Personally I have a dislike of the paywalling of content where there is a source of income originally - mainly being the paywall behind some YouTube content creators. The paywalling of a FanFiction is almost a blurred line for myself, some authors have a paywall behind their early releases - such as early/unrevised chapters which are coming ahead and mention that they have discussions with their followers about them. Something like this is slightly different in my opinion to a paywall of an entire FanFiction. I don't agree with it, I don't see the necessity behind it either - although perhaps if I was a writer of something which was achieving millions of hits I would feel different and hope that others would support the time and effort that I put into a story they are enjoying. Fundamentally I don't have an issue with it, as long as they're not posting one chapter and telling you that you have to support them throughout the time that they are finishing the rest of the story. However, each to their own.
