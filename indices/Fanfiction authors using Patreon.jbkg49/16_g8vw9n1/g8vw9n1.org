patreon is entirely voluntary for you to give money. your not paying for the story you are giving them money so they have more time so they can write its completely different and a legal loophole.

its the same reason people that make sword art abridged are able to have a patreon

you are not paying for sword art abridged your paying so the people involved dont have to work and its completely voluntary.

also considering billion dollar companies have exteded copy right for ever and routinely screw over people I am fine with writters get some money off it.

I mean I doubt Jk cares
