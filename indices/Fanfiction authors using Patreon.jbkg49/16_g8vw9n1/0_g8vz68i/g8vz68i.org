  patreon is entirely voluntary for you to give money. your not paying for the story you are giving them money so they have more time so they can write its completely different and a legal loophole.

This is not a legal loophole... it's the kind of thing people consider a loophole if they get all their legal knowledge from TV legal dramas.

In reality, the law doesn't work like that. Judges/juries make findings of fact and they're perfectly capable of seeing through convoluted schemes. It's entirely open to a judge to find that, as a matter of fact, there existed an arrangement between the parties of payment in exchange for fanfiction.

So I can talk as much as I like about how technically I'm not paying for fanfiction, I'm just happening to give this person a regular gift, and he is just so happening to regularly post fanfiction. But this is a fairly transparent scheme and the likely finding of fact would simply be "the author was accepting payments in exchange for writing fanfiction".

The only situation where I think you could avoid that finding of fact is where the author in question has a long history of posting fanfic for free, publicly, and then starts accepting donations, which do not alter the frequency or manner in which their works are posted. In that situation, I think it's fair to say that as a matter of fact, no exchange is taking place.

But with Cadmean Victory, that's explicitly not what's happening. The author stopped writing and now is saying he will write again for payment.

He may well get away with it. JKR and WB tend not to act on these things - see when MOR elicited payments in exchange for a faster update rate. But if JKR/WB did decide to shut it down, my money is solidly on them succeeding.
