In principle I can't think of a logical reason why the arguments should be different as regard visual art as opposed to prose.

Nonetheless I recognise that many people will instinctively feel that fan art is different (and have that same feeling myself).

I suspect the reason for this feeling is that the medium is not the same medium as the original work. Producing artwork of HP doesn't feel like it's stepping on JKR's shoes in the same way as fanfiction.

The test for this theory is to imagine, say, a Spider-man comic produced by a fan. In this scenario the artwork is in the same medium as the original. And at least for me, the idea of someone selling their own versions of Spider-man comics does trigger the same sense of moral wrongness as selling fanfic.
