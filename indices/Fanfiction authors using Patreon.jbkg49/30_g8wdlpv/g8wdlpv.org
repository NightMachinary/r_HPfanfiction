Not a lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, but how different legally is fanfiction comapared to artwork or merchandise? I'm sure there are plenty of artists who have been commissioned to draw Harry Potter characters in one form or another, and there's definitely lots of people buying (and making) unofficial merch. Would fanfiction get crushed simply because its also writing?
