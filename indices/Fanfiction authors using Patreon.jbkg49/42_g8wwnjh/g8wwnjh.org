Sure its illegal, but I really don't see why any of us should bother with enforcing it for the 5 billion dollar owner of IP. They wouldnt notice the bottom line move even if every author had a patreon, so who really cares?

I wont snitch on someone shoplifting food at a supermarket either for example, and there is actual tangible loss for the supermarket in that case. WB definitely doesnt lose money from the fandom existing, if anything they make more.
