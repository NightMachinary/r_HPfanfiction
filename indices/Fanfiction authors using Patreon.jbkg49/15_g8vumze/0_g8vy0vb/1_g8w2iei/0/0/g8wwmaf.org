Okay, I just wanna preface this with a quick disclaimer that I don't mean any of this as condescendingly as it may sound. I'm running on low sleep and I struggle with diplomacy when I'm tired. So, yeah, I apologise profusely for how it may sound, and if it sounds negative please know that I'm not intending it that way. I'm also not sure if my thought structure even makes sense, but that's a whole other issue. Feel free to tell me if I'm talking nonsense. :D

Oh, that's undeniably true, you're right, Law is indeed different in every country. And ethics is different for every person. Even if you believe it should be universal, in reality ethics manifests very differently for everyone. Of course, you can evaluate however you choose - that's entirely your prerogative and I'm just a random voice on the internet, after all - but as I said, the rest of the comments on this post show the issue with doing so. You believe it's wrong, they believe it's right... so then what? Where do you go with that? Morality manifests itself far too subjectively to find those common precepts to build an argument upon without it devolving, especially on the internet, and just saying your moral views on a subject at each other isn't terribly productive. But if I go any further with that point it'll start veering into the epistemology of debate and this probably isn't the place. So, I'll simply conclude with the point that ethical valuation has its own difficulties and I would perceive those as harder to work around than debating practicalities, even with country-based variations.

(Also, to clarify - practicalities also includes functionalities, not just legalities. ie. how the behaviour manifests, how/if it works well, what could be done better, what scenarios might ensue, what consequences might be levied, and so on. So, this writer is trying to charge for their fanfic - what might that mean for everyone else and fandom? What consequences might that bring down? What ideas will that propagate through fandom, if any?)

Anyway, regarding the practicalities - whether you live in America or Timbuktu, the generalities are still there to debate and they're a lot less... emotionally charged than ethics often gets. A little Western-centric a viewpoint, I agree, but Reddit is mostly Americans.
