I'm guessing you just googled this to try and find it without actually reading it, because if you had you'd realize that the point (all 3) of the articles are making is that the people who pirate also buy a lot. That doesn't mean that the pirating doesn't harm the artists. It simply means that the people that are into this category of art will look into various ways of acquiring what they're looking for, be they legal or not.

Moreover, your ideal world has literally no one producing arts because morons like you always steal it to stop the 'billion dollar companies' from making money. If everyone thought like you, we'd have no art at all. Because you're a moron who wants to justify stealing and is reaching at straws.
