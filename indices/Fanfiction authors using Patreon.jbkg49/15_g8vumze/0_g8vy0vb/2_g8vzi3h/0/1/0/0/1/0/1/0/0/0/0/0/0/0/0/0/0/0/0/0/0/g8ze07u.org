I'm expecting an adult to know how to write "you're" and the difference between that and "your". And that, y'know, stealing is good for you, but not for the person you're stealing from. Don't worry, I'm sure your online classes will get to that point eventually.

I think you've proven my point several times by now. Keep stealing and justify it however.
