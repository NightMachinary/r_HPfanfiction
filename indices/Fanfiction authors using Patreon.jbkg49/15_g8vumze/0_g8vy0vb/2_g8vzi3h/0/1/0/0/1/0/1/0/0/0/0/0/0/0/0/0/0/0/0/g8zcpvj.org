People care when you try to call other people idiots and can't even spell at the level of a four year old. You're just embarrassing yourself.

Saying you support small artist in the same conversation where you repeatedly and proudly admit that you steal from them and deprive them of their income and only source of revenue. Yeah sure. Keep telling yourself that.

I can only hope that when you grow up and have to try being financially independent, someone pays you with the same coin and steals your hard work. See how you like it then.
