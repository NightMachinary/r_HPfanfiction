There's your problem lol Things can't make money when you pirate them. When they do, they make money despite morons like you, not because of you. You're not helping anyone other than yourself. You're just being cheap. The big companies can take the hit. The smaller artists get crippled because you think your shitty 'exposure' pays their bills. You're a blight on modern society. A parasite.

Don't call me an idiot and write 'your' instead of 'you're' in the same sentence lol. You're an idiot.
