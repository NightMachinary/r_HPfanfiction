or you will realise, I pirate a film

I like a film, the film gets a sequal I convince my friends to go see the sequal in cinema's I buy merch of said film

the film makes more money then if I never saw it.

thats literally how it works, I know at least six people that have seen John wick in cinema's because I liked the film and got them into it

its word of mouth.

game of thrones was the most pirated show of all time in my country and it still made gangbusters

I take it your an idiot, and your brainwashed to defend companies to your core. my ideal world involves companies not fucking over small creators all the damn time.

look into hollywood accounting.

anyway this conversation is over go lick some more corporate boot
