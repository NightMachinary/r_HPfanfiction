Legality aside, it just seems fundamentally immoral to seek payment for a derivative work using someone else's characters, world, etc. Which is why, regardless of legality, it has long been considered poor form by the fanfiction community. Hell, even extorting reviews in exchange for posting chapters ("Next chapter will be posted once I reach 100 reviews!") is considered going too far.
