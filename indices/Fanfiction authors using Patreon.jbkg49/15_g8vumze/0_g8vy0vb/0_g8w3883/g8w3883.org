Is Disney fundamentally immoral for getting paid to make derivative works of Alice in Wonderland & every fairy tale known to man? Are the BBC/CBS/Warner Bros/literally every movie studio and author under the sun scum because they retold various Sherlock Holmes stories and got paid for doing so?

The only reason it's illegal to break copyright is because Disney pulled the ladder up behind them so they could keep making money off of Mickey Mouse. The first Harry Potter book would be entering the public domain fairly soon under earlier copyright systems.

Why do you consider it "fundamentally immoral" to make money off of your labor, if it's derivative? Every work of fiction is derivative, some just are better at hiding it. Hell, Fifty shades of Gray was Twilight fanfic with the serial numbers filed off. Should Erika Leonard give all the money she made by writing that to Stephenie Meyer in penance for the "fundamentally immoral" act of taking inspiration from the Twilight universe to write her story?

I've read star wars fanfic that has felt less derivative of its source than Eragon was. Why is getting paid for fanfic so much worse in your eyes?
