"But everything is derivative" is a line commonly deployed, but I think it's one of those arguments which relies on establishing a false dichotomy where everything must be absolutely black or absolutely white with no ability to distinguish even obviously different shades of grey.

"If a work is derivative at all, then it can be treated the same as a work which is entirely derivative" is what this argument amounts to.

But I think that there are distinctions between, one the one hand, drawing on a common cultural heritage and using ideas such as wizards and fairies, and, on the other hand, taking a boy called Harry Potter who is a wizard who attends a magic school called Hogwarts whose parents were killed by a dark wizard called Voldemort. Both are derivative in a sense. But they're also still very much different things.

Not only do I think there is a distinction, I also think that it's a distinction which only takes a peppercorn of common sense to recognise. It takes a special kind of overthinking a problem to arrive at the idea that these things are in principle the same just because they all, at a stretch, fall under the umbrella "derivative".
