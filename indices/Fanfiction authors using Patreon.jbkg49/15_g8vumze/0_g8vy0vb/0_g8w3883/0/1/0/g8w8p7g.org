JKR has given explicit permission for people to write fanfiction not-for-profit. And there is a general consensus that it's fair to create fan works so long as you're not profiting off them or otherwise subverting the original author's prerogatives.

Writing fanfiction for money falls under neither JKR's permission not under fair use.
