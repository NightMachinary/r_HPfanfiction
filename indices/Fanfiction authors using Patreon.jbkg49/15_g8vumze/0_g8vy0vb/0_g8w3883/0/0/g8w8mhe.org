I can see why you might draw a distinction between directly derivative works and more indirect, sure, even if I don't agree. However, it's not nearly the "common sense" thing to recognize. What makes Master of the Universe immoral to make money off of, but all you have to to to make it moral is change a few character names and call it Fifty Shades of Grey? They're the same work of fiction, as far as I can tell you seem to be ok with monetizing one but not the other.

I've read plenty of HP fanfic with no character named Harry Potter, no magic school called Hogwarts, and no dark wizard Voldemort to be seen. Where's the exact line? Plenty of my favorite fics could be given the Fifty Shades treatment and pretty much be perfectly ok to publish. Don't just go "oh it's common sense", you need to justify your point. Where does a piece of fiction go from being "entirely derivative", and immoral to profit off of, to "just somewhat derivative at all" and ok to do so? Sorry if I don't have the same amount of common sense as you, help me out here.

Additionally, I brought up the legal use of works in the public domain as well, since you mentioned "regardless of legality" in your original post... Do you really think that? Is everyone involved in having made every piece of Sherlock fiction fundamentally immoral? Every movie, tv show, manga, comic, anime, stage play, etc? These works are entirely derivative, they have Sherlock & Watson, most have got Moriarty, a ton have the same plots. From what you've written, you seem to think they are all bad people for making them. But who are they actually hurting, and what is making what they're doing immoral? Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has been dead for almost a century.

Do you genuinely think that it's an immoral act to write fiction based on other people's work, and receive financial compensation for your labor?
