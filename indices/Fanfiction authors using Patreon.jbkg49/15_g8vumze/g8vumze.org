There's probably some leeway or technicality someone with actual knowledge of legal systems could find (especially since copyright laws and associated things do vary slightly from country to country), but generally selling fanfic is against the law unless you have permission, yeah. Not jail time illegal or anything, but it does open you up to fines and lawsuits (again, varies by country).

I guess the author either doesn't know that, does have permission to do so, or is falling back on the tried and true addendum to every law - it's only illegal if you get caught. Rowling and Warner can't sue someone for something they never hear about, after all.
