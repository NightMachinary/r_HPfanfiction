Let me be clear. Putting fanfiction behind a paywall is almost certain illegal, and 100% immoral.

But that's not what the author is doing. He's putting them on his patreon but not behind a paywall. He's basically moving his fanfiction to a site with a ton of advertisements.

It still makes him an asshole, but not one that would require complete resection.
