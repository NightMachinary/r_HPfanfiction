I don't think he's using it as a bait. Disclaimer on his ffnet page says:

"Important note on the above: I don't own the rights to any of the fanfiction I write or post, so if you just want to read the fanfiction posted on my patre0n, you don't have to pay. However, my original content, community, and everything I hope to build with the people I've met on this site, is behind the patron barrier. Once again, just to be really clear, because copyright is a very real thing. All the fanfiction I post here, there, or anywhere, is non-profit, so only become a patron if you want to support my writing aspirations, see my original content, or join the community."

so basically one does not have to follow him to Patreon. I know I won't.

The only person I'd follow/support would be Miranda Flairgold series /A Second Chance at Life/ / /Changes in a Time of War/ and the unfinished /A Magical World/. I still go back and reread them sometimes because of the massive worldbuilding done to make it an original fiction.
