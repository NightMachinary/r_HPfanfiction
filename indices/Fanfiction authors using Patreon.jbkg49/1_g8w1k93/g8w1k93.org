Honestly I hate when authors do this. It puts the entire fandom in jeopardy. If JK or WB gets in their heads that this is a problem, they'll shut the whole thing down. They won't stop with just DarknessEnthroned, they'll go the whole way and destroy the fandom.

If you want to get paid, write original content. If you want to write fanfiction, don't expect to get paid. Its not a complex thing.
