  If JK or WB gets in their heads that this is a problem, they'll shut the whole thing down. They won't stop with just DarknessEnthroned, they'll go the whole way and destroy the fandom.

this is never going to happen. fanfiction is incredibly obviously fair use, and the â€˜industry' is big enough that someone will lawyer up if it's challenged. IP laws may be awful but they're not that bad, Disney isn't out there suing people for drawing pictures of Mickey Mouse.
