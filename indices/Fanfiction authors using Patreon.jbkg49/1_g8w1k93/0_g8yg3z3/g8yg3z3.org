I agree. Adding money to fanfiction can lead to legal issues. Authors have sued fanfiction writers before and gotten sites to take down content.

I have read from authors who decided to monetize their popular fanfics. They found a publisher, took down the fanfic, removed all references to copyrighted material, and published it. Then they told their following about the new book. I am totally okay with this form of ff monetization.
