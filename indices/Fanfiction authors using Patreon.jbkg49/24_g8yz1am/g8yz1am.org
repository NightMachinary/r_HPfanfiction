I think it's great of an author can monetize their hobby. Patreon would be a great way for an author to release new chapters in advance to their patrons (and let the patrons essentially be a crowdsourced proofreading service that pay you for the privilege).

But I'm not paying for fan fiction. If someone else wants to, more power to them, but it's a no from me, dawg.
