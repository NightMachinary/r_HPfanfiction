Frankly, I am still firmly of the 1990's state of mind where open source and free access was the internet's most praised and celebrated virtue. When companies started to commercialize the internet something precious was lost.

I have always been very generous with voluntary donations for stuff that isn't hidden by a paywall but rather asks for a donation in order to pay for time or effort in stead.

I might even be convinced to help one of my favourite authors out with a micro donation if they'd put a message out that by high exception they can't pay their bills.

That said nobody has managed to awe me enough into wanting to support a pateron for early access or exclusive content hidden behind a paywall. Maybe it's the knee jerk reaction that keeps me away from it.

Moreover I am mostly concerned that if more fanfic authors put their fanfics behind paywalls, the creators of the original content might start to sue and the fandoms are going back to being big no-no's the way Terry Goodkind's Sword of the Truth series still is.
