While I would definitely agree that this is over the line, and leaves a bad taste, it also makes me wonder... where is the line exactly?

I've seen a Pok√©mon romhack whose author has a Patreon, and the romhack is very popular. It still leaves me with a bad taste since they're profiting off what is essentially copyright infringement of someone else's franchise when you get down to it. I think fanfics may also technically infringe, but very few actually bother going after people about it, since basically all fanfiction writers and romhackers give their work out for free. And then I've seen game mods in Minecraft who also has a Patreon... but Minecraft modding is, to my knowledge, fully legal. So where is the line exactly?
