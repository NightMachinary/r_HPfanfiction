In all honesty, I think this falls in a grey area.

As a previous user commented, it is is very similar to artists who draw/animate/paint etc. characters from series they don't own.

I currently subscribe to a Patreon where the entire purpose is comics based around Fire Emblem Three Houses, and I doubt the author owns the copyright at all.

Additionally, the YeseniaFaye patreon page IS exactly this. She makes her own original works but also does fanfictions there as well.

In all honesty, it may fall under the "Transformative" part of Fair Use. It can be argued that it is original work that does not attempt to compete or replace the original works.
