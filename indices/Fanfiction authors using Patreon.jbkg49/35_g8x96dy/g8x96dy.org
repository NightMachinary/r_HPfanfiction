I think it's a legal grey area like fanfiction in general is. If the only way to access the work is to pay, then it's clearly profiting from an unauthorised derivative work, so would attract Lawyers. If on the other hand it's only a preview and an opportunity to comment/affect the content before it's made public, that's different as then it's paying for the authors time rather than the work.
