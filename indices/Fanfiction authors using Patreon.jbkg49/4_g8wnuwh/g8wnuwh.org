It's a pretty open and shut case of blatant copyright violation. Dress it up all behind words like donations or support all you like, paywalling copyrighted material you don't own is illegal.

But I don't have any strong opinions about it personally. I mean yeah it's illegal and shady, but this is hardly going to put a dent in JK's or WB's bottom line, if it even registers at all. It certainly won't put anyone out of work. Not to mention the fact that companies steal from content creators all the time. The amount of money corporations steal from Youtubers for example is ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised for a second if someone at WB has as well, so I can't be bothered feeling sorry or indignant on their behalf.

Beyond that I'm not a real fan of the practice. A few writers I like do this, and while I love their work I can't bring myself to support such a thing. One author hasn't updated his stories in months on FF.net, but I know for a fact he has several chapters backlogged and updates frequently on Patreon.
