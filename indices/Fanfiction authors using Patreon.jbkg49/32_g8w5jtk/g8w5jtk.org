I'm not a legal scholar, but it seems to me that so long as the fanfiction is being published for free, there's a decent case for arguing the patronage money is not payment but a donation.

Either way, there's so little money in targeting a specific creator that it would have to be a very petty rights-holder to file a suit.

Even then, it most likely wouldn't be fanfiction that gets hounded down, but the patreon side of the matter.
