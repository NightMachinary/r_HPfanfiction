I dunno. A lot of negative views in the comments here, but I don't really see this as 'forcing' people to pay, or even baiting them. IMO it's as simple as him wanting to write fanfiction, and if people want to support that lifestyle then that's OK. As long as he's not putting it behind a pay wall then there's nothing wrong with it. At the end of the day it's not illegal to write fanfiction, and it's not illegal to pay people who you don't want to stop doing that.

Edit: reread your post and noticed the mention of a pay wall for the 'remastered' version. Pretty sure that IS illegal, but if he didn't pay wall anything and literally just asked for donations and wrote fanfic that was completely open and free I don't think it would be illegal or immoral. At that point I would look at it more as people supporting his writing as a lifestyle, because they enjoy reading it, as opposed to people paying him for his work on any specific piece. Does that make sense? I'm not sure, but it does to me.
