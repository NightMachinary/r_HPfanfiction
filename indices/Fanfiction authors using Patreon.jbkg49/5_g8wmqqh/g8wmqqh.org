It's a strange legal gray area, because with patreon you're not technically paying for the writing yourself, but you're donating to an artist you support and that gives you access to other work they've done. Practically speaking it seems like there's no difference, but legally there's a world of difference that's been enshrined in law, especially in tax law.

But there's also an argument to be had about the legality of straight up monetizing fanfiction. People have monetized fanart to hell and back, and arguably most fanart is inherently less transformative than most fanfiction, especially when that fanart is of a piece of media that's already visual. Yet fanart has been monetized on official channels without a peep from copyright holders; just wander into your local convention to see the artist's alley full to the brim with fanart for sale.

The reason why there's a stigma on monetizing fanfiction and not on fanart is because of the legacy of people like Anne Rice. But that stigma doesn't carry over to the legal system. Copyright holders who harassed fanficcers in the past did so by overwhelming them with legal resources that they couldn't match, but now we have organizations like AO3 that have lawyers on call to mount legal defenses on behalf of individual fanficcers. And frankly, I think that a person writing fanfic for money has a strong legal ground to stand on, since they are in no way disrupting the revenue of the copyright holder (no one's commissioning Rowling for their Drarry Omegaverse fic) and copyright holders have been implicitly approving of monetized fanart for decades.

I get the concern, but I think that if you disapprove of monetized fanfic, then it only follows that you should also disapprove of monetized fanart. And if you approve of monetized fanart, it only follows that you should also approve of monetized fanfic.
