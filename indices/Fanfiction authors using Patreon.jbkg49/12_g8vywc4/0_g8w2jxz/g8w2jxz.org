The problem is that the updated version of it exists solely on a website that obviously and prominently asks you to pay for stuff. But sure, /that/ story isn't part of what you're paying for. Nope. Definitely not. Looks, it's free for everyone to read!

That kind of argument rarely works in other areas. 'Oh, no, it wasn't a bribe, I just felt overcome with generosity, and gave him the money, no strings attached. And he, in a decision completely unconnected to my decision to give him large amounts of money, decided to do the thing I wanted him to do.' Yeah. That's not likely to fly.
