I'm not entirely certain. I mean something like the /Alexandra Quick/ series is probably original enough to be monetized with little issue, given that it would only need a few tweaks to be completely disconnected from the /Harry Potter/ series. /A Cadmean Victory/ on the other hand, draws a lot more from /Harry Potter/ canon.

One might be able to argue that their material is "fair use", in the case of a lawsuit, but that's only really a defense in a lawsuit. It doesn't protect someone from being sued.
