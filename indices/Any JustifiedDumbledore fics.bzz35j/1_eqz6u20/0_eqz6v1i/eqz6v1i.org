#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore never dreamed he would have such a person on his hands. He had never imagined how quickly even the best laid plans could be derailed by something as simple as love. Snippets of the Harry Potter series from Dumbledore's point of view. Will eventually cover all seven books.
