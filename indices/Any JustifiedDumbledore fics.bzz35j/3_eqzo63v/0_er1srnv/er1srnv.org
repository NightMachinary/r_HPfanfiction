I dunno. I think there are several things which can only be justified logically via either Dumbledore being dangerously manipulative or secretive or by him being dramatically less intelligent than he is suggested to be by JK and all the other characters.

Such as the whole Philosopher's Stone thing. Keeping it in Hogwarts, basically openly telling everyone where it is at the Welcome Feast, and keeping it behind traps that are both so weak they can't stop anyone and suspiciously fitting for a particular 11 year old and his friends, ignoring the danger posed by Quirrel despite Snape's suspicions and the Trio's worry about the stone and then flying to the Ministry instead of flooing, apparating, portkeying or phoenix travelling, only to turn up after Voldemort's already escaped and Harry hospitalised, and then hint to Harry that the traps were deliberately set up as a test for him. That to me requires a bit of fiddling to make justifiable. At best, it's a series of ridiculous and obvious over sights and at worst it's Machiavellian.

Or telling nobody but Harry about the Horcruxes, and waiting till Voldemort's back and he had a year to live max, despite knowing he had Horcruxes since 2nd Year and having several trustworthy people around - Moody, Sirius, Remus, Kingsley, even Snape until Voldemort was actually back - who could have been assisting him in the hunt for a solid 2 years prior to Voldemort doing anything more dangerous than sitting in Albania twiddling his ghostly thumbs. Again, at best a bizarre lapse in judgement by an addled old man who keeps secrets and does nothing with them for incomprehensible reasons, and at worst an actively malicious series of maneuvers towards Harry's self sacrifice.

Or, simply, leaving Harry with the Dursleys. He made the choice to do so pre-Sirius' imprisonment, and he did so for ostensibly 2 reasons. 1. Blood protection 2. Keep Harry from his fame and fortune so he doesn't grow up weird

Yet there are dozens of options that could work as well or better, and not involve leaving a baby on the doorstep of a family with a young baby of their own, a family comprising a bigoted Muggle and the bitter, estranged sister of Harry's mum, neither of whom want or expect any contact with Harry, Lily or the Magical world, with nothing but a letter and a shrug, not to mention the promise that in 11 years you'll come and whisk him away just like you did to Petunia's sister, disincentivising her from forming an attachment with him for fear of their relationship repeating the past. Even in the best case scenario, that was a bad idea. To not even check on him once, only having a Squib who neglects to tell you anything of substance about Harry's obvious mistreatment, is bizarre. I could understand leaving him there in spite of his treatment, but only if it's demonstrable that for all 11 years the threat posed to him by the non-imprisoned, disloyal, selfish Death Eaters with no desire to reopen the 1st War's wounds was so great that even putting him with two trusted wizards under a Fidelius or at least some powerful as hell protective spells and glamours to stay hidden would have been insufficient to keep him safe, but that the threat was not so great as to exist for even a second once he turned 11, meaning that Hagrid can leave him in Madam Malkins and go for a pint, no problem.

It's entirely /possible/ to write decisions like this in a way that makes them understandable, but I don't think JK did it.
