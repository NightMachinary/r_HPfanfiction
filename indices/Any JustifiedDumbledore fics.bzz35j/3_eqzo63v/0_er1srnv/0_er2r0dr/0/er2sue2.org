" I could understand leaving him there in spite of his treatment, but only if it's demonstrable that for all 11 years the threat posed to him by the non-imprisoned, disloyal, selfish Death Eaters with no desire to reopen the 1st War's wounds was so great that even putting him with two trusted wizards under a Fidelius or at least some powerful as hell protective spells and glamours to stay hidden would have been insufficient to keep him safe, but that the threat was not so great as to exist for even a second once he turned 11, meaning that Hagrid can leave him in Madam Malkins and go for a pint, no problem."

Not to mention, not ever checking up on the boy? Sending a woman to keep an eye on him who's so dumb she makes sure he doesn't enjoy himself cause she knows it'll upset the Dursleys, and doesn't think "hmm maybe that's a bad thing and I should try to help or tell Dumbledore"? Leaving them only a letter, no money or contact information or even the courtesy of a face-to-face interaction, just "here's a magical baby we expect you to pay for and raise, we know you hate your sister and magic but too bad. Also even if you love him as your own, in 11 years we're taking him back. Cheers."?

That's not within the bounds of normal human mistakes. That's the mistakes of a man who's got a sub-100 IQ, or no basic sense of human empathy.

Further, the only reason Dumbledore has the world on his shoulders is because he utterly refuses to let anyone else in on anything. Endless examples in the books, from

1. Not telling anyone about the Horcruxes for 3+ years even when he had plenty of people who he could trust and a very big incentive to stop Voldemort while he was still a ghost

2. Deciding where Harry would live and placing him there, with a woman who didn't even know he existed and had no reason to take care of him, even while his Godfather was (at the time) alive and free, in direct opposition to James and Lily's wishes. Even ignoring McGonagall's warnings about the Dursleys, and then forbidding anyone to even remotely interact with Harry, and leaving a useless watcher who doesn't even tell him anything.

3. Telling nobody about the Prophecy when again, there were plenty of trustworthy people.

4. Going for the ring horcrux alone with no backup and telling nobody, instead of at least saying "hey Moody, come with me for a minute"

5. Ignoring Harry and the school for his entire 5th Year, rather than just saying "hey Harry, until you learn Occlumency it's too dangerous for us to be close, Volde might Legilimens me through you, sorry"

6. Letting absolutely nobody in on his plan with Snape, not even leaving a message to be found afterwards by Harry or something

7. Leaving Harry to figure out he's a Horcrux on his own, and just hoping he'll self sacrifice

One or two of these things, fine. He's 100+ and running a School, a Judiciary/Parliament and an international organisation plus a resistance movement. But that's all the more reason to delegate and discuss things instead of telling nobody what you know or what you're doing and moving them around like chess pieces. You'll either be super effective but totally amoral, or useless because you're overwhelmed.
