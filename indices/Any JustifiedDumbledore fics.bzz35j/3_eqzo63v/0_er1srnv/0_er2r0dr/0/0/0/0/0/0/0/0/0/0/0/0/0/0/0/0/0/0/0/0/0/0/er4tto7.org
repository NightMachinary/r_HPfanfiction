No. You've made up your mind. You especially showed that when you said you can think of a reason for why Harry was left alone, surely I could think of one. That means you've spent a lot of time thinking about this, and have thought both for, and against Dumbledore, and have chosen what you have. Therefore any arguments I bring are most likely ones you've heard while being on this sub for as long as I believe you have. This is why it is useless to debate with you about this, you've already made your mind up about this.
