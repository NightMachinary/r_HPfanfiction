Do you often get into arguments and then back away saying "yeah I could counter that but why bother? I don't even care."?

I thought it was a fairly simple, fair question to ask "What possible danger warranted leaving Harry totally out of contact for 11 years, even when all the loyal death eaters were in azkaban and the rest were over the war, but didn't warrant sending a witch or wizard who'd actually finished their OWLs to take him shopping, or at least telling Hagrid "don't go drinking and leave him alone in a shop (and maybe not having Hagrid grab Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (which you know Voldemort is after) at the same time since that's pretty dangerous)?"

I mean hell, I can think of a decent counter, and I don't even believe it. Surely you can?

Nothing I've said is a theory. It's all fact, it's all canon, and I'm asking how you can justify those canon facts as being anything other than, at best, woefully negligent and stupid decision making. If your answer is "I can't, I just like Dumbledore and don't want to admit that knowing the Dark Lord has made multiple horcruxes and having some idea of where they might be, plus knowing that Voldemort is out there gathering strength, but spending 3+ years keeping that to yourself and doing literally nothing until he's resurrected himself and killed a student, before going alone to find a cursed artefact and only then, when you physically can't keep it to yourself anymore cause you're going to die, telling 3 children and nobody else, not even the multiple war veterans and law enforcement officers who you know and trust, is a bad idea" then that's fine.

But don't do this pathetic thing of getting halfway through an argument and pretending you're suddenly above it. We're both grown adults arguing over the logic of a children's book series about magic, embrace it.
