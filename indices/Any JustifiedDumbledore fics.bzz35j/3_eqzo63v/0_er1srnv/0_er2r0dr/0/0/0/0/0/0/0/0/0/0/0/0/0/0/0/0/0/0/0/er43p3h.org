Do you understand how debate works? Two people with two different opinions put forth arguments and counter arguments. How would that work if one of us hadn't made up our mind? How would we know what to argue for?

If you want to explain why I should change my mind, that would be nice. Otherwise just fuck off because this above it all pretence is annoying.
