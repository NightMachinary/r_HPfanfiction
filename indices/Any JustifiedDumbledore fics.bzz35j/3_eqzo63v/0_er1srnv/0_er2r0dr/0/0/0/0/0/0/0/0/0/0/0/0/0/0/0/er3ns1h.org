The question I keep asking and you keep dodging.

What possible danger warranted leaving Harry totally out of contact for 11 years, even when all the loyal death eaters (who might have wanted to hurt him) were in azkaban and the rest were over the war (and wouldn't risk hurting him) but didn't warrant sending a witch or wizard who'd actually finished their OWLs to take him shopping, or at least telling Hagrid "don't go drinking and leave him alone in a shop", especially given that as well as Harry Potter (who Voldemort wants to kill) Hagrid was also responsible for the Philosopher's Stone (which Voldemort wants to steal)?
