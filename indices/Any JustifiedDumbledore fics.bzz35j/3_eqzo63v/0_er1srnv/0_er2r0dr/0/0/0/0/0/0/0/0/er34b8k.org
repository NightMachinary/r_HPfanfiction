Why should I care? You mistake my arguing for passion. It is boredom. Yes I could make arguments, and I could explain a lot of the reasons, but in the end they're all just what I think, theories. Just like yours are just theories. You make connections, and assumptions just like I do, but with different outcomes. So what can be proven? Why should I care? Will anything I say actually change what you think? Lastly why should I?
