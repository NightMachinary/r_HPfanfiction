There's a BIG difference between being human and being stupid.

And spending 3+ years twiddling your thumbs doing nothing to deal with an immortal Dark Lord even after you get proof he's got horcruxes and you know he's about is stupid.

It's not kind, or nice, or clever, or even mildly respectful, to treat everyone around you including war veterans and supposed friends like children and hoard information that leads to people's deaths.

Not to mention, if the traps in 1st year were to give Voldemort a false sense of security, then what's your logic for why Dumbledore chose the slowest and least contactable method of travel to leave for the Ministry, rather than say, apparating and being able to return the moment Voldemort went for the stone? I mean, we know he could have done that. Or flooed, or portkeyed, or phoenix travelled. But he flew. That's either because he was stupid or he was trying to give Voldemort enough time to come face to face with Harry. Neither option can be discarded as "woops, nearly got several 11 year olds murdered cause I couldn't use a locking spell that a 1st year can't beat! Well, everybody makes mistakes lol! I'm trying to /protect/ people!"

I also never suggested he did anything out of pain or hate. I said it was either stupidity or a complete inability to understand other people's feelings. Hence him thinking that keeping the Prophecy secret was a good idea, and not grasping that Harry would have been a million times happier knowing about it than being kept "safe".
