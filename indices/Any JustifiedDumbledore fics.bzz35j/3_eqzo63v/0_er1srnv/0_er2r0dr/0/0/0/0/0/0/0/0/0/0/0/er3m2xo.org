"I'm not mad, actually I'm laughing"

The cowards way out. Just admit you can't answer any of my questions.

What possible danger warranted leaving Harry totally out of contact for 11 years, even when all the loyal death eaters were in azkaban and the rest were over the war, but didn't warrant sending a witch or wizard who'd actually finished their OWLs to take him shopping, or at least telling Hagrid "don't go drinking and leave him alone in a shop"? Especially given that along with Harry, who Voldemort wants to kill, he also goes to get the Philosopher's Stone, which Voldemort wants to steal.
