You could actually explain a rational reason for any of Dumbledore's mistakes rather than shrugging and spouting a platitude.

Why would you leave a baby on the doorstep of an Aunt who never met him and probably won't love him, with no money or contact information, and just a letter that basically says "look after this kid till he's 11 for me. Then I'll take him back but you'll still have to look after him in the summers. Oh I know you haven't spoken to your sister in years, hate magic, and already have a toddler of your own to provide for but tough." and then never, not one time, bother to go check on him or even to ask the woman you placed there to check on him "is he okay?" (To which she'd respond "they hate him so much I have to make sure he has a bad time at mine so they don't forbid him from coming")?

To keep him safe? To be kind? To stop others from dealing with your mistakes? No, can't be any of those cause that wouldn't make sense.

What possible danger warranted leaving Harry totally out of contact for 11 years, even when all the loyal death eaters were in azkaban and the rest were over the war, but didn't warrant sending a witch or wizard who'd actually finished their OWLs to take him shopping, or at least telling Hagrid "don't go drinking and leave him alone in a shop"?
