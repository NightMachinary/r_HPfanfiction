Ok. Is there any way I could convince you to see things my way hmm? How about why I should care so much about this subject hmm? What you consider a cop out, which is a childish way of thinking, is me merely stopping a rather pointless argument from continuing. You may be immature enough to enjoy arguing about such things, and obviously don't have crap to do to keep you busy, but it's 5:06am where I live, and i've gotta get ready for work in 20 minutes. So excuse me if I no longer wish to continue in such childish bickering against someone who's clearly antagonistic, and frankly, petty.
