That's completely your choice to think that in such a way. Just know that he is not amoral, nor is he evil. He is simply human. He never told anyone about such thing out of kindness. Imagine the fear that people would have to know Voldemort is literally unkillable. I'll argue your points, but it's obviois you've made up your mind one way, or the other. So no point. I believe your wrong, and looking at this from an entirely wrong point of view, and not putting yourself into his shoes. That's fine.

Just know that every single point in your list can be resolved with Dumbledore either not wanting to burden others for what he perceives to be his mistakes, fear of either Voldemort getting his secrets, knowing that Dumbledore knows about his Horcruxes, or getting to Harry, or just because he is human, and therefore is prone to mistakes. He's not perfect, and the more you realise that, the more you understand that he didn't do anything out of hatred, or pain, but kindness, and fear.
