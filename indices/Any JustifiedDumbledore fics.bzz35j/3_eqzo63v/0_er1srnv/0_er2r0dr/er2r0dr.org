Again this just shows Dumbledore is human. He left Harry with family, but to also protect him from Death Eaters, he also knew Voldemort was going to be back, and that Harry needed great protection. He knew Hogwarts wouldn't cut it(as the books themselves prove), nor could he be expected to be able to protect Harry 24/7. While he did have a horrible time at the Dursleys, he was at least healthy for the most part. The Dursleys never treated Harry as badly as Death Eaters would have. The Philosophers Stone was purposely kept behind weak traps to lull Voldemort into a false sense of security, and if it wasn't for Harry, ot never would have left the mirror. Also you have to remember that a child growing up in England in the 90's, Harrys trapeatment wasn't actually all that uncommon, nor was it really illegal sadly.

You've also got to remember that while I agree that Dumbledore was manipulative, he was human, and therefore prone to mistakes. Every human is manipulative to a degree, and considering that in the end Dumbledores plan lead to the destruction of Voldemort, it worked. So while we could argue black, and blue all day about whether Dumbledore was good, or bad, would you have rather that Voldemort wins. Dumbledore is human, and is not privy to all the information that we the reader are, so you cannot expect from him to make the choices that are obvious, sonce to him they are not.

Also you forget that while he could have gone under Fidelius with two powerful wozards for protection. He never would have reaped the benefit of the blood protection, the same protection that both saved the wizarding world, and until GOF burned Voldemort at a touch. So again Dumbledore obviously knew what he was doing.

In the end I believe Dumbledore was manipulative, but for the right reasons, and that considering that it all worked out in the end, he was right. so instead of looking at it from a readers perspective, look at it from a desperate mans perspective who is trying to do their best with the world on their shoulders.
