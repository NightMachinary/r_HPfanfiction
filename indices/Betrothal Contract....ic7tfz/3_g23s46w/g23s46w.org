The trope only works as an evil to be worked against, not a relationship device. As in - "Harreh m'boy, you gotta marry x person and then have at least three children with them, and also can't divorce, and also can't be with anyone else" - and then Harry says "fuck this sideways" and gets the hell out of there. The story would then revolve around dodging the contract's various trigger conditions (acceptance, saying she looks pretty, being within 2 miles) and finally finding a way to break it and any others like it of their power, maybe by invading the ministry of magic with a non-human army and smashing the mcguffin that keeps magical contracts binding in the framing of a nonhuman rebellion.

As a relationship device it's just a piece of rape paper.
