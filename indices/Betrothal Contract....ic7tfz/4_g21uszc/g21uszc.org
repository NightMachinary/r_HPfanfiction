Yes, that is a question more authors should ask themselves. Not just about contracts, about anything. Unmotivated nonsense is a major cause in creating the typical badfic. In this case, there are many possible plots that aren't making sense, and very few that do. Virtually every story in existence uses the former, however -- because the latter invariably invalidate that plot vehicle as a raison d'Ãªtre for the story. You'd have to come up with an /actual/ story.
