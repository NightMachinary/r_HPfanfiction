What I really would want to read is a fic with: yes there is a contract but no one want to enforce it not even the parents/guardians but they have because bad things would happen if they don't. So over the course of the story they search for invalid/break/make it non-enforceable and are successful in the end but still fall in love but not because the contract, despite of it. A kind of love/companionship- trough- adversary thing. Wouldn't even have to be the main plot just a notable part.
