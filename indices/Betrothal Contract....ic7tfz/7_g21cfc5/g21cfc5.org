The reasons are always wrong. One of the most secure methods how to make me leave story unfinished. There are so many of them which started well, and then suddenly this thing happens (also compounded with necessity of harem) ... and that's it for me. I really hoped for linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion by Vance McGill) to be good: promise of really hurt and socially inept Hermione growing into Harmony sounded very well, but then it turned into “need to have three wives” for Harry, and I don't know what's the next sentence of the story, and I will never learn. Oh well.
