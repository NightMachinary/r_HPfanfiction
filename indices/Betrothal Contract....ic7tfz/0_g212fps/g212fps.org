Because you have 2 personalities who might never have interacted forced to live together. It's like Big Brother in miniature, with the added stress that they may need to have a child. How do they react? How do their relationships with others change? Can they find a way out? What if only one of them wants to? How do they navigate a romantic relationship when they know they can't just break up if they're incompatible? Especially if they dislike or hate each other? How does this tie into the wizarding world as a whole? Why do these contracts need to exist? What side effects have there been on the world? All of these are questions that can make a betrothal contract story really interesting if it's handled well.

Pretty much every trope that's become hated by the fandom can actually be fun and fresh if the person writing knows how to use it, and that's the sticking point, unfortunately. A lot of fics are not written well, and this includes betrothal contracts. They end up full of tropes that are poorly thought out, or thrown in for a quick laugh or to make a plot trudge on. Sturgeon's Law says that 90% of everything is crap; the 10% are what make any type of fanfic worth reading. Including betrothal contracts.
