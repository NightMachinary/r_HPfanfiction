The problem is that those stories never, ever consider the most basic, most important question: Why would James and Lily do this to Harry? And if it's an older contract, why could every other Potter skip it until Harry? Why would people even make such contracts without specifying the individuals involved?

Authors using this trope never, ever think things through. They always keep the canon background, not realising that if such contracts existed, the canon world would look very, very differently - and everyone would be aware of such contracts since teenagers at school would be talking about such stuff all the time.
