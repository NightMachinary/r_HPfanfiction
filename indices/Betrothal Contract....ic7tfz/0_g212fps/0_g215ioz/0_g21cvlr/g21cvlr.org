  Why would James and Lily do this to Harry?
#+end_quote

The only good explanation I've seen is that James and Sirius got really pissed and had a "You know what would be awesome? Imagine if our children got married. If your son and the daughter I am going to have eventually..." kind of dialogue. Only works for Harry/Sirius' daughter (and to a lesser degree Tonks, Narcissa, Bellatrix and Andromeda as next of kin).
