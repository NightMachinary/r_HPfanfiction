Its fanfiction, it doesn't have to be realistic. Marriage tropes are often used as a tool to bring two characters together and explore enemies to lovers trope. The consequence are usually the focus of the fic, not how this arrangement came about or how the world would look like with marriage arrangements in it.

I am not a huge fan of any pairings in Harry Potter fandom so I haven't read many HP fics with this trope but marriage tropes are my guilty pleasure in a few other fandoms. When I read them I really don't care about how marriage law came to be, I just want to read about two characters having to put up with one another. I love in character fics and its a trope that can lead itself really well to allowing two characters to grow closer while not completely rewriting their personalities (as long as you can ignore the fact that these characters would more likely leave the country first). At least I prefer it to two people all of a sudden developing the hots for one another and making out despite being considered mortal enemies the day before. I do like the dubcon elements of some of these fics as well so they are really not for everyone and are often not examples of healthy relationships.
