There are much better ways to force two characters together without going the "rape law/contract" trope. The trope is actually a really shitty way to force two characters together since it generally needs a rewriting of their personalities to accept the law/contract, instead of working on a way to break it. If the characters were such doormats that they go along with such a law/contract, even though they didn't really want to, then the contract wouldn't be needed in the first place - the parents/guardians/public opinion could simply tell them to get hitched.
