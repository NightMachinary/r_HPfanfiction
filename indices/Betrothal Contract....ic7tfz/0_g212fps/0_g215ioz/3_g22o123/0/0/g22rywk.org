Is there much difference between guardians telling them to get married and a contract saying they should? I guess I was thinking in terms of other fandoms which don't usually have binding contracts so to me they are the same thing. The result is still the same either way - two characters who now have to deal being in a relationship/partnership with one another despite not wanting to be in one. I imagine characters like Draco or Harry don't exactly have guardians that would want them to be together in the first place so it makes more sense for there to be some magical contract.

I don't think it requires that much deviation from their personalities either. Once you get past the fact that for one reason or another these characters have to or chose to stay together, they are now free to hate each other as much as they want. To you it might be a non-negotiable part of their character that they would never be in a contract in the first place, but to me them keeping their personalities during their time together is what is actually important. In contrast with developing pairings the usual way, the only way two characters would be together is because they wanted to in the first place. This is a completely different type of romance story and doesn't work well for pairings where two characters wouldn't even be seen in a room together otherwise.

I believe the rape/noncon/dubcon is also a big appeal of this trope as well. Rape fantasies and domination/submission fantasies are some of the most common fantasies for women so marriage law trope fanfiction could be a safe way to explore those. It is for me at least and considering just how popular these tropes are I don't think I am the only one.
