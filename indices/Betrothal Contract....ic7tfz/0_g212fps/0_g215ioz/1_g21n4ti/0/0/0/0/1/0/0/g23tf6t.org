The trope is: Marriage Law/Contract forces two people together and they fall in love. If that doesn't happen, the trope isn't played straight. That's a huge difference. It's like the difference between a story where a king actually has the divine right to rule, and one where the king doesn't, and is toppled when he tries to enforce his rule against the people. One uses the "there is a divine right to rule" trope, the other doesn't.

Or, in other words, if the trope is subverted, then the trope isn't being used. And it's a toxic trope since it normalises rapey behaviour and teaches people that they have no rights.
