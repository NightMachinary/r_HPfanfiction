Who died and made you the arbiter of what constitutes a marriage contract fic for all fandom?

Once again, everything comes down to the writing. Rape, in and of itself, is not a bad thing to include in a story. Marriage contracts that, as you say, "use rape/the threat of rape to force a relationship," are not inherently bad things to work with. How do the characters handle it? How do they deal with the repercussions if they fight it? You're looking at fics where people take this idea and run with it and don't handle it well, and you've decided that this means the idea itself is bad.

I honestly don't know how to get through to you that tropes are never inherently bad. They can be discredited, they can be overused, they can be used poorly, they can even be used to try to harm. But in the context of writing as a whole, they are not in and of themselves a bad thing. They are tools in a toolbox. That's been my entire argument this whole time. Take the tool, use it in a way that makes the story interesting. Cause conflict for your characters. Explore the world you're creating. If you don't like a trope, don't use it and avoid stories with it. But don't tell people they can't or shouldn't use it.
