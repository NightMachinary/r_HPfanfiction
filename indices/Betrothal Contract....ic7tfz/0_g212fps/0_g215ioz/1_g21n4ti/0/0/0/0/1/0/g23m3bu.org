I really don't agree with your definition here. You're telling me that if a marriage contract is the driving force of the fic, the premise under which everything else happens, and the characters manage to invalidate it that it's not longer a marriage contract fic? What is it, then? This makes no sense.

But let's work under your definition here. Your problem, as stated in previous comments, is that a marriage contract is essentially a form of legal rape. But it's only a marriage contract fic, according to you, if they get together due to the contract and fall in love. At that point, it's consensual. There's no rape at all. There's not even the threat of rape with a clause demanding an heir because they want to be together and have children together.

Sure, in real life arranged marriages probably shouldn't exist and can be highly problematic. But they can also work, if the people who are under the contract make it work. In any case, this isn't real life we're talking about. This is fanfic, where we can explore things that are or are not true in real life without actually having to go through them. So again, what's the problem here? If all the marriage contract does is get the characters together and force them to put effort into a relationship they normally wouldn't, once they love each other and consent to having sex there's nothing weird or skeevy or wrong. It's just the impetus for the relationship to start.
