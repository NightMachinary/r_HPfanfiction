A contract that two people have to marry and produce an heir is basically a rape contract. Forced to have sex against your will is rape. Unless you go the whole "artificial insemination" and possibly "artificial womb" route, but that would utterly defeat the point of the trope, forcing a relationship between two characters. The entire trope is basically "use rape/the threat of rape to force a relationship", and that's a problem.

Getting out from such a contract is not using the trope, anyway - the marriage law/contract trope is about a relationship resulting from said law/contract. It isn't about people resisting rape.
