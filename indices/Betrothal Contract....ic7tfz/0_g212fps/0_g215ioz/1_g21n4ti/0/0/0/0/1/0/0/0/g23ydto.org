To me, the existence of the contract is the trope. Everything after is a subtrope. this is similar to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/apocalypsehow][Apocalypse How]], which is the trope for the end of the world but can happen in many different ways and has various classifications as subtropes. In our case, the trope splits off. Do they fall in love? Do they not? Is there pressure to have a child? Is this a weird thing for the current society or a societal norm?

As for your argument that this normalizes rapey behavior, it really doesn't. The trope, as you define it, is about how people can find love while under the societal pressure to do so. It's not "Welp, you're married, so just lie back and think of England." It's "Well this isn't what I would've chosen, but how can I make it work?" Which is, in fact, a part of life for many people globally. Would you like to tell people who have had a successful arranged marriage that it was rapey and should never have happened?
