The vast majority of the ones I've seen don't come from the Potters, but rather from the Blacks as part of being Sirius' heir. Or occasionally you get the James and Sirius were drunk fics and thought it would be a great idea.

As for the older contracts, it can just have some asinine requirement that made it skip generations, i.e. it only activates when there is a male Potter who is an only child reaches the age of 17, and whose parents are deceased. Typically goes hand-in-hand with blood and family magic. As for why it wasn't specific, maybe one of the intended participants died before it could be completed. Or the people who made it didn't want to restrict themselves, who cares about their far-off descendants. Or it was a demand for repayment of a debt and solidifying an alliance in the future. Sure, most of those are a stretch, but so is a magical contract story in the first place and I'm just spitballing.
