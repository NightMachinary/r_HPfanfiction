  As for the older contracts, it can just have some asinine requirement that made it skip generations, i.e. it only activates when there is a male Potter who is an only child reaches the age of 17, and whose parents are deceased.

Or even a straight forward one of requiring an eligible daughter for the other family while there's an eligible son for the Potters. Linkao3(The Ilvermony Champion) had that happen to Daphne Greengrass as the first daughter of the family in three generations.

Although I did read one Harry/Fleur one where the contract was supposed to go to James, but he and Lily either eloped or were engaged. Which since the Delacour it was supposed to go to was "already in the family way" meant it wasn't that hard to negotiate skiving it off to the next generation.

ETA: Looks like Ilvermony Champoin was taken down unfortunately.
