  Everyone knows that the seventh son of the seventh son has great magical abilities, that they are destined to become great.But a sixth son of a seventh son? That's nothing special. There's no guarantee of magic or heroics or special gifts. Just a little boy with lanky limbs and earnest eyes and a face splattered in generations of freckles, who grows up knowing that he's nothing but a footnote to the glory of his older siblings.Ron Weasley grows up as a shadow. Every single one of his older siblings is extraordinary, in their own way- Bill, the exceptional linguist and cursebreaker; Charlie, the dragon tamer; Percy, head boy and prefect; the twins, inventors extraordinaire. His entire life, Ron is compared to them by everyone he knows and always falls just a little short, no matter how hard he tries.Is it any surprise that Ron wants more out of life, that when he arrives at Hogwarts, bastion of magical opportunity and the chance to change his fate, that he takes it?
