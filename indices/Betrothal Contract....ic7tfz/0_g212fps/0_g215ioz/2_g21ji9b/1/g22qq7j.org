I really don't see James, who married a muggleborn for love, think that forcing his son into a marriage would be a good idea, stone drunk or not.

And the "Older contract" once again fails utterly at answering the question why anyone would make such a specific contract. What reason would they have to stipulate such conditions? If it was a political or debt motive, then "our kids will marry" is the logical answer, not "in some far, far future, our scions will marry into each other... maybe" clause. If the people involved didn't want to restrict themselves, why would they even make a contract in the first place? If only one side didn't want to, the other wouldn't accept such stupid conditions.
