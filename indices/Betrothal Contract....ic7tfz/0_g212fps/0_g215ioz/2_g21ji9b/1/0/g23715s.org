I imagine that one reason why an older contract isn't fulfilled yet is because there is some escape/postpone clause hidden in the whole legalese and every Potter bevor him was trained/advised for something like that. But with his his dursley upbringing he didn't know enough and everyone assumed he knows or maybe a manipulative Dumble kept him willful ignorant until it was too late?
