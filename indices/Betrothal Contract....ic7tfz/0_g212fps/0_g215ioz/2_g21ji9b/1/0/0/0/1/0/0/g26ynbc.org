It still would be obvious. Not to mention that the further back the contract goes, the less likely it would be that it lasted until Harry.

And the point remained: Why would someone put an escape clause in in the first place if they were willing to sell their children to get something? Contracts aren't made with the goal to fuck over a descendant centuries down the line, but with a goal for the ones making the contract. No one would make a contract "and our descendants can fulfil it whenever they want, or not".
