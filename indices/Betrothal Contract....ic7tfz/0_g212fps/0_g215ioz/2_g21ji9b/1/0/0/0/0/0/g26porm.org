Of course there is not an example in RL history for it. We wouldn't have the means to enforce something like that. But magical contracts that you didn't signed yourself has a example in canon: the GoF. But honestly it doesn't matter like with all Urban Fantasy stories (and in the end HP is just that) especially in fanfiction every troupe is 80% bs, 10 so bad it's just funny and the rest is despite or even because the troupe really good.
