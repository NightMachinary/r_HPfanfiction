There are no societies that have this kind of contract. They don't exist in the history of anywhere -- because there is no point to creating them. You make contracts for children you have or at least children you will have. Not contracts for children your distant future relatives might or might not have. And obviously, they will be cancelable by mutual agreement.

I really have nothing against writing an AU where parents sell off their children to the highest bidder, but the unbreakable forgotten contract trope is just utter nonsense.
