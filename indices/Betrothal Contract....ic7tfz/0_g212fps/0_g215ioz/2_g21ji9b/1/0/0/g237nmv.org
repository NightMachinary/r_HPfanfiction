Such clauses wouldn't be "hidden" but obvious. And even then - WTF would people put such clauses into a contract if it could mean that the entire reason for the contract was long gone by the time it might be fulfilled?

Honestly, the entire contract trope is just rotten. You need so many changes to the world to make it even half-way work, the characters wouldn't be the same anyway.

And we haven't even touched the "I won't adhere to the contract. And I just killed Voldemort. So, who do you think will try to enforce this on me?" argument. (And using the "It's a magical contract" just opens another can of worms, mainly "if we can bind others just like that, why haven't we done this to every damn suspected Death Eater after the first war?)
