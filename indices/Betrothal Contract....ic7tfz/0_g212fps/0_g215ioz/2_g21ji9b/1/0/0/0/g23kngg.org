Don't forget that societies that have this kind of contracts don't have necessary the laws to make such things more clear. Besides if u look at pre nip agreements if old and rich RL families they r so full of legalese u need a lawyer to dump it down for most people. It would be too easy to slip for an social and educational stunted person like harry over such clauses. But yes in most cases stories with that are rotten inrhat regard with their argument is often: " because magic and I said so"
