My argument is that if the two people making the contract want such a clause to be included, then they would do so openly. They wouldn't sneak a clause in - there's no reason to be sneaky. They didn't make the contract with the idea that, centuries down the line, Harry would be screwed by it. They made the contract with a clear goal for themselves. Too many authors don't understand that.
