I think it's a stretch saying those are a stretch ;)

Any contract of that kind would be cancelable, so the story would consist out of one scene & The End. However, I reject the last bit. After all, betrothals historically /made/ sense. Just between existing children, because the entire point was the alliance through marriage, not between some future offspring that may never exist and therefore would be meaningless for current relations.

You obviously need a sufficient AU, in which alliances matter and children are only regarded as bargaining chips, but after that, you sure can write a story /with/ a contract. It's just not going to be a /Contract Story/ (in as far as those are a genre/trope, and the contract is the plot).
