I think the reason for all contract fanfics is that authors either want harry to have arranged marriage but most arranged marriages are fixed by parents/elders but harry is an orphan so they use marriage contracts or to bring their heroine into Harry's life because in most romance stories introduction of harry and most girls are unrealistic. Also these stories are funny and popular at start as people enjoy their fights between harry and the heroine.
