  Enemies to lovers trope is often the entire point.

There are way better ways to do this though. I can outline what I think would make a decent Draco/Hermione or Harry/Bellatrix fic without the forced marriage bit (although by the point they would get together, the death eater characters would be barely recognisable due to the necessary growth).

Short of Harry(or Hermione)/Snape, /Pettigrew or /Voldemort, you can make everything work somehow, and those three are the only exception because they are directly responsible for the murder of the Potters, the very premise of this series.

Bellatrix can redeem herself if she defects before the DoM, Malfoy can grow up early if he has an attack of common sense and actually uses his brain for once (diverge before he calls Hermione mudblood), Parkinson did little other than running her mouth...
