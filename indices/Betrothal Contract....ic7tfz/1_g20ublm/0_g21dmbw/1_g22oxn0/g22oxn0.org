The whole point of marriage law tropes is often to set up relationships that are in no way healthy or make any sense otherwise. Enemies to lovers trope is often the entire point. Two characters may make the worst couple ever, but have interesting conflicts and drama that could be explored in a fic.

Its also way easier to write than actually developing a realistic bond between people who hate one another so a lot of authors tend to rely on it for specific pairings. You may not get the point of them, but they are very popular and quite entertaining to read for those of us into them. I don't care about any pairings in HP fandom to read many HP fics like this but I do occasionally enjoy them in other fandoms.

Your plot example just sounds boring and way too fluffy for my taste. If I read a romance fic give me conflict and drama instead. If I wanted something super normal and cute I would go out on a date with my fiance in real life. In fiction I prefer relationships built on more than just bumping into one another and going on a date. Whether it's by fighting Voldemort side by side or exploring a crime mystery or being forced to live together by a silly marriage law its all good to me.
