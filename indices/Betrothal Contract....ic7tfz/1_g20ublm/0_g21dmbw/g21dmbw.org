I never understood that part. Setting up a relationship is ridiculously easy. Character A and B bump into each other, they talk a bit and laugh about bumping into each other, due to (lighting/new haircut/new clothes/nice perfume/something B said), A realises that B is attractive, spontaneously asks B for a date, they go out, they have fun, they go out again...

Like, I can get almost everyone who aren't mortal enemies together in 2k words. And in the cases where it would require a marriage contract/law to get them together, the pairing isn't believable in the first place and the likely outcome of such a contract/law would be murder and/or suicide rather than a happy relationship.
