Its easier than thinking up an original twist. Like say, a good role reversal idea. Perhaps Harry has to work for it. Perhaps the person you select to pair him with. Romance is nothing if no effort is not put in. Don't just let them fall in love willy nilly. Let Harry or someone else take someone they like out on a date first, let them buy gifts and bumble through the necessary steps. That is far more interesting than forcing a relationship or love at first sight. A relationship takes work.
