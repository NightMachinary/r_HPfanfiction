Books 1-3 were clearly for tweens and early teens. 4-7 were aimed at square at the newish YA category. They were written latter and logically seem aimed at the same readers, as you say. I'd still suggest most kids ten or older could handle it, all the way through the series.

People do die "on camera", get tortured, and deal with really heavy issues. Given those themes, the series could be comfortably classed as YA in all but the stuffiest library systems, as even the early books don't talk down to the reader and deal with tough issues -- a major reason the series was so subversive and became so famous in the first place. Some people argue that Young Adult novels means late teens, but they are stupid. The people claiming that, not the teens. Not /just/ the teens.

Late teen readers are off finding the smuttiest stuff they can in the mystery and fantasy/sci-fi sections of the library with their new adult library cards. Or, this generation, on Amazon Unlimited with their Kindles.
