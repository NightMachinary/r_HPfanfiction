I love Doctor Who myself almost as much as Potter, and I feel like there is the same question. What is the audience of a story that's fantastical but strives to explore many complex themes like love and the nature of evil? I thinks he two series are similar, though Who has the advantage of thirty more years of existence, but Potter is more famous. I think I would keep loving Potter ten years from now just as much as I did ten years ago, but the appeal would be different. I think that Who and Potter both draw a young audience and can keep us in love with the series because of the complexity of the stories. I hope this means Potter ages as well as, if not better, than Doctor Who.
