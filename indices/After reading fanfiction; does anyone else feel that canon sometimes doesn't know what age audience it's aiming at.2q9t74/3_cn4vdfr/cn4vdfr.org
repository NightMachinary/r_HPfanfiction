  that same Hermione is literally being tortured by being CUT INTO with a knife, by the Harry Potter world's equivalent of a racial supremacist. That's heavy going for a book originally aimed at 11 and 12-year olds.

That's mostly because the last book /isn't/ aimed at 11/12 year olds. It's aimed at 17 year olds. The fact that kids can read all the books back to back now doesn't change how JKR originally meant for them to be read.
