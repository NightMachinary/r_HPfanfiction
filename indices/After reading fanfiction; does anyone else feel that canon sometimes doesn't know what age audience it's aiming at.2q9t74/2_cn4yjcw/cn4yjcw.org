Ehh, none of it really bothered me when I read it. Bearing in mind that I was given the entire series as a gift shortly after DH came out, and I was around 12 at the time.

I read through all of them in a couple of months and the final book didn't really bother me. Granted I didn't quite understand some of the finer points, but it certainly wasn't disturbing.
