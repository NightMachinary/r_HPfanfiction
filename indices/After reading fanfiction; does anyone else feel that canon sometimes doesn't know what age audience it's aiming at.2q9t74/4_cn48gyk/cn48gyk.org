I've noticed the same thing about a lot of other, lighter series actually. Until I was a young teen for example, I could not get through the high school aged books of the Betsy-Tacy series. Now, reading the earlier ones is so incredibly boring. I personally like those kinds of series, because there is so much more depth you can get when you're older.
