As Mrs. Norris watched Voldemort storm into Hogwarts, killing students as they desperately tried to flee, she knew the moment when things went wrong. The death of one squib caretaker had seemed so insignificant to them, so unnoteworthy to the wand-wavers. But only she knew Argus's secret, how he kept all of them safe.

Mrs. Norris used the pandemonium to slip off to the Seventh Floor. After giving a polite nod to Barnabas the Barmy, a cat door appeared. Pushing her way into the Come and Go Room, she walked over to the fourth pile on the left, piled high with assorted human junk. Stepping carefully, Mrs. Norris plucked out what she needed, and headed to the door.

Time-turner held firmly in her jaw, Mrs. Norris exited the room. She was ready to make things right.
