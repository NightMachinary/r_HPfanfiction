Fudge!

Fudge fought the Death Eaters tooth and nail time and time again. In every time line, he tried a different thing.

It surprised him quite a lot when he realized that by acting completely incompetent (not recognizing Voldemort, not sending Aurors to fight the Death Eaters, etc) and letting Harry do-his-thing, he stopped a bloodbath from happening and saved lots of people.

It disappointed him, but soon he accepted that yes, that was the best case scenario.

Pity he will be remembered as the most useless Minister of Magic in centuries instead of the brilliant time traveling hero he actually is.
