I imagine Wizarding America to be like America under the Articles of Confederation but less organized and unified.

I imagine that the wizards who were in the american colonies were moving for similar reasons and wanted to get out from under the thrall of the Ministry of Magic. So imagine a bunch of pioneers who can teleport. If I ever write a story that is compliant to Fantastic Beasts, New York and the MCUSA would be the butt of a joke for most American Wizards with their obsessive govt overreach and wand licenses.
