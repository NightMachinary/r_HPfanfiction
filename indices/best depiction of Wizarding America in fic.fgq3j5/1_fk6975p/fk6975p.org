Damn this is infuriating. There is this one fic that I remember have an interesting depiction of wizarding America with the wizarding west still being mainly lived on by the magical native tribes. I can bot remember the story or anything else from the story but I just remember either Harry or someone else being amazed by the difference of their culture.. or something like that.
