I would love to see a Harry acting like full blown Camp-AF Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid's campy, hammed-up-to-hell, Shakespearean-drama Palpatine performance in the prequels would be hilarious on Harry's part.

It would be such an interesting variation to the usual "I lace my cocaine with the tears of my enemy's wives and daughters" emo-Harry that he always seems to do whenever he's a villain. A Villain Harry who loves life and evil and has fun the whole while would be a delight. :)
