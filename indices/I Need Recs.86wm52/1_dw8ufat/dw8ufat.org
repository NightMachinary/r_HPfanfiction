I always recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) and sequels, because it's a personal obsession of mine, but it's not exactly unknown. I mean, it has plenty of followers and a pretty tight discussion forum with some nice regular fans.

It's Fem!Harry (which is something I hated prior to reading it), gen, no romance (Harry is borderline asexual so far), very well-written and satisfying plots, the best Pansy Parkinson that anyone has ever written ever, awesome worldbuilding, and a fantastic array of orinigal characters.
