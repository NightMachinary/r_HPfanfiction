Read like 10 chapters. The writing's alright, but Harry seems almost autistic (well, I exaggerate a bit, but he's definitely on the spectrum) and a bit of a doormat. Does the story get better in that regard?

Also what the fuck is up with Harry's cloak? Did Dumbledore basically withhold it and gave it to Neville without telling Harry anything? Cause that's some /bull/shit.
