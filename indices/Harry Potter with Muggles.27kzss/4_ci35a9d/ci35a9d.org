[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2917903/1/All-at-Once][All at Once]]: "AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info."

Harry knows nothing at all about the magical world or the fact that he is a wizard until he's almost done with high school. It's pretty good, but it is incomplete and hasn't been updated since 2008.
