I'm picturing actual ships like in treasure planet - sails, oars, the whole bit. They'd be built using similar methods as broomsticks with large scale bubble head charms, expanded spaces, and some AI aspects like the Weasley's car develops. Wizards in space would be a lot like the MCU Asgardians visually.
