1. Use space mass expansion charms, time turners and portkeys to build the TARDIS.
2. Take whatever vessel they find visually appealing and add featherlight, space expansion, modified bubblehead and unbreakable charms, insert engines and go. I like the idea of the Rook taking flight, personally. We would see a lot of weird ship design. Treasure planet is definitely an option here too, if that Durmstrang ship was any indication. I don't think they would go for boring old muggle ship design if they don't have to and if wizarding tents or the Beauxbatons carriage are any indication...
3. Create something slapped together from various modules like the Weasley's house, held together by magic alone.
4. Weapons systems are where it gets interesting. Portkey bombs, potions, magical plants or creatures onto enemy ships? Unbreakable hulls with perfect, magical shields? Standard duelling spells are not very useful here, but anything that improves guns definitely would be. Internally extended barrels and such are only the more mundane application here. A front-mounted Basilisk with a bubblehead charm might be terrifyingly effective, even if all it does is petrify.
