They'd probably be steampunk-ish in design and nature, no?

If they're still stuck in the Victorian era of design and infrastructure, they wouldn't have much else to go on. Though, this question is under the assumption that they've advanced enough to have knowledge of Star Wars type ships. So they'd probably look like literally anything. If they advanced enough to that level, they'd either look like any other muggle ship that's out there, or they'd look similar.

Outside of portkeys, we have don't really have much to go on for how they travel super long distances. They'd either borrow from Muggle design or whichever era they're currently in.
