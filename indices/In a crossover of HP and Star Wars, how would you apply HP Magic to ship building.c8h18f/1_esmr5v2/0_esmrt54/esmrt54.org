Assume there are Muggleborns who have some idea what their doing OR they hire someone who does like say Blissex-Wessex family, whose members are notable for creating the Victory-class & Republic-class Star Destroyers, the Venator, Imperial, and Executor-class Star Destroyers, Delta-7 Aetherspite-class light interceptor and Alpha-3 interceptor, and RZ-1 A-wing interceptor to help them with the designing and building of these ships to take advantage of their Magic's various practical applications.

Basically, assume they have someone helping them that does know and is collaborating with them to design and build these ships.
