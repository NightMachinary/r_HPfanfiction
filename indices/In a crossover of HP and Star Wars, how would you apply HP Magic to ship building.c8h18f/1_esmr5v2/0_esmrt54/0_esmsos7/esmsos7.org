I'm trying to be magical and creative about thinking this through, but I honestly don't think they'd be different or special in regards to other starships. JKR tried to make everything seem magical, but when you get down to it, none of the architecture was inspiring or creative. It was Medieval to Victorian and Gothic. I don't think they're nearly creative enough to come up with something that differs much, even with Muggleborns. The Muggleborns would base their designs more on Muggle designs, and the Purebloods would base them on whatever their society's current design standards are at.

If we're saying that magic is the same as the Force, then they couldn't really do anything weird. We never hear of spells that make things unbreakable, unless we're talking Fanfiction, so they couldn't have glass yachts flying around. I stand by thinking that they'd either be Steampunk in design, or whatever the rest of the universe is using at that time.
