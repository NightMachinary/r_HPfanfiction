Actually, you'd be wrong about that unbreakable part. Hermione makes the jar holding Rita Skeeter unbreakable in Book 4.

HP (canon) magic has shown all sorts of avenues for magic improving SW ship design. For example, they can design small freighters with cargo space matching that of huge freighters using space expansion charms, in addition to being lighter due to feather-weight charms that save on fuel due to having to moves less mass, and that's not even bringing shrinking charms into account to make for even more room on a ship. Or make even Starfighter Carriers that are small but capable of great carrying capacity. And that's just canon charms applications.

You got to think more outside the box.
