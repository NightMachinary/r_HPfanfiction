For warships I think a reasonable idea is to build the ships on the conventional Star Wars manner, but make them unplottable. It's also reasonable to mount systems of surfaces spelled to be unbreakable on the outer hull.

I imagine combat looking like this: You detect a starship, or a tiny fighter, or something. Unfortunately targeting systems are malfunctioning. Something is suddenly visible on light telescopes. You try to export targeting co-ordinates to the guns, but the telescope output is giving malformed co-ordinates. You're suddenly hit by cannon-fire, rattling your shields.

Imagine having to deal with an ordinary bomber aircraft which had been treated in this way.
