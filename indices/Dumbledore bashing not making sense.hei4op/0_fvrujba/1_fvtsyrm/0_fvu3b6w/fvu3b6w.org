  Plea deals are a huge thing in most countries.
#+end_quote

Plea deals happen /in the context of a trial/. The plea is step one of the trial, with step two being either case for the prosecution or sentencing depending on the plea.

(It's why suspects used to be tortured by pressing with weights to force them to enter a plea: with no plea, there was no trial.)

Sirius's complaint that he had no trial is fundamentally that he was not permitted to plead before the court /at all/, which a plea deal would have specifically required.
