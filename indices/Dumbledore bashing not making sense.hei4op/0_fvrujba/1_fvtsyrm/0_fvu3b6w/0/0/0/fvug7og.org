I know from the Czech law (I have a law degree, but I haven't practised for twenty years now) that the institute of “collaborating defendant” has been introduced not that long ago, and it is used under heavy supervision mostly in the corruption cases and similar high-profile ones (where it is usually otherwise impossible to prove anything), but it is still viewed with a lot of suspicion, and it is certainly far from the widespread use (and perhaps abuse) as in US.
