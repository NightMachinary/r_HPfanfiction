Not so much 'less common' as 'happen in a way that a US lawyer wouldn't recognise as a plea bargain.' There's a certain amount of haggling over what precisely goes on the indictment, which may or may not involve defence counsel saying what he can or can't 'persuade his client to hold his hand up to' and pointing out the relative chances of the prosecution making more serious charges stick.

Plea bargains therefore officially aren't a thing in the UK. Which is why I didn't spend several hours about thirty years ago in a stuffy Crown Court interview room not trying to sort out what definitely wasn't a plea bargain with a recalcitrant client whose sticking point wasn't the charge of reckless driving of the getaway car.

Since he was holding his hand up to, among other things, arson and robbery, I'm still not sure what his motivation for that was.
