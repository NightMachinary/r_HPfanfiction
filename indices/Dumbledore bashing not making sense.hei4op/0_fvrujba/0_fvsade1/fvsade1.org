Why would he go on a crusade with the whole rest of the government though? And that for someone who CONFESSED to his crimes, for which he was caught almost red handed ? Even Bellatrix had more chance for an appeal because she didn't hang around at the scene of her crime for gods sake. In Sirius' case there was zero ambiguity, many witnesses, confession, perpetrator caught at the scene of the crime. Also remember it was basically martial law then, with the war still ongoing. Sirius was extreamly lucky to not have been executed then, when he was believed (I don't why, but it's cannon so...) that he was LV's right hand man.
