I meant *after* Harry's third year of course. His cannon excuse was that he doesn't have enough solid evidence to prove Sirius' innocence. That is a two-fold nonsense: there is no way how to definitively prove innocence (alibi is proving impossibility not strictly speaking innocence), and thus all legal regimes since the beginning of the world are based on what the old Latin maxim states: “/semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit/” (“the necessity (or burden) of proof always [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law][lies with the person who lays charges]])”). Logically out of it comes the concept of /presumption of innocence/, which is kept by all civilized or even non-civilized legal regimes (including mostly Nazi Germany, excluding Stalin's Russia and probably current Northern Korea). Unless Sirius was /proven/ guilty in the trial, there was no legal reason for him to be in jail, and thus should be immediately released (and perhaps criminal investigation should be reopened).

There is no shade of evidence anywhere in the canon that there was any kind of plead agreement, just to the contrary (aside from nobody mentioning it, you also need a trial even for a plead agreement):

  “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.”

  And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial.
