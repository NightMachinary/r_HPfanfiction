I'm not quite sure why you're bringing up veritaserum, but I was more referencing the confundus and more importantly the Imperius, which we know Death Eaters used.

I'm making assumptions about the existence of potions, but love potions exist so other kinds of mind control potions aren't impossible.

The big point however is that there are many many things that can make Sirius appear guilty while being innocent and so a trial is important as it allows for soberly looking at the evidence and making sure Sirius is not compromised. And veritaserum doesn't fall in this category.

EDIT: Though given all the magical things that obscure things I'm not sure how you can charge someone to the level of no reasonable doubt without veritaserum, since the polyjuice potion exists. And likely other things that make it hard to prove that it's the person being accused is actually the perpetrator.

EDIT 2: Though seeing your other responses we agree on the necessity of the trial. I'm loving all the info on legal stuff btw.
