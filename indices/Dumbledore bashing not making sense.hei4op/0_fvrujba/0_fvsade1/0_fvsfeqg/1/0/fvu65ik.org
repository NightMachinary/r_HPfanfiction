Since at least early modern age (in Czech law since 16th century) it is held as a foundation of the legal criminal process that “/Confessio est non regina probationum/” (Confession is *not* the Queen of evidence), because the overwhelming stress on confession in the criminal process (held under the maxim opposite to this one), which was typical for the medieval process led to too many false confessions, forced confessions, and another miscarriages of justice. There is no way how anybody could be thrown in the jail *solely* based on their confession of crime.
