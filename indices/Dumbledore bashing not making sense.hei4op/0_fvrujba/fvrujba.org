I think most of the blame for Dumbledore actions/inaction could be fairly put on Ms Rowling's shoulders. Her worldbuilding is oriented only as much it carries her story, when she doesn't need it, she left horrible holes which are inexplicable in-universe without some horrible inconsistencies on side of many actors. E.g., just out of the top of my head: there is no reason in the world why Chief Justice couldn't order of somebody who was thrown for twelve years in jail without trial. And burden of proof is on the side of the prosecutors not on the defendant. There is no explanation for this in-universe, but Ms Rowling just wanted to have Sirius locked in Grimmauld Place until he went a wee bit crazy.
