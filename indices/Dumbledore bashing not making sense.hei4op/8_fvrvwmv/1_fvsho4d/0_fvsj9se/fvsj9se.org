During 3rd year is, as [[/u/Vercalos]] says, on Dumbledore for sure; however, I find it really unlikely that Dumbledore only became Chief Warlock post-1981 given his extreme age (he was 99/100 in 1981) and the fact that his claim to fame was Grindelwald which happened in 1945.

So I find it really unlikely that he wasn't Chief Warlock, but we also don't know since the books don't say one way or the other.
