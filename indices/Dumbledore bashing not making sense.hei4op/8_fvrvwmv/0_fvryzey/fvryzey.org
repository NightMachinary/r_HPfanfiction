In general, Dumbledore managed to use his influence to get himself in high roles and then he acted very passively with regards to the war. Which lead to more suffering as someone light-sided and more active couldn't take on the role, while also dividing Dumbledore's attention.

Some other failures:

- Not using the post war anger to make sure known death eaters were sent to Azkaban to break the pureblood agenda's back.

  - He's Albus fucking Dumbledore, defeater of the last Dark Lord, and given the power of the boy-who-lived story, it should be an easy thing politically to force either veritaserum or political disbarment.
  - There was enough anger to throw Sirius in Azkaban for live without trial

- Not using the basilisk fiasco to ruin Lucius politically
- Leaving Malfoy free after he both managed to almost kill Ron/Katie and then tried to Crutacius Harry (the Sectumsemtura incident)

Pretty much, due to his hangups (Aria's death making him more passive/forgiving) and the writing of the story (The tone change from a children's story to a YA story and then the fact that Rowling didn't tie all the events of each book together, e.g., inventing things in later books that cause massive issues in earlier books), we're left with a Dumbledore that might be very competent/powerful in a personal capacity, but that's a terrible and ineffectual Leader of the Light.
