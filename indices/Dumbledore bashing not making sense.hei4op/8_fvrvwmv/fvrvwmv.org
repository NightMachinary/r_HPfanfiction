Ultimately a lot of poor decisions were made by Dumbledore.

- Traveling to the Ministry via /broom/ when called away. This might be excusable in the first book, when other methods of long-distance transport hadn't been introduced yet, but this issue pops up again in later books.

- Knowingly leaving Harry in an abusive home for over a decade.

- Setting a trap for Voldemort in a /school for children/, putting it behind a door that a first year could unlock, and announcing it to the school(I wonder just how many students actually knew about Fluffy, at least, as the surest way to get a teenager to do something is telling them that they shouldn't).

- Never calling in a curse breaker to break the curse on Defense Against the Dark Arts.

- Never ensuring Sirius Black got a trial, he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot by the time Black broke out. And this probably speaks more to the corruption of the wizarding world than Dumbledore specifically, but both times summary execution pops up(Sirius Black, and Barty Crouch Jr.) no one bats an eye at the execution.

- Distancing himself from Harry when he /needed/ an authority figure in 5th year. His stated reason was to make Harry a less tempting target for Voldemort, but

- 

  - He's stated to be the only wizard Voldemort has ever been afraid of.

- 

  - Voldemort has been demonstrably obsessed with Harry Potter ever since Harry became the Boy-Who-lived.

- The Ministry Six beat the Order of the Phoenix to the Department of Mysteries, by at least an hour, despite flying from Scotland to London via thestral. With access to portkeys or floo, the Order should have been there much faster.

There's more, but I'm on mobile and tired of tapping.
