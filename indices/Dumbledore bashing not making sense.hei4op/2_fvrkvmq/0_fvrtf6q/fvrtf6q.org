Exactly, a plan shouldn't be judged on the outcomes but, rather, the expected outcomes and risks given the knowledge the planner had or should have had.

That is, plans should be judged in abstract. You can have a brilliant plan that fails due to not knowing some critical information that there was no way for you to know. Though, if your plan doesn't take into account various contingencies, then it's a bad plan.
