I agree with all your points and I'm not arguing against any of them, but I think "trying to keep Harry out of it" doesn't do justice to how badly he fucked that part up. In first year alone, three eleven-year-olds tried to knowingly confront a mass-murderer, because they knew about his plan and, to the best of their knowledge, everyone else was busy doing nothing about it (not taking into account whether any plans to deal with it were actually viable). Oh, and each of them has experienced at least one threat to their life, if not an outright assassination attempt, some of which, as a result of the choices of teachers. And it just sort of goes on like that.
