Oh, boy you're poking at a hornets' nest.

Dumbledore is an excellent example of "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Just because his plan worked doesn't mean his actions aren't easily twistable and occasionally reprehensible.

However, I will say Dumbledore isn't bashed all that much for his canon actions. Case in point: he doesn't want to leave it up to a baby. In fact, he tries his best to keep Harry out of it, which is the actual problem at hand.

Edit since we're here:

- Barty Crouch Sr, and the Council of Magical Law, was in charge of Death Eater trials. Not the Wizengamot, which we don't even know if Dumbledore was part of at the time. Sr is the reason Death Eaters were free.

- James told Dumbledore Sirius was his Secret Keeper. It was up to Barty Crouch Sr, Fudge, and all the Aurors on scene to check Sirius' wand.

- The curse on the DADA position is very much like Lily's sacrifice: magic caused by an action. Voldemort couldn't enter 4 Privet Drive. Bill Weasley, lmfao, wouldn't have been able to remove the DADA curse.
