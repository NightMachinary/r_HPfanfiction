I didnt expect him to be able to kill voldemort but maybe during one of those years that actual terrorist were set free and gaining power within the government he couldve idk, maybe tried to prepare in any way shape or form against what would be his 3rd fight against a dark lord. He didnt know about the horicruxs so I wont hold that against him but my argument is that his ENTIRE plan that decided if everyone he knew would live or die, was for harry to take care of it, even before he accidentally put the timer on his life. Like dont get me wrong his side won but the literal only actual "plan" that worked was a literal prophecy that voldemort himself made sure happened. The stone trap Voldemort easily broke in and Dumbledore was hoping that riddle would just sit there for another hour or so. The chamber of secrets, there plan was send a hat if someone decides to fix the problem, 3rd didnt have any sort of plan, neither did 4th, 5th was avoid harry and have snape teach him a thing. 6th was die via snape and hope no-one checked his corpse for the obvious signs of curse damage. And 7th was hope harry was jesus. We never see any sort of evidence that Dumbledore was planning ANYTHING else during these books. Dont get me wrong I have problems with Dumbledore's methods but I think he was a good person. I pretty much share your sentiment that he was a professor, not a leader or soldier but that doesnt mean his plans werent awful. It's easy to forgive the awful planning since he wouldnt even be the one making these plans if he didnt have such bad luck with men but nevertheless his plans were just flat out bad. Still one of my favorite characters though, hope we get to see him do things in the next FB movie.
