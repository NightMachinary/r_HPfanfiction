This is where your argument lost credibility. Dumbledore didn't HAVE to hold three jobs. He could have turned down those other, prestigious positions. Even after saying he knew he couldn't have a position of power because he was too susceptible to it's lure, he CHOSE to hold those three jobs. He CRAVES power, and he is fooling himself if he believes that turning down the position of Minister gave him the moral high ground on not seeking it. Hell, he puts every single title on his correspondence, to make sure everybody knows what an important man he is.
