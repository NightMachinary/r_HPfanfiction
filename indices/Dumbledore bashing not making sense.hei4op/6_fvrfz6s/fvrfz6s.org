Its mostly cause with over half a century of being in power and 10 years of being aware of voldemorts surviving after the rebounded killing curse, his only plan was to let a baby deal with it and also to have arabella and snape sorta kinda watch over said baby. Like if harry got hit by a truck Dumbledore was kinda screwed.were never made aware of any plan outside of the one that relied on harry and that doesnt sit well with alot of people.
