If you look at Harry's life, It has always led up to him dying at the right time. I understand having it as a back up plan, needs of the many and all that. But Harry was brought up specifically so that he would allow himself to be killed.

There are several parts in canon that prove that Dumbledore knew Harry was in danger. For example, he admitted that he knew that Quirrel was possessed by Voldemort. He knew that Voldemort was after harry and what he do? Nothing. He knew that a professor was actively trying to kill an eleven year old, potentially putting any number of students in harm's way. And still Dumbledore did nothing.

And that's just one example, so don't tell me Harry wasn't raised as a lamb to the slaughter.
