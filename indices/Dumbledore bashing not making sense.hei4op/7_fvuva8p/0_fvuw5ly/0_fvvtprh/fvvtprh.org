  "Go --- cupboard --- stay --- no meals."

This is what Vernon said after they got back from the zoo. No meals plural: canonical proof that he was ABUSED by withholding of food. Having a child skip dinner is not abusive, but multiple meals in a row skipped IS.

Locked in the cupboard for DAYS at the minimum. Locking a child in a cupboard has not been acceptable since the Victorian age.

For your second point, yes his life was controlled by Dumbledore. His rightful guardians said he was not going to Hogwarts. Dumbledore sends Hagrid to BULLY them, KIDNAPPING Harry (who went willingly, but was still taken from his guardians by force). They get to Gringotts, and hey! Harry has an account that /Dumbledore had the key to/. By what right did he have this key? By what right did he withhold these funds from Harry's rightful guardians? (I'm not saying it was a good idea to give them access to the money, because they'd have stolen it all. But your argument is that Dumbledore didn't hold control Harry's life, which this shows that he did.)

Starting at the end of fourth year, Dumbledore insists that Harry go back to the Dursleys in the summer. His position as Headmaster in no way gives him that authority, nor do his other positions.

  ...Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.

  'She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,' he said. 'But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.'

  'Why?' said Harry.

  'She said Dumbledore's got his reasons,' said Ron, shaking his head darkly.

After that point, not only does Dumbledore insist he go back every year, he stipulates how long Harry must stay, and where he's allowed to go other than that. He goes so far as to set guards to make sure Harry stays, and instructs them (and his friends) to keep Harry in the dark. He even kidnaps Hedwig to make sure Harry can't contact anybody.

Dumbledore controlling Harry's life is CANON, no matter how much his apologists try to whitewash it.
