I think the problem with Dumbledore is we see him as the 'wise old man' character but he proves to be very human. He is bashed because he doesn't have a perfect solution, he makes mistakes that are in line with his background/character, and he only is able to make excellent guesses instead of being omnipotent. His genius is academic. He's not Sherlock who is able to take in minute details and analyze them to reach seemingly inhuman leaps of logic. He's not Tom Riddle who is able to build a social network and leverage it into a political coup. Dumbledore is skilled and he is smart, but he's not infallible.
