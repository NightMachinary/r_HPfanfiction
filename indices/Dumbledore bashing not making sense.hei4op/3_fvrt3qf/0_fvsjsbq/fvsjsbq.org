Yep, you can tell because every stupid Dumbledore bashing fic is like "lol why didn't you just have the goblins get rid of the scarcrux like they can't do in canon?!"

Or "lol why didn't you just do this spell that doesn't exist in canon?!"

Or "lol why didn't you do this stupid, insane solution that was extremely unlikely to work but it turns out did because the author doesn't know anything about anything."
