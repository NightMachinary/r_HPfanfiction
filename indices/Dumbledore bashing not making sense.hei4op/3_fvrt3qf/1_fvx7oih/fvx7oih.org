Dumbledore's biggest problem is that he believes he is smarter than everybody else, and therefore there's no reason to consult with anybody about anything. His biggest flaw is his hoarding of knowledge.

So he plays the, "just do as I say because I know best" card time after time, without ever telling anybody why.

And when he inevitably fucks up, because nobody is perfect and he's not as infallible as he thinks he is, he plays the "forgive an old man" card. He can't have it both ways.

And the biggest bullshit he ever spewed is when he tells Harry he kept things --- EVERYthing --- from him because he loved him too much.
