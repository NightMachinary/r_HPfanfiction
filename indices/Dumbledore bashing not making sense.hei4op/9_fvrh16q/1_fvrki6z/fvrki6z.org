Is there evidence that Harry's friends will be less forgiving post-war? Draco almost killed Ron and Katie and was fine, Lucius avoided Azkaban even after planting the diary, helping execute the Department of Mysteries break in.

This is unpopular, but Harry's decision to snap the Elder wand makes more sense than flexing about to everyone in the Great Hall. Any surviving Death Eaters knows about the Elder wand allegiance and can simply kidnap Harry or his friends and torture them for information. And there's nothing the Order or Ministry can do about it, given the heavy casualties sustained.

Death Eater confirmed casualties

- Voldemort, Bellatrix, Peter

Order/Ministry confirmed casualties

- Snape, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Scrimgeour, Amelia Bones, Emmeline Vance, Tonks

- unknown number of Aurors, leading to Ron and Harry being accepted into Auror Department as a result of heavy casualties

The Death Eaters got off light here. Yaxley, Dolohov, the Lestranges, Travers, Mulciber, Avery, Nott, Selwyn, none of them are confirmed killed. Anyone that survived can simply bide their time and strike back, given the weakened Ministry.
