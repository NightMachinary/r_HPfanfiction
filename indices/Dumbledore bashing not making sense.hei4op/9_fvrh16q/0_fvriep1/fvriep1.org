This is D+D levels of subverting expectations. The reason Harry and Dumbledore do this (and tell Voldemort about the wand) is /because/ Voldemort is too arrogant to do everything you mentioned. It's a fatal flaw 7 books in the making.

Nevermind that Voldemort himself /cannot/ do any magic against Harry here and that Neville knows about the snake.
