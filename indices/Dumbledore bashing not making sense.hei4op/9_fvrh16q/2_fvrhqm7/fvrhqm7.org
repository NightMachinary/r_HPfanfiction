Ah, yes, my favorite. Trying to have Voldemort not just end the fucking fight right then. Definitely makes a good argument against Dumbledore not being the bad guy. As I said a couple minutes ago,

Ah, ok, so you expect a transfiguration professor turned headmaster to be able to kill a wraith? How? He was susceptible to the one horcrux, ended up dying to it, sacrificed his remaining health for the locket, and died for it, and tried to give Harry the support he needed in order to complete the task after he was dead. Dumbledore couldn't enter the chamber, got blocked at every turn by Malfoy and the Ministry, and had to hold three jobs. Like, Dumbledore didn't know that Voldemort was alive, no proof, but he did suspect it, and didn't know how, until the diary, and then he had other obligations, but once Voldemort returned he managed to get the number out of Slughorn, and start tracking them down. He didn't just leave it up to Harry, he died getting as far along as he could, trying to track down hidden artifacts.

JKR set it up so that no good guys were actually competent in the series. Mad-eye got beat in his house by a person who was under the imperius for years before just getting free, and a rat. Not a single auror did anything productive until the final fight, and even then it was the same ones who were in the Order to begin with.
