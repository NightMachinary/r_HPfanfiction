The books are called the Harry Potter series, not the Albus Dumbledore series. Obviously Harry and friends need to be the ones doing all the action. Dumbledore is barely even a character in the first few books, he's basically just there to occasionally provide exposition, and as such I don't think it makes any sense to try to come up some motivation for any actions he doesn't take. He's clearly supposed to be a good guy, and so he is imo. The plot holes are just plot holes, they don't need to be explained with Dumbledore secretly being some sort of evil schemer.
