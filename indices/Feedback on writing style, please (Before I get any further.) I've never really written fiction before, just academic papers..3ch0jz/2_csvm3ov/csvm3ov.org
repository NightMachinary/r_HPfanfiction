I like this style of writing and would like to see more of it in fanfic. Feels like a real novel to me, unlike a lot of fanfic that is very dialogue-heavy and light on inner monologue and description, leading to me having a hard time ever feeling particularly immersed in the characters or setting.

I'd certainly be intrigued and continue reading if I came across this story.
