linkao3(Messing with Time by slythernim)

This one is more of a cracky time-travel fic where Harry ends up in his five-year-old body and dwells less on the rebuilding phase after the first wizarding war. It's more about Harry pranking Death Eaters and trying to convince everyone that he's not a five-year-old possessed by Voldemort.
