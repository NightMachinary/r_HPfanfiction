Maybe someone can help me out (but I don't care enough to start a whole knew thread!) I started reading a story a while back on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] where Hermione and Draco work together at the ministry and get pulled back in time and the tie-turner breaks. They're in the country with some Longbottom relations and I think Hermione and Draco pretend to be brother and sister. I was really quite enjoying reading the two of them being flirty/snarky with eachother. But I didn't favourite it and can't remember the title.
