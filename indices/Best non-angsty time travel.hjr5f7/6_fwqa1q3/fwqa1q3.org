Uhhh... I can only think of one off the top of my head, but it is centered around Hermione and I do believe the war ends up being a plot point, but it's due to the ramifications of the future and Hermione's knowledge, which does end up being a massive plot point that. I'll not spoiler it, since I did quite enjoy it. Gotta love the fanfiction portrayal of Harry's Grandparents. They are almost always great when they are part of the main cast.
