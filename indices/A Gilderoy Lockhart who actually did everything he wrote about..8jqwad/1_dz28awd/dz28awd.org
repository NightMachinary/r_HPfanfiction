I know of one, but can't remember the name!

Lockhart was a complete fraud, and accidentally(?) got obliviated before 2nd year. When he woke up and learned he was supposed to be the defense teacher that year, he studied and trained to make himself competent. Unfortunately I don't remember anything else about it off the top my head.

Hopefully someone here will remember the story and provide a title.
