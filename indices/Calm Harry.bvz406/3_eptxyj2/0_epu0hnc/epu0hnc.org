From what I remember reading For Love of Magic, it certainly isn't what I want. I was hoping for fics with Harry being detached from his emotions .... Something like Worthy of Magic. linkffn(12800980)

I just realised worthy of magic doesn't have a calm Harry .... Harry in that story is quite the opposite of calm. I didn't realize what fic I wanted I guess...
