Worthy of Magic was just fucking perfect. That one was a fuckin hit, I mean that shit hit straight to the bones yo. Best part is that it gets better and it does so in a manner that makes sense in a weird way. Best part is that it doesn't try to sweeten it's utter fucking madness, it revels in it and how horrible it is and that comrades makes it one of the best fics in the fandom and a goddamn must read.
