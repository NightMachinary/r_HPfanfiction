i was talking about Worthy of Magic lol. For Love of Magic was really good imo, even though sex scenes and rather strong racism were used more than necessary. I agree that it was really well written, and it had a lot of aspects that i look for in a fic.

Now Worthy of Magic follows a /complete psychopath/ of a child. It is interesting and he is really powerful, but he is absolutely crazy and it's scary lol.
