Unless you're a red-pill jerk, you should just give it a pass. It's on the same level of creepiness as Princess of Black, except imo it's a bit worse because at least in that one you got the impression that the author was trying to offend you. In For the Love of Magic, it felt like the author was just jerking himself off writing it as a self-insert and being unrepentantly racist/sexist/creepy. I was pretty disappointed actually, because it was rather well written in terms of dialogue and imagery. But I was getting creeped out by the "sex scenes" in the story and was skipping over them, but there are a lot.
