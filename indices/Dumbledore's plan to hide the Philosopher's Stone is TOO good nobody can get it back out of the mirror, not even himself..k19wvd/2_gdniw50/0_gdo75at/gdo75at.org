It would require some really good convincing on Dumbledore's part, but I could see that being the case. Assuming that Harry getting the stone was a fluke because the stone/mirror were only supposed to lure Voldemort in, the mirror provably works as a means of safekeeping. It would further make sense that Flamel accepted death afterward if he had kept himself alive so long to protect the stone rather than out of fear of death; His old friend found a way to keep his extremely valuable and potently dangerous creation safely out of the reach of evil people, so he could finally rest?
