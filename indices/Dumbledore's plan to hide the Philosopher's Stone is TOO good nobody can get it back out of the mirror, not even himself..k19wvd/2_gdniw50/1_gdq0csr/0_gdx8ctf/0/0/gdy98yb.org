I wrote that on my phone so I kept it brief and dumb.

From a Watsonian perspective your position makes little sense. You aren't interpreting the text based on any actual clues, just applying your own headcanons to a story. There is nothing to ever suggest that it was not the real stone. I would venture to say that, based on my own headcanons, it is equally likely that Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel were old people who were ready to move on.

A huge theme of the series is accepting death. Everybody dies, and when it is your time you should welcome it with open arms. To do otherwise is an affront against nature (ie. horcruxes). I think that, interpreting the story from what we are given in the text, it is unlikely that the stone was not real.
