That's a good question. Now that I think on it, the stone being trapped wouldn't change the story in any immediately relevant way, but it would change the overall story of Harry Potter in some ways.

As someone else on this thread mentioned, so long as there's still a chance the stone could be recovered people will keep trying to do so. Such an endeavor would open up new avenues for world building and exploring the magic system, as the task would require either a better understanding of the mirror and stone to succeed; Or at the very least, a better understanding of how things can be put into the mirror in the first place.

In any case, keeping the stone in the mirror would also leave a useful tool or plot device available throughout the series. One almost as important if not more so than Griffindor's sword or the Elder Wand.
