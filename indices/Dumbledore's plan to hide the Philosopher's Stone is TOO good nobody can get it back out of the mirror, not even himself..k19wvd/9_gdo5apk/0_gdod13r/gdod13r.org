Long life through the Elixir so that he knows he will be there through the war to help Harry defeat Voldemort. Gold so that he can fund his anti-Voldemort group so that their primary focus can be on stopping Voldemort and the Death Eaters rather than Order of the Phoenix members essentially working two jobs. Maybe use the gold to bribe someone to be a Defense teacher so he doesn't have to take Umbridge.
