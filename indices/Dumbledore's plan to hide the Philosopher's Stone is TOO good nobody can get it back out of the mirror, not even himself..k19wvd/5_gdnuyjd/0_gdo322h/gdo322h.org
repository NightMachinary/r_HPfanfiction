Maybe it's bc Dumbledore put it IN the mirror, it's not just something you wish. Harry wished he had his family and Ron to stand out. Then, bc of the whole thing with Voldemort, Harry wished he had the stone, bc Dumbledore had hidden it there, god knows how, the fact that harry had pure intentions but wanted the stone made it come to him. It wasn't just a wish, the stone he saw in the mirror was actually there, it was real. It's the only thing i can imagine, really.
