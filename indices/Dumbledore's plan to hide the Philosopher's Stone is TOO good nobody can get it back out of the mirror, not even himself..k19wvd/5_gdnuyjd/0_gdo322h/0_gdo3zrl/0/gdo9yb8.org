If I might offer my two cents, I think the reason the mirror produced the stone in that way is simply because there were two people in the room. Consider what we know about the mirror:

It was made not just to show one's desire, but also to interact in unknown ways with whomever is observing it. It shows an observer things that aren't there as well as what is there, and does so in such a way that two observers won't see the same thing or be able to see what the other sees. It's capable of storing and releasing objects, but it only operates when it is observed and the mirror may do so in ways that ensure no observer but the one it's interacting with can see.

I think the mirror put the stone directly into Harry's pocket because it could not allow the other person in the room to see it carry out a prearranged function. If Harry had gotten there first it's possible the mirror could have been as blatant as spitting the stone out onto the floor straight through the glass for all we know.
