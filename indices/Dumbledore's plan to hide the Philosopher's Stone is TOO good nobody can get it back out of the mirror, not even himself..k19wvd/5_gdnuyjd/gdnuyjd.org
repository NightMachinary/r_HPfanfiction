It never made much sense. So the mirror is introduced as an object that shows you what you want most. At that moment he wanted nothing more than to find the stone and not use it but just find it. But why would that mean he actually had it in his pocket? Like his parents weren't actually standing right behind him? It breaks the previously established rules of the mirror.
