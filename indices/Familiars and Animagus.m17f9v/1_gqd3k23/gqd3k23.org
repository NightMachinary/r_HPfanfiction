Really? I swear every fic seems to include Animagus, at least for Harry and his minions, although it is often barely relevant to the plot. I have seen a few versions where Hedwig is his familiar, which is fun.

Relevant stories I can think of off the top of my head:

Alpha series linkffn(6389117) Slytherin Harry from year 1. Despite the title no cringe werewolf rubbish, it is about him bringing together all the students as friends. Harry-Ginny.

Linkffn(8769990) Second Chances Trilogy. Essentially gets adopted by the Greengrasses. Harry-Daphne, Hermione-Neville. All four get animagi which get some use and there is a bit of familiar stuff.

Linkffn(2488754) Second Chances at Life. Unfortunately third book abandoned after one chapter, but still worth reading. Basically original story loosely based on HP universe with some name dropping. Technically Harry main character but basically becomes complete OC. Gets a snarky snake familiar and Animagus is a central plot point.
