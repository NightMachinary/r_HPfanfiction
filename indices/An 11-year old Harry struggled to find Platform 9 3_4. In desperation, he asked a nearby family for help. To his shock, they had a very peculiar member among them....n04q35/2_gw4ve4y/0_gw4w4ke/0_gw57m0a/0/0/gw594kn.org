Yay! I need something to keep me busy make me feel productive anyways, so no problem! I have only one request if you go through with writing it: I was doing beta work for this guy's Haphne fic, and 3 chapters in he just straight up forgot about me or something. Stopped sending me stuff. I checked out the fic on ao3, and he was still posting. I sent him my revision of chapter 4, and got no response. I would prefer if that didn't happen again. So yeah, totally happy to help, just please don't ghost me lol.
