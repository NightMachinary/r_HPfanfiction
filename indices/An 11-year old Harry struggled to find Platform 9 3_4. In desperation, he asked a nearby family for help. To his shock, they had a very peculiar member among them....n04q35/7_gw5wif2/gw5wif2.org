This is good, but my headcanon is that there is Shoppe for the Youngest Witches and Wizards of Frederick August Otto Schwarz with direct import from the Ravensberg Hills in the Diagon Alley. The fun part is to imagine what kind of toys you would create if you had magic at your disposal. Talking slightly autonomous teddy bear is just too obvious idea, so my theory is that Paddington the Bear (from the fairy-tale) was just one such teddy bear who was lost to a Muggleborn child at the Paddington Station, and whole fairy-tale and book were just attempts to cover-up its existence by the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.
