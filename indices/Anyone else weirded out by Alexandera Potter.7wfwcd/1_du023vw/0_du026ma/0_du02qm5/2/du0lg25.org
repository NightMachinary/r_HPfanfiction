  There actually are kids who "date" at that age, that´s really uncommon, sex at that age is even more uncommon, but happens and I guess if you want to write about unhealthy relationships or uncommon sexual behavior without fetishizing it, it could be interesting if it´s researched well I wouldn´t touch it with a ten foot pole, but I can´t say it wouldn´t have some educational value.

I'm not going to argue about whether or not it's grammatically correct, because there are a bunch of fucked up rules that I couldn't possibly remember even as a native English speaker. However, I /would/ argue that hitting on three distinct points in a single sentence is probably not the best way to make a fluent-sounding statement. I'd try to hit them all separately.

"There actually are kids who 'date' at that age, but it's really uncommon - let alone sex, but I suppose it happens. I guess if you want to write about unhealthy relationships or uncommon sexual behavior without fetishizing it, it could be interesting so long as it's researched well. I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole, but I can't say it wouldn't have some educational value."
