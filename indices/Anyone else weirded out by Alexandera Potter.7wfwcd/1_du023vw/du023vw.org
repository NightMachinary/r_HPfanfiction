There actually are kids who "date" at that age, that´s really uncommon, sex at that age is even more uncommon, but happens and I guess if you want to write about unhealthy relationships or uncommon sexual behavior without fetishizing it, it could be interesting if it´s researched well I wouldn´t touch it with a ten foot pole, but I can´t say it wouldn´t have some educational value. But I wager that´s not a story like this.
