Yeah, I kind of noticed an explosion of posts from this "person". I've never heard "sock account" though--is that like what a boy of a certain age might use a sock for?? :D

When I started posting again, I checked out FFN's TOS and decided against posting there since I write about adults doing adult things and posted on AO3 instead. Then reading here and seeing what's recommended on FFN, I decided to give it a chance. So far so good, but if I get nuked, then I still have a home on AO3 which remains my primary depository and gets my first postings.
