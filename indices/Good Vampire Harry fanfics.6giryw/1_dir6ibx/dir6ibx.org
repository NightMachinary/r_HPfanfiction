The problem with vampires is the sexpot imagery that comes with it today. That's why I like the World of Darkness vampires. Some are pretty, yes, but many are not and all are inhuman monsters.

A good WoD vampire Harry would emphasize the inhuman nature over the supernatural pretty, and either make him like Remus: a tragic monster that tried to hold onto every bit of humanity he had, or they'd make him like Greyback: a monster that reveled in being a monster.

At least a WoD vampire Harry wouldn't care about sex. They can't have actual pleasurable sex. Their bite(barring Clan Giovanni) is pure pleasure, it's true, but that only increases their inhumanity imo.
