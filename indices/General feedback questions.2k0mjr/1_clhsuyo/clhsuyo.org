I really like the concept as a whole, but here are my silly thoughts/comments:

- "Soul Juice" doesn't bother me, it actually made me laugh. I love the idea that he absorbs characteristics of other's. It could make him a totally new person, it can make things really interesting!
- "Mr Evans" is so overused as an alias, it's annoying, but it's usually Harry that uses it, so I'll give you a pass. Tom Riddle could actually use his real name since Voldemort has forsaken it, but then he'd have to deal with Dumbledore so I realize that isn't possible, or maybe he could make an unbreakable vow to fight for the light or such...
- Since Tom is influenced by what soul juice he ingested, shouldn't he be really infatuated with Harry? I'm not encouraging you to write slash (I'm not a fan myself) but it could be funny to see Tom struggling against his unwanted crush.
- I also like a weak-to-start-with Tom Riddle. I don't like characters always being super-powered, it's boring. Has Tom Riddle lost past of his memory/knowledge as he is only part of Voldemort's soul?

I really want to read this asap and I hope you'll post a link to your story once it's done :)
