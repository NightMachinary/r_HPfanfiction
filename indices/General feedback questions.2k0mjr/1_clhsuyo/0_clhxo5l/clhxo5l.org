  Mr Evans" is so overused as an alias, it's annoying, but it's usually Harry that uses it, so I'll give you a pass.

I definitely agree. Its what makes me leery of doing it. Tho, it would be less about being Mr. Evans, and more him walking up to Petunia and trying to claim being her Xth Cousin. The actual Evans name would be less important. Can't decide if its better that Tom find himself unable to enter the house for reasons he cant fathom at first, or if the blood wards accept him because a little bit of Harry's magic is in what passes for his soul. Shaking hands with Harry and immediately pulling a Quirrell would be problematic.

I think I'd prefer to assume that Ginny is still too young to have /that/ kind of crush on Harry and just avoid the whole slash concept. I don't like reading it so I can't picture myself writing it.

As for /done/ ... I cant decide if its better to try and block it off year by year, or write it all as one piece. I feel like year 2 will, by its nature, be comprised almost entirely dialog, and Tom's thoughts and feelings on the topics, since he can't "see" who he's talking to. I wonder if that might come across a touch dry if done all at once, maybe handling it in flash backs as an already escaped Tom begins his machinations based on what he learned.
