Maybe not those exact people, but that's how I see the period analogous to book 2 happening. Riddle has no real sensory perception, no information but what he's told by the people writing in the diary.

Conversations with Ginny give him the beginnings of history post-1942, and the news that his elder self lost to a /BABY!?/ are you serious?

Some compulsion charms or even just basic manipulation later and he's in Harry's hands, discovering parallels in their history. Piecing together the role Dumbledore played in Harry's early life (does it count as bashing if the character making Dumbledore out to be a villain is explicitly and willfully twisting facts to meet his goals?) Weeks pass, and Tom wonders to himself how learning about his young nemesis became trying to help free him from a home life that he is all too familiar with.

After trying to teach Harry some form of magic, Tom find himself talking to some handwriting he doesn't recognize. He learns that the Miss Granger whom Harry speaks so highly of has questions about the theory behind what he was teaching Harry.

The a question about where he keeps his brains from Ron and a hurried distraction from that notion for all Tom's worth. But he finds himself in Percy's hands nonetheless. But he knows Percy's type. Afterall, he was Head Boy himself back in '43, clearly he did something right. Percy, have you considered the following to help your selection chances?

Round and round we go until Percy remembers in spite of the compulsion charms on the diary that he is afterall supposed to turn this into the DADA professor. A professor who abandons his post towards the end of the year under strange circumstances and is never heard from again.

--------------

I'll wholeheartedly concede that Riddle as he appears in CoS isn't terribly engaging, mostly by virtue of having very little screen time.
