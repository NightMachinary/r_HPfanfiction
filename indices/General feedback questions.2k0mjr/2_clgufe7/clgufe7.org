The idea I found most interesting out of all of that would be Tom picking up attributes of the people who write in the diary that he "leeches soul juice" (nice phrase, by the way) from.

I'm not quite as interested in the hypothetical plot you talked about, but that's my own bias talking; I never found Riddle to be that interesting of a character, on his own.

I could see being very interested in a restructured CoS where the diary gets passed around a little more (in canon, I believe Harry and Ginny were the only ones to actually write in it.) and Riddle ends up taking on the qualities of, I don't know, Percy Weasley, Romilda Vane, Hermione Granger, and Professor Lockhart.
