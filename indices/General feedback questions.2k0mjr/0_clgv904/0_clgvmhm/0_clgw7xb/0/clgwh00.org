I would assume, that as in CoS, he asks new people to identify themselves, or waits for them to say something identifying. Harry wrote his name in the diary seemingly without reason... it could just be a compulsion charm to write your name and say hello. I don't know if he'd be able to sense certain things at a short distance, roughly analogous to Harry's scar-aches.

After that I'd expect he can recognize the handwriting well enough to notice if he's talking to someone new, even before they succumb to the inexplicable desire to write their name in the diary.

Lucius may have gotten wind of the coming raid on Malfoy Manor and then distractedly found himself writing in the diary while bossing Dobby around to collect all the objects that suddenly need hiding. Probably complains about Dobby's willful behavior, how he's constantly twisting his orders in spite of punishments, planting the seeds in Riddle's mind for his insurrection.
