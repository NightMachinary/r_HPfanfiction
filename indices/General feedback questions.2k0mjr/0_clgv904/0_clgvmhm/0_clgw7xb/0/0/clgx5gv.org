Too many leaps beyond normal thinking.

When the diary was created, did Voldemort write in it to see what the soul inside was capable of? Did they communicate to one another in order to see whether it could gain life by simply being written in? Did Voldemort put a compulsion on it to make it /only/ able to get the chamber open so Voldemort doesn't have a younger self on the loose? Did Riddle break this compulsion when he's resurrected?

Anyway you've given me some great ideas to build on for when I get my series to CoS stage.
