I think the question has to be asked if Voldemort even considered the idea that his younger self could end up loose in the world. IIRC, all of his horcruxes were made with compulsions to use them. Wear the ring, put on the diadem, write in the diary. Possessing Ginny, an 11 year old, took 2-3 months. Full bore resurrection would have taken a 9 month school year. Given how he hid them, Its unlikely that any of them would have that kind of prolonged exposure to make the attempt prior to the diary. Voldemort may have just thought of them as anchors, and not really planned for anything beyond that.

I feel like the plot Riddle used in CoS was a result of his basically being a 16 year old who had been paused at the time when that was his big thing. He was The Heir of Slytherin, as proven by his finding the chamber and commanding the basilisk. When Ginny writes in the diary, he sees no reason not to resume that same behavior now that apparently 50 years have passed and people have let their guard down.

The Riddle we're describing has instead been stuck in an empty void for 50 years. His only contact with the outside word has been flashes of another version of himself. He's watched Voldemort's greatest hits reel so to speak in bits an pieces like Harry gets the dreams only with nothing in between to track how long its been. And perhaps he resents being left behind, watching his older self make some calls that he disagrees with... but his older self is winning, so its all right he supposes. Then there's a glimpse of a red haired woman defying him, a baby crying, a flash of intense pain... then NOTHING for 10 years. Maybe he assumed at first that his older self would come back for him, but he never did. He wonders what happened, but gets no answers.

Then, 10 years later, he feels someone nearby get ensnared in the compulsion charms and leaps on the chance for more information. From Lucius he finds out about his disappearance. Is he on his own now, the first and strongest of Voldemort remaining pieces? He needs more information, especially about what happened with this Potter /Baby/ that defeated the greatest wizard of all time? He sells Lucius on a plan to pass him to the Weasleys where Harry is staying.

It takes him longer than he expected to get control of Ginny, Lucius was easier than this... Lucius already wanted to follow his +orders+ ahem, suggestions. By the time he's close to doing so, he's realized that he feels not just stronger but /different/ somehow.
