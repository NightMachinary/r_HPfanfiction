Yah man - brainstorm this shit.

Create reader sympathy for the soul in the diary by writing Toms' perspective from the beginning - you could divide this into chunks of writing spread years apart and have his mental state deteriorate - /WHILST/ feeling the other soul (Voldemort) wandering around - sometimes getting flashes of emotion or something like dreams.

Then the splitting of the soul which he might be able to feel - eventually the soul splitting so much that eventually Tom can't feel any piece of soul and is completely alone (did this happen when Harry became a horcrux?).

Thus as the reader we are drawn immediately into a world of lonely darkness without a companion for years, making the reader sympathize more with Tom and understanding /why/ he wants to do the things he does.

How the diary can communicate to Lucius and persuade him (let alone tell the difference between he and other people before they write in the diary), I'll leave up to you.
