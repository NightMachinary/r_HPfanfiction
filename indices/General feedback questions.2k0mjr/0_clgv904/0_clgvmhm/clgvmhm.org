Regarding 'soul juice' I'm quoting [[/u/timeloopedpowergamer]] who knowingly or perhaps not has helped me refine my concept quite a bit over the past few days. And I read juice as it's sometimes used colloquially for 'power' aka /eckeltricity./

My only issue with Lucius writing in the diary is that I think if I were Tom, and in the position... I'd just omnomnomnom Lucius's soul, and avoid any risk of Dumbledore exposure. Though, now that I think on it, that could be a terrible plan, since that would leave me in the body of a man bearing my elder self's mark. A mark that would make it all too easy for said elder self to crush my newly won independence. I would know, I designed the bloody things.

That might be Ginny's cue. An unmarked member of a family I can manipulate Lucius into planting me on with promises of ruining her and that dratted Muggleborn Protection Act Lucius was complaining about. For a pure blood male politician my god can that man WHINE... why did my elder self tolerate the man?
