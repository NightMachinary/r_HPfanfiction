I like it, but I'm picky.

Soul juice sounds... icky. Personally, I think it also implies more corporeality in souls than what I would expect (/people drink juice etc.../).

/Thus,/ I would personally use other terms, such as:

- Diary soul is /tainted/ by soul /outpourings/ from those who write in it (going along with /juice/ line mildly)

- Ingest(?) / digest(?) / inhale(?) / absorb / leech the /excess off/ or sponge off / assimilate / consume / devour / imbibe / acquire / merely /learn/ or likewise be educated, taught, tutored, or perhaps indoctrinated.

*/ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS THAT SOUNDED COOL IN MA' HEAD:/*

- Tom finding out Harry is a horcrux allows you to play around with Harry either being trained or protected by imprisonment . . . OR (more likely) Harry rebelling against that imprisonment and demanding training instead.

- Assuming Tom was conscious and capable of existence and capable of thought when in the diary (as proven by him writing back) then we can deduce that he'll be pretty fuckin' angry at himself (other self) for not looking after him and/or not lightening his suffering (because, lets face it - he was a /book/ for /fifty years/).

- If Lucius had written in the book or Draco we could have him more interested in the political game, this would steer the book in interesting (for some) political directions.

Will add more thoughts as they come :D
