I really want to like this story, so I've been overlooking the grammar and spelling errors and the incorrect use of some words, but I just finished with the Yule Ball chapter, and I just can't keep going with it. I feel like it went completely off the remaining rail it was on here, and the characters who had all been a little out of character went full-on 'author-insert world breaking mode.'

Maybe if I had read it back when there would be some nostalgia, but I put quality at the top of the list these days, and this story doesn't have it, in my opinion.
