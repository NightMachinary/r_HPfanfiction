  I really want to like this story, so I've been overlooking the grammar and spelling errors and the incorrect use of some words, but I just finished with the Yule Ball chapter, and I just can't keep going with it. I feel like it went completely off the remaining rail it was on here, and the characters who had all been a little out of character went full-on 'author-insert world breaking mode.'

You hear this a lot, but this is really a fic where the writing and story improve dramatically over time. The best I can say for you is to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/27/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][this chapter]]. If this doesn't convince you to make it to at least chapters 12-18 (the best parts in my opinion) nothing will.
