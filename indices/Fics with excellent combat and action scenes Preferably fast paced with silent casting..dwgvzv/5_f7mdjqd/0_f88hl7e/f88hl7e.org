  Thanks for all the suggestions. Any other suggestions? I've read most of these actually. Magicks, The Lesser and the Dark Lord's Equal were my favorites. I found Lady Thief to be okay at best, but that's just my opinion.

I've got you covered on this. Big action and battles are my thing:

- linkffn(The One He Feared): some of the best depicted action scenes in the fandom, particularly in Chapter 4. Some of the best out there.
- linkffn(The Mind Arts): this fic has some problems, but there are a few entertaining action/battle scenes later on (Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, Harry vs Crouch, etc.).
- linkffn(Skitterleap): more or less just a straight out action scene for the majority of the fic. Fairly entertaining, if incomplete.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): lots of Harry training and learning to duel as a 6th year, with an interesting take on the Horcrux.
- linkffn(The Resistance of Azkaban): this one is full of action packed battles, as its one of Shezza's hallmarks. It ends fairly succinctly, if a little clumsily, but is definitely worth a read.
- linkffn(Delenda Est): again some issues with this fic, but there are some admittedly entertaining fights and action sequences here.
- linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): a bit of a mystery that revolves around an AU Harry, but there are 2-3 action sequences here that are truly stellar and captivating (and heartbreaking).

There is more, but that should keep you covered I think.
