  Does the title match the fic? Not really. I was blanking and used a random Hozier-based fic name generator. Hermione has a very healthy relationship with her body, even if it's not the same shape as it used to be. But nobody completely immune to societal messages, and sometimes that self-love needs a jump start to get going again.Lucky she's got a partner who's more than willing to help out.

  When Hermione agrees to go to Bulgaria with Sirius to help him in his hunt for Peter Pettigrew the summer after third year, she never imagined she would discover herself, make new friends, and fall in love with Viktor Krum. However, the golden warmth of summer has its shadows, and Hermione finds herself on the edge of something much bigger and more sinister than she ever could have imagined.

  It's been several years since Vldemort was defeated. Hermione now an acomplished healer is struggling with a marriage that no longer feels right and a desire to engage more with the muggle world. Dinner with Viktor leads her to start questioning what it is she wants and with who. When a slip of the tongue leads to divorce she finds herself taking a look at her life. Which increasingly leads her to look at the man who is still the only person she will fly with.Viktor has loved Hermione for years, but she loved another. So he became her friend and never confessed his feelings. Their relationship became a friendship that only grew deeper over the years. When they strike a deal over dinner he finds himself in England for the year and suddenly able to pursue the woman he loves. But is it right to do so when she is going through so much? Or is it the perfect chance for them both to build something new.

  Viktor had thought he might have loved her when he saw her by the Black Lake the first time, standing under a tree and trying, desperately, to make it look as if she wasn't waiting for him. But now? Now as she glanced up at him dwarfed by one of his old coats, snowflakes catching on her eyelashes... Now, he knew.
