i like the idea that curse breakers also serve as kind of repo people. This ancient family of arrogant purebloods have stolen great deals f goblin forged artifacts but good news! They've inbred themselves out of existence. Better get the cursebreakers into their evil castle to get it back.

How long do goblins live? I like the idea thata they will wait out entire bloodlines and never forget what they are owed. I also like the idea that they live very short, violent lifes.
