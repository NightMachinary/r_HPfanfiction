For me I see Gringotts as the place the ministry pushes all the jobs they don't want to do themselves. The Goblins can't have won every war since the can't use wands and the rebellions are a back and forth between the two nations, where every wizarding win the ministry forces the Goblins to take on more of its dull jobs like record keeping ( in exchange for pay) and with every goblin win they push one of those jobs back onto the ministry.

As for the friend of the Gobins thing, I also view Gringotts as the goblin embassy and as such feel that such titles could be given but only for very extreme acts in favour of the Goblins, such as betraying the ministry to help them in a rebellion.

To me the Goblins are a puppet or vassal of the ministry that has been given far too much power and that could now (if it wanted to) collapse the wizards economy to gain its independence, though it currently finds the status quo to be acceptable.
