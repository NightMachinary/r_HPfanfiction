Perhaps, but as can be seen throughout the magical world wands are not required for magic and simply act as a focus to aid in casting. I find goblins using it to simply mock magicals as rather strange ( though it is an amusing thought) since even they must see the benefit of easier access to more powerful and easier to cast magic, though it is likely that they don't care as much as the ministry think they do, especially since they have other arms in the form of melee weapons and their own species specific branch of magic.

While the Goblins have since proven to be a force to be reckoned with even without wands the ministry is still reluctant to return the right to them due to fears of how deadly they would be with them. Something the Goblins use to their advantage. During peace negotiations the Goblins always lead with the demand to utilize wands which causes the ministry to grant greater concessions than they would have done otherwise to try and avoid this.
