My personal headcanon is that Gringotts is a protection agency/business conglomerate for goblins. Since goblin culture highly values creation as a skill, the blood of master artisans is a vital ingredient in ancestry testing potions. After humans kept abducting and exsanguinating artisans, Gringotts formed as a protection agency and negotiated a deal to provide ancestry testing for a price. Most "goblin wars" consist of goblins hunting down someone "doing things the old way". Gringotts provides scholarships and apprenticeships for goblins in exchange for blood, as well as business connections. The stereotype about goblin greed stems from humans not realizing that the goblin they're meeting with isn't a member of Gringotts proper - they pay the goblin they're doing business with, along with paying the headhunting agency.

The vaults for humans arose when a particularly enterprising goblin realized they already have a fiercely guarded area and inheritance testing. Gringotts later began offering proper banking services, but those are entirely separate from the vault services. Most of the finance department finds the insistence on keeping all your money physically in a vault hilarious. Muggleborn families are read in after the first term of blood supremacy.
