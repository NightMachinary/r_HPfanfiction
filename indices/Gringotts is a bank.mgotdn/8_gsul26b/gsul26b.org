I like the concept of them doing inheritance tests. Maybe because they would rather the gold was moving and presumably making more, rather than moldering in a forgotten vault--or worse yet, being handed over the government entirely (isn't that what happens in the Muggle world? Abandoned accounts go to the government?).

AFAIK, the Wizarding World doesn't seem to have the myriad forms of advisors and service providers we do and thus it gets thrust on the goblins in a lot of stories. Experts in law (see all those will readings), providing private rooms and mediation services, specialists in everything from wards to rituals, etc, etc.

For the most part, I don't mind that so long as it's explained in-story and consistently used. I mind some of it a lot less if the goblins are charging, TBH. Fine, the concept of a Horcrux offends them? They'll destroy the Cup since it's polluting their vaults, but there will be a small charge for each one brought in--works for me. (I like a lot of the friendly goblins stories, but for a race that is so interested in the accumulation of wealth, I can't see them waiving that much. Lowering fees is more likely.)

In my own WIP, Harry gets lessons in finance from them, but offered to pay when he asked for them; they are charging him a fair (competitive?) price for private tutoring. They handle investments both Muggle and Magical, and he does have an account manager. I am running with a lot of tropes I mentioned above, but not relying on them very much. The goblins are not the only ones who can run an inheritance test, for example, but are considered the most reliable. A lawyer can handle will readings, but the great houses store their wills with Gringotts because the goblins can't be forced or intimidated into ignoring the clauses (and despite their love of gold, it's hard to bribe them). You can hire a private room or a ward expert (fearfully expensive, though) or business advisor. They do have international scope, but are not found in every part of the world, which can occasionally ease things but isn't a guarantee. They don't provide documents unrelated to the bank, so no coming up with fake yet valid Muggle IDs and passports, much less Wizardly ones. Oh, and a goblin healer did look at Harry's scar, but more in confirmation of what the other 2 had said. Not the normal thing, and Dumbledore is amazed upon hearing that, since he can only think of 5x a goblin healer was involved in human affairs, and 3 of them were in his history books.

[Although I toyed with a one shot where Harry was trying to find out what Gringotts could do for him, and it wasn't much. They did provide him with the name of a man who could make a complete set of documents with some interesting updating charms, though.]
