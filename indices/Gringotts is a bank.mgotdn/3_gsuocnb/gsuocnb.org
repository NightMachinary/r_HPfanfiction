Gringotts is a bank but goblins are not 'just bankers'. And seemingly, Gringotts is the representative front of goblins. So they can offer some side businesses for a hefty profit (not as part of the bank but as a third party negotiator).

To be honest, I like fics where goblins provide these extra services. And I totally love fics in which goblins take an active role (albeit in shadows) regarding the wizarding world. They are smart, proud and warrior minded.
