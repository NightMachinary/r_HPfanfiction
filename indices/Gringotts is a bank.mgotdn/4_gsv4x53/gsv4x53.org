The Knight's Templar were also a bank, or at least as close to one as could exist in the high middle ages: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Knights_Templar]]

They also, you may be surprised to know, did a LOT of things other than banking.

Like with many things, JKR really did not include enough information for us to be certain on anything. I don't really remember the goblins being mentioned outside their connection to Gringotts, so you could argue its the public front for the race/nation as a whole, in which case it would be a sort of part bank, part embassy. And you could do a lot of things, both officially and unofficially, at an embassy.

But even if we take it at face value and say that Gringotts is just a bank and nothing else, modern banks over a lot more services than just banking. Of course there is stuff like credit and loans, but also investment and holding, retirement plans, currency creation and exchange, and, most relevant to fanfiction, they can be executors of wills. Its completely reasonable that in a magical society this could expand to other services, especially if they are viewed as being a neutral or uncorrupt third party.
