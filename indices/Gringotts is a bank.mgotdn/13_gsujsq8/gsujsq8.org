1. Wizarding economics are stupid and frankly, nothing they do deserves the term 'Bank'
2. The very nature of a bank run by a certain race, that is primarily interacted with the world through the bank, that seem to live around the bank and not really elsewhere suggests there is much more to the Bank than just a bank. It kind of implies a lot more going on in the background.
