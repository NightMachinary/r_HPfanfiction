Well I could see one reason for an simplified inheritance test for one reason fees and taxes. Now assuming that goblin bank works the same way as an American bank they would make more money off an active vault with transfer fees, yearly vault tax, oh you wanna and and second name to the account here's a service fee, etc. Now if a vault is unclaimed then it can produce no more Revenue which makes it useless to the bank, but using an inheritance test the goblins could make that wizard pay more fees for having two vaults. I wouldn't see it a favor just gilded cage for the greedy and unsuspecting to fall into.
