The difference is that Gringotts physically stores gold. So if they do take a yearly fee for the storage and protection (which would be very reasonable), then there is nothing stopping them from just taking it from the vault directly -- until there is nothing left. At which point it's closed.They don't need to know or care about the owner for that.

And that is only if they don't have stipulations in their agreements that if there is no claim for a century, all the items inside belong to them. Which I could easily see, given the character and behaviour of Canon!goblins.
