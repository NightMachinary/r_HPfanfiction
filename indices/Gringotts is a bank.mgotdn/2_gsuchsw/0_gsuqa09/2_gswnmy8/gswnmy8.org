I don't even see the relation between banks and inheritance. Even ignoring that goblins have a different idea of ownership (goblin items are only loaned, so they'd love to snatch up anything that might be passed down) and that we /see/ who and what handles inheritances (Scrimgeour and the Ministry in HBP), banks have nothing to do with wills. They aren't lawyers.

It's one of the many strange FF tropes that I have no idea how they started, and how anyone thinking about it even for five seconds can consider this to make sense and use it in their story.
