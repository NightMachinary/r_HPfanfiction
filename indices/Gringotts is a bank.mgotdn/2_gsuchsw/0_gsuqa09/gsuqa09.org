But neither inheritance, or banking works like that.

You have a vault, and when you dies, it goes either to the person named in your will, and your closest relative, even if he has a different name. Just like the Gaunts were the descendants of the Slytherins, and inherited their fortune at a point. If someone dies without any close relative, there are still some farther relatives, or the Ministry could easily seize the goods.

Also, the Goblins own a bank, they sell Bank Vault. As long as you pay for your vault, they don't give a shit about what's inside. Assuming they could use the money from inside a vault to pay for it, an ownerless vault would be the best kind of vault for them, since it means money without having to either provide a service (just like the Gyms owners love the "New year, New me" clients that buy a yearly subscription and stop showing up after 2 weeks).

Also, I hate inheritance tests. I could understand if it was some kind of magical DNA test (/ok, both of you put a drop of blood in the bowl and . . . match, Sir, that's your son/), but every time it's the same drop of blood on a piece of paper that explains that Harry is the Heir of 50 Families with a 2000 words paragraph about how he is so rich and has so many palaces in cool place like Greece.\\
Not to mention the whole "You are related to . . . Ravenclaw". Greeeeat, like most Pureblood since we are all cousins, but it's not like it would bring anything. I am 99% sure I am a descendant of Charlemagne (like pretty much everyone in Western Europe), But even if I made and proved the blood relation, I doubt people would agree to give me the throne of France since :

1. The guys lived 1200 years ago and all of his possessions have already been passed around his descendants
2. Even if the Carolingien throne was still in place, I would probably be around 300 000 000th in the line of succession.
