I see you point, and it's true that Gringott could have some additional activites outside of "Selling Vaults".

I am personally not a fan of them being "Financial Advisor" because I think the Magical Economy is too small to support this kind of investing (and I like to keep the Muggle and Magical worlds separated, so no wizard can make a killing by buying Microsoft of Apple shares). I also think that the Goblin "hate" the wizard, and that giving them a direct control over your money present at least a 50% risk of them making the worst possible investment just to ruin you.

If I really had to create some additional activites for Gringott (outside of the vaults and the already presented Curse Breaking/ Tomb Raiding), I think I would make them pretty similar to the medieval banks :

- A change service (even if the Wizarding World seem to have an unified currency, it may be appreciable for people going abroad to not be forced to carry on themselves hundreds or thousands of Galleons)
- An intermediary service (we can put you in contact with someone able to help you . . . for a fee)
- Some "direct" investments (rather than using Wizards money, Goblins use their own money to become owner, or co owner of a company like a mine, or tree farm or maybe even a reserve for magical beasts, anything able to bring them money).
