Maybe not investment advisors but I go to the bank for more reasons than to get money. But I also could see goblins not going beyond "this is your vault, pay for it and we hold it secure" I just thought that some additional services wouldn't be completely nonsensical.

And I definitely see your point on inheritance tests. Maybe I've read this fics to often... Blood seems to have some significance in the magical world but realistically (if you can even say that in a world with magic) I definitely don't see the -drop blood on parchment and get a detailed biography, every magical power you possess and some weird magic blocks

Another person mentioned curse breaking but I'm really not sure about the goblins that aren't in Gringotts (should there be any in Wizarding Britain) and what their culture looks like.

And sorry I don't know if I can really bring my point across. I'm trying it for the first time in english.
