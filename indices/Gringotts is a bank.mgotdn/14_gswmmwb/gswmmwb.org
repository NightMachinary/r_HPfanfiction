It might be more accurate to say that goblins like to collect treasures (see the cursebreakers, as was pointed out). The "bank" -- more accurately, the storage & protection service, i.e. offering safe deposit boxes to store precious items -- then follows as a natural, but somewhat afterthought-y consequence.

Of course, this still means they don't do all the other nonsense they do in many FF, yes.

Funnily enough, if they /were/ a regular bank -- i.e., doing, for example, asset management (which they /don't/, no, you can't invest in a magical stock market) -- I'd be more inclined to be lenient, because if I trust some of my more wealthy acquaintances, the poor bankers doing the asset management for sizeable fortunes have a tendency to double as a personal secretary for spoiled bratty clients.
