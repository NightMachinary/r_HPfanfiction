Most of the time, goblin rituals are used to break enchantments, de-potion, or 'cleanse' a person of other magic. I believe people most people use Gringotts because it's hard to create a place you could do that without the Ministry knowing, which is the case in most fics. It simply comes down to convenience.

I am genuinely curious though, if they were to change their fics to not include these fanon jobs, where would they have to go to get these functions done?
