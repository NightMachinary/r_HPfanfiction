In my headcanon, Goblins have been providing banking service for sentient(magical) races because they have the right kind of mentality. I don't have a specific kind of it but something like this: Greedy but never outright steal, Rebel but never steal(seize) opponents' property, etc.

​

Sirius Black was able to extract a large sum of gold to buy Firebolt even though he was an escaped convict. Since the Gringott has been always the third party to the feud for thousands of years, they don't care whether Wizarding Government convicted someone or not. Others can do their own work, and Gringott just minds their own business.

​

Wizards use Gringott because they are largely free from Wizarding Governments' influence, and theft.

​

Gringott is producing Wizarding currency because Wizard magic cannot break their enchantment until now. Galleons are not just gold, but a currency that just happens to made by the gold. Wizards use galleons because they can forge, earn muggle kind of money so easily.

​

Gringott and other Wizards and Witches are largely forbidden to operate the business in the muggle world. It is more like 'don't get caught, but since Statute extortion of muggles are outlawed. This is to stop Wizards or other sentient beings from earn muggle money, buy raw materials, and wreak havoc in the Wizarding economy.

​

The only reason Gringott is granting muggle money to be exchanged at a seemingly crazy rate is because of the treaty. Goblins think forcing the poorly made paper to their beautiful coin is a blatant insult to their race for no good reason. Muggle loving Minister actually forced this after the rebellion because he wanted to insult Goblins and to show muggle parents that they are not actually considered useless... until magical children became an adult and realize reality.

​

Opposite to fanon, no muggle can set their filthy foot on the Gringotts. Muggleborn Minister tried to force the issue and almost induced rebellion. The idea is considered in the same context 'Centaurs can enter here, thus horse can enter here.
