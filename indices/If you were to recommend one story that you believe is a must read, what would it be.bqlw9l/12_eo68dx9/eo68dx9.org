Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

It's a must read because it's rather unique in the fandom. The story focuses on characters and how they deal with their disabilities and powers and still go on to achieve their goals. There's very little focus on conflict but when it does occur, it is both well written, emotional and hard hitting.
