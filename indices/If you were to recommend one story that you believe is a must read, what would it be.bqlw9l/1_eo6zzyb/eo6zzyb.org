linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is /the/ definitive time travel fix-it fic. It has a horrifying plot line and details just how wrong such a thing can go. Unrelentingly violent, gory and suspenseful, but oh is it written well.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is what I generally think of first when I think 'dimension travel'. It is dark (not nearly as dark as The Unforigiving Minute though) but has a lot of awesome humor and characters to go with it. Also very well written.
