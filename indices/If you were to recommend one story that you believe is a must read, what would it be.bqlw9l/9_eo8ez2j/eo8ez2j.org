linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) is a perfect read for everyone who likes likes a powerful, independed and strong willed Harry in combination with some side story about pureblood culture and a quite ingenious take on magic. The character depiction of some of the more important side characters is sometimes a bit linear and some characteral developments are not thet logical, which is probably the reason why it only has 2.5 stars at DLP.

What I really like about the story though, is how Harry gets motivated and and works his ass off to get the person he needs to be to beat Voldemort, as well as the fact that even though he is a lord and quite rich, those tropes are not that important for the main plot, just for his familial background.

By the way, just yesterday the author released chapter 1 of a complete reworked version of the story, so maybe get into this one as well, as he fixed some style issues.
