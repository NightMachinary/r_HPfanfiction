I always love to recommend linkffn(By Baker Street Station I Sat Down and Wept)

It's got everything that I want in a fanfic, because I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for about thirteen years. I read it throughout all of my formative years, and I've gone through every phase. Exclusively one pairing or another, exclusively gen, exclusively dark, any and everything, and this is my favorite story of all time. It's long, centric on Petunia Dursley in a very mature and exciting way. The plot is original and keeps me sucked in, the characters are believable and likeable even with all their flaws. The tag of Severitus can scare some Snape-haters away, but it really shouldn't. In this fic all of his flaws are on flat display. My only issue is that the updates are few and far between, but for such quality I can't begrudge the time.
