The number of HPMOR haters on this subreddit is absurd. If someone was indeed going to rec only 1 story, it would honestly be this one. It's the most popular harry potter fanfic of all time, and had an enormous influence on the broader community. There are /articles/ written about this story on serious websites! It has fanfics! Recursive fanfics!
