Don't. I have still haven't understood why this is the most celebrated story around. Truly, I don't want to be contrarian, but what the hell? It is overly long, plot is mostly missing, Harry is preachy as hell. Who is able to really enjoy it? Apparently, the world turned to the evil and this is the most successful fanfic of all time. Sad.

I don't have one particular story to read, and I don't think you should have it either. Read a lot and try to find a genre which you like. Why do you like it? Read that. Then read something different. You will find few stories which are good, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][The Sturgeon's Law]] is merciless: eighty percent of everything is thrash. And I think the number is higher with fanfiction stories.

Having said that, here is my ten randomly pulled stories which I have currently in my head. I prefer this is kind of semi-realistic (I call it Magicians' realism) stories from the normal life of wizards and witches. Good story, good characterization, good plot is a way more important for me than superpowers or glorious battles. So, in no order whatsoever:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][Series of stories about Petunia Dursley by mzzbee]] ... mostly as an illustration of what I talk about. This is mostly about adultery, trying to find oneself, repentance and reconciliation (hopefully, we are not there yet). Yes, there is some magic.
- linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian), but it could be many other stories by him (series of the relationship between Lavender and Mark, linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian;Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian;James and Me by Northumbrian)), but this is a good representative: yes, Harry is the main character, yes, there is a lot of action and a bit underdeveloped world of werewolves, but it is mostly the human story. Will they overcome their problems? Will other ones survive? Also a bit of mystery story.
- linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) ... this was originally side-story hidden inside of linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities), which is more mainstream Harmony-marriage-law story (but well written), but readers were so enjoying this side story, that the author developed it is as an independent thing. Yes, it is AU version of the JKR books (AU from the winter of HBP), but suddenly it is more really underdeveloped (by JKR) story of Percy Weasley and his life outside of the Harry story. And again, yes, there is war and drama, but it is mostly about him, overcoming his insecurities and developing a relationship with his future wife (and yes, it is my firm headcannon, Audrey Weasley is a muggle).
- linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) ... yes, it is mostly just a retelling of the book story with Harry being brought up by Grangers and him being an animagus, but it is really not just the same thing. It is more story of all those people who are trying to work together (contrary to the books, where Harry is due to his experiences, almost paralysed by distrust to almost anybody) and the author is making his heroes to work with common sense and not using silly behaviour to keep the story float (really? Going for the midnight duel with Draco Malfoy? Which idiot would do that? Second task of the Tournament where viewers just look at the surface of the lake?). The best part is without question the third year.
- linkffn(Exile by bennybear) ... the best Draco-after-the-war I have ever read.
- linkffn(Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here) ... this is in that something-completely-different field: I have never read a fanfic story like this. This is actually a tragedy (like the Greek Classical ones) about fate, heroism and sacrifice. Yes, there is magic, but it is mostly a human story.
- linkffn(Pecan Pie by Arpad Hrunta) ... again something completely different. Just a sweet one-shot, mostly to mention the author, who is the master of writing short stories like this.
- [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=9605][Rows by Antosha]] ... similar in style to the previous one (and these two authors are very similar in their best things, which confuses me a lot): what if Ginny just couldn't take it any more (post-HBP), and she goes to the biggest adventure of her life: driving a muggle train to the Little Whinging to talk with Harry? Again, a sweet romantic one-shot.
- many many others
