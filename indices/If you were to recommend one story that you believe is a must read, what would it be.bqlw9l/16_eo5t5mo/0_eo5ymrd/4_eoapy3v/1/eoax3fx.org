  The year is CE 476. Cenau Redhair is a very long way from home, and she's in prison. While she doesn't want to die in front of the crowds at the Flavian Amphitheatre, escape seems impossible. Does her friend Rhea the falcon have a plan? This is a story of the early days of magic, long before the founders.
