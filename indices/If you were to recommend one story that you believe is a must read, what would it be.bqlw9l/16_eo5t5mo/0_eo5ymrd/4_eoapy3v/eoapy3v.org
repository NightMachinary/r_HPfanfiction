I forgot to add one more as a representative of the historical fanfiction, by which I mean stories outside of the extended FBWFT+HP timeline (basically whole the twentieth century). Most of them are not that good (just a transplant of story in present to the past: princess Hermione must marry unpleasant prince Draco to save her family's fortune; oh well), but some are great. Actually, I'll put here three of them:

- [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]] ... as far as I know the best representative of the subgenre.
- linkao3(Bloodstone by Northumbrian) ... this looks like a story from the Roman era, but it is mostly just filling for the present time stories of the author (I think, it has not been completely revealed yet in linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian)). However, it is nice and sweet story nevertheless.
- linkao3(7460772) ... I really like this one: great transposition of the magical universe to the Middle Ages where things were slightly more rough, great portrayal of the Franciscan monk struggling with his faith, good original story.
