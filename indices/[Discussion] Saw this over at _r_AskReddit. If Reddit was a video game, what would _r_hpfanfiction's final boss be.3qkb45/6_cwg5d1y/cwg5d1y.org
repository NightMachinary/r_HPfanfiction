Depending on the path you take, the Grand Army of DLP, Spelling Error's And Grammer Error's, OCs, Ron Weasley, Dumbledore, everyone but Harry, a Mary-Sue, Emma and Dan Granger, Ginny and Molly Weasley, Slytherin, Gryffindor, or anti/pro LGBTBDSMKITUYTBIENSHFTERBDTAZLOEMPREG activists. It would be an RPG on the scale of Skyrim, or Balder's Gate, or whatever it was called.
