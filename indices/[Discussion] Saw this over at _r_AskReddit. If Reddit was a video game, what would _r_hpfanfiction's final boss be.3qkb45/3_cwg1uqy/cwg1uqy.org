A Rational!Mpreg!Harry. Special moves include:

- Long Range: blasting you with his luscious emerald eye-orb lasers while in his rainbow-phoenix animagus form

- Melee: quite literally using Ron as a flail/morningstar

- Defenses: pointing out your biases

- Psy attack: describing the mpreg birth process

 

Just spitballing here, but the first mission would be an Escort, helping someone with a [FIC REQUEST] /"Can you help me find a H/HG fic I read 10 years ago? It's the one where Harry has a katana and can fly"/
