OMG; you know that awful story people always complain about and debate is is so awful on purpose or was the author just really that terrible? I made the mistake of starting to read that katana story. O.M.F! I can't tell if the author is a mad genius, or just really unable to write an original story so just regurgitating every awful tropey plot for Dumbledore-Weasley haters. Literally in the middle of one of the chapters they stuck in an AN about how they were too lazy to describe a scene. Later on, some of the dialogue is "blah blah blah." Not...sure...why...I...can't...stop...reading....GAHHH.
