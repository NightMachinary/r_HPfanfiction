This is one of the most encouraging things to read, funnily enough. Writing folks are always out to prove themselves, so being told that my project is /too difficult/ is a challenge and a tease all in one.

Given your advice, it definitely makes sense to work extra hard on the beginning. After all I won't be given a second chance in selling the story, right? It's not like I'll be able to rely on the inherent appeal of already existing characters like Sirius or Snape.

The stakes have never been higher.

Cheers! :)
