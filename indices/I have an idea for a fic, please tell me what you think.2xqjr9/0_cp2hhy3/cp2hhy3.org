  All the protagonists, antagonists, and otherwise major characters are OCs.

The difficulty curve gets exponentially steeper if you do this. Alexandra Quick is pretty much the only story I can think of with an all-OC cast that's worth reading. Granted, it's stellar.

You have to have a really, really good grasp of storytelling - phrasing, pace, character development, tension - to hook people. I would give it a shot, because it sounds like you've thought the idea through and it's intriguing enough, but for me, the story would have a very short leash.

If you do this, I'd recommended you spend a lot of time making your first 500 words incredible.
