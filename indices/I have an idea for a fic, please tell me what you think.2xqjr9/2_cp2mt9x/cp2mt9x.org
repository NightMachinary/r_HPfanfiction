So whats the objective of this 'organization'? I mean if they plan to reveal the magic world to the muggles why waste time telling the aurors that? why not do it right away?

As for OCs if you can write interesting characters it really doesn't matter if they are OC or not as most canon characters are almost always OOC anyway
