Since it's taking place only a few years after DH, have you thought about trying to take advantage of characters who technically exist in canon but who have no real characterization? It might lend a little bit of familiarity for the reader. Not that you should to star Bill Weasley, but there are tons of characters in the books who could be kind of a "name brand."

The thing is that the wizarding world is very small and insular. It's almost unrealistic to create a 3D large-scale story that takes place a few years after DH and spends a lot of time talking about the auror office and the wizarding community/world without coming into contact with characters we know. For example, Harry Potter is basically a VIP, he would still be hugely relevant to the magical community as a symbol and just as a celebrity. The D.A. and the Order are already in various parts of government especially the Auror Office, Kingsley is supposed to be the Minister of Magic. So to be honest, if you got through an entire story without mentioning or including any familiar characters even at the tertiary level, it would actually seem unrealistic.

It sounds as though this is largely unrelated to the Death Eater movement, but there might be a few former Death Eaters who would love to make Kingsley's government a bit uncomfortable, even if they don't want to see the wizarding world exposed.
