I have always dreamed about a story, where Harry wouldn't be such an idiot going only for the fast first kiss, but he would decided to stick it out with Cho until she gets through her grieving for Cedric. I know, it is unrealistic (and poor Cho was meant by JKR just a stepping stone on his way towards Ginny), but when the seventeen year old can put down his life for others, is it more realistic than him staying and supporting beautiful crying girl?

Harmionians are angry about the perceived bad treatment Hermione got in HBP, but nobody stands for the poor Cho Chang.
