I think canon Dumbledore didn't KNOW that Harry was going to survive, but was desperately HOPING that if he set things up just right he MIGHT manage to arrange things to Harry wouldn't actually have to die.

Unfortunately, that meant having Harry spending some time thinking he had to die.... but, well, what's worse: Having a seventeen year old boy thinking he's going to die and be wrong, or having a seventeen year old boy thinking he's going to SURVIVE and be wrong?
