It's not directly about Dumbledore, but does canon ever say Sirius never had a trial ? I mean, it's not like he could not be sent to jail with one : ●We dont know who set the Fidelius on thé Potter's Home, but it could potentially be Lily. Bill cast one on his home for example. So Dumbledore may not know the identity of the secret keeper ●Absolutely everyone though Sirius would be the Secret Keeper for the Potter. It's because it was such an obvious choice that they chose Peter. So when the Potter are betrayed, it's normal for everyone to think he did it. ●When Sirius is finally found (like 5 days later ), the rare witnesses only heard someone else accuse him of betraying the Potter before before an explosion killed 12 people (13 if you count the new guy ). ●As Rowling say (though not in canon ), the Veritaserum is not infaillible (or it would make a very boring plot device ). As Voldemort 's suspected right hand man, Sirius was though to be talented enough to fool the potion. The fact that he had 5 day before his arrest to modify his memories, put himself under the Imperius or any other defense make the potion even less usefull.

All these elements make Sirius extremely suspectfull, and we see in canon that Death Eater could not be present at their trials (Bellatrix and co were only brought to hear their sentence for example). Maybe Sirius got the same treatment, or was though to be too dangerous to have have it, but that doesn't mean he never got a trial. I'm sick to read this cliche in all the manipulative Dumbledore.

As for Dumbledore himself, even if I think he was clean in Sirius sentence, and even if Lupin was not forthcoming with informations, I wonder why he never though to check if Sirius used secret passages to sneak in the school, especially when it seems he created one of these passages.
