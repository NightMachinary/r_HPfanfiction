  Did canon Dumbledore know Harry would survive, and keep that theory from everyone including Snape who thought he was setting Harry up to die?

Absolutely. If Harry hadn't thought he was going to die, he wouldn't have protected everyone in Hogwarts during the second half of the battle. Because he did, no one was killed by Voldemort and his death eaters because Harry basically made a magical bargain with Voldemort to die for them, just like his mother did for him.

Dumbledore probably didn't know that's what would happen, but he knew the way Voldemort thought, and he maybe knew the way prophecies work or some other theories that made it likely.
