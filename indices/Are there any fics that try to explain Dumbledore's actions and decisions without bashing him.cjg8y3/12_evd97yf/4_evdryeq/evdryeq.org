I mean... using that kind of logic in a magical childrens book is kind of silly. It's like judging a cartoon's physics-it just doesn't work. You need to carefully pick and choose what scenes to judge a character on; because consistency is /not/ something you'll find here.

Had Rowling made something for a more mature audience, I doubt the protagonist would've been dropped on a doorstep. That's horrible; but children certainly won't catch that pesky little detail. And so she did it the magical way, akin to a bird dropping off a baby. Because procreation doesn't exist.

From Book 6 and beyond I can't really defend anything though; every one was more a plot device than a person at that point. And the audience was more mature then.
