That sort of thing happens in real life... it's in fact depressingly common. I've read about babies left on doorsteps, and of people who have left them there, and it's a very sad situation... But the thing is, there IS a sort of logic behind it, even if it's a logic born out of desperation.

Most often, it seems, you have a young mother who knows she can't take care of her baby. She doesn't have the money, maybe not a job, maybe she's sick. She doesn't have any friends or family members who could take care of the child. The only chance the baby has to survive is if she gives it up. But she's desperately afraid that if she goes to the authorities and tries to put the baby up for adoption, she'll be shamed and rejected and told to just do her duty as a mother and keep the child. And she's not sure she'll be strong enough to insist.

So she does the only thing she can think of: Abandon the baby on the doorstep in the middle of the night, when nobody can see her. And then leave. Because surely NOBODY who finds a helpless baby on a doorstep, all alone and with no mother to take care of it, could POSSIBLY be so heartless as to refuse taking it in?

Dumbledore of course isn't a young mother, but I can see there being a similar reasoning: He knows that Harry's best chance for survival is with the Dursleys, but he's afraid that if he shows up in person with him Petunia will just slam the door on him and refuse to have anything to do with her nephew. And then the blood protections will fail and Harry has lost his best chance for survival. But if Petunia finds Harry on her doorstep, with a letter that the boy has nowhere else to go, surely that'll evoke her pity and she'll take him.
