No recs to offer, just a reply to your Sidenote:

Dumbledore didn't know that Harry would survive. He guessed, and he bet on that guess for no other reason than his 'guesses are quite good'. He suspected about the Horcrux in Harry after the diary incident and believed that since Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection ritual that it was very possible for Voldemort to act as Harry's faux Horcrux (thereby ensuring Harry's survival). And I'm only going by the books on this b/c I've never actually watched any of the movies beyond the 2nd one.

BTW, since I don't have my books on hand, I've been referencing these sites to be sure I'm remembering things correctly:
