I read an excellent fic that once explained the blood protection in more detail and justified why he was sent to the Dursleys.

So Voldemort had shown, at least to Dumbledore, that he had some way to live up to his nickname and escape death. Dumbledore was an old man, and it wasn't a guarantee that he'd live to see the return of Voldemort. So he turned to the blood protection. He reasoned that 10 or so years of mistreatment was nothing compared to a lifetime of potent protection against Voldemort. Harry's kids would have presumably inherited this protection as well, and so there was a possibility of creating a dynasty of wizards and witches whose blood was Voldemort's bane.

Of course in canon, Voldemort successfully returned while Harry was still in school instead of biding his time for decades, and he subverted the blood protection by using Harry's blood to create his new body. But this explanation still helped convince me that it was reasonable for Dumbledore to make the decisions he did. Harry arrived at Hogwarts alive, if mistreated and skinny.
