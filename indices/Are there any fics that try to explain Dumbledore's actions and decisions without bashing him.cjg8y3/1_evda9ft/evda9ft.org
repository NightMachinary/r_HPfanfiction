Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

Seriously.

From Dumbledore's memories; Moody on Karkaroff:

#+begin_quote
  "Crouch is going to let him out," Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. "He's done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he's got enough new names. Let's hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors. "

Crouch sentenced his son and the Lestranges to Azkaban. Crouch questioned Karkaroff and Ludo Bagman. Crouch threw Sirius in Azkaban without a trial. Ergo, Crouch let Lucius and Co. go free.

  Did canon Dumbledore know Harry would survive, and keep that theory from everyone including Snape who thought he was setting Harry up to die?

Pretty much. Also GoF:

  "He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's," Harry told Dumbledore. "He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too. And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face. "

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.

Then Dumbledore in DH:

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
