Not any specific fics, but if I were to do that, I would try this:

“I wasn't the Chief Warlock at that time. My relationship with the Ministry was already strained due to me running the Order of Phoenix. I couldn't have forced a trial even if I had wanted to. On the other hand, Sirius Black's betrayal was too painful for me to confront him directly. I took his confession for fact and didn't pursue this matter because of my personal cowardice.”

“I had known that Dursleys weren't treating you right. I thought several times about removing you from that place. But after what had happened to the Longbottoms, when they were betrayed by leaks inside the Ministry, I just couldn't risk moving you out of the protection of the Blood Ward. You see, Lucius Malfoy has made many inquiries about your address over the years. Walden MacNair has tried a few times. Corban Yaxley did several times too. Their attempts were all thwarted for whatever reasons. Only last year, when Minister Fudge turned against you directly, did your home location become finally compromised. Even then, the Dementors could have never entered the premise itself. You were surprised outside your home.

I have several instruments monitoring your conditions on this shelf. I was indeed prompted several times to take actions, but your condition somehow improved afterwards.”

“Yes, the Stone was both a trap and a test. If you had not intervened, Voldemort would have either made off with the Stone or gotten caught by the Mirror.”

“I tried to ask Miss Warren several times, but she absolutely refused to speak to me. Without knowing the cause of her death, I couldn't investigate further and clear Hagrid. I didn't know that Basilisks could cause petrification if its gaze was redirected, so I ruled out a Basilisk very early on, although I should have known that the king of snakes must be a Basilisk.”

“But I have no excuses for my atrocious actions during your year 6. I should have explained everything to you in a single day. I could have much better prepared you for this dangerous mission. It was completely wrong for me to risk the lives of so many students, just for the faint hope of turning a would be murderer and terrorist. Perhaps the only explanation is that I underestimated to what great length a desperate teenager was willing to go.”
