It was also meant as a serious intro... until I figured out that I would have had to start at the very beginning to make it work.

I also realised that convincingly writing 11-year-olds with superpowers being thrust into an alien world that has more in common with Mogadishu than with London is really, really hard for me.

So this is sadly staying a one-shot for now, if only because starting at the very start of philosopher's stone would be... difficult.
