  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...
