Linkffn(Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death) for Harry Potter/MCU

The start of the premise is that Death from the HP universe resurrects Black Widow after her death on Vormir (Avengers: Endgame), plonks her on Halloween 1981 in Harry's room just after Voldemort had offed himself and asks her to look after Harry as he's in danger. She takes Harry and runs. Death from the MCU universe then resurrects the just deceased James and Lily Potter to fuck with her counterpart (and everyone else).
