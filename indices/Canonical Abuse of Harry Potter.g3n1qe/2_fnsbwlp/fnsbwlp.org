I do agree with most of this, just have a few comments. My main criticism is that the author comes to conclusion not based on what is said in the books, just his own opinions. For example, this passage:

#+begin_quote
  We're never told explicitly that Vernon gave Harry a beating once he physically “dragged Harry upstairs,” but at this point, given the context provided in Philosopher's Stone when Vernon hit Dudley “round the head,” it is not a mere inference, but a logical deduction---it would be more than reasonable for us to safely conclude, with certainty, that Vernon did hit Harry a few times, more than a few times really---i.e. that Vernon gave Harry a beating. There really can be no doubt that Harry had bruises and welts after that incident. Only the most obtuse Dursley apologists would suggest otherwise.
#+end_quote

Um, yes, there can be doubt about that. All that happens in the book is that Vernon takes Harry upstairs. No mention of a beating, no mention of pain, nothing. My view of the abuse is that Vernon was no stranger to slaps around the head, pushing, grabbing and throwing, etc. We see this even when it comes to Dudley, as the author observes. However I don't believe there were prolonged “beatings” as such - there's nothing that suggests that in canon.

Furthermore I have a comment on this passage, discussing Harry's remark about ducking Vernon in the career advice chapter of OOtP:

#+begin_quote
  There is another critical piece of dialogue in Order of the Phoenix, that is definitive evidence that Uncle Vernon had hit Harry on more than one occasion---perhaps the only time that Harry let slip to Hermione just how awful things were for him at the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

Why is Ron excluded here? He's also present for this conversation. Yet the author paints this as Harry confiding in just Hermione. Just an observation that tells me that the author is comfortable ignoring canon when it suits his narrative.
