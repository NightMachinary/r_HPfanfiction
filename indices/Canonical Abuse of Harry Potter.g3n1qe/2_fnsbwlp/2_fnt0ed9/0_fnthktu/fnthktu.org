I'll go with C. It's mentioned several time in canon that the Dursleys believe that Dudley is the most perfect child in the world who would never even hurt a fly. And we learn from book 4 that they are ready to ignore the truth since it took them a very strongly worded letter (and probably a meeting) to admit that no, Dudley was not just big boned, but was fat.
