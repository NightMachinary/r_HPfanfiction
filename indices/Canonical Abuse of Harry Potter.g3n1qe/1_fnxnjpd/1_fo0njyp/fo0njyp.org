I loved and will probably always hold fondness for JKR's HP despite the faults, but the handling of child abuse has always been a major low. When I was young, there was a point she was claiming that it wasn't really neglect/abuse (or maybe I misunderstood).

In any case, the abuse never being addressed was problematic for me. There is an expectation that children know what is wrong, after all if not at home then school or the community says it, right? In reality, this is not always the case particularly given cognitive dissonance.

One of the key reasons I didn't tell anyone about being abused was because JKR was my idol and she never thought anything was wrong - after all, nothing happens when the window bars are brought to the Weasleys or Molly sends him food, etc. As a child, I wasn't able to make the cognitive hoops about why they might not have taken it seriously.

Dozens of times I started to pen an letter or later email to JKR only to destroy the evidence. I was terrified I would never get a response or worse she would tell me that what was happening was right based on her writing.
