Luna, dear;

Never base your perceptions of what's correct and good or what's wrong or 'improper' on anything that comes out of JKR's pen!! Mein Gott, she has an entire generation of sheeple believing the psycho-babble that she came up with to explain Severus Snape's behavior towards Harry and most of his other students!

The psychology behind Snape's bullying points more towards a *spoiled child* (ala James Potter) who grew up terribly spoiled by aged parents, became a bully through having little or no empathy or compassion for anyone not blessed with his gifts of love, health, and wealth. If said overindulged child/teen is suddenly *thwarted* in their life and/or desires (becoming suddenly orphaned & impoverished; being blocked from the pursuit of their desired profession; being rejected by their 'love interest' and/or bested by their rival in love, etc.), THEN one could reasonably see the antecedents to the character of Severus Snape. But NO: JKR *chose* to frame the characters of James Potter & Severus Snape using the old EGOTISM of *CLASS* stereotypes:

James Potter: Wealthy, high-class, *Pureblood*, Gryffindor Golden Boy, from the *right-side* of the tracks="Hero"!\\
Severus Snape: Impoverished, abused son of an alcoholic 'muggle' father & ineffectual, beaten-down Pureblood mother, Slytherin, from the *WRONG-side* of the tracks="bad boy" attempting to find redemption! WTH?!

I'm sorry, but I could go on and on about all the things that Rowling got so wrong that it would be laughable if there weren't so many people who've drunk her koolaid and subscribe to her brand of pseudo-psychology!

That's what made me so g-d ANGRY with her and her empire: It's built on the blood, sweat, tears, and bodies of children like you and millions like you who now seem to think that the kind of home life that Harry was *forced* to live through--however 'toned-down' it was--was "okay"!!

IT'S */NOT/* /OKAY/ and Rowling better like it hot where she's headed for her "next great adventure", cuz it actually says in the Bible, *“*But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and /that/ he was drowned in the depth of the sea.” (*Matthew 18:6, King James Bible)* I find her works *very* offensive towards children!

Sweetie, you're not in the wrong about how you perceived and experienced your childhood! Talk to someone or join a group near you or even online! You need to be heard, acknowledged, and validated! Only then can you start to heal!

Take care and may God Bless YOU!!
