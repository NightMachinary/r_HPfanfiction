Aw, thanks. Luckily I'm an adult now with my own view on life and the spectacular NHS to thank - meaning I was able to get intensive support without the involvement of my parents, before I turned 18 and still have support now, though of a different kind.

I suppose in many ways it could be a contrast between Snape and Sirus, like Voldemort and Harry.

Even if most abused/bullied people don't go on to become Snape's, a notable minority do. Broadly speaking the psychology is sound, it's just that it's very stereotypical framed. It can't have helped that she had Dumbledore force him into a teaching position when he obviously lacked skills, temperament or interest in it.

It doesn't excuse what he did, but really he's there as a villain-with-a-twist so none of the sensible things (like teacher training or interviews with student involvement or, idk, staff performance measures) were there.

In a world outside her requirements, I imagine that Snape would have gone on to be a socially isolated lab worker, perhaps creating potions for St Mungos or a shop and lived a quiet, if snarky life.
