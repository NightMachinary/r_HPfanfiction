THANK YOU!!\\
I've ranted and raged for *years* about Rowling's cavalier attitude regarding the abuse of not just Harry but multiple characters in the series! My objections and treatise on the subject have been dismissed and 'hand-waved' away by those who don't want reality intruding on their *worship* of JKR!

In 2005 my husband's adult nephew came to stay with us and he had the HP series, up through book 5. Now, I've been a voracious biblioholic of mostly Fantasy & Sci-Fi, since I was 6 or 7 years old, so of course, I wanted to read what all the hype and hoopla was about these books.

I got a bad feeling from the opening paragraphs: Who, in their right mind, leaves a 15-month old *toddler* on a doorstep, in the middle of the night, WITHOUT even ringing the doorbell or in any way alerting the occupants of the house, in NOVEMBER, in ENGLAND, in *1981*?! A toddler is *walking* by 15 months!\\
The sleazy and furtive way that Dumbledork slunk towards the house had me on high alert already! Right up until I skimmed through book 6 (when I finally gave up on reading this highly derivative [as a long-time reader of Fantasy and former Children's book reviewer for my Public Library, I recognized multiple characters, scenes, and sometimes dialogue that were nearly direct *steals* from other books and stories! I've come to realize that Rowling has produced the highest-paid piece of crossover FANFICTION in history!] appalling waste of my time!) I thought that the MOB would turn out to be the actual *villain*; to paraphrase Frodo: He "looked fair, but felt foul"!

As I read through the 1st five books, I kept trying to 'suspend my disbelief' and tell myself, "It's GOT to get better!" But no! Rowling & her publisher were able to SELL unmitigated, unremedied, and dismissed CHILD ABUSE of *multiple characters* to a fantasy-starved public! I believe that at any other time in history, she and they would have been run out of town on a rail! I still can't believe that "Scholastic" had anything to do with these books!

These were first published, in the U.S., in 1998! My God, the U.S. public had become aware of and been on a 'witch-hunt' about Child Abuse since the 70s and here was this author making money off the suffering of a child throughout a *series* of books!! WTF?!?

My disgust finished any interest in "Harry Potter" until, in 2012, I accidentally began reading a fanfiction story in my current favorite fandom, that crossed over with "Harry Potter". My first inclination was to exit immediately, but something was truly different about this interpretation of canon HP: This author didn't attempt to 'gloss-over' or dismiss Harry's abuse nor the bullying ongoing at Hogwarts! This writer was willing to point out and fix many of the plot chasms and horrors extant the deeply flawed original! I was in *wonderment*! ;D

HPff has become my favorite genre of FanFiction for just that reason! There are *thousands* of magnificent writers, toiling away for *nothing*, who write so much better than Rowling and who tirelessly attempt to write/right the glaring *wrongs* of the "Harry Potter" series!

Thank GOD!!

Thanks for reading!

Take care and stay safe!
