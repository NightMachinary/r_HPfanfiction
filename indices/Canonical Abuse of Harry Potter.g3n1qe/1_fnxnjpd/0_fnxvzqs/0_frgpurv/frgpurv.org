I think this is part of the reason why many angry harry, runawat harry, Manipulative dumb as a brick or evil dumbledore, and other fanfics are made.

Because it makes no sense at all. Dumbledore could have made a safe house for the summers with the fidelius charm, or visited somedays when Harry was young, but blood wards are supposed to be better somehow? even after almost getting eaten by dementors?

There is a severe neglect of an abused child, and the main book do not show a healthy way to confront it. Just a take it all and ignore it.
