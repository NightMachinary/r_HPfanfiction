PS ;)

From the time I was 3 years old, I grew up in a truly dysfunctional, abusive alcoholic home where */I/* was the "problem" and thus the designated 'hittee'. My mother and step-father were both severely alcoholic, my mother also abused prescription medications--both hers and my epileptic brothers.

My mother was the more abusive of the two, but she'd rope my step-dad into 'double-team' beating us kids when he'd get home from work late and after he'd had a few drinks! She never told him that she'd already beaten me/us for whatever wrong-doing I/we'd committed that day, so we'd get woken up to be beaten with the belt, a stick, and/or fists; whatever happened to be handy. I remember being backhanded *in my highchair* so hard that the chair went over backward! Etc., etc. Sorry. :(

Anyway, reading the HP books brought back a lot of bad memories that I only thought I'd dealt with, long before. It was one thing growing up in the 60s in the family I did, but to read about an abused child written about so callously and dismissively in a purported "Children's book"? That's what set me on the warpath against Rowling and books!

Did I read books about abused children as a child? Sure I did! BUT those children, such as "Jane Eyre", "Tom Brown", and "Margaret Thursday" were ALL eventually rescued and/or ended-up having loving mentors/protectors thus they gave me HOPE! Their authors didn't thrust them back, BOOK AFTER BOOK, into the same abusive homelife and horrific, bullying school life!

Had I read these books when I was a young child, I might have tried *harder* to kill myself to escape my childhood! These books did the opposite of giving me the hope of a happy childhood!

Shame on you, Rowling; shame on you!

I felt compelled to explain that it wasn't as a 'disinterested' 3rd party that I feel such disgust with Rowling's crap! I just haven't had much of a 'forum' outside reviews and commentary on fanfiction, to "vent my spleen"!

Thanks again.\\

BTW, Just in case any of y'all DON'T know, Rowling said in an interview that she was "forced" by her Editors to "tone down" the abuse because she was much more descriptive and wanted to sell to a younger audience! :P
