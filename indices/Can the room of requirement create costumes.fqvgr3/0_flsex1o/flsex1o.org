Honestly I've read so many fics that I don't know whats canon and whats fanon anymore.. But I think that most people go by the idea that anything created (not stored) by the room, can't leave the room. However, I'm pretty sure that J.K. never went in that much detail about the room so it's pretty much open for interpretation :)

edit: considering Dumbledore found a room full of chamberpots when he needed to go, the room can definitely provide some robes for Ron
