We know for a fact that Dumbledore /tried./ The curse on his arm was a result of him putting on the Gaunt Ring.

#+begin_quote
  “Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “/why/ did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”

  Marvolo Gaunt's ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.

  Dumbledore grimaced.

  “I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .”

We don't know if he actually managed to use the Resurrection Stone. His use of the word /tempted/ and that he seemed to have destroyed the Horcrux right after touching it seems to imply that he didn't manage to use it though. I think he stayed far away from the Stone after this too.
