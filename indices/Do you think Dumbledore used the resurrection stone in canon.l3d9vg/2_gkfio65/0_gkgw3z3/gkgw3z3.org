This does raise (not for the first time) the question of how the pensieve works and what its limitations are.

Does it work like an objective recording, and you can watch the whole event exactly as it happened, regardless of whose memory you're using, what their field of vision was, etc.

What does the pensieve do with facts that no-one knows the answer to (e.g. the curse that killed Ariana)? Does it fill in the gaps with the interpretation of the "rememberer"? Or fuzz it out?
