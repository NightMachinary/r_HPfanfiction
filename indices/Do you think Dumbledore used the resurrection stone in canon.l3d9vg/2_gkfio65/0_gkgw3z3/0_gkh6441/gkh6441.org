The way it's described, yes you can see things that you didn't consciously note at the time. It allows you to "walk around" in the memory and see things that are not even in the direction the person was facing.

Clearly, there's magic involved rather than just showing somebody's memory.

The reason it would help in Ariana's case is that Albus, Aberforth, and Gellert were in a three-way fight and none of them noticed which spell hit her because they were concentrating on the battle. Viewing the memory would allow him to see it while not distracted and see exactly what happened.
