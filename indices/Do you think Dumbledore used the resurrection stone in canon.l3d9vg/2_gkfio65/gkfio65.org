Some fanfictions have the ring with a compulsion charm to put it on, so anybody who finds it will get zapped with the curse, but that's not my headcanon.

My headcanon is that Albus knows that his curse is the one that killed Ariana. The reason for this is the pensieve, full of his memories and others that he's collected. I think Ariana's death would have been one of the first memories he put in there, trying to get closure by finding out whose curse killed her, hoping that it wasn't his... and finding out that it was. I think he was hoping it was Gellert, to give him even more of the "moral high ground" against his former partner.

Thus, what he'd really like is for her forgiveness; to know that the changes he made in his goals and methods are enough to earn redemption. Faced with the possibility to find that out NOW, rather than waiting until he passes on himself, I think he just couldn't resist.
