My headcanon was always that you can't use the resurrection stone to get any closure from the dead but it is meant to assist you dying. Dumbledore himself says in the King's Cross chapter that he was not worthy to use the stone because he was only going to disturb the peace of the dead, while Harry was worthy because he used it to gain courage to walk to his death.

Edit: so I give OP a reasonable response and I get a downvote? I hope whoever downvoted has their most beloved person die of the worst form of cancer.
