#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix and Voldemort had an illegitimate son
#+end_quote

Stopped reading right there (not really)

Just the idea of Voldemort fathering a son is cringe-inducing

I'm not saying you couldn't make something good about it if you worked it up

reading the first preface you have the dialog betwen Bella and Regulus like this

Bella: Take care of Voldemort's baby\\
Regulus: Lol nope he is evil\\
Bella: please\\
Regulus: ok but just this time

I don't think Regulus should so easily accept the anticrhist that easily
