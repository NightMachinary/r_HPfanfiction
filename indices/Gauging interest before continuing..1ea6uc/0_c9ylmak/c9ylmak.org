  "Of course, m'lord! All ya had to do was just ask nicely!" Bellatrix chirped.

If you want this fic to be taken seriously, your dialogue needs serious work. Everyone is speaking in the same voice (your own). It's jarring to say the least.

Go back to the books. Examine and try to mimic the different ways different characters speak. Ron is always informal. Hermione is rather proper. Dumbledore is lofty and learned. Sirius is friendly. Voldemort is silky and harsh. Bellatrix is erratic and excited.
