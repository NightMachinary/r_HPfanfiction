Like a lot of things with HP, JKR never really expanded on these ideas. To expand would mean to explain and then we would get to the nitty gritty of why these things don't make any sense.

Like anything, if you wanted to establish Apparition distances or traveling to the far side of the world to avoid the moon, make sure to establish the rules your story. As long as it fits within the rules of the story and doesn't offensively contradict canon (everyone's an Animagus!), create giant loopholes, or make it too convenient for the protagonist(s), then I think it can be executed.
