I think one reason Lupin/ Werewolves may not do this is because of international law/treaties.

My uncle has AIDS and tried to visit China in the 90s. They went through his bags at the airport, saw his medicines and made him take the next plane out of the country.

Lycanthropy is treated as a similar stigmatized disease in The Magical World and so traveling out of the country all willy nilly may not be allowed by other governments. (Or even by the government of the magical UK. There are some restrictions on werewolves, and maybe this was one?)

Some countries may be more liberal in their policies, but many could still see it as a “keep your diseased folks out of our yards, thanks.” Especially on the night they can transmit their disease more easily.

I have no idea about apparition limits though. I do imagine that there are things like customs and magical boarder control too, which probably should be obeyed.
