The longest apparition distance we know of is from Hogsmeade, somewhere in Scotland, to Tom Riddle's cave on the south coast of England. That's probably in the region of 400 miles (~640km).

For reference, the distance between London and Paris is 214 miles (344km).

Moreover, Harry was able to do the same journey in return, with a passenger, the same year he learnt to apparate. So it's not a super special Dumbledore-only thing.

We have to reconcile this with the fact that Voldemort flew between Nurmengard (likely in Germany or Eastern Europe) and England. Even if he couldn't apparate directly all the way to England, surely he could have apparated once he flew within range (i.e. when he reached France or Benelux countries). But he didn't: we have Harry seeing him flying over water through the scar connection.

One explanation is that Voldemort just loves flying, but given the urgency of the situation this makes little sense. I think the only way to reconcile the two facts is to say that there are other factors contributing to apparition than distance.

I can think of two potential explanations here:

1. Large bodies of water block apparition. This is an elegant solution, fits with mythology which JKR will have been aware of, and also nicely explains why the war with Voldemort never really spills over to involve the continent or rest of the world. Britain is relatively inaccessible to wizards. It also explains why wizards apparently largely left the New World to the Muggles to explore. The downside of this explanation is that it means that Europe, Africa and Asia are all apparatable, unless you bring in other limiting factors.

2. Magical geography is not the same as physical geography. The idea here is that what determines apparatable distance is not physical distance but rather "magical geography", some kind of extra dimension in which, for example, Australia may be closer to Britain than France is. This fits nicely with the conceptual nature of HP magic, where a beetle is easily transfigurable into a button simply because the words are similar. Britain and Australia's shared language, culture and history could make apparition between them easier.
