Yea I agree. With lupin I read a story before where harry is so rich he hires a jet to keep lupin moving around the world in the sun so he never has to turn around the full moon time. As for apparation. We know in canon people like Dumbledore and harry can apparate long ass distances. So why can't lupin apparate to the Arctic where they have the sun up 6 months at a time? I don't know.
