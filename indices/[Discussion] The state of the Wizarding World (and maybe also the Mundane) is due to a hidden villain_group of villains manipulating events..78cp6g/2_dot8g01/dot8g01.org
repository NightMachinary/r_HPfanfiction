Mm, but how would a hidden villain manipulate events? Select assassinations and false-flag operations, I assume.

I mean, revenge is a powerful motivator, and stereotyping and dehumanisation are powerful tools; a few well-arranged incidents might be all it takes to get purebloods and muggleborns at each others throats, or goblins to distrust wizards, or centaurs to hate hags, et-cetera.

That would make a proper Good!Harry a tremendous threat to their plans, of course. Idealistic, but more importantly forgiving person who actually has a lot of fame and therefore a lot of people listen to him? He'd be a huge threat to this nebulous evil organisation's plans. And imagine if he found out that someone was confounded/Imperiused to attack him for reasons NOT relating to Voldemort? What if Sybill Trelawney of all people detected them and prophecied their involvement in Harry's life?

...Huh, maybe that's why Harry's life tends to suck so much in canon. Neglectful relatives, shunned in first year after losing a ton of points, shunned in second year after being exposed as a Parselmouth, exposed in third year to dementors, trapped in the Triwizard Tournament in fourth year, harassed by the government in fifth year and of course Voldemort trying to kill him; all because a mysterious agent went "His body and soul are protected by love magic AND he's ridiculously famous? Oh, /shit/."
