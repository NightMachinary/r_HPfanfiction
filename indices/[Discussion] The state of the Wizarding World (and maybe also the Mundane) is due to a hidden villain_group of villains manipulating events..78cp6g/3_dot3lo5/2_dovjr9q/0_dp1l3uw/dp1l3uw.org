I don't think you understand the reason, though. It's not solely because of the definition, it's because there already is a term set in place in canon to describe the nonmagical population. There are two terms, actually. Saying mudblood is not acceptable in polite company, but saying muggle is. That's because no one in the wizarding world thinks that the word muggle is a pejorative term -- not even Hermione.

But for whatever reason, fanfic authors get this idea in their head that "muggle" was a racist term, when it clearly was never meant to be or used in such a manner... and in all their brilliance, decided that calling people mundane was somehow less rude.

There's also a new term that's become canon within the past couple years with "no-maj". A much more Harry Potter-esque term, and not insulting in the least.
