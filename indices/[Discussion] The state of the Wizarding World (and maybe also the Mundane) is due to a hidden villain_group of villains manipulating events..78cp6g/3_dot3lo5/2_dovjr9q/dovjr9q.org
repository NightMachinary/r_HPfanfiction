I sort of agree. Rowling has used the term to refer to the non-magical, but I don't think she has actually called muggles, mundanes.

Nevertheless. I feel like people are just getting offended by mundane for no reason. It's absolutely possible that an alternative definition evolved for the word in the wizarding world to specifically refer to non-magical things. This includes people. It's not even unbelievable in any way.
