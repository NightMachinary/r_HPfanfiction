I think it's meant to be the [[https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Amundane&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8][second definition]]. The natural versus the supernatural; the normal versus the paranormal.

Using mundane, though, could also be seen as self-demeaning. A wizard calling a muggle a mundane is tacitly admitting that the wizard is abnormal and/or unnatural.
