Sure, but I don't think witches and wizards see themselves as any more 'heavenly' or 'spiritual' than muggles. Some might see themselves as better, sure, but for most magic is just a normal part of life. There's nothing special about magic to them.

And yeah, most Americans didn't vote for Trump. But I guess what I was mostly pointing towards was the fact that many governments right now aren't very progressive, and quite conservative and afraid of change, in fact. When you look at the wizarding world person by person, they're not really that backwards or racist. When you look at the government as a whole, though, you see the same things in the Ministry of Magic that you see in governments everywhere. So it's a bit hypocritical to point to the Ministry in HP and say, "Oh look how backwards and inept they are compared to us!" when it's not true at all.
