I feel like calling normal people 'mundanes' is a lot more demeaning than calling them muggles. You'd think if being called a muggle was considered offensive, Hermione would be the first one to be outraged, but nowhere in the books does she think that it's pejorative, and she uses the term a lot as well. You realize being mundane is to be dull, boring, and uninteresting, right?

Also, how is the canon magical world more backwards and inept than our current world? Because they're prejudiced against people different from them? Americans just elected a man that said he would build a wall so those Mexicans couldn't come in. The UK just voted to leave the EU. It's only in very recent memory that homosexuals started receiving rights. Slavery existed in the USA just a century and a half ago.
