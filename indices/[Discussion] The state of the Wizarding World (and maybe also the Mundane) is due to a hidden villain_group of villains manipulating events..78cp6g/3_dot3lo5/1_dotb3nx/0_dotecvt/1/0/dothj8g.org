No i am arguing science, an animal that has magic (of which acidental magic alone is proven to increase survival chances) is better than one that doesnt posses magic. On a completely scientific level, wizards are superior to us muggles. Magic is an evolutionary advantage much in the same way that humans extremely developed brain led to our domination of the planet.

Regardless of you taking my side of the debate as a personal attack and bringing up Nazis imediately (as if that has anything to do with this) no where in my comment did i say that eugenics was an admirable or even morally neutral concept.
