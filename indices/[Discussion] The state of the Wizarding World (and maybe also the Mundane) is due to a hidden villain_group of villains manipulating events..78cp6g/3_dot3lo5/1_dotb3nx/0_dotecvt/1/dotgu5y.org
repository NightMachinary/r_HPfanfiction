Define ‘better'.

A deranged murdering psychopath with superpowers is NOT better than an average person with no special powers.

You are basically following the Nazi eugenics argument that ‘lesser' human beings should be exterminated.

But where do you draw the line? Should people with higher IQ or SAT scores lord over or even murder those who have lower scores?
