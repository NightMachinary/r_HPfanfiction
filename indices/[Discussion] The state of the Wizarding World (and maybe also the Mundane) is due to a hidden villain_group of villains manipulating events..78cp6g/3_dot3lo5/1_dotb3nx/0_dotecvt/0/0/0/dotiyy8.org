Yes, but that doesn't change the fact that you are naming an individual mundane, and thus insulting them.

And with 'good' or 'bad' I was not referring to Voldemort, but rather Ministry clerk #387 who mostly sits around in his office all day vs. Albert Einstein who helped us to understand the world better.

If you were to compare those two it is rather insulting to call Einstein mundane.

Yes, on a species level wizards are superior, I do not disagree with that. But that is not the fucking point.
