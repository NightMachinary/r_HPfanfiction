You need to think about whether the worst wizard is 'better' / 'more extrodinary' than the best Muggle.

From the examples we have seen in canon, I do not think that is the case, and thus it is insulting to claim otherwise.

Also, being better or worse isn't one-dimensional. Steven Hawking for example is bad at a lot of "human" things, including the most basic ones. However, he is still extraordinary in his understanding of modern physics, and I certainly wouldn't say he is more mundane than me, even if I can walk and he can't.
