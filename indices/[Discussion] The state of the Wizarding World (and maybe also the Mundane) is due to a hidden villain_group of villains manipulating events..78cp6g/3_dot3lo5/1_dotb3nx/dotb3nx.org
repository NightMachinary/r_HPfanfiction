I completely agree. Is a distinguished muggle like Usain Bolt / Albert Einstein / Angela Merkel / JK Rowling really more 'mundane' than Minstry Clerk #342?

It is demeaning because it basically says "No matter what you achieve in life as a muggle, the achievements of the most boring wizard will be more exciting."
