I think that this (like many ideas) would be a great concept IF it were executed well. However, I suspect that most authors would struggle to write a story like this without it coming across as hacky and kinda stupid. It's very, very difficult to write a villain or group of villains who has that kind of overarching control without plot holes making them seem like idiots or making them compelling villains for the hero to fight against.

Not saying it couldn't be done, but if I came across a fic with a description hinting at this, I'd be really skeptical of it going into it.
