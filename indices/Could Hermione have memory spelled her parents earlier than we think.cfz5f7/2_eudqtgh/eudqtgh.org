Technically, Hermione "may" have spelled her parents during 5th year.

We know the trace only act as a magical radar, and can't determine "who" cast the spell. During both CoS and OotP, the Ministry doesn't "know" if Harry cast a spell or not out of school. They just detected a spell being used in Privet Drive, and since Harry Potter is the only wizard registered in this zone (both to activate the Trace and use magic), they assumed it was him. (I would have to add that, with this definition of the Trace, explained to the reader by Dumbledor in HBP, any spelled used during the "rescue mission" of the Order, from Tonk cleaning spell to Maugrey Disillusionment Charm should have actived the Trace and sent the Ministry a warning. But for the sack of the plot, we can ignore it).\\
Anyways, in Hermione case, she was on a trip. So even if she used Magic, the Trace would either not work (if we assume the "Trace" vary from one country from another, and each Ministry only monitor its own), or worked but the local Ministry would be unable to link the Magic to Hermione. Yet, this scenario is still unlikely for several reasons :

- Even if Hermione could use the spell without being caught right away, it is likely the local Ministry would investigate the unknown magic, making it dangerous.
- Hermione was also forced to do a lot of spells when she spelled her parents. She add to create a completely new identity for them, it include to conjure things like a passport for both of them. She also add to completely remove any trace of her existance in their house (which make it probable she spelled them her). All of this would take a lot of time, and I doubt she would be able to do all of it while being pressed by time.
- Finally, the Memory Charm is a spell very advanced. Hermione pulling it off while still at school could already be considered impressive, so during the First Semester of 5th year? Possible I guess (the only limits are the ones made by the author after all), but I would still consider it too hard for her at that time.

In conclusion, Hermione needed to not have the Trace, and to be at home to be able to spell her parents memory without too much risk. It only leaves the 3 vacations of her 6th year (I can't remember if she returned home for Christmas or the Easter Hollydays). But, since Hermione "returned home" at the end of 6th year, I guess she only charmed her parents at that time. Since, if she had done it before, she would effectively be homeless at that time, and I don't see why she would not have said it to Ron, since his house is the only one she could have gone.
