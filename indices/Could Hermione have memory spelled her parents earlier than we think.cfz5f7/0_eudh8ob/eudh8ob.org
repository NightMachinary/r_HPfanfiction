On Christmas in Y5, Hermione would have turned 16 in September. Any spells she could use would class as illegal underage magic.

But if we're going to go full tinfoil, then Y2. Hermione's parents were first seen in Flourish and Blotts in book 2, then never seen again after that. Hermione was petrified for months and it didn't look like her parents were notified, or if they were, cared. Remember that Myrtle, a muggleborn, was killed back in 1943 and her muggle parents showed up to collect the body.

So obviously the Grangers must have been obliviated!
