Theoretically, her parents could have gone after Christmas of Year 6. Due to Lavender affair, she wasn't with the boys that time; and she was over 17 by that time.

Her scheme would need time to pull off:

- Her parents or someone have to sell their practice
- Her house may need to be sold or rented, although that could put the new owner in danger. She can alternately burn down the house and claim insurance payout, but I doubt she would try that scheme
- Her parents need to organize a new life in Australia
- Someone needs to arrange their identity, including new fake passports, fake data in Muggle government databases, etc...

Anyway, I think her scheme of â€˜evacuating' her parents would take longer than a few weeks to complete.
