Personally, I go with a population around 200000 for my stories and my headcanon. It definitely has to be larger than 20k for people like Lockhart to make a living by selling books. Otherwise, having three broomstick companies would never work out, nor would many others businesses. As I see it, Hogwarts is an elite institution, where you don't get accepted unless you show a certain magical talent (the Muggleborns do surprisingly well, all things considered) or make a generous donation. Otherwise, there are public institutions which teach until OWL level (don't need a potion NEWT to be a clerk), which would explain why there's a special Ministry department for education together with several positions centered around OWL exams. There have to be other schools, it wouldn't make much sense for the whole commission around Marchbanks to exist.
