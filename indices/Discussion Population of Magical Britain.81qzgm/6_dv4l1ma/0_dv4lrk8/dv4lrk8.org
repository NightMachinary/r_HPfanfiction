There aren't other magical schools in Britain. In fact there are only 11 magical schools in the entire world, with most wizards being home schooled:

Also, Hogwarts invites all witches and wizards in the UK and Ireland ([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm):]]

On the topic of economy, I don't think you are correct. The magical economy will not be like small Muggle economy. It will have significantly different dynamics.

Some of those economic differences:

- The wizarding economy is small in absolute terms due to the low population.

- The wizarding economy does not have a banking sector in the sense of banks which create money as Muggle banks do, nor a central bank which prints money. It's true that you can get loans (see: Bagman) but given the nature of wizarding banking as essentially deposit boxes, it is likely that these loans do not expand the money supply because they probably are a literal transfer of cash rather than the crediting of an account with money that did not exist before (as in the Muggle world). It seems that the only way money is created is by the discovery of treasure (and, I suppose, mining). The money supply is therefore extremely stable, meaning there will not be a trend of inflation as in the Muggle world.

- The wizarding economy appears to still be on the gold standard.

- The wizarding economy does not have mass production and is not inclined towards it, given that you cannot automate the enchantment of objects. Innovation is common, but tends to stay on the scale of an individual craftsperson rather than becoming standardised (with a couple of notable exceptions, namely brooms and beauty products).

All these add up to a very stable economy with almost zero inflation and low growth, and a moderately fixed money supply, as well as no "wealth creators" of the kind who in the Muggle world create billions worth of economic value where before there was nothing.

In short, the wizarding economy does not have the capacity for billionaires. What extremely wealthy individuals it does possess will likely have their wealth tied up in illiquid assets like land.

On the other hand, wizards can use magic to satisfy many of their basic needs for themselves. They have no gas or electric bills, no internet or phone bills, potentially no water bills. Many of them inherit homes so they would have no rent or need to buy a house. Those who do need to rent/buy are not forced to buy in an expensive area, due to instantaneous magical transport, so can buy a cheap patch of land in the middle of nowhere.

In short the main expense on necessities for most wizards would be food and clothing, and rent for those who do not have a multi-generational home. Most everything else is a relative luxury. That means the majority of their wages will constitute disposable income. This allows wages to be quite low, relative to the Muggle world, while still allowing wizards a high standard of living. It also allows prices for most products to be quite high relative to incomes, because they are luxury goods rather than common necessities.
