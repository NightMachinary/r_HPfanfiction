I come at the issue of borders from a different direction: given that wizards can ignore borders, why would they particularly care about what the borders are?

All signs are that the international magical world is highly integrated, somewhat like the EU only deeper (given that the ICW interferes in national government, something which the European Commission does not do) and taken to a global scale. Given this, if a border moves one day, it doesn't really impact the way wizards live at all. Intra-EU borders have come to mean very little - essentially just a sign by the side of the road - and I see wizards having a similar mentality.

Wizards see themselves as wizards first and belonging to a particularly nationality second. It's not a significant part of their identity (see also Pottermore, the country vs kind debate: [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/macusa]]).

Regarding Pottermore, I understand disliking canon and doing something different for fanfiction. But pretending that canon says something other than it does seems to me to be a kind of delusion - the idea that you can pick the way the world is based on preference, rather than having to take it as it is.
