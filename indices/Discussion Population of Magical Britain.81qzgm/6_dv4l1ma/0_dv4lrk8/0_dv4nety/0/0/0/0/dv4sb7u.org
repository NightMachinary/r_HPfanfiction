My question is rather, where do you draw the line and say "this is the state we use for magical administration, Quidditch and so on"? 1707? 1690? 1444? And if they use any date before 1806, how is the HRE handled? What was it like during the cold war, especially for Muggleborns? Post-Napoleonic Europe and the collapse of the great Empires? How do you think a Muggleborn in Montenegro would react if someone told him that his country doesn't exist in the magical world and that he has to pay his taxes to the Serbian Ministry, whose Muggle counterpart is busy with a racial cleansings and war?

Instead of answering these questions, we got Cursed Child and a web blog with more adventures of horribly named children. To get back to the original topic, I am not saying that Pottermore sucks, I have just glanced at it a couple times, and it didn't answer the questions I had. Guess I am not the target audience then. Which is the reason why I am making my headcanon up and focus on international relations and try to figure out a way their economy works beyond "magic" instead of who ended up with which Weasley.
