I'm not sure that there needs to be a universal date. Presumably, like most of history, it would be rather more organic and based on contingent circumstance, and subject to possible revision later on. I doubt that there's some logically consistent set of rules which determines borders like a mathematical formula.

One imagines, however, that 1689 (statute of secrecy) would be the date at which Muggle and wizarding borders began to diverge, since we know that prior to that date, wizards fought in "Muggle" conflicts such as the Norman conquest of England.
