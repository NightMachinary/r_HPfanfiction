I feel like you're talking past me somewhat. Raising the complexities of Muggle territorial changes doesn't seem to address my point of "they just ignore it". For example, Transylvania is a country for wizards (they have a national Quidditch team which knocked Britain out of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup) despite not being a country in the Muggle world (and indeed, it never was).
