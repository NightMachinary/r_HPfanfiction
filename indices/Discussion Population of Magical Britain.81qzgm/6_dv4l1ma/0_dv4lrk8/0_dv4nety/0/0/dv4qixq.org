It matters a lot for administration. How else do you determine where which law is in effect? There has been a magical government since 1707, a time where countries like Prussia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Ottoman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire still existed. Meanwhile Bulgaria, for example, was merely a province of the Ottomans. If the ICW was already around back then (and it was according to the wiki), Bulgaria should not exist unless you want to argue that they were a member since the Second Bulgarian Empire before the year 1396. Admitting Bulgaria would be an affront to the Ottomans, similar to the two China question.

What would a wizard from Silesia, for example, accept as his nationality? Who would rule him? Silesia? Bohemia since the Bohemians ruled that area after 1292? The Habsburgs/Austria/Holy Roman Empire, since the Habsburgs inherited Silesia in 1526? Prussia, since Frederik the Great conquered it in 1742? Poland since the Potsdam Conference decided that it is now part of socialist Poland?

The solution of saying "the ICW settles international matters" becomes lacking once you realise what a clusterfuck European politics were before 1945. How do you determine which magical government rules a certain area? Britain is easy, considering the Act of Union in 1707, but it really doesn't work on the mainland. Especially considering the Holy Roman Empire, since it is not an equivalent to modern day Germany (it included a lot more territory) while the individual members were rather independent. And how do the Free Cities fit in there?

And it is not even just administration. What about Quidditch teams? Is Prussia still fielding a team? The German Empire? East and West Germany? Where do you draw the line and say "this territorial division is now used by magical governments". What about Muggleborns who learn that they are a magical citizen of a foreign country? They might not know the language, or, looking at the Balkans, not accept that they are ruled by their arch enemy.
