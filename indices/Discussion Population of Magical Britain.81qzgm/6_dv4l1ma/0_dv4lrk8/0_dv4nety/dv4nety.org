I never bothered with Pottermore or Fantastical Beasts, just canon (and occasionally the wiki to look up tidbits which came up in fanfiction). Instead I make up my own head canon based on what I think are logical conclusions from the seven books.

Frankly, half of what I've seen mentioned for the rest of the world makes little sense, especially stuff like wizards following Muggle borders when they can simply apparate across Europe. Do you really think that someone like Malfoy or any Black would accept that they suddenly lived in a different country because some Muggles lost a war?
