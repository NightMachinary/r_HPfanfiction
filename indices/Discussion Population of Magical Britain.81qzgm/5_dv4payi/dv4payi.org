Given that wizards have had a very high standard of living for a very long time, and that they don't tend to die too often before a fairly old age, even if wizards don't have children as frequently as Muggles, their population growth should still be pretty high, so I don't see how populations can be anywhere smaller than that of a small city without having massive casualties from the recent wars.
