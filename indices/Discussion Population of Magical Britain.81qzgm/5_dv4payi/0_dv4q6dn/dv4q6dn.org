I don't see the logic here. High quality of life and security are associated with low birth rates, not high ones. One would expect wizarding birth rates to be similar to the Muggle developed world, i.e. at or around the replacement rate of 2.1 (in some countries like Germany, significantly below that rate). It's easy to see how the population can have been stable and small for centuries.
