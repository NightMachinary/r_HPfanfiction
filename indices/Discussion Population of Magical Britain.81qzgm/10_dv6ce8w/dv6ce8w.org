Logically, there can't be more than a few thousand wizards in Britain. However, this creates some problems in the world that have already been outlined in this thread.

I prefer the way population is handled in linkffn (Unlike a Sister by MADharmony). It is stated that there are around 1,000,000 wizards in Britain, and the author acknowledges that this is a direct contradiction to any logical attempt to guess the population of Britain, but it allows for a more interesting world.
