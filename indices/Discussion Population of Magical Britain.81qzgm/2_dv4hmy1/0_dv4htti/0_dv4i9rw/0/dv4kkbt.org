My reasoning is that Harry's year was the second smallest, the smallest being Ginny's year, since the war had been particularly bad by that point, before a population boom starting nine months after that Halloween. Remember, Ron is flabbergasted at the number of first years being sorted in OotP, and can be inferred to be preoccupied and not take notice the previous two years, given the Dementors and Peeves/Hermione beginning her House Elf Crusade.
