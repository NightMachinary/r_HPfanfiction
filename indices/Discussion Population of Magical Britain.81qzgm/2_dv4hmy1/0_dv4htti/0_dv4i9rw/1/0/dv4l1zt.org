Times change. Assuming there were plenty of people back then, does us no good. They could have lived in a time of constant peace for all we know. Harry's time was full of war, Grindelwald, Voldemort(Twice) being the most notable figures. Either way, castles could have been made to make the Founders feel more special. Or it could have been a war fortress and it's just a coincidence people are studying there.
