I think that hogwarts itself may have actually Led to a drop in the number of witchs and wizards.

Before hogwarts most wizards and witchs lived with and probably married muggles which would mean that even if each magical person only had two children that lived to adulthood they would have been slowly doubling the magical population with each generation.

But after the founding of hogwarts wizard and witchs would have been more likely to marry another magical meaning that a magical family would have had to have at least three children to keep the magical population growing.
