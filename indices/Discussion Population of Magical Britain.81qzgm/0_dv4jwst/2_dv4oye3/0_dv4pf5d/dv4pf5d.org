These seems to be largely based on what your intuition is regarding what is and isn't realistic, rather than any hard impossibility.

Personally, I would consider it realistic for, say, 50% of the British wizarding population to attend the Quidditch world cup final. What's stopping them, exactly, other than having to buy a ticket? Certainly not the inconvenience of travel, given that it's a) free, arranged by the government and b) instantaneous. And 50% means lots of people still miss out and so are jealous of those who got to attend.

For reference, the Christmas 1986 episode of Eastenders was watched by over 50% of the British population at the time. So entertainment can and does attract those kind of population figures. In a world where transportation is instantaneous and free I don't see why you couldn't achieve similar figures for an extremely popular event.

With respect to international attendance, I'm not sure that we have any reason to believe that international portkeys are in any sense harder to come by than domestic ones, and again, they were arranged by the government. So I don't think the international element is any particular barrier to attendance either (except for Americans, who are less interested in Quidditch).
