In GoF, there's this quote:

#+begin_quote
  Seats a hundred thousand... Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year.
#+end_quote

While the size of the task force may make sense in respect to a population size of 10k (5% in the task force, with 15%+ total working for the ministry), is 10k really a realistic number given the size of the stadium? If we assume 10% of the British Wizarding World (because tickets are expensive) is at the Quidditch World Cup (1k) and set it against the UK's population of about 50M, we get 0.00002:1. Take that ratio and multiply it against the entirety of Europe's population, and we get 15k people. If we throw the entire population of the world against that ratio, we get 150k people. And that's really unrealistic, to assume that 10% of the world population, especially those in far off places who will need to pay for portkeys too, will come to the Quidditch World Cup. I think more realisticly, the population would have to be increased by a fair amount, if those hundred thousand seats are to be filled.
