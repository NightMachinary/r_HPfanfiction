Jumping into the conversation since its a slow day at work:

The only issue I see is is the wording of your first quote: it says people, not students, and appears to include at least 1 professor in that number. Considering these seem to be the equivalent of a college sports game based on the fact that students move from school level to national league level, it wouldn't be unreasonable for some of those 200 to be parents, former students, fans, or other teachers. That said, we know of at least one instance when a student serving detention was forbidden from attending a game, so it wouldn't be too crazy to also assume there's students not attending either by choice or by consequence. Everything else sounds sound though, I'd just be careful using a vague and open to interpretation quote as your only hard number source.

As to your last statement, I don't argue that castles are actually quite small internally, but, and I hate to use this excuse, but magic. The only reason I say this is because we have a direct comparable example: the Burrow. I'm using the imagery of the movie here because I don't have the books on me to look up lines, but assuming the description fits the visuals, the Burrow should not stand. It'd be easy to compare whatever magic makes that possible to keeping a castle standing with less support than a stone structure of its size would require. I still agree that the idea of Hogwarts having many unused rooms being a bit over the top, but it's not unreasonable to assume there's at least some empty hallways, seeing as in the first year there was a hallway out of the way enough to keep a giant ceberus without anyone being effected from an entire corridor being off limits.
