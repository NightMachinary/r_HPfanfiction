True, off that fact alone this is an alternate possibility. However, Lucius Malfoy comments in CoS that Arthur Weasley is low paid, and when he gets a promotion in HBP they talk about how the pay is much better, so taken together with those facts I think it rules out the possibility that they have a decent income but spend it all on tuition.
