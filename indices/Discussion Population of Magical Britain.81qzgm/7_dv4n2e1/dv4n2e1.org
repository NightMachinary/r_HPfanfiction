That's pretty much the same as my headcanon, though my reasoning behind it might not always be the same. Just one thing: they wouldn't live in "other magical British communities", to me, but simply live hidden in muggle villages. We know that Hogsmeade is the only all-wizards community; there are a few other magical neighborhoods (like Diagon Alley), but the bulk of wizards just live in muggle areas. Examples: the Gaunt Shack, Grimmauld Place.
