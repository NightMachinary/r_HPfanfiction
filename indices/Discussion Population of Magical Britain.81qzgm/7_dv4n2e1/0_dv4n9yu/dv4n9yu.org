Well, we know that Hogsmeade is the only all-magical settlement, but we also know that there certain places where wizards cluster in higher than normal concentrations - Godric's Hollow and Ottery St. Catchpole being two examples. It appears that they tend to live in fairly rural areas, which goes well with what JKR says about wizarding schools all being located in sparsely populated areas of the world. It seems that wizards have a preference for rural living (and with instantaneous transport, why not?).
