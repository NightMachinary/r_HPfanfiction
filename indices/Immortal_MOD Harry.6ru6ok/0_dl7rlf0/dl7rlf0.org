Probably because in canon he had a real chance of becoming the master of death and while we don't actually know what comes with being MOD, it granting you immortality kind of makes sense, even though thats not rly Rowlings style. She was all about accepting death and what not, and she wrote Harry accordingly, so hes not really the character to chase immortality.

Personally i think that epilogue where Harry goes back to the forest to pick up the stone would have been way cooler than Albus Severus.
