How does becoming immortal by being the MoD make any sense? The moral of that story was all about welcoming death when your time comes, which is exactly what Harry did at the end. Immortality seems to be the exact opposite of being the MoD. I don't think the title is really anything more than symbolic. Anything else feels kind of cheesy.
