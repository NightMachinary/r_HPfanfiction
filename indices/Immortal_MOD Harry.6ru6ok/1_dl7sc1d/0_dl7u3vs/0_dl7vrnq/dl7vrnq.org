Still, I like the interpretation common to a lot of fics that the stone kept at Hogwarts wasn't real.

If the Flamels are ancient, there's no particular reason/benefit to them giving the perks to just another add-on who tries to appeal to them.

The last one works, but is obviously a very different type of story.
