  and a Philosophers Stone wouldn't be easy to make.

OP Indy!Harry could steal the stone before Quirrell made an attempt to do so.

Other ways of making him get a stone include.

1. Stealing it as I stated.

2. Being friends with the Flamels - and getting special /perks/.

3. Killing the Flamels for it.
