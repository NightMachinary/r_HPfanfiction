“Sky by Dalnim” linkffn(9355381), but I have to admit I haven't finished it.

I still dream about somebody picking up “Street-Smart by 3.1415926535897932384626433383” linkffn(12278819) and gives us good HP/Oliver Twist crossover, but I haven't found anything like it yet. Modesty Barebone is so awesome character and it is pity she got lost.
