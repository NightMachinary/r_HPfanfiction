I didn't know that; it's on my "get around to reading someday" list.

I've done a search the first chapter, though, and can't find anything that includes more than "nig," which is found four times as part of the word, "night." I couldn't find "n-word" or "n word" in searches, either. Are you thinking of a different one than the obvious? And is Harry actually using it in an insulting manner, or using it in a context such as, "I've run across this word. What does it mean?"

I probably won't get around to reading this one, though, because I ran across more profanity than I care for in the first half of the chapter.
