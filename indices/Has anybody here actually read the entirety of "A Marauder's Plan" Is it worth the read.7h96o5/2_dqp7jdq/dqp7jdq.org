I managed to make it all the way through, eventually. Lots of stopping and starting to read other fanfics (and discover a new fandom! hi Worm) in between.

A Marauder's Plan is writing-technically competent. The i's are dotted, the t's are crossed, the sentences flow nicely and the story forms a coherent whole. Character development is generally fairly good, as is character consistency.

However, that's where my praise ends. The plot moves at a glacial pace and there are clich√©s up the wazoo. Too much politics stretched over /far/ too many words, with a side helping of Lordships and... ResidentSleeper.
