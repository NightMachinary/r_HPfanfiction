I really liked it, it took a couple of well-worn tropes and makes them work.

Things like Lordships, Ancient and Noble houses, rings (heir rings and head of house rings), Peverell ancestry, ritual magic (mostly blood rituals for family (house) purposes), blood adoptions, time bubble magic (Harry and Sirius spend a couple of months in a time bubble but only a week passes outside). It all sounds like it should be too cliche-ridden to be any good but it's actually pretty well plotted.

I like the fact that while all the on-screen romance is straight (and strictly G-rated), there is a mention of gay relationships and characters and there isn't any sense of disdain for them. (As a gay reader I like it when my existence is acknowledged without being shat upon). There is also a creative use of a pensieve to give Harry and Neville "the talk".

I love the characterisation of all of the Weasley's, from Molly and Arthur suffering from empty nest syndrome, to Ron overcoming his jealousy and becoming more sure of himself. I admit to a bit of a crush on Bill as portrayed in this story. Even Percy gets to have a bit of character development.

I usually hate original characters but the ones in this story are tolerable. Especially because some of the characters named in canon (Augusta Longbottom for one) are fleshed out in such a way that they are pretty much original characters too.

Overall, it is overflowing with a very large number of fanon tropes, but it is also a well-plotted, well-written (from a grammatical standpoint it's near perfect), story that I added to my favourites without hesitation.
