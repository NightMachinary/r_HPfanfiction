I have read it twice, once when it had just ended and I loved it. It was the perfect wish-fulfilment with just enough fluff and battles to make me happy. It was also the period where I truly enjoyed Ancient and Noble Houses and that stuff, so it obviously appealed to me. The second time, this summer, I couldn't finish it, not because it is not well written (it's a surprisingly enjoyable read), but because I had outgrown those tropes. So, should you read it once? Yes, because it is a bit of the top fanfiction for that genre. Will you go back to it multiple times? No, because it is quite long and exhaustive once you know how it goes.
