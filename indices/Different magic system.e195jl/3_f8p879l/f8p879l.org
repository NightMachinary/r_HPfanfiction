Depends on your perspective I think. For one thing, the majority of fics that delve into magic beyond the surface introduce a lot of canon-contradictory information clearly sourced from other fandoms. A good example of such a series is linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), where magic is both implicitly and explicitly (see A/N in beginning) modeled more after the Naruto fandom (hell even the main character is a mashup of Naruto and Sakura character-wise). Lots of fics pull the magic=energy thing in fics because its an easy way to make Harry more powerful than everyone without giving reasonable explanations why.

Some more unique divergences though can be found in:

- linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): and its sequels, where the entire world and way magic works has been redesigned (this is a dark fic, so be prepared).
- linkffn(0800-Rent-a-Hero): where Divination is made a LOT more useful than it is in canon.
- linkffn(Sixteen Years): magic often manifests itself as superpowers of sorts in certain wizards (ex. Kingsley throws around lightning, Sirius can manipulate shadows and darkness, Tonks metamorphmagus abilities are more like Metamorpho from DC Comics, etc.).
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): there is higher class of spells called Arcane magic, one not utilized often for a variety of different reasons.
- linkffn(By the Divining Light): partly because much of the fic delves into the eldritch and 'old magic,' with wand magic taking, if not a backseat, a sideseat to other styles.
