Harry Potter/Merlin cross over in the semse that magic is a lot more limited in the sense that spells are wandless and very few are short encantations but actual chants and rituals to some extent. Potions require more than just mixing ingredients in a pot and using magic takes a lot more focus but is in the end, more powerful once mastered.
