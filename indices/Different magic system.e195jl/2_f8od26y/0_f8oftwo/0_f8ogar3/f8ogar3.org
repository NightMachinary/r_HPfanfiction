Hm, that's the only one with a completely different magic system I know of. But turning the whole "traveler stuck in another dimension" theme around, there's another great fic I'm currently reading: Linkffn(13312738), where almost canon Hermione is stuck in a universe with no magic at all, except for what she got in her bag.
