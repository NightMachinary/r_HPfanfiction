Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

The Death Eaters use a ritual and accidentally summon Milo, a wizard from Myra (City of Light! City of Magic!) whose magic works completely differently. In some aspect he's completely overpowered (Imperius? Eh, just cast Protection from Evil) and in some aspects the HP wizards are way more powerful than him (what do you mean, unlimited spells per day?).
