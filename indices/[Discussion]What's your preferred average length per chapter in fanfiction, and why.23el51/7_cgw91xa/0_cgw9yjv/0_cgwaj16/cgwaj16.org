Well, I read on Safari so I wouldn't know. Do you read on ffnet/ao3? i've never had trouble with reading on my phone with those sites, but livejournal and other non-traditional fic sites are a nightmare because they're not mobile-friendly. Maybe you should start using other app. If your phone is an iPhone just use Safari. If it has Android, you can use Firefox or Opera and see if the problem is solved.
