I am of the same general opinion as you typically if it isn't at least 1k words per chapter I skip over it. The only exceptions to this for me are one-shots or fics with a lot of chapters.

As an aside I too read on my phone, using a chrome app, a lot when I can at work and for some damn reason almost every word that starts with "fi" like first, is replaced with "u" readin as urst the only time this doesn't happen is with bolder or italicised words. Does this happen to anyone else.
