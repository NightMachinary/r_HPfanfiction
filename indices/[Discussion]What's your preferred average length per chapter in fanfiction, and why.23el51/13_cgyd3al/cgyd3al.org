It's also a stylistic preference of the authors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4538453/Yeghishe][Yeghishe]] for instance tends to write stories as tiny snapshots of very short length to tell a story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9000908/1/The-Housekeeper][The Housekeeper]] is at 99 chapters and just passed 20k words, but is an oddly captivating read... and I /really/ tend to dislike the fluffy stuff. The most popular stories usually are in the 5-10k words per chapter range, but popularity does not equate to quality (/cough/HarryCrow/cough/).

So, while it makes sense that there should be some correlation, chapter length should not be an exclusive filter for quality. There are plenty of long length per chapter stories that are absolutely cringeworthy, and there are plenty of short length per chapter stories which are fantastic.

Personally, my ideal is around 6-7k words per chapter, but there have been plenty of ones with around 2-3k per chapter that I've greatly enjoyed. It really depends on the pacing set for the stories.
