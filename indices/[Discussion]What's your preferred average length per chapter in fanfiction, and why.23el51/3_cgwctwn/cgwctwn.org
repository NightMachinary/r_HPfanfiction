To be honest, this question is a peeve of mine. I understand a preference for length, for whatever reason--time commitment, preference of style, common lengths of your preferred genre, what have you--but the idea of a correlation between quality and length completely strange to me. Even if it's common on ffnet. That's like saying 'this movie probably sucks because it's only 90 minutes' or 'I only watch movies over 2 hours long.' It's a meaningless benchmark.
