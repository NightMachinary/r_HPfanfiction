I would argue that there's a serious correlation between low quality writing, lack of commitment, and lack of any serious plotting, and low word count chapters. I'm not saying one necessitates the other, I'm just saying that a fic with 20 chapters, each at 10k+ words, is far more likely to be worth reading than a 20 chapter fic with an average chapter length of 2k words.

This isn't always the case, but I'd be willing to bet that if you took every fic under five thousand words, and every fic above ten thousand, and compared them, the quality would be infinitely better on the 10k+ word fics on average.
