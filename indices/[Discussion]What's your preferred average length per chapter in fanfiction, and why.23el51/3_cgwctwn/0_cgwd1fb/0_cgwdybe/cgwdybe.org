I think it's because of the genre you prefer and the length you are accustomed to reading; or maybe you click through more fics than I do, because I don't read a wide range of fics and certainly not the genres popular in this subreddit. Outside of fantasy epics (which tend to require more exposition--and even then I think 6k is a good realm to stay around), I don't see this trend at all nor a reason for it. Slice-of-life, romance, family, character-centric--these genres tend to be on the shorter end. Even my favorite adventure fics hover around the 3.5k range per chapter, and I'm picky about any fic with 5k+ chapters because these fics can be wordy, lack focus, and overly indulgent with plotlines.
