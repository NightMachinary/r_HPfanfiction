Wow, 130k words seems almost like a taste to me. I prefer stories or series ranging in the 200k+ (with no upper limit, I've read fics with 1.2m words for instance).

I do understand what you're saying though. With fanfics, you'll very often find authors floundering in the end, with no idea what to do. It makes me wonder sometimes whether they bothered to plot the story out before writing it, or if they just let their story go where it will.
