Personally, I have no chapter length preference whatsoever. I do, however, have a story length preference. Full length stories should be 80k-130k words. Any more than that, and it is quite common to find that either the story is either too slow moving, or they don't know where to end the story.

Personally, I find that not knowing where to end is actually one of the most common problems in fanfiction. It can be difficult to end a story where you've worked hard to build up and expand the world, but I find that authors who right several stories in the same world, or write a story and then write lots of little oneshots in that world are much better at letting go when it's time for the story to end, instead of dragging it out until they are ready.
