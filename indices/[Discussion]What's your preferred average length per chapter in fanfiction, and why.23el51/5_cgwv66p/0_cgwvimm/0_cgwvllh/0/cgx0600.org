Obviously there's been no scientific study on the subject, but it's just common sense. Someone willing to put in the time to write long, detailed chapters, one after another, is far more likely to take the time to edit and correctly plot their stories than someone who writes 50 1k word chapters and posts them quickly.

I'd paypal anyone $50 who could take 10 truly random stories with 50+ chapters at say 2k words or less chapters, and them compare them with the fics that have the same word count, but a average of 10k+ words per chapter. Then compare the two, and determine the quality between the two, with the lower word count chapters having higher quality writing. It's not gonna happen.
