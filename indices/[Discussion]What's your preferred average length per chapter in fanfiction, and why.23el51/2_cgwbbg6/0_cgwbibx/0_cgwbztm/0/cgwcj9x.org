Mhmm, I feel your pain with His Angel. I'm actually a big sucker for Harry/Fleur, so I gave that fic a shot. An actual, cringe worthy shot. I think I got about 15 chapters in before I said "fuck this shit".

The one problem with fanfiction, you can't throw it against a wall into a bin like a normal book. Some fics just make me want to print them out, just so I can throw them away. His Angel is one of them.
