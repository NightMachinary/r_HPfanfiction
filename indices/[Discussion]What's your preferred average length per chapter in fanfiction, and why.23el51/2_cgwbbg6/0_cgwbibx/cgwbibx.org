  but I'll state with complete certainty that you are missing out on a lot of good fics if you are skipping over everything that's less than 5k/chapter.

I agree with you, and I tend to make exceptions for fics that come recommended or are by authors I've read before. Or sometimes if I'm looking for a particular genre or pairing.

It's just, with the amount of fanfiction out there for HP, it's so much easier to find fics (when searching at least) that are decent by sorting through chapter length. I'm not saying a fic is bad because the average chapter length is short, nor that a fic is good just because the average chapter length is long (God knows "His Angel" is shitty enough, and the average chapter length is long enough there). It's just the correlation I've observed.
