Not everyone will like your story. Some will be nice about it and air their issues, perhaps even with constructive criticism. Some will just flame your story.

Meanwhile, your work will enlighten other people's day, and likely be enjoyed. They'll be happy to review it, or perhaps leave a favorite.

Most will just stay silent.

Personally, as long as you accept that not everyone will enjoy it, and some will inevitably flame you for it if it's popular enough, you should be fine. Don't take whatever flames you do happen to get to heart. Perhaps they had a bad day, or they just want to ruin someone else's day for the heck of it. Also, the more... creative ways people criticize the work can also just be downright amusing -- if they disliked it so much, why did they put the effort into complaining about it in first place?
