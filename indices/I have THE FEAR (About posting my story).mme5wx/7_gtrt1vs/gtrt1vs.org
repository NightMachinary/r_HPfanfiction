I have never wrote fanfiction but I'm going to try to give you advice. I don't really care what I read but I do kind of get put of by some really sirius topics. But I think your fanfiction would be AMAZING! You wrote 49 chapters I have never read a fanfiction with that many chapters! If people don't like it, well that's their problem. You are proud of you work and that's all that matters. There will be some people who won't like your work but there will probably be more people who love it. Those people you should pay attention too. You put DAYS into your work and if they can't see that dedication then they should leave. I hope you submit it because it sounds great!
