I just read a story where the characters are all way out of character. At first I didn't know if I liked it but I always keep reading if I've started a story. If your story has a great plot and the change in character fits for that storyline I'm sure it will be a great story and noone will care about being out of character Please don't let thoughts like that discourage you, we need more long storys!
