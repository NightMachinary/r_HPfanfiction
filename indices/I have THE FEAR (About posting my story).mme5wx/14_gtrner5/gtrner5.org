People are hateful. Even as much as media would have us believe we are born "good". Really we're just innocent. Till we grow up. To be honest I'll never understand why people feel the need to be hateful (trolling) other people. I suppose it's why we still have bullies.

Others have given you some sound advice. What you need to remember is why you're writing. What interests you about this that you would spend so much of your time and support on it? It takes a certain amount of passion to write as much as you've written. That's precious. That's amazing. As an almost writer I tip my hat to you.

I'm this situation only you have the power. Perhaps try to think about ways you can cope with idiots. Special candle lit bath with music? Maybe a taking yourself to a yummy dinner. I'm fond of a nap to give my emotions time to calm down (sometimes a couple of days). What I'm saying is there are ways to help your emotional self deal with trolls. Use your knowledge as a shield. Of course your going to write hermione differently than JK. Your story is told from her perspective with no narrator. The choices you've made have been purposeful even when it was a stroke of inspiration.
