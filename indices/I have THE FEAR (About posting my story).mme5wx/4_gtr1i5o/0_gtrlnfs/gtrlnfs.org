Thank you! I think it's a case of me picking certain traits of hers and ignoring others I don't want to write. The determined, headstrong, passionate parts of her I'm all for. The spiteful, insensitive, bossy parts not so much! But one big thing happens before the story even begins that I figure is big enough to change anyone a bit.
