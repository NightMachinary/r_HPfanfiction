Ok, firstly: well done, you! And I understand your hesitance to upload the story; I went through the same.

Write what you want to write, and write for yourself. And this is very important: it's impossible to please everyone. Don't even try. Do not fall into the trap of trying to revise your story, for someone else's benefit. Do not let others compromise your vision.

Getting good reviews is nice, but don't allow them to influence you too much. It will only make the inevitable negative ones sting that much more.

Now, about in character. It all depends on what you're going for. Are you trying to write a Hermione who is true to book canon? Perhaps more akin to her film counterpart?

Perhaps you are starting with an in character Hermione who develops into a different person? That's perfectly fine, so long as you provide reasons/context.

That's what I did with my own Harry. He's changed, since the start of my story, and he's had to bend some of his principles, but he is still very much Harry, and driven by his core motivations. Always provide context!

Hope this helps, and best of luck to you!
