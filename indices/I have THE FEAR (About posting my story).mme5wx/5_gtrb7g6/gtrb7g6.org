My big piece of advice is that if you're posting only on ao3, which is the only website I've ever used for ff, then change the comment settings so that only registered users can comment. People are so much more respectful when you take away the ability to be anonymous.

I don't allow any comments whatsoever, which is sad because the only feedback I get now is from the number of likes and subscriptions, but I love writing fanfiction so much and am so sensitive that I'm willing to pass up some potentially beautiful comments in order to avoid the horrible ones. I used to adore receiving comments then got trolled for three straight days for making a canonically capitalist character into a socialist (it was a weird time, but I took half a year off and switched fandoms and now it's fun again).

In terms of your specific concerns, yes, it's really easy to turn readers off. There are so many fanfictions out there that people are accustomed to really niche content, a lot of which is pretty well written. The idea that you should post it just because one person might really connect to it is completely accurate; someone is going to love it and be so happy that they found it, and someone else is not going to like it. Something like the characterization or perspective or verb tense could make or break the story regardless of the writing quality because people are used to getting what they want. That's why I write it myself, because I want to create the exact content I want to see. I definitely believe that if someone dislikes your work, they should just move on, but this is the Internet and people are spoiled and do feel entitled to spend five minutes leaving a nasty review that could undermine the price of months of effort and passion for the writer.

Also, the advice to tag as much as possible if you're feeling insecure about something is good. People hate feeling like a fic's been misrepresented.

tl;dr definitely post it both for yourself and for others but if you think a mean review could ruin the experience for you, then change the comment settings to limit who can leave reviews
