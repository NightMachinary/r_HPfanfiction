Hello!!! I am in almost your exact situation, although I'm only nine chapters in to mine.

First of all, I'm so proud of you for making it this far! That's a crazy big accomplishment and time commitment.

Secondly, I 100% read out of character Hermione stories. Almost all of them are out of character in some way. The only thing that I look for is a coherent writing style that isn't riddled with grammar/spelling/formatting errors. That's the only thing that kicks me out of a fic.

I feel the same way as you do- I'm so happy writing my fic in my own little bubble, and I'm too afraid to share it with others right now. I think the key is to recognize that some people criticize instead of taking a moment to realize that the fic isn't necessarily for them, but that doesn't mean it is inherently bad.

You will undoubtedly get rude reviews that punch you in the gut, but you will also get reviews from people who get you, and who love what you did with the story. It's worth it. You clearly love the story enough to dedicate this much time to it. I promise you there will be so many people who love it too.

I'm excited for you!
