As an avid fanfic reader, I will read any fanfic that is well-written and compelling, even if the characters are "out-of-character". Basically, many people would love to read your story. There will always be a few people that get hung up on how J.K. Rowling portrayed the characters vs. how you will, but they are just being nitpicky. It doesn't matter if the characters are OC. If the story is good, people will read it.
