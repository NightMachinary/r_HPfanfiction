Honestly, a canon person being 'out of character' in a fanfic is one of the most ridiculous complaint. As a reader, I can appreciate both very realistic fanfiction talking about events not showed in the canon but stick to the canon representation as best as possible or showing an alternative stories where a change causes butterfly effect but the characters are still very similar AND completely AU/OOC stories. Often, the original plot actually starts because one of the characters is different than in canon.

There is lots of other things to take care of: make sure your grammar is correct, your style of writing reads well, the characters are well developed and stay in character considering your fanfic only (if Hermione does something completely different than in canon it's fine, if she does something completely different in your chapter 10 than she was doing in chapters 1-9 there might be something wrong) or if the characters change over the course of the story, their growth is natural. Make sure your plot is interesting and consistent. If you are using AO3, tag that your Hermione is OOC.
