If people have the time to sit and write a review criticising someone else about a FICTIONAL CHARACTER WHO CAN BE INTERPRETED IN MULTIPLE WAYS that's their problem. All the characters in any series are open to interpretation from the reader and different people will see them in different ways. Besides, JKR didn't write anything in first person from Hermiones POV, so any conceptions about how she thinks are likely built up from other fanfics. So how can anyone say one way of writing her thoughts is right or wrong? It sounds like you've put a lot of effort and time into this story, so be proud of what you've written and don't let the Muggles get you down!! I hope you post it, I love Hermione stories and I'm sure it will be great!!
