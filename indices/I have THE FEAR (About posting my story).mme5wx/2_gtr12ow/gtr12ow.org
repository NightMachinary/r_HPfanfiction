When I wrote my first, I had zero intention on posting it, and then about 70k words in I thought "there has to be at least one other person out there who would want to read this" and it kick started a fantastic year of writing for me. I know OCC is a big complaint in any fics, so if you're worried about it, I'd call it out at the beginning and this way if people still read it, then that's on them. I have an occ Snape (with good reason, he's an AU version) and made sure to state it promptly at the beginning and didn't think twice about it. You'll get some good feedback, and inevitably you'll get some bad too, but you shouldn't hold back your accomplishment because of others.

My biggest piece of advice to any writer is to write the story YOU want to read, not for anyone else. Since you're going to wait to post it it's completed, you have less influence coming in, but that mentality will help against any negativity you may recipe. I do sometimes adjust based on feedback (during my latest I had a reviewer ask if a certain conversation had occurred yet, and it triggered me to add a specific scene to address it which I'm actually very happy with), but overall I write the story for me - not my beta reader, not the general readers, just me.

Congratulations on how far you've come already! I hope you don't feel discouraged by others and let the fandom read what you have to offer!
