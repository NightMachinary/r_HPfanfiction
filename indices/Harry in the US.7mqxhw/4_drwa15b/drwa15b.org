Since you seem OK with crossovers, here's a WIP Avengers crossover but the author is really good about updating weekly: linkffn(Heroes Assemble! by Stargon1)

EDIT: forgot about this one: linkffn(Bearings by MattD12027). It's been a while since I read this one but from what I remember it was pretty well fleshed out with an interesting story. Both of these are post-Hogwarts by the way, you didn't really specify any couples you're opposed to or time periods so I went with what I had read in the past.
