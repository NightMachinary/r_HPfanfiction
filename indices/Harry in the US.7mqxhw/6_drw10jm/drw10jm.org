I remember one fic where Harry had an OC aunt and they moved to America. I didn't read it all but I don't think he went to Hogwarts. Don't recall the name right now sadly.

I do rememeber Harry McGonagall (linkffn 3160475) that had him raised in America by her OC relatives, though he does go to Hogwarts.

If your okay with crossovers, I can pull up a few fics with the Avengers (usually raised by Tony Stark).
