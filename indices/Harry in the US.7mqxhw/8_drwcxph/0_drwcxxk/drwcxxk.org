  Everyone always forgets about the Merpeople. So did Harry until the day his, Lee's, and Hermione's Portkeys land at Reagan National Airport's Arrivals dais.

Then Malfoy and his subplots arrive, and suddenly, saving the world again, one Mermaid at a time, sounds like the perfect excuse to do something he's always wanted.
