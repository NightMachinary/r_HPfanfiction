Fleamont Potter (Harry's Grandfather) and Charlus Potter (Sirius' Great Uncle by marriage) were second cousins, making Harry and Sirius barely related at all (Harry in the son of James, son of Fleamont, son of Henry, son of Thomas, brother of Fredrick, father of Reginald, father of Charlus, husband of Dorea (Black), sister of Pollux, father of Walburga, mother of Sirius).
