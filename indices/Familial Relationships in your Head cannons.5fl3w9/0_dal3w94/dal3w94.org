I cant contribute much, I only have one tought. Am I the only one who thinks the fact that Harry is related to Sirius (as you and many other have in their headcanon) actually weakens their relationship? I mean for me it was always such a strong point that Sirius was deprived from his family, a men without a legacy who found true friendship is James and was above all else willing to continue this friendship even beyond his dead by standing at Harrys side.

If the two were family it casts a strong shadow on this which, in my opinion weakens SIrius character and makes his relationship to Harry a lot more shallow.
