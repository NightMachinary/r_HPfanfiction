Remember that in OOTP that it was mentioned that Dorea Black had married to a Charlus Potter. It wasn't mentioned how but before JK revealed that Harry's grandfather was Fleamont, people wrote that Dorea and Charlus were Harry's grandparents.

The way I see Sirius is he never got on with anyone but his cousin Andy in his family, and went to Fleamont after making friends with James. I see Bellatrix as having close contact with Dorea and Charlus in my stories as I write Charlus as the black sheep of the Potter family and Sirius as the "Light Black".

I believe that James and Sirius would have been friends since meeting on the Express and both hating the dark elements in their families, joined together, his friendship with James being why he, in my fics, never chatted up Lily, despite being (thanks to fan fiction) a "ladies man".
