I have tons of ideas for relationships between some of the minor characters that rarely make it into my stories.

Terry Boot's mother is Mary Macdonald in my HC. She married a fellow muggleborn and they both left the wizarding world to escape the first war. They came back shortly after Voldemort was defeated in '81.

Blaise's father was Kingsley Shacklebolt's older brother. His unsolved murder is what led Kingsley to a career with the Aurors. Blaise has no relationship with his paternal family growing up and seeks out his uncle as an adult.

Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones are first cousins. Vincent Crabbe and Greg Goyle are also first cousins.

Alice Longbottom had a sister, Mary, who married Edgar Bones. They, along with their children, were murdered in the war. Neville was supposed to grow up with them. He was raised by his gran and granddad, Leopold Longbottom, instead. His granddad died a few years before Neville started Hogwarts (the reason Neville can see the threstals)

Colin and Dennis Creevey's mother was a witch. She died when they were very young and never told their father. That's how two "muggleborns" were born into the same family.
