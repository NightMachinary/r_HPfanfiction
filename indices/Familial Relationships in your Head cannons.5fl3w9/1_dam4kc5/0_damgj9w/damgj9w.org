Interesting. I can see the Ferrets bookends being related as viable. Wouldn't be surprised if their mothers were first cousins as well!

With regards to Neville and Augusta, I personally write the grandfather as being killed by Lucius because of Malfoy wanting to get more power in the Dark Faction of the Wizengamot, with Bellatrix not liking it as, in my stories, Bellatrix was attacked by a older brother of Frank Longbottom during her Hogwarts years, causing her to fall deeper into the Dark Arts (I usually have, for that purpose Augusta spared as in my storylines her "brother" Charlus & "sister-in-law", Dorea, ask Bellatrix to spare her for "family sake, even though she is a blood traitor". But I could totally see the Alice thing working.

The Bones family are an interesting bunch in my stoires as I usually write Amelia as the sister to Edgar (Susan's uncle) and Henry (Susan's father) and usually I pair her in some way with Sirius, especially as I see Amelia as a year or two older than the Marauders.

The Abbot/Bones connection is interesting. Personally I have Hannah and Megan as first cousins, with Hestia as Megan's mother and Gwenog as Megan's sister (who is same age as Bill in my fics)
