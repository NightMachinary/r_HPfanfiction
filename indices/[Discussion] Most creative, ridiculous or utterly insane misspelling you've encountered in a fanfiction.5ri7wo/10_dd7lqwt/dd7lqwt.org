Luscious Lucius is always a classic.

Also Diloris because Dolores is hard.

And then there's "surnames are hard for $200, Alex", with the double jeopardy of Weazelly and Durzely.

And and! Don't forget Dumbldoor! And Abra Cadabra! And Cruciate! And Sevrus!

All of these were completely serious too. I hate spelling mistakes.
