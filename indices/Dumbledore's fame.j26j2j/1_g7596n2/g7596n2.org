I'd guess he was already fairly well-known in academic circles, given his that he'd apparently been a prodigy in his exams and a leading magical academic since school (and eventually a professor).

How well-known he'd be outside of academia... probably pretty well-known in Britain. The magical world has a small population, nearly everyone goes to/sends their kids to Hogwarts- by the time he faced Grindlewald, two to three generations at least would know him, either as their classmate Dumbledore, or as their professor Dumbledore, or as their kids' professor Dumbledore. But I doubt he achieved international fame outside of academia, or the status of the greatest wizard of his time in the popular consciousness, until the war with Grindlewald.
