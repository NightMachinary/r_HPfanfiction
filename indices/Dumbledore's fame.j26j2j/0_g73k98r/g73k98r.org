I didn't watch "The Crimes of Grindelwald", so I'm not sure how "famous" they make him, but Dumbledore still had reasons to be (somewhat) well known before defeating Grinderwald. At the times of the movie, he had already:

- Been hailed as a genius throughout his Hogwarts year
- Became an apprentice of Nicolas Flamel
- Discovered the 12 uses of Dragon Blood (I think so?)
- Been hired as the Transfiguration Professor of Hogwarts, one of the few (and best) Magical Institution in the World, as well as Gryffindor Head of House and (maybe) Deputy Headmaster.

One of the most important aspect of Rowling's Magical World is that the entire Wizards population is equivalent to a Muggle small country, and the Magical countries are comparable to a little town in how they work (or at least, it's the case for Magical Britain). It is pretty easy for someone of Dumbledore's talent to acquire a local notoriety in such a world, and his defeat of Grinderwald propeled him to a level comparable to the Founders or Merlin.
