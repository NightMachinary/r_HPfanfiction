Check out some of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] works specifically Grave Days, Aurors and School girls and Strangers at Drakeshaugh they all follow canon closely have canon pairing, are extremely well written.

Specifically 'Strangers' is now my all time favotire fic ever from time to time i forgot i was reading a fanfic and instead felt like i was reading a Published novel
