You can find a lot of those if you just search for Harry/Ginny on FFN. The reason they're not very popular is that a completely good, Light Harry being extremely powerful is either incredibly dull to read, or so AU it doesn't feel like Harry Potter anymore. There's not much room for intrigue or conflict. Because if you think about it, even the Shining Knight Hadrian "Chad Thundercock" Potter-Black-Many-Other-Titles isn't exactly a good guy. He's violent, manipulative and cunning, delighting in his enemies' misery, insulting them left and right and playing with them. A /good/ Harry would be way blander then canon, because even Canon Harry isn't objectively good. He has a shitload of faults and biases.
