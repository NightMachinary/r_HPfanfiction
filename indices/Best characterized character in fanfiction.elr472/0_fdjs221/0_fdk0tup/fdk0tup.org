I was following your first two paragraphs but you lost me at the third. Keeping canon characterizations doesn't require that we retell canon. Keeping all the characterizations exactly the same, there's plenty of room to fill in the missing details of canon (canon-compliant backstories etc of all the characters) or describe how these characters would react to a change in the plot.
