No. That just doesn't make sense. You seem to be stuck on this idea that fanfiction has to either diverge from canon or repeat canon, which isn't true at all.

As an example, we know that there's some backstory involving Moody mentoring Tonks before Harry met either of them. There's plenty of room for fanfiction about their working relationship that leads to the two canon characters we eventually meet. There's plenty of room for fanfiction about Order activities that Harry didn't know about, so didn't get mentioned by Rowling in canon. All those fanfics require all the characterizations to stay canon in order to fit in with canon, but don't involve repeating canon.
