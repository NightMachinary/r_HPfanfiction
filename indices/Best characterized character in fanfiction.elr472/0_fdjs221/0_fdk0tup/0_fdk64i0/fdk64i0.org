You think so?

Characters act, behave, think, and feel according to the subjective logic of their perception. Their 'history'.

If Harry would've had a different upbringing, he might not have made the same choices. But he would still be Harry. Even 'in-character'-Harry. Just a Harry with a different backstory.

My point was that since every meaningful form of fanfiction describes events not displayed in the original series, the character would be forced to experience something new which -- inevitably -- would lead to their character changing subtly.

Thus, any fanfiction is (over time) bound to change the characterisation of its leading cast. If I was provocative, I might even say that fictions that don't do this fail to stay true to the inner logic of their universe and how it diverts from canon.
