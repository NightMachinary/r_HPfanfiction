Typically the one-dimensional characters like Filch.

Complex characters tend to lose some layers in most fanfiction (Dumbledore, Snape, Ron) whereas much-admired characters tend to inflate to something barely resembling the original character (Luna, Draco, Ginny).

But isn't that just the inherent problem of fanfiction? All characterisations are 'off'. They'd have to be. Otherwise, you're just retelling canon. I don't see the point in that.
