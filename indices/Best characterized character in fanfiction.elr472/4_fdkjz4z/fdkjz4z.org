Tough question. I'd say it's those who neither get a lot of love nor a lot of hate. Because people tend to only focus on the positive with their favorite characters and only on the negative with the ones they don't like, when all characters have some positive and negative traits.

Perhaps Neville and Umbridge? (Not to say they are not loved and hated, but I don't see as many fics about them as about other people) I haven't read a lot of stories focused on Neville, but the ones I have seen seemed pretty in character. And Umbridge is just so terrible, it's hard to bash her.
