Yeah that's what I meant. It just came to me this morning while reading yet another fanfiction that McGonagall is fairly consistent and every fanfiction keep tend to keep within range of her plausible behavior in regard to canon. Even fanfiction where her character is developed and play a more central role, she keeps the same air about her, the same heart if you will. Of course there are fanfictions in which she simply sounds off but most of the time she is on point.
