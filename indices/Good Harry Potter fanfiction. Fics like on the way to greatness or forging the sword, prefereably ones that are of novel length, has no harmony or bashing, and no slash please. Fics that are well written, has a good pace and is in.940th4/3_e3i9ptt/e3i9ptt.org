Not really sure what the stories you put in the title are, but one of the greatest reads I've read in a while is Gryffindor's Girl. It's a fem!Harry story (which is probably why it isn't that popular) that has fem!Harry receiving all of Canon Harry's memories up until he dies before her third year. And, unlike other time travel stories, it has plenty of twists that don't make it an exact rehashing.
