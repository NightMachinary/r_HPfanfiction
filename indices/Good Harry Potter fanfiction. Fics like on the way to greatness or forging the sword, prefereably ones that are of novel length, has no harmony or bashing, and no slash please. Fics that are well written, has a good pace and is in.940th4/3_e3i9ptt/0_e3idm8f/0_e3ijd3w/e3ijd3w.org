It's a rehash in the sense it follows a basic outline to the books. But it also does forge a new path; for instance, Mary proves Sirius' innocence before she's even halfway into her third year (if she even started it at all, that detail escapes me). This leads her to getting away from the Dursleys and never going back.

There's lots of other new things that happen, but I'm not going to spoil the story. =P Also, one thing I forgot to add: the author has not directly stated who they're going to put with Mary. A few of us have some theories about who it will be, but I'm not going to spoil your fun with those theories either. Because, well, they're only theories lol.
