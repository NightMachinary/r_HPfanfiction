linkffn(Unatoned): depending on your thought on noir style that is.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind): probably abandoned, but it is an enjoyable read with a lot of interesting ideas on the whole. I would probably recommend this one above anything else.

linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): pace is a little bit sacrificed for the sake of the mystery, but its a great story with a true tragic Harry.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time): probably one of the most interesting time travel stories, though I cannot remember right now if there was bashing.

Taken together linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) are easily novel length, with some interesting ideas that you won't see anywhere else. Ditto for enembee's other work linkffn(The Skitterleap) one the most interesting AU's out there.

I would also throw in link(The Unforgiving Minute), predominantly because its one of the most unique storylines I've come across, with a lot of things most of the fandom wouldn't touch.
