I've been outlining a story that actually has that as background information, somewhat.

My Harry Potter ends up as a professional criminal, taking down Dark Lords and corrupt governments by striking where it hurts the most: their bank accounts.

But since he's Harry "The-Boy-Who-Lived-Also-Vanquisher-of-You-Know-Who" Potter, and has the blind eye of the Minister, he gets away with it.
