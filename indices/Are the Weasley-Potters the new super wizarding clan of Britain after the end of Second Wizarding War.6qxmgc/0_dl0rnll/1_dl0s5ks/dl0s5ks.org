We can potentially see the making of a new Sacred Families group in future. Potter,Weasleys,Longbottom, Scamanders etc. Honestly the Next Gens fics are pretty bad. I can see Grandma Molly's dinners being the new power center in the Ministry. It's like Useless Weasley to mommy: Mum I want to be an Auror just like Harry

Mum: Ofcourse you can ask Uncle Harry, there is no one better suited to be an Auror than a Weasley/Gryffindor/Lion.

Uncle Harry: "Thumbs up". There's always space in the Ministry for another Weasley/Potter/Gryffindor.

Honestly If I was there I would like to see how many Slytherins made the Ministry after the war.
