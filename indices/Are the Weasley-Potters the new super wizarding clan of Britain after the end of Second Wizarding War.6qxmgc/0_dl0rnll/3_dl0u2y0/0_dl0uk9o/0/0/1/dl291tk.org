Adolf Hitler is NOT a good example.\\
He ruined his country even before he started genociding and conquering around. The Anschluss allowed Germany to (barely) survive economically through Austrian gold, and the plundering of half of Europe allowed it to keep going.\\
A Hitler without the 'bad' elements (conquest and mass murder) would be remembered as Mugabe will, only not as long-lasting.
