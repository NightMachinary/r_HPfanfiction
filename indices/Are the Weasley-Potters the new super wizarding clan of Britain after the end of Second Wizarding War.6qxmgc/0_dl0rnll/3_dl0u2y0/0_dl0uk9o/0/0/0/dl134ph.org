No. Hitler was a bad example. He was bent on genocide and world conquest right from the beginning. His "Mein Kampf", written in 1923, already said everything he had done later. Unfortunately, that book was not translated into English until 1937.

Also, Germany's recovery from the Great Depression was achieved through massive government deficit spending and one of the largest rearmament programs in history. Between 1933 and 1936, German Wehrmacht conscripted more than 3 million soldiers, enough to remove most unemployed. If Germany hadn't gone to war by 1939, it would have gone bankrupt in early 1940s.
