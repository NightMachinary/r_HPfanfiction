According to Pottermore (up to you how canon you consider it) the eugenic wars started out with the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy. Malfoys are specifically stated that they got a lot of their wealth through deals with the Muggles. The conflict between Wizards and Muggles started when Wizards started abusing their powers over them and Muggles retaliated by hunting down the magical children and the weak ones. I can understand why the Magical community would feel annoyed when many that (assuming they were competent wizards) had to take one for the team. In any case there are cases of high ups in the Ministry who tried to promote anti-Muggle sentiments but seems like they were quite unpopular with the community. I think the boiling point was reached during Grindelwald's time. During Voldemort's time there was a feeling of resignation and people thought "So we're not supposed to integrate in your community? Then fuck off and don't force your kind down our throats."
