They would stay hidden.

While popular belief/propaganda says that the magical world stays hidden to keep themselves safe, that is clearly not the case. At most, it's a secondary benefit. The real reason why the magical world hid itself and stays hidden is because they don't like helping muggles with their problems.

Since the DC universe still has plenty of problems that could easily be solved with magic, the magical world will not want to reveal itself. But they might in the Star Trek universe, because it's a post-scarcity society where technology has already fixed most people's problems.
