They would probably stay hidden, even in DC, many of the magic users and heroes, in general, are very private people.

Zatanna is an exception that in some versions she also performs magic in a stage for entertainment, but other magical users, like Constantine and Dr. Fate prefer to remain more discreet.

Why would they reveal themselves, I see no benefit, it would mostly be a hassle for them, heroes can mostly protect themselves, what about wizarding children?
