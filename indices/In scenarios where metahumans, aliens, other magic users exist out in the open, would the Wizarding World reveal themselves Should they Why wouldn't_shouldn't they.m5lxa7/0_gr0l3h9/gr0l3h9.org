Probably not, or not willingly. Why? Fear. The wizarding world as shown in the books is distinctly xenophobic. They fought wars over people coming into their world from the outside and brining new ideas.

Whether this alone would keep them isolated depends on the writer of the fic it's taking place in, but any exposure to the broader world would have to address a small, militant movement of wizards who oppose such an opening. My take, anyway.
