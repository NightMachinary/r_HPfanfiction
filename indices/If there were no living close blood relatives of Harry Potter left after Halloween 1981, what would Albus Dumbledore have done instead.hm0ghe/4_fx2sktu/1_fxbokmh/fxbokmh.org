Actually this isn't confirmed in cannon. We get the idea because as the purebloods are portrayed mostly as the elite of society we automatically see them as being few and far between (the whole list of sacred 28 is even in cannon showed as being more opinion than fact), this plus how long they would have to have existed so that no one could point a muggleborn root makes it seems as if they intermarried like crazy.

If you use the definition of pure blood more common though (three generations without muggles) than eventually in the span of 4-5 generations muggleborn descendants would eventually be considered purebloods or at least half-bloods. Ignoring all the muggle-wank we see so often a person would realistically have better chances of obtaining a good life-standard in the world they completed their entire education and have been socializing since they were eleven years-old rather than in one where they would have to get all the education they should have gotten between ages 11-17.

So the number of muggleborns going back to the muggle world would be very close to zero, this plus their seven years of schooling during their teenager years versus the fickleness of friendships formed during childhood and never strengthened plus the odd months at the muggle world means that their social cycles would be majority in the wizarding world, and thus it's more probable that they would end forming couples with other Wizards/witches. Assuming that the choices aren't deliberately made with the goal of bettering their social status their choices would be randomly either other muggleborns, half-bloods that would form the majority of the population and non-bigoted purebloods (no way of knowing for sure, so let's make it as 50-60% of them since the prejudice seems to be at least associated with economic status). And so whatever choice they make their future children will at least be half-bloods. Now, assuming this children face the same scenario then their children would end up being purebloods if they marry other half-bloods in the same situation as them or if they marry a pureblood; and half-bloods if they marry a muggleborn or a half-blood with a muggle parent. Theoretically the family could stay as half-bloods indefinitely, but, again assuming no choices are made deliberately because of blood status, the more generations pass the less likely this is because of probability since we are enlarging the total number of events while maintaining the same chances.

Obviously this is based only on maths and thus doesn't really take in account possible changes in social norms, genocide events like Voldemort's war, social politics and cultural changes, neither does it tale into account the exceptions that while small at the time-span of a single event will eventually end up accumulating during the course of multiple events. But the fact remains that in a roughly estimative chances are that a family originated by a muggleborn will eventually become pureblood. This obviously doesn't justify segregation politics or bigotry, but if we go by this logic than chances are that the purebloods aren't really a portion of the population as small as we are likely to think, and so there wouldn't really be a need for intermarriage to preserve their family's status as pureblood.

This is even corroborate by cannon when Harry sees the memory of the Gaunts and it is shown as being the exception for purebloods instead of the rule.
