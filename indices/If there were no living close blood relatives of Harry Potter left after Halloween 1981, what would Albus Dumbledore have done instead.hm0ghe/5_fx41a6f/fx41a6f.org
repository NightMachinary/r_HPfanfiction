In Canon, the Blood Protection was not the only reason why Dumbledore left Harry with the Dursleys (though it was the main one), he also wanted Harry to grow up far from the Magical World, to not be overwhelmed by his own fame.

Raising Harry in the Magical World would be difficult, because everyone would want a piece of the "Boy-Who-Lived".\\
Most politician would love to use him as a poster child to avance their own career. Just like Scrimgeour in HBP, people like Crouch Sr would love to have the public "support" of Harry to keep the population happy or raise their chance in an election, even if he is just a child.\\
Most Death Eater and Voldemort sympathiser would also be interested by his guardianship. He could be used to prove that they were not sympathiser and only victim of the Imperius curse (like the Malfoy would). Or as a Dark Wizard to potentially replace the one he vainquised (like that girl in the book that shall not be named). He could also suffer a terrible "accident" just week after moving to his new home, child are so fragile after all.\\
Finally, the rest of the population would also very happy to raise him, since he is their hero and all.

With this situation in mind, I don't think that Dumbledore would leave Harry with the Ministry since it would put him in the spotlight way too soon, but also bear the risk of Harry living with bad guardians (considering how closely related the Pure Blood are, and the stakes at play, I don't think that Andy claim as a distant cousin would hold since people like the Malfoy or Crouch could also claim some relation while also having a lot more ressource to invest in a legal battle).\\
Raising Harry at Hogwarts could also pose a problem since most adult there are already busy herding teenagers without also having to take care of a toddler. There is also other problems like the Ministry being a lot more insistent to "meet" Harry if they knew where he lived, the complaints about favoritism, children being even worse than adult regarding celebrity and some of them being a bit angry about Harry being somewhat "responsible" for their parents/ siblings/ cousins being sent to Azkaban.

So even without Petunia, Dumbledore would probably still chose to first take care of Harry, and then explaining to the Ministry that it's been taken care of and that he is safe. He could probably refuse to send Harry to an orphanage considering how it went with the last one (and the fact that, apparently, British Children don't really go to orphanages since the 1950's), but foster home could still be a solution (and Harry could even be raised by trusted Squibb and under the best protections Dumbledore could give).

Another possibility could be Dumbledore taking a very long sabbatical and raising Harry himself but I'm not convinced by this solution. In the end, Dumbledore is an educator whose allegiance is toward the school. I'm not sure he would abandon his position as a Headmaster (and his duty to protect/ teach all of his students) just to raise Harry. Also in 1981, Dumbledore doesn't really know and love Harry like he would later. Of course he would care for him and would want to protect him, but just like he would want to protect Neville, or Susan Bones (both child turned orphan by the war and whose parents were Order Members or at least Voldemort opposants).

So I'm not sure that Dumbledore would leave his position and all of his duty just for Harry. I would say that the most likely possibility is Harry being raised in the Muggle World by some Squibb, maybe Mrs Figgs or another, unknown one. I also guess that Dumbledore would be forced to be more present in his childhood, since he would have to place protections on his house at the very least.
