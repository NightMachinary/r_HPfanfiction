You atriculated a lot of my internal reasoning (and a lot better than I would have managed!) but I agree about Dumbledore's other motivations. He was committed to Harry being raised away from his fame, and even without blood wards anonymity in the muggle world is another type of defense. I also think he would want him to have a connection/understanding of muggles that will make him empathise with the muggleborn experience.

I reckon he would look for a muggle couple that wants to adopt and just leave him there. Dumbledore might have plans and an end game (and sure, he setup Mrs Figg who kept everything a secret) but I just don't feel like he would setup someone in that direct parental role to lie about everything; the inevitable betrayal just seems too cruel. Whereas with a random muggle couple he can coast on their ignorance.
