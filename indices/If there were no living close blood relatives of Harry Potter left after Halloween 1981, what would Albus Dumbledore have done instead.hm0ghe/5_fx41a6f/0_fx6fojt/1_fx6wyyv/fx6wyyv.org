I'm not sure the "inevitable betrayal" was already on the table in 1981.

Sure, it is pretty much confirmed that Harry is the subject of the Prophecy he would have to explain to Harry, But Dumbledore never gave much importance to it, so their discussion would be more along the lines of "While alive, he will always target you so be carefull ".

For the rest, Dumbledore suspected Voldemort survival but only confirmed it in 1991 after his attempt to steal the Stone. His mean of immortality (the Horcruxes) was also only round in 1992 when Harry brought him the destroyed diary. It's only after this date that Dumbledore found out that Harry was an Horcruxe (probably at the start of GoF when he sends him a letter about his visions). And he found a possible way to keep Harry alive at the end of that year (glimps of triumph when Harry tells him Voldemort used his blood).

Anyways, the point is that in 1981, Dumbledore didn't have much secret to keep from Harry (yet) so he would have though something like "I have to stay away from Harry so it will hurt less when he will need to die". ‚Å∏
