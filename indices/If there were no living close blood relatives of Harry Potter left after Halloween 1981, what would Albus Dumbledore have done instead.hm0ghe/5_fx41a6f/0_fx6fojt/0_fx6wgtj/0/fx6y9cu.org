Oh oops, I should have been a bit more specific, in hindsight I see what you mean but I wasn't referring to any of that stuff (by 'stuff' I mean evil!mastermind Dumbledore).

The reason why I think Dumbledore would still choose to leave Harry with muggles is that muggle ignorance of the magical world means they wont have to lie to Harry about his heritage, cause they don't know it. Then they'll all discover the truth together and still have a trusting foundation to their relationship.

But if Dumbledore leaves Harry with a squib, or magical person who agrees to live away from the magical world, my assumption is that they would have to lie, either directly or by omission in order to protect Harry from his fame. So the inevitable betrayal is about Harry's feelings in that scenario when he would discover his guardian/s had been keeping secrets his whole life and the damage that would do to their relationship. Harry would probably understand and forgive them, but it still leaves a mark.

I don't think Dumbledore is cruel or pragmatic enough to do that, either to the chosen guardian or to Harry. Sure it happened that way with the Dursley's, but ultimately they were family (plus blood wards) so got custody. With the Dursley's out of the picture, the path is clear for Harry to have a guardian that actually cares and takes on the parental role properly.
