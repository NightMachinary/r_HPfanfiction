Even if they're too distant for blood wards, i suspect that he would still give him to the closest acceptable relative even if its only for legal reasons. Wouldn't want folks like malfoy to challenge Harry's placement. In which case the Tonks family would become Harry's guardians as Andromeda is a (distant) cousin and her claim is as good as her sister narcissa, better actually because she wouldn't have the any deatheater taint: Malfoy and his underlings may have avoided azkaban but not without using up serious political capital, capital that he now cannot use to get the BWL into his custody
