I believe the options are: Elphias Doge, Sturgis Podmore, Emmeline Vance, Aberforth Dumbledore, Moody, and Albus himself.

Doge seems like an awful idea, Podmore is probably too young but possible, Vance is possible, Moody and Aberforth both seem like bad ideas though Aberforth might be possible, and Albus is too busy. So basically only OCs.

(I could have missed someone)
