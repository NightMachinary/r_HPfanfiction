Lmao. I can see this being a fun read. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry swindles the twins out of their savings and steals Malfoy's watch. He then steals the philosopher's stone. And the diary (this thing is sentient, it was to be worth something!). He pawns off the Marauders' Map and seeks out Sirius hoping that the convict will aid him in some grand criminal pursuit. The Triwizard gets cancelled because Harry stole the Goblet of Fire. When the Order returns to Grimmauld after a mission, they find that all the silverware is missing.

And when it's finally time to hunt for horcruxes, Harry already has them all in his trunk, because he hadn't had time to pawn them yet.
