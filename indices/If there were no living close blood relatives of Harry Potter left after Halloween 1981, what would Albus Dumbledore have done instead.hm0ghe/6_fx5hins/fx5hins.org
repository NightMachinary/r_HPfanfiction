I'm still of the opinion that McGonagall should have raised Harry. Picture this- tiny Harry, polite as can be, with (slightly) less messy hair and tortoiseshell glasses to match. He's an animagus from a young age and he takes classes years ahead of others his age. He has a particular talent for transfiguration and potions, which Snape grudgingly acknowledges. He's the only Hogwarts champion in GoF, Cedric is spared, and, a week later, Minerva takes him on a field trip on which they defeat Voldemort.
