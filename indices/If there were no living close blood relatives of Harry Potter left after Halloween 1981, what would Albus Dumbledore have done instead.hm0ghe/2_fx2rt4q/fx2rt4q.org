Andromeda Tonks is his third cousin once removed, or second cousin in the common setting where Charlus is his grandpa, reasonably close

(easy trick for remembering cousin numbers: number of "gr" in the younger one's most recent common ancestor, in this case Dorea Black's parents, Cygnus Black II and Violetta Bulstrode, are Harry's "Gr"eat "Gr"eat "Gr"andparents, third cousin, but Andromeda's "Gr"eat "Gr"andparents, so "remove" one of the "grs" and you get 3rd cousin, once removed)
