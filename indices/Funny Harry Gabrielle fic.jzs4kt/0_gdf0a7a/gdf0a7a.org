linkffn(Taking Hostages by The-Caitiff).

I remember reading another story, in which Gabrielle changes herself into a bird (a falcon, I believe), and has herself mailed to Harry, but I can't find the name of it right now.

I don't believe Fleur goes for Harry in either of those.

There is another story I've read in which Gabrielle is going after Harry, but Fleur doesn't until she gets too irked by Gabrielle saying Fleur is "too old" and "not enough woman" for her Harry. I don't remember the name of that one, either.
