The two that take the cake for me are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] - A bad writer decides to write a fanfic (with lots of tropes), but the characters are all self-aware. Highlight include Ron and Harry having a conversation about Ron-bashing, and McGonagall joining the Death Eaters (because she wants to be more relevant for the plot).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - Needs no introduction. A piece of Voldemort takes over Harry's body by accident on 10/31, and decides to live life. With the added bonus of everyone being ridiculously stupid.
