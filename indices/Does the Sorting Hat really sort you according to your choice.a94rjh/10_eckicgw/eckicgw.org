Short version: The Hat takes your opinion into account, but the final decision is the Hat's.

Longer version: How the Sorting Hat works in the original books is fairly consistent, but certain comments JKR has made post-books tends to cause issues for canon. In the original canon, the Hat would take into account what your current traits are, what traits your are lacking and whether or not you can/should nurture those traits, how specific houses would help regarding those traits, and your own personal desire. Neville and Hermione are good for elaborating...

At the start of the series, Neville isn't super brave (on the surface), has confidence issues, is bullied by some other students and even one of the professors. Based on what he was like at the time of his sorting, Gryffindor may seem an odd choice. But a house based around courage and bravery and doing the right thing is just the kind of place that could help him develop those traits and make him a more rounded individual (which ended up happening).

Hermione seems like a shoe-in for Ravenclaw at a glance. She is intelligent, enjoys studying, and seeks knowledge. But Hermione says herself at the end of PS that there are more important things, like bravery and friendship (which is what Gryffindor is good for). The Hat could have put her in Ravenclaw and not had many issues, but Hermione wouldn't be as likely to develop other virtues that she didn't yet have, like bravery. Whereas putting her in Gryffindor allows her to pull a Neville and become a more complete person.

Regarding Harry, I don't think the Hat was joking about Slytherin. If that Hat was joking about a House, it would have been Ravenclaw; Harry had a keen mind, true, but he didn't show many of the other traits native to Ravenclaw. Slytherin, on the other hand, was an alright fit for Harry. Harry could be a little sneaky, was more cunning than your average Gryffindor (not that that's a high bar), really did have a desire to prove himself to others in the beginning. Those are all things Slytherin would have embraced and nurtured, but the fact that Harry actively wanted to get away from Slytherin mattered; by not wanting to go there, in spite of the Hat's points about how they could help him, showed that Harry isn't /really/ suited for Slytherin. But this would seem to create an inconsistency with Neville getting shafted by the Hat! Well...

I think it's a little different. Harry not wanting to be in Slytherin despite his potential there was anathema to some of their main traits, and while Neville being intimidated by Gryffindor is inconsistent with Gryffindor's values, it's something that Gryffindor could actually help him with in time.
