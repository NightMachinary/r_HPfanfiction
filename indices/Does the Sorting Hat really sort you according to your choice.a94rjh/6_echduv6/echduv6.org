The Hat looks at what you value, not what you have. Nevile valued bravery, he was just scared. The Hat knew this and to Gryffindor he went. If you read the first book and look at Hermione's little speech in the potions chamber before Harry confronts the Mirror + Quirrel then you see that she values a bunch of stuff over brains which is why she's Gryffindor over Ravenclaw.
