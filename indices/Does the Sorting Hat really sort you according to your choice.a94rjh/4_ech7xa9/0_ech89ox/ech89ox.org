Yes, but like I said, if she wanted to make Slytherin the bad house, that's fine, but she should have KEPT it that way. Instead she tries to convince us now that Slytherin is a normal House like all others with supporting nonsense like the Cursed Child or that Merlin was a Slytherin.

You see what the problem is? If she wanted Slytherin to be the House for evil people , she should have just disbanded it in the end of the series, not have Harry tell his son that it's okay to go there.

It just feels inconsistent and confusing. It feels like a retcon.
