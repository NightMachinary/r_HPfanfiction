A book written for children requires black and white villains and heroes which is what JKR gave us. No one expected that the series would become so popular with a more mature audiences who would question the lack of subtlety. Many of us get really annoyed every time JKR drops another canon interpretation but we should remember that her target audience wanted a clear cut evil to be vanquished. Think of orcs, goblins, etc. in LOTR vs elves, men, etc. - a clear cut divide between good and evil so that we can cheer every orc death without feeling guilty or conflicted. How many people complain about the racism inherent in that? Or how Tolkien made the attractive races good and the ugly races evil?
