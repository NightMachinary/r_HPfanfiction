  Well, it's not like we didn't know that JK never intended on representing Slytherin fairly anyway, so this isn't a surprise.

You know what. It's fair if she wanted to make Slytherin the House for bad people, but in that case, i just wish she just disbanded it at the end of the series.

Reading the books themselves (and not Pottermore stuff) it's actually hard to see why they kept Slytherin at all, after all the problems it caused.

What I dislike is that on the on hand she makes Slytherin the obviously bad House in the books and on the other hand she tries to convince us that it's a normal House like all others, when in the books it obviously isn't...
