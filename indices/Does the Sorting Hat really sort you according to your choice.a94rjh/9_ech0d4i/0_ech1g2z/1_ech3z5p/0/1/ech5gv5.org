Yeah, but “every single Slytherin” in this case pretty much means Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle. I guess Millicent also fights with Hermione in CoS? There are at least ~70 Slytherins at Hogwarts, the fact that Harry makes no effort to speak with anyone doesn't mean that they don't exist. Zabini, at least, is neutral towards Harry even when Voldemort is confirmed to have returned.
