Well, it's not like we didn't know that JK never intended on representing Slytherin fairly anyway, so this isn't a surprise.

As to the rest of it, I tend to think that the Sorting Hat places you in the house that represents what you value most. Neville wanted desperately to live up to his parents and he knew that they were incredibly brave. The reason he didn't want to be in Gryffindor was because he was afraid that he wouldn't live up to the expectations, not that he valued hard work and loyalty more than bravery. The Sorting Hat would have been able to see what his real motivations were for asking for Hufflepuff over Gryffindor and placed him appropriately.
