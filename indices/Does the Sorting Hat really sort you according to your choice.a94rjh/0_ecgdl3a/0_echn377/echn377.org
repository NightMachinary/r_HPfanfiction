The Hat has to sort based on quota too, or else number discrepancies between houses can get rather large.

Plot necessity aside, I see the Hat as an algorithm that generally bases its decisions on:

- Min/Max number allowed for a house, so in other word, Quota
- Student's personality
- Student's value system
- Student's own choice
- Student's ancestry
