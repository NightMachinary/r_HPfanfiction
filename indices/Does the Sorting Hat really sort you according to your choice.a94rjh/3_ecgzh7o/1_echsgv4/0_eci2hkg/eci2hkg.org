Yes, meaning that all her tweets and other not-published-in-the-seven-books shit is irrelevant.

  Death of the Author is a concept from mid-20th Century literary criticism; it holds that an author's intentions and biographical facts (the author's politics, religion, etc) should hold no special weight in determining an interpretation of their writing. *This is usually understood as meaning that a writer's views about their own work are no more or less valid than the interpretations of any given reader.*
