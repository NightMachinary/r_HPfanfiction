I headcanon that it was standard for the old wizarding families to believe in blood purity to some degree or another until fairly recently and it's just Voldemort's Slytherin buddies who were willing to go the extra mile. I mean, sure Molly and Arthur married for love and James and the Longbottoms fought Voldemort, but their families had to have gone out of their ways to stay pure over the previous generations.

Edit: Actually, it might have still been true to some degree when the series was set, considering how fast people were convinced to go along with genociding the Muggleborns. Maybe Harry and Hermione just lucked out when they befriended Ron, and Ernie Macmillan's parents spent the whole series silently disapproving of his friendship with Justin Finch-Fletchley.
