As concerns the broad question of "does the Hat let you choose?"... well, it's a case-by-case thing. If the Hat feels like the student would belong in any one of several (or all) Houses, it will offer a choice and take it into account; but if the student wants to go somewhere where they obviously don't fit, or which wouldn't help them grow as a person at all, then it will feel free to disregard what the student says.

As for all the blood-purists going to Slytherin specifically, the Hat is an amalgamation of the minds of the four Founders. The way I've always imagined it is that in its subconscious are echoes of the four Founders squabbling about who gets who. And the Slytherin side, being itself blood-purist, is very insistent on getting all the blood-purists, while the other three, being broader-minded, don't particularly /want/ those people in their Houses.
