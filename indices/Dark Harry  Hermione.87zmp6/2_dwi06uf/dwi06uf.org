There's a light (Dark)HarryxBellatrix one-shot called "From The Shadows" on FFN; it's by Nicodemusshadow. I know it's not Harry and Hermione, but it's pretty good. Here's the summary and link:

Harry is in the Department of Mysteries, when he stops to ask Bellatrix a question. Why? The answers given reveal the mind of a tortured woman, and a plot is hatched.
