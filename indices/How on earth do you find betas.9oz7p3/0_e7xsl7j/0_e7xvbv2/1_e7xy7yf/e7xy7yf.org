It depends on what the author wants. Some want help with the plot (ie search for holes and inconsistencies or how to fill out the middle), some want a spelling/grammar check since they are not native speakers or aren't using British English on a regular basis. And some just want someone to talk their ideas through with, bounce things back and forth.
