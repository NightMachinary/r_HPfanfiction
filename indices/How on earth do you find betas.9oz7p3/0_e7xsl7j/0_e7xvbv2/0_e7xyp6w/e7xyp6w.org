It really depends on your needs. Personally I'm pretty close with the Discord crowd and a few of them read my current fic anyway, so I often ask them to read through a chapter before I upload it. I do the same for them, of course.

You can have more formal arrangements too which is useful if you need deeper help than proof reading and sense checking - you usually just have one person here and you would use Google docs or track changes on word. Obviously extremely helpful but a bit more difficult to find because it's a time commitment for the other person. I have done this a lot in the past but it wouldn't be fair for me to promise that to anyone now because I just wouldn't be quick or reliable enough. I'm usually happy to look over one shots or do short term beta work, especially looking out for grammar issues and Brit picking.

Sometimes if it's one particular passage/extract you can just post it here and eveyone will chip in. I wpuldnt do that for mpre than 1000 words though.
