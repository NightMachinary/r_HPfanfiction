  What is it about you? Teddy thought. He looked away, then quickly back again. Billy wasn't like anything or anyone he'd ever known. He wasn't like anything or anyone he'd ever thought he wanted. He was...wholly new, unexpected. Baffling and oddly frightening. Teddy wet his lips, studying Billy's sharp features. It wasn't often he had the chance to do this---to just observe Billy without drawing the full weight of his attention.His nose was a little too long. His ears were too big. He was the kind of skinny that other kids made fun of, all gangly limbs and extended trunk. His brown hair stuck up in untamed spikes, too chaotic to be deliberate. He was so pale his angular face almost glowed in the darkness of the planetarium.His skin was a living canvas beneath undulating waves of light.Or: Sequel to Teenage Wasteland.
