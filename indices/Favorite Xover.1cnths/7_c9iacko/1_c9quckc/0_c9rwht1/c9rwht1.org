heya i've actually been looking for the original story I was talking about for the last few days. and I've yet to find it?! Been trawling through the many authors I follow and reading the first few bits of any torchwoodxharrypotter fics I find.

It's really odd. The story involved SB and Ianto Jones stuck in a bar, whichs is supposed to be purgatory, together talking about their lives post veil/death.

I have a memory of remus wandering into the bar eventually after he passed away and Ianto being left there alone wondering if anyone would ever come for him.

It was really interesting. I have this thread earmarked, and if I come across it i'll let you know asap.
