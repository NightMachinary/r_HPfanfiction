[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.]]
