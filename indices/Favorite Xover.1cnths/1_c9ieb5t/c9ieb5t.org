Harry Potter and the Natural 20; a Harry Potter + Dungeons and Dragons Crossover

"Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry."

It is WIP, with first book completed. Usually I am not recommending unfinished stories, but this one is perfect - humor is great, crossover is done properly, characters are well done, no bashing, no OOC and Mirror of Erised chapter is among of the best things that I have ever read (and the best one that I have seen in fanfiction).

  Yeah," Harry said, climbing to his feet shakily. "Trick us into thinking that he's tricking us into thinking he's dead by offing himself. Brilliant, that is. Well, we saw through his cunning ploy. Go team.

  "In accordance with Section Thirty-Two-Point-One-Four-One-Alpha of the 1634 Statute on Inexplicable Phenomena of a Magical Nature," Umbridge declared in an authoritative voice, reading from a scroll she'd been carrying somewhere on her person, "which states, in the words of the Great Wizard Peabody, 'When something really, really, really wyrd happens, and hear ye me I do mean REALLY wyrd, and lo, it hath never happened before, and neither sir nor gentle lady knoweth what to do, let the goddamned Department of Mysteries handle it, y'hear? And forsooth, maketh sure there are at least a half-dozen Aurors around, if ye know what be good for ye.', the first preliminary inquiry to determine the nature of one entity known as 'Milo Amastacia-Liadon,'

  "You see?" Milo said. "There's obviously some kind of subplot or sidequest involving Quidditch. I can only assume that we'll get bonus XP or Magic Items if we win the Cup. So: we'll win."

  "This place is awesome," he said. The amount of XP he could get just from random encounters in the school grounds... it suddenly made sense to him how such a school could be an effective way to gain power. This place was clearly, really, incredibly, obviously, brilliantly dangerous. With all the adventure and monster fighting that must be happening between classes, not to mention the magical brawls that naturally occur when you give an eleven-year-old untold arcane power in a practically unsupervised environment (it would take a staff of thousands to keep an eye on all of Hogwarts at once), these kids would be leveling up like crazy.

  "I can't let you start on teapots until you've managed to transfigure more than just the colour of the stick, young man. I'm sorry," she explained, then sighed. "If you can manage to change its weight, sound -- that is, the sound it makes when dropped --, or shape at all," she added, "then I'll let you move on."

  Milo frantically pulled out his spellbook and re-read the description of Prestidigitation. There was nothing in there about anything beyond colour. He bit his lip. There was a sewing needle in his Belt of Hidden Pouches, but Milo assumed that other students had tried to pull that one in the past and McGonagall probably had a way to tell the difference. He hadn't prepared Ghost Sound, which could create illusory sounds, but even if he had he probably couldn't get the timing right to make a ping! sound at the exact moment the pin hit the table. If he'd prepared Mage Hand, a weak telekinesis spell, he could maybe push down very gently on the pin to simulate the metal's higher density, but his only 0th-level spells were Dancing Lights, Prestidigitation, and Acid Splash.

  Milo ran his fingers through his hair nervously. There was absolutely no way he could turn this stick into a pin using his arcane magic.

  "Cuddly Cannons," Hermione laughed. An uncharitable person would call the sound she made a giggle, because while it was still politically correct to have giggling girls in a piece of literature in 1991, this is no longer the case.
