I love Harry Potter/Dresden File crossovers. The universes just mesh so well in my opinion. My personal favorites are [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3468902/1/Demon-s-Feign-Merlin-s-Pain][Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/The-Master-of-Death][The Master of Death]]. You can find more of The Master of Death on the DLP Dresden Files WBA section, but you have to make an account.
