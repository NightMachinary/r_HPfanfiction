It is a high fantasy series written by Robert Jordan and then finished by Brandon Sanderson when Jordan died. It involves a magic system (called "channeling") in which people can access the two halves of the One Power, saidin and saidar, to weave the five elements. There are dozens of POV characters, political intrigue, and of course a Huge Horrible Evil which our main protagonists must fight.
