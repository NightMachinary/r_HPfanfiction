  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
