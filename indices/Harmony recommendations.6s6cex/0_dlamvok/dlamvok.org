The latest fic by Starfox5, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), looks very promising.

The latest fic by robst, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12117770/1/Who-Will-Fill-a-Coward-s-Grave][Who Will Fill a Coward's Grave]], linkffn(12117770), is not bad. Even Dumbledore and Ron are not bashed here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), is a rare crossover with both Battlestar Galactica and SG: Atlantis. It's quite interesting and the plot is original.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12043835/1/History-is-Written-by-the-Victors][History is Written by the Victors]], linkffn(12043835), is H/Hr time travel to the Marauder Era. Pacifist Dumbledore, but the plot has promise.
