  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix
