Relatively short prologues are fine, but anything longer than that is usually a waste of time, in my experience. And pretty much every scene involving a reaper should be deleted entirely, but that's mostly Reptilia's fault.

Of course, there are always exceptions. linkffn(No Fate by AndrewWolfe) is at 84k words so far, and the time travel is probably still a chapter or two away. But I think the difference is that what he's written so far is a good story on its own, so even if it ended in a twist with the time travel ritual failing and the main characters dieing, it would still be enjoyable.
