The "pre-time-travel" part of the story should serve a few purposes:

1. Show the audience /exactly/ why time-travel is happening. Is there something the character(s) hope to accomplish? What sort of world are they leaving behind?
2. Establish the method of going back - some obscure ritual? An accident in the Time Chamber? The good old Veil of Death?
3. Let the audience know exactly what sort of characters we're dealing with. Does Harry behave as-per-canon if the time-travel is an accident? Is he embittered or desperate if it's a "Voldemort Wins" timeline?

If you can do all of that in a single chapter, by all means. Generally though, I find it takes multiple chapters to establish all of that - which makes the "long pre-amble" you're complaining about not only necessary, but a /good thing/ in many cases.

Of course, if the pre-time-travel chapters have exactly none of that, /then/ they'd be unnecessary and the writer should skip them. I've never seen a story like that though.
