I read each story as if I haven't read a million of them, in which case no - the summary, 9 times out of 10, isn't enough if you don't rely on common-trope knowledge.\\
Also, you're supposed to be able to skip the summary most of the time - the summary is the blurb on the back of the book, it's not where all the plot-crucial info goes.

I'm sorry that you seem to be getting burned with Sturgeon's Law when it comes to time travel fics, but the ones I've read, the parts where they're not back in time yet tends to actually be necessary.

  when the romance is the primary plotline in a story, I'd much rather get to the part with the two characters interacting then whatever is happening before.

When that happens, you're not reading a time travel fic. You're reading a romance that happens to use time-travel as a vehicle for it. And surprise surprise, Sturgeon's Law /especially applies to romance-focused fics/. It's a popular genre to write for newbies, and a bit of a challenge to actually write /well/.

If a time travel fic is bad, it's bad regardless of those few chapters before the time-travel. If a fic is good, it might be /because/ of those few chapters establishing stuff you need to know.
