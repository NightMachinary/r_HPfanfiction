Speak for yourself. I'm sure there are a lot of people who get tired of seeing the same tropes and appreciate novel ideas.

As for your second point

Well if 90 percent of it is crap, and then I make a generalization about the 90 percent who's to say that my generalization was wrong.

You can talk in abstract and say that if written well, it does work. Then I would agree with you, time-travel fics would need a beginning But in this world of HP fanfic where not everything is top-tier, I want the trope to change a bit.
