A lot of the information that you say is needed can easily be read from the summary. And most of the time, the 1,2,3 isn't novel enough to keep me interested.

All im saying is that a lot of fics can benefit from cutting the jump. Secondly, when the romance is the primary plotline in a story, I'd much rather get to the part with the two characters interacting then whatever is happening before. Also, Harry usually explains where he came from to the person anyhow.
