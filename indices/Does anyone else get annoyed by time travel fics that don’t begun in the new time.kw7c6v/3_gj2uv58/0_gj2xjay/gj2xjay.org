I read and loved your post on the Daily prophet truth thingy, so I have no doubt you're a great writer and have your reasons for doing such.

But a lot of the stories I read don't have plot points structured around the previous time frames. Its just 2000 words on describing Harry going through the veil or him having a conversation with Death after he gets hit with the killing curse. Its like reading Godric Hollow wbwl scenes. Redundant by the 10th time around.
