I get that, but the fact that you saw some badly written doesn't mean doing it like that is bad. You read some bad because they were written bad, not because the structure is bad. It's just, whenever I see a post like this, I wonder "Would OP have preferred if the books started with Harry arriving at Hogwarts and telling everything else through memories?"
