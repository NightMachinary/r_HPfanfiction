Harry Potter doesn't start at Hogwarts because the story isn't about him learning magic. Well, it is, but more importantly its about him escaping a terrible situation and finding acceptance in the world. Similarly, with most HP romances, the overarching plot isn't actually defeating Voldemort and conquering evil but more Harry finding love. Voldemort is just a tool to separate the lovers.

I think our disagreement arises when considering what you read time travels stories for. For me, I'm more interested in the romance than whatever is going on in the background.

So, I think the author's should start with by setting up the romance first. Its why I don't like intros that start with length descriptions of the time travel mechanics. Because I'm much more interested in seeing the character interactions.

I probably should have phrased it better in the title. But I wouldn't have came to this understanding had you not challenge my opinion
