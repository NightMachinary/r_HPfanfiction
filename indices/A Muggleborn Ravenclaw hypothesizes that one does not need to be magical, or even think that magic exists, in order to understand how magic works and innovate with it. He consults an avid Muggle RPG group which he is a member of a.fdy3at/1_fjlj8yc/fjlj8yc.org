New Post

Hey guys, first of all, wow. You've clearly been busy since Christmas time. It sucks that my boarding school is so restrictive about internet access or I would be here working with you all. As it stands, I've only had a chance to skim through a few pages of your mad genius and wanted to make a post addressing something before I really get into it.

So to get started. Some of the newer thread participants need to reread the stickied posts at the beginning. This massive worldbuilding exercise we've been undertaking together already has a foundation that we are building on. Please don't suggest changing any underlying rules as that diminishes the work we've all done together within those constraints. That being said, if something seems inconsistent in the foundation rules feel free to bring it up. As xxXDragonbornHedgehodXxx pointed out last year, the requirement for wands is partially superfluous and wandless magic should be a possibility. Thank you once again Hedge, that's been a huge hit with my group at school.

I know that MagicWiz420 and his buddies have really taken to the spell crafting aspect of the world and I wanted to give you an update on their work. Those spells you crafted have worked great in our playtesting and are regularly employed by my friends at school, though I might pull the Thermite spell out of play for balance issues.

More good news is that my mom found some more books in the attic. Seriously, the amount of effort that whoever wrote this stuff to start with put into the lore building for this world is astounding. It's like Tolkein level. Anyway, these look like more textbooks, for arithmancy and ancient runes. Cursory glances this afternoon show that it should answer some of the questions that MagicWiz and potatologist had when they were trying to figure out the rules of spell crafting. Similarly LadyClarice should be interested in how the ancient runes lore compares with her dissertation work. I'll upload some scans as soon as I have a chance.

For those of you more interested in the story arcs we've been building I promise an update on where things have ended up for the political plotline as well as the magic school plot thread. I look forward to your analysis and where you think things are going to go from here.

I have lots more to tell you and A LOT of back posts to get through. I'll be on Discord tonight while I read through the old posts. I promise more updates on spellcrafting, new potions, herbology, and the results of our thoughts about a 13th use for dragon blood later. Looking forward to another summer with you guys.

RavenMudMage out.
