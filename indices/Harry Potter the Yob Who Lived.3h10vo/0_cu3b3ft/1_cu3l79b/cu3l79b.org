#+begin_quote
  An apostrophe should only be placed before the letter s when describing something belonging to something/someone.

Not quite, though that's a fairly good rule of thumb.

Apostrophes are also used to show contraction, which means 's can also mean /is/ or /has/, as in “she's really something” and “she's got a wonderful car.”

's is also used for plurals of lower-case letters (mind your p's and q's) and of mixed case abbreviations (I hear she's got six PhD's).

Important to note:

- “Its” (no apostrophe) is possessive: the world has lost its mind.
- “It's” (with the apostrophe) is a contraction: it's been a hard week, and now it looks like it's going to hail.

(But Rohovark's given very good advice, and you won't go amiss if you follow it. Just wanted to make sure you were as informed as possible.)
