Interesting and I think shows promise. A couple of things, don't use an authors note mid chapter, secondly I'd suggest finding a beta reader to tidy up a few grammatical and punctuation errors. I'd try and merge the first two parts, switching perspective can be confusing and is best saved for new chapters.

I look forward to seeing where this story will go, after all, Dumbledore himself said that thievery is not tolerated in Hogwarts!
