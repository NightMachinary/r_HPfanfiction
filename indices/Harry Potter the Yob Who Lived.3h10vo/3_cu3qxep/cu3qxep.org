I like it. The premise is interesting, and you /can/ write.

The economist in me would like to point out that the economics of what Harry is doing don't make sense. If Harry is selling candy at more than retail, then he has no need to risk shoplifting, since he can just buy his product lawfully: his markup is a premium for storing and sneaking them into the school.

In practice, like most stolen goods, he'd probably have to sell them /cheaper/ than retail, unless sneaking them into the school is some sort of a scarce skill. I think that if you had him undersell retail (because it costs him nothing to steal), it would make more sense, and it would justify people protecting him because he brings candy, since he supplies it cheaper than they could get it otherwise.

Interestingly, if this Harry gets sorted into Slytherin, he /really/ wouldn't fit in, since Slytherins consider themselves wizarding aristocracy, and he'll probably be more uncouth than canon; but I can see him being a wheeler-and-dealer, like a younger Slughorn (but without the Potions).

Incoming plot bunny... Speaking of Potions, this is /not/ necessarily where you should take this fic, but suppose that Harry finds his place in Slytherin as this scrappy wheeler-and-dealer. Hermione, due to a slightly different encounter on the train, finds herself in Ravenclaw, has a generally pleasant if uninteresting time there, but, due to a lack of active discouragement from Snape (because not Gryffindor or Harry's friend) finds herself excelling in Potions in particular.

Fast forward five years later. Voldemort is back, and Slytherin increasingly uncomfortable for Harry; but magical items that provide protection and bribes are rather expensive. He's done Potions dealing, but his brewing efforts don't work out very well (he did minimum necessary in Snape's class), and he almost gets caught. Meanwhile, Hermione, the Potions prodigy, also finds herself in desperate need of money. (Not sure what reason. Maybe a Death Eater attack on her family leaves her in need of expensive magical treatment for her parents?)

She approaches him with an offer. It's...
