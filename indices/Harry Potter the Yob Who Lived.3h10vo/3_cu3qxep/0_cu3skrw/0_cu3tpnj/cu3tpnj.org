  It's more the thrill of breaking the rules which Harry likes. Obviously it also increases his profit margin to never buy anything.

That makes sense.

  I'm taking this scenario from my own childhood. Of course plenty of kids snuck in food, but others had parents who wouldn't buy them that much junk food or at least not as much variety, so Harry still get's plenty of business even with the inflated prices (as the lad in my school did, God bless him).

Interesting. I guess they /were/ willing to pay a premium for the convenience.

  That plot bunny will be incorporated somehow (although obviously not exactly). It's too good not to. It's fucking glorious.

"Obviously not exactly"? I am insulted by the "obviously". :D

Think about it: Jerry Potter and Waltermione "Mme. Curie" Granger partnering up to cook the Crystal Ecstasy Potion in the Chamber of Secrets, sneaking ingredients past Filch, with Harry trying to run a crew of distributors, even as Hermione decides that the money to cure her parents isn't enough, because she must also get enough to set herself up in France, so they end up escalating, clashing with the Weasley Crew (because The Twins also cook to raise startup funds for their joke shop), eventually taking out Voldemort because he is in the way of their drug operation.

*Dumbledore:* [upon receiving news that Voldemort has died in a massive explosion, which rumors say was orchestrated by Harry Potter and the mysterious "Madame Curie"] This is completely not how I thought the Prophecy would play out, but... OK. As long as they don't try to poison my lemon drops again.
