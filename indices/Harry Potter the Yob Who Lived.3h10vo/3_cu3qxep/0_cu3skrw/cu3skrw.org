It's more the thrill of breaking the rules which Harry likes. Obviously it also increases his profit margin to never buy anything.

I'm taking this scenario from my own childhood. Of course plenty of kids snuck in food, but others had parents who wouldn't buy them that much junk food or at least not as much variety, so Harry still get's plenty of business even with the inflated prices (as the lad in my school did, God bless him).

That plot bunny will be incorporated somehow (although obviously not exactly). It's too good not to. It's fucking glorious.
