If we go by their canon characters, I doubt Dumbledore could have made anything to make them treat Harry right. Dumbledore chose to place Harry at Privet Drive for several reasons, but the main one was that, as long as they "welcomed" Harry (no matter how badly), it was the safest place of Earth for him.

Because the Dursley's acceptance was vitale for the blood protection, any coercive methods was out of question: Dumbledore could not use threats ("/Take Harry and treat him right, or else . . ./") or magical compulsion (Imperio, Compusing charm or any potion able to manipulate the mind of someone. And that's without talking about the obvious legal/ethical problems brought by these options.

Reasoning with the Dursleys may work, especially if Dumbledore says something along the lines of : "/Because of your relation with Lily, Dark Wizards may attack you to avenge their Master, but you will be protected as long as you take Hary/". But it's something that Dumbledore already did with the letter he left with Harry (which is why Petunia refused to throw him out in OotP), and we all saw how it went.

Paying them would also not work because, as if we could see throughout the serie, the Dursleys are far from desitute, and the reason why they don't take care of Harry is not because they can't afford to, but because they just don't care.\\
Sure, as long as you pay them, they would probably buy Harry new clothes rather than giving him Dudley cast off, and they may even let him stay in a true bedroom, but they would never "love" him. They still wouldn't care about his school reports, the drawing he brings from school would still end up in the trash while Dudley's are put on the fridge, and they would never stop Dudley from doing what he want. And by accepting to pay them, Dumbledore even take the risk of letting them grow greedy and ask more and more outrageous prices.

Nothing could have "truly" change Harry childhood, because his guardians are just not good people from the start.
