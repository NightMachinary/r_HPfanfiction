You can take a look at [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/8][this fic]]. Or should I say abandoned first chapter?

#+begin_quote
  The idea behind this story is to flip all the Bad!Dumbledore tropes on their heads. In this story, Dumbledore knows about the horcruxes and genuinely believes from the beginning that Harry needs to die to defeat Voldemort, but he actually acts rationally about it. As Snape points out in this chapter, the appropriate thing to do is to treat Harry like a child with a terminal illness, and that is what he does. Dumbledore ensures Harry is well cared for and does everything he can to extend his life. He tries to hunt down the other horcruxes as soon as possible, but he also seeks to delay Voldemort's return as long as possible.
