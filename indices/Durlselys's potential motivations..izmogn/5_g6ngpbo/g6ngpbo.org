How about magic itself, rather than the fear of it? Use a compulsion spell or potion on the Dursleys. Put a muggle-repelling charm on Harry's room so he always has a place where they can't go without suddenly remembering something else they need to do. Mess with their minds so they can't see him as anything but normal, maybe by erasing their negative memories of magic and "abnormality" in general, or by putting a spell on Harry to make him always appear normal. Or Harry himself, after fourth year at least, could just set up a magical tent in his room and stock his magical kitchen with food he buys himself. It really is silly that he never uses potions or even his invisibility cloak during the summers. We know the Ministry can't detect enchanted objects; the only reason they knew about the flying car was because muggles saw it.
