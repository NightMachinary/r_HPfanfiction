Money. "I'll give you a stipend if you provide a good home to the boy."

Revenge. "Maybe if we're nice to him, he'll renounce the magicals like Lily should've."

Random changes of heart. "Maybe locking the freak in the cupboard won't make him more normal, after all!"

That's about it really, to my mind.
