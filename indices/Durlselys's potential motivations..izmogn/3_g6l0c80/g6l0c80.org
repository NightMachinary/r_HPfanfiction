There is still an option, which I like, that more respectful asking of Dursleys to take care of their son than leaving a baby on the steps overnight (i.e., virtually doing absolutely anything) could get better results. After all, the most normal behaviour for any normal middle-class family is to take care of orphaned members of the family. Preparing them for accidental magic (it will happen, don't worry, it shouldn't be dangerous, nevertheless if you need help, there is the contact here), explaining that suppressing magic by force can lead to unwelcome results (Obscurial), offering consultation and help, yes, financial support as well, could lead to better behaviour of Dursleys.
