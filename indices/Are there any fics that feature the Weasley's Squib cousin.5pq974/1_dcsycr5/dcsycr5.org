I have used him ias a side character in a couple of stories but I don't think I ever explicitly state who he is - or perhaps very briefly, I forget.

I think the Weasleys don't mention him because he's a squib and they are ashamed or embarrassed. Being a squib is always presented in a negative light in canon as I recall. Bit unfair really.

edit spelling

Also edit because I don't see the Weasleys as being 'terrible at managing money', they just don't have enough of it coming in. Of course that does open up the whole can of worms about the complete illogicality of Rowlings economic system, but that's another matter.
