Aunties are different to cousins. Molly probably grew up seeing her as much as she saw grandparents, but in large families, second cousins don't tend to be very close. Or, in any sized families, really. Teddy and Scorpius, for example, would be second cousins, and I don't see them being that close, except for Scorpius's friendship with Teddy's god-brother.

Cygnus and Walburga Black were second cousins to Arthur. Arthur's mother, was first cousin to their father, Pollux. This makes Arthur second cousin once removed from Bellatrix, etc, and I think Ron and Draco are third cousins once removed.
