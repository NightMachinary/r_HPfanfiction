Huh, I think I've figured out who the cousin is. Cedrella, Arthur's mother, had a first cousin who was a squib, Marius Black - burned off the family tapistry and disowned. Given that his brother was Pollux, who raised Walburga and Cygnus, you can imagine what kind of a messed up kid he was. Raised as a Black, then kicked out to the Muggle world.

He would, in fact, be a first cousin once removed to Arthur, and probably a second cousin to Ron, or close enough that everyone would just use second cousin.

I'm not entirely sure how it works out, since Molly's uncle was married to Marius's first cousin once removed, and Molly wasn't actually blood related, but it's possibly that side of the family took him in.
