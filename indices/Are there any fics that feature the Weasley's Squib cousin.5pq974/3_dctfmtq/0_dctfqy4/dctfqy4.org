There's this one story where the twins basically forced ron to swear on his magic to never tell on them. Then, sometime later, ginny's hurt, I believe, and they basically force him to run and tell their mother which strips his magic. He ends up goong to live with his squib cousin who's actually james bond, not an accountant. It was pretty good if I recall correctly.

Edit: i remember, as much as I dislike Ron, I was really choked up at the end. Then the reveal made me so excited.
