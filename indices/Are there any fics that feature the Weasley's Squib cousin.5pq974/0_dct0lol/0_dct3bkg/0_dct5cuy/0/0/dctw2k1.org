An editorial misspelling.

Probably. Both spellings are common enough, it's like someone not picking up on Rachel vs Rachael, or Mich(a)el, birth certificates and passports make these mistakes more often than you'd think. Because Prewitt is Welsh, it has plenty of different spellings. My boyfriend actually has distant cousins with a differently spelled surname, due to mistakes back before computers.
