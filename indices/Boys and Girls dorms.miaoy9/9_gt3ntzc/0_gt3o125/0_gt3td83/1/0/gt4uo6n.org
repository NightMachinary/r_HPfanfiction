Because even today, as a man, if you told people that a woman raped you, you'd have trouble being taken seriously. OotP was written in early 2000s when as a man if you told someone that a woman raped you, they'd just pat you on the shoulder and say 'lucky guy', the action happens in mid-90s in a school that's still stuck in 1700s. So, yeah, I think that Hogwarts has a long way to go until it decides to remove those charms or add them to the boys dormitory.

I think the idea is that guys can physically overpower girls and they are considered typically the sex-hungry gender. However in this universe the girls are not defenseless either since they have magic.
