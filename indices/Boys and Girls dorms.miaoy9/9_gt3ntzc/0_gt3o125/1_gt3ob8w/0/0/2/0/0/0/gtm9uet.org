"Why are we then making judgements about the morals and habits of an obviously different society? Yes, it has some overlap with our society, but that does not mean we should expect total overlap!"

#+begin_quote
  But I disagree with criticizing the morals of a different fictional society according to our own morals. An author can create a new society, it can be flawed but as long as it is consistent (and I don't think that JKR is consistent, feel free to criticize that!) that's how it is.

Two of your quotes back to back. If we decide to allow for a suspension of disbelief permeate through their society, I'd be willing to bet that the quote about it being a different society would die a horrible death. The reason is due to the fact that one of two things will be proven. One is that it is only as bad as it seems, which, lets face it, is pretty medieval at best.

The second option is that it's a lot worse, with a lot of the things we'd call trauma being brushed off as "learning experiences" by the Wizarding World.

At what point do we stop and say that there's things that need to be addressed about the society Rowling created? Cause I'm of the opinion that it was easy to sneak in a few of her own beliefs into it and brush it off. And we should call attention to things that may not have aged well.

Like the fact that a teacher was extremely biased, the fact that there seemed to have been something going on between an adult and child during the Triwizard Tournament(Krum and Hermione, since only those over 17 could join it), someone managed to get an underaged student into it, and the fact that almost nobody batted an eye at the idea of child soldiers being used to take down the Ministry. Something that, if we're being completely honest, should've been investigated by an outside party to avoid any sort of conflict of interests that would've popped up.
