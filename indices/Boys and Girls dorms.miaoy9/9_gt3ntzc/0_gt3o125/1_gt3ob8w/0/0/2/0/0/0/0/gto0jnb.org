  At what point do we stop and say that there's things that need to be addressed about the society Rowling created? Cause I'm of the opinion that it was easy to sneak in a few of her own beliefs into it and brush it off. And we should call attention to things that may not have aged well.

This is what I'm trying to say: we can think that the society that Rowling has created is quite vicious and outdated (and I totally agree with you here, and it's obvious that at least parts of it are intended to be bad for the story to continue). we can comment that it is so. What I don't think we can do is criticize the author for creating this fictional society. It's like it is by design: with antiqued habits and many many unjust things happening.

Now you, in 2021 consider that some aspects of the society written in 1990's that already wanted to depict an old and flawed society has even more flaws than the author wanted to put there. Well... duuh! I can bet you that in 2050 there will be even much more such flaws.

I mean, would you complain about a book that describes a 1800's schools where the kids are called to the principal office and beaten with a wooden paddle on the naked ass? Yes, it's horrific for us now but that's how our society was at that time. The principal was not doing anything wrong, but what he considered the best think he can do to help those kids. And that's the case with the Harry Potter books.
