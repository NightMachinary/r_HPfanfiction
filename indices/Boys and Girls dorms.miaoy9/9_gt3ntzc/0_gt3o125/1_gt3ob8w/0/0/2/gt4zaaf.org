I disagree. Strongly.

Rowling has ideas that in our current society, especially US and western Europe are starting to be considered outdated. But in the 90's they where not. Also, she describes a different society, that has at least some ideas, habits, rules and morals that are different to ours. That does not make them outdated, but different.

Consider Frank Herbert's Dune. Would any of the societal rules of the fremen be considered outdated? No, it's a different society, molded by needs different than ours, etc.

Why are we then making judgements about the morals and habits of an obviously different society? Yes, it has some overlap with our society, but that does not mean we should expect total overlap!
