  Why are we then making judgements about the morals and habits of an obviously different society? Yes, it has some overlap with our society, but that does not mean we should expect total overlap!

From reading your reply, it seems like you're defending her reasoning, which is your right. However, allow me to regal you with a story.

A kid sat at a computer back in 2000 or so, just playing a game when his aunt came into the room and trailed her finger down the back of his neck and said that she liked her men "a little hairy."

The kid is six years old, and a few months away from turning seven. He doesn't exactly /know/ what that means, but shrugs it off. Almost twenty-one years later, the rest of that year is blocked from his memories save for when he gets nightmares. He thinks he was raped and, having been brought up in a small town that shunned all those who weren't seen as "normal," he kept it buried inside of himself.

Just like he learned to keep his sexuality hidden.

The kid in the story was me. JK Rowling has given us zero reasons as to believe that the Wizarding World has morals that aren't backwards. Case in point: Krum is technically an adult in the world, and was making moves on Hermione, who was underage. I believe that in Deathly Hallows, he was looking at another girl who was underaged. And don't get me started on the idea that there's a different "age of consent" when the Triwizard Tournament was only for "those over the age of seventeen" as they'd be considered adults.
