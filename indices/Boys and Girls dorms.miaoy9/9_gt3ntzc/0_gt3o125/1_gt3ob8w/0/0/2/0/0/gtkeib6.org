Sorry for the late reply, I was not on my computer since I posted that. I don't defend her reasoning. I agree that all societies are flawed, and some people suffer due to the flaws. I agree that our current moral changes seem to better the society overall (but I always keep in mind that all effects of changes become obvious a long time after making a change, so maybe our changes bring some unknown bad along with the obvious good).

But I disagree with criticizing the morals of a different fictional society according to our own morals. An author can create a new society, it can be flawed but as long as it is consistent (and I don't think that JKR is consistent, feel free to criticize that!) that's how it is.

The magical society is flawed. There is rampart discrimination based on birth, the politicians are corrupt, the people are even worse sheep than our people are... and only the girl dormitories are warded against boys (and many other things, like Molly hitting her children, bad teachers, etc). But this is how that world is, and the story has to happen in that world.

And the flaws have a logic inside the book. We have a society with people living for over 100 years as a norm. That society will evolve much slowly than ours (I still have many arguments with my 70y old mother about a lot of our current changes, she would never consider a guy can ever e raped, and when she was young she was quite a rebel and a free thinker).

I also have trauma since my own childhood that should not happen to kids in our generation, and I am 100% sure my kids are getting their own subtle trauma from how I grow them up, but I have no ideea what I do wrong, I'll find some of them out in 20-30 years (ofc I don't want to create that and if I knew, I would not do whatever bad things I do!) and I hope I'll be able to understand and accept the new changes.
