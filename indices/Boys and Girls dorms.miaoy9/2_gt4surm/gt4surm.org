It's part of the ‘Boys can't control themselves around girls, so we'll remove the temptation' mentality. In other words (according to this mindset!), I guess it was felt boys couldn't be responsible for their actions if they're near a girl and get “tempted” to rape her. That, and “good” girls were shamed for having a sex drive, so for them to go up to the boys' dorm was just not ‘proper behaviour'.

I have no idea why it was never changed.
