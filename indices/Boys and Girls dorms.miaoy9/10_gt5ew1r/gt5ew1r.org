I think it's JKR's weird thing about girls being more pure and safe than boys. Like with the baby unicorns who are considered to be the purest creatures only allow girls to touch them and don't trust boys. I don't like the subtle hints that boys aren't trustworthy because they're all kids there who are equally pure and innocent, why start antagonizing the boys at such a young age?

But I also agree with the things other people have said about it being an old mindset and the wizarding world is behind but I still blame this thing on JKR. She's weird.
