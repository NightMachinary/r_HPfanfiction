eh the unicorn thing is not really JKR, that's a pretty universal thing. Also the baby unicorns were fine with boys, just not the adult ones from what I remember.

Unicorns typically are associated with purity/virginity/fair maidens (only being able to be caught by a virgin in the myths) so it's pretty in line with that imo
