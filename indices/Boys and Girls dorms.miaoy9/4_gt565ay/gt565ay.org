It's a product of the author and times it was written in - and even still, men are viewed as more likely to abuse such things. Eg, think of the trope where guys will try to sneak into the women's locker rooms in high school to watch them undress, or all the manga/anime examples of looking at the women's hot springs - it's all the same sort of view.

So definitely, the girls could take advantage of it as well - but, well, that wasn't really the view in the 90s or in JKR's mind. (For the latter, I think we can say that given her more recent statements/views on trans people, that she has biases about those she views as 'men' entering 'women-only' spaces, and that's something that does shine a different light on the subject you mention)

I think I would personally change things around a bit - I feel like both the boys and the girls should be able to go to the others rooms, but that they'd have put some restrictions (eg, the doors being locked except to the people sleeping in the room and professors, or only being allowed during the day or the like). That way friends can hang out with a bit more privacy than the common room would provide.
