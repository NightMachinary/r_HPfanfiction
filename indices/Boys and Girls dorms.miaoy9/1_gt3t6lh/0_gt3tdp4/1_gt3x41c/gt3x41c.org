The thing is, we give on Rowling for this, but even up to the 90s only boys/men were widely thought to be the only ones that raped (and that men couldn't be raped). So, really, it /kinds of/ make sense. I mean, I expect someone as level-headed as Dumbledore or McGonagall wouldn't have thought that way, but since it's background things it's not like Rowling would care or even think about it.
