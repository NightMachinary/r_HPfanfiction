Realistically and for security measures as well as peace of mind, no one aside from the people assigned to a specific dorm should be able to go into that dorm. The only exception being house elves, and professors. The professors needing a specific spell provided by the headmaster to allow entry. With every instance of the spell being used monitored by the school board, requiring an interview with the use of Veritaserum, pensieve memories, unbreakable vow, compulsion charms, and Priori incantatem.
