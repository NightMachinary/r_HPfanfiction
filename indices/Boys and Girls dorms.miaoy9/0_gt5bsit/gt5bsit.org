Okay, I actually have a headcanon that the gender wards on each dormitory are different

Gryffindor prevents boys from entering the girls' dorms but not vice versa. This is because Gryffindor drew from his own experiences of sleeping around a lot and decided that young boys couldn't be trusted (young Godric certainly couldn't have been).

Ravenclaw prevents boys from entering the girls' dorms and girls from entering the boys' dorms. This is because she is an egalitarian who believed in propriety.

Hufflepuff has no gender wards. This is because she was... shall we say... progressive.

Slytherin also has no gender wards, because he didn't want people getting complacent about their safety while they slept.
