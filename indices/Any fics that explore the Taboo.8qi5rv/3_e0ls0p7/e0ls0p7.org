I used it in my fic the Aurors, but for good. If the Aurors knew they were going into a dangerous situation where they might need back up, or were otherwise vulnerable, they could have the taboo placed on them. Freshly inspired by the handmaids tale, I made the word 'mayday'. They could either yell it or subtly slip it into conversation.
