In a couple of fics that I've recently read the author has referred to biscuits for breakfast. They are talking about savoury biscuits, like what we serve in the Southern US. But in the UK, it's my understanding that biscuits refers to cookies. And that they don't eat biscuits and gravy at all, even by another name.
