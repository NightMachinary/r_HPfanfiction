It's a separate country and a member of a union of several countries. That union's quite more combined that, say, the EU, but Wales has its own parliament. It also has a different set of national languages than the UK -- Welsh and English, while the UK's national language is English. It has its own national anthem.

From a cultural standpoint, Wales is chock full of L1 Welsh speakers, unlike the majority of England, and many are monoglots. Wales also fields a number of national sports teams.

Similarly, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are each separate countries within the United Kingdom.

They aren't sovereign -- they can't issue independent passports or set foreign policy. But then, a vassal country is likewise limited in its ability to make foreign policy decisions.
