It does bother me a little (ok, a lot), but in most cases it's understandable.

What I can't tolerate are distinctly American things being used in a fic, which are obviously not British in any way, shape, or form. E.g. Thanksgiving, July 4th, American football... all of which I have seen being used in fics before.

It may seem odd, but the thing I hate the most is the use of 'American names', i.e. names for OCs or whatnot that just wouldn't be used in Britain. I will nope out of a fic the second Harry starts chatting to a 'Brooklyn' or 'Hunter'.

(note that I have nothing against these names, but they just wouldn't exist in 1990s Britain)
