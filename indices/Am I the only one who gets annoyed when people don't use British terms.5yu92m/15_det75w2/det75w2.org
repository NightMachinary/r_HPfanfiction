The main reason why I care about it is that it shows a minimal level of care and /love/ for your story and the HP world if you actually make an effort. If I detect lots of americanism it's one of those indicators that the author doesn't really give a shit and is just publishing an original story transposed into the HP world to get more eyeballs.
