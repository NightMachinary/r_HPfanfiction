It bothers me when it's something massively egregious that breaks me out of the story. I'm not going to lose the plot if someone uses "math" instead of "maths" but if Harry is the quarterback of his 'high school' football team I'm probably going to back out of the story.

This goes both ways, by the by. There are certain cultural elements about fics set in America written by non-Americans that will kill my immersion in the story. Common terms I've seen pop up recently in some fics include the use of the word "hob." That's...not a word in the majority of the United States. If at all.

Generally speaking though, it's pretty easy to figure out if the author is American, from the British Isles, Australian, or doesn't speak English as a first language. Once that is accounted for, I generally overlook minor mistakes as there are some things about cultures that are IMPOSSIBLE to know unless you actually live there. It's the mistakes that show that author has done zero research into what they're writing about that end up annoying me.
