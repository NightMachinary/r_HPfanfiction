I don't really care about it because english isn't really my native language anyways but what annoys me a lot more is when american cultural quirks present themselves in the story.

One of the most annoying ones is when Harry dates a character like Hermione and he meets her Father who is a gun fanatic who tries to intimidate him or something similarly ridiculous.
