As a non-Brit - even worse, someone who's mother language isn't even English, I only get annoyed at very obvious mistakes. There is, of course, the really awful stuff [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sD_8prYOxo][like calling football, soccer]].

Then there is some phrasing and use of words such as "Fucking hell" that puts me off. Its "Bloody hell"... come on!

Also, the British have developed, in their very hearts and through intermingling with continental Europe, as reluctant as they may have been with that, one specific trait. They're polite, but don't mean it. As a matter of fact, the more polite they are the more chance there is they're actually mocking you. I don't close a tab if that is not the case in a fanfiction, but I do appreciate any effort made towards this trait.

Also the Brits call dessert "pudding" which solidifies my conviction that the Brits are islandic weirdos with no sense for cuisine. ^{^{/s}}
