I think you joking, but honestly I would kill for more fucks in US-written fic because I've read stories where Ron's using bloody every other sentence and it it's so. fucking. annoying. We use other swear words, people! There are other ways to express surprise than "bloody hell"! For my sanity's sake, throw in a "merlin's beard" every once in a while!

Seriously, bloody may be quintessentially English, but there are other fucking words. Bugger, bollocks, wanker, twat... there's plenty to choose from.

Okay, I'm done now.
