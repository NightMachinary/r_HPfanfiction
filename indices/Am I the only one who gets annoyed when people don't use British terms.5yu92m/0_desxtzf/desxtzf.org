It annoys me to. But... As an American, I don't know all of the words/phrases that are different in Britain. Some of the obvious ones (soccer>football, trash can>bin, trunk>boot) yeah, but I can say that the Recess>break thing is completely new to me. I try to use British words and spellings when I'm writing a story set in Britain, but I really appreciate it when someone lets me know that I got one wrong lol. So I think it's important to remember that a lot of fanfiction authors aren't British, and they probably just don't know any better.
