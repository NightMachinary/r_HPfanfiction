I disagree. Calling Asian people "yellow people" is offensive, as is referring to a Chinese person as a "chinaman" or calling a Native American a "red person".

Just because the term "black people" is what we use nowadays doesn't mean it can't be considered offensive down the line. That's what happened to "negro" (which black people in the early 1900s called themselves, but nowadays is not appropriate).

It's totally reasonable to assume that the Brits have their own term for black people, even if that term itself is just "black people." I don't see what's wrong in asking that question is all.
