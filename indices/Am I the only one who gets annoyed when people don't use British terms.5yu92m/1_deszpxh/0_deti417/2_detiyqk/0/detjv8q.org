I suppose that works. It is just awkward for me if I want to try and describe someone. Like I say, oh yeah, I was chatting with that nice African American clerk over there, sorry I am late. Calling him black outright feels a bit uncomfortable, but if he is a black dude and there are four white dudes near him, it is the easiest and most obvious descriptor. That's why I was curious.
