Generally, I don't mind /if/ it's third person/narrator voice.

If it's dialogue, I mentally start adding an american accent, and it kinda breaks the immersion a bit, but not a dealbreaker. But one thing to remember, is that "Old-Time" words that your grandad used to say /Is Not/ the same as "British English". I've had to look up a large number of idioms, and that just makes it confusing for me.

My biggest dislike is not the words, but parts of culture, but it's also the hardest part to get right.

Not everyone here had a car when they're 16, but the vast majority have drank (significant amounts) of alcohol by then.

You're more likely to hang around in a town center that happens to have a shopping center, than a 'mall' as it's own thing.

Not everyone in the UK is either a Lord/Lady from some questionably-historically-accurate 'drama', or if they aren't in the top class desperately looking for someone they can swear their families eternal fealty to.

The church in our village is a hodge podge of buildings from around the 12-14th century. My halls of residence at university was a castle dating back to the 11th century. A 'few hundred years' isn't particularly ancient.
