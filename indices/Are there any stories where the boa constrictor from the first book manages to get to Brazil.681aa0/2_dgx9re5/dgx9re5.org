I just had to drop in and say that I love posts like this that ask for Fics that are so outside the box and unusual. Even if there are not any stories, you can bet someone will see this idea and it will possibly inspire something. Perhaps the Boa comes back to Harry as his familiar down the road, or saves Harry from Nagini or something.
