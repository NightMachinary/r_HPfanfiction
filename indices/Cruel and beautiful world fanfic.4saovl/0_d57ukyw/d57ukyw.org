The author's name is Lena Phoria, though she now goes by L. Stoddard Hancock. She took the story down because she revamped and published it as original fiction. Instead of downloading it offline, I would shoot her a message on tumblr and ask if she can send you a copy. She's been very accommodating to people who ask but she doesn't want people to download it from random sources.

Good luck!
