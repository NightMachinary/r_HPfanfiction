There is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681/chapters/29871909][A Dangerous Game]] by Cybrid. It's still in progress (and rather punctual in it's update). Basically, it starts with the Chamber of Secret where Harry arrives too late and lured by Tom himself. He killed the girl (not Ginny; probably Daphne or one of the other background Slytherin girls) and while he tries to kill Harry, they destroy the chamber. They both try to escape. Tom basically kidnaps Harry. I find it both fun and full of suspense. It's rather well written and the characters are really fleshed out (and Tom isn't some cheap version of himself and Harry is still himself, not some Dark version of it).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/17632187/chapters/41574056][God of Nothing]] by Machiavelli (They also wrote Field Theory, with a Slytherin Harry). In an AU where they grow up together at the Orphanage, with no magic, they have to go through the rough reality of the times and the war. It's just beautiful (and violent). A Tom who instead of becoming a Dark Lord is sent to war and become a vicious soldier (I suddenly forgot the exact title/rank in English).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/12061266/chapters/27315231][Aconitum]] . A flower shop au. It's not a pretty cute story but it's Tom. And it's beautifully written.

It goes well with the other flower shop au: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080][Don't Fuck With Florists]] .

Édit: i somehow forgot about Strange Soulmates! [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7035334/chapters/16006603][Good Intentions]] which is a totally AU with no magic and Harry's family being alive. James is a cop, Tom is still a psychopath and Harry is young and cute. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6015619/chapters/13804801][As Certain Dark Things Are to be Loved]] where they were childhood friends and reconnect at uni. It's also an AU without magic but Tom is still Tom: he's got his Death Eaters, is a version of his own Hogwarts' prefect self and Harry has lived through Sirius being wrongfully accused, Quirrell, Draco, the Dursley's, etc.
