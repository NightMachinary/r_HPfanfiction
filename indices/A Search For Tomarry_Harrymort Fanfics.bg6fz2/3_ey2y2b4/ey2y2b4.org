Internet sensation Tom Riddle, now selling his bath water to his adoring fans! Harry is so done.

It's really short, but I enjoyed it.

Something New. by Nerexx

People have been beginning to lose interest in internet sensation Tom Riddle. That's where Harry get's dragged in.\\
Tom is basically the Belle Delphine in this world

This fic was inspired by $30 for 8 oz, and it's how I found it. The last chapter is coming out tomorrow. Again, it's short, but good read in my opinion.
