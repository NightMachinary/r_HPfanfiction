I mean some of them can be subjective (like say the quality of the wand - Krum (and probably his entire wizarding culture) believes that Gregorovitch is the best wand maker) or are canon (African wizards do not use wands IIRC).

However, I guess they state that as a fact, rather than an opinion.

I mean, I get that JKR's wizarding culture has downsides - but so does every culture.

And let's be honest - who would wanna read that?
