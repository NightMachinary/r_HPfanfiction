No, they try to make it better than perfect. There was no prejudice against muggleborn, vampires, werewolfs,goblins,elves and other magical creatures, like that was possible.

Wizards get their wand at the age of six and allowed to do magic outside the school, like kids would be responsible.

Ollivander wands are second rate. Yeah Voldemort uses something inferior, that dampens his power.

Or they won't use wands at all. Instead they uses staffs or rings or something else.

In manipulative Dumbledore stories, Dumbledore was just an average wizard and any auror can defeat him.

They use computers, cause they are not ignorant and prejudiced like their british counterparts.

British government was a control bitch and doesn't allow people to learn anything except light magic. In truth there was no light or dark magic everything was just magic and only intention matters. Tell that to horcruxes and inferi creation.
