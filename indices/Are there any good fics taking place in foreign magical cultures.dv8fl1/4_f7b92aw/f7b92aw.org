It would be kind of cool to write about lost and forgotten cultures with a lot of OCs, like Covens or druidism, or Medicine Men/Women.

Usually those things have an OP Harry learn them from books or whatever (guilty of that myself), but I have yet to read about OCs in such cultures be the focus instead of Harry learning those magics for whatever reason.
