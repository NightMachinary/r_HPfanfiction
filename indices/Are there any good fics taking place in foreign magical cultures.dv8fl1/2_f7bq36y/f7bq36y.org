Most fics are only in other cultures for brief stints of time rather than the whole fic. Nevertheless, I will throw out some fics with different renditions of the non-British wizarding world:

- linkffn(Dagger and Rose): this fic has Dumbledore mentoring Harry post-PoA, and there is a quite a bit of adventuring and worldbuilding as they go.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): this is a highly AU version of the magical world and is /very/ dark (grimdark), but there is quite a bit of foreign worldbuilding in the trilogy with Harry visiting multiple countries (including the war-torn magical Americas).
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): this fic is a gargantuan piece of worldbuilding and storytelling, with a strong point in its characterizations (see: every scene with Voldemort or Snape). Most of the foreign stuff is in Ireland, France and Germany around and after 4th year.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): this fic starts pretty shallowly, but if you get past the first ~5 chapters it improves significantly. The highlight and my favorite parts are Dumbledore and Harry adventuring in Ch. 12-18 in numerous different countries. As a teaser, at different points the two are fighting off an undead Basilisk and tracking down a Chinese dark lord with a penchant for the Imperius Curse.
- linkffn(A Long Journey Home): this a time-travel fic where we see fem!Harry going through many of the magical cultures in her past lifetime. Decent story that is best at the atmosphere it creates.
- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a true classic, this story features a 2nd person look at Harry in magical Brazil as a cursebreaker in training post-OOTP. The fic is a bit Indy!Harry, but a lot of the personality, cleverness and sense of adventure make it worthwhile.

I have more, but I think thats enough for now.
