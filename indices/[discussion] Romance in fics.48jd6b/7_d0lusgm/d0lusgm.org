What I loathe the most is a character suddenly going out of character so that the romance can work. Harry/Tonks is the absolute worst for this. In order to make this work, so many people make Harry super confident and 'witty' in a way which loses all resemblance to the character.

I just don't see Harry as that sexual. He rarely has crushes or notices people. If he suddenly starts going super playboy, l roll my eyes and back button out. You need character developments and interactions to show a romance can work. Not just 'he was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?' (I'm looking at you, JKR, with your Harry/Ginny and your Remus/Tonks.)
