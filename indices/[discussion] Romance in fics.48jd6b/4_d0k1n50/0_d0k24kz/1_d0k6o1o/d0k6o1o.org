It's different for each person how old they are when they first start feeling romantic feelings. Some have it when they are 5-6, some only start having feelings like that when they are 14-15.

I don't think it says anywhere that magical kids mature faster than normal ones, that's just fanon, created by people who want to speed up their pairing. And we don't know when James first started feeling for Lily. All we know is that he asked her to go out with him during that scene with Snape. And later Snape says that James fancies her. We don't know anything else.

When you're that young (10-15), you will go through changes, as will your romantic feelings (exceptions are there of course). Plus, as a young teenager, you often lack the empathy to be in a good, healthy, lasting relationship. And hormones will often cloud your perception and that can lead to fights etc.

Not to say that romantic feelings aren't true at that age, they can be earth-movingly intense, but it's more than often temporary. And there's a difference between a crush and love. I couldn't tell you what it is to be in a relationship with the one you love, but it's safe to say that it's something else entirely.
