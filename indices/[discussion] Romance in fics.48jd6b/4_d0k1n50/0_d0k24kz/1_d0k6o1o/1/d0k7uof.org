I'd have to agree with maturity thing in HP. We read Harry Potter in the POV of a kid who had the world on his shoulders so perhaps some thought that other magical kids would also be mature in a similar way. It makes sense but the fandom amped it up to a whole other level. While it makes sense for them to worry about the state of things and want to fight Voldemort and think about sex. A fourteen year old should not be able to buy a house in ANY fic, it just makes it silly.
