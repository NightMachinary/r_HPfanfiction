  It's different for each person how old they are when they first start feeling romantic feelings. Some have it when they are 5-6, some only start having feelings like that when they are 14-15.

Everyone is indeed different, but if you read up on the research of child development experts, you'll find that 5-6 is normal age for first crushes to develop. It usually involves a bit of hand holding and occasional kisses on the cheek if the feelings are reciprocated in any way. Sometimes they will even go so far as to "marry".

It's not a real romantic relationship, obviously, but if the first tentative steps are starting by the age of five, it's no surprise if something a little more serious might develop by twelve.

  I don't think it says anywhere that magical kids mature faster than normal

I didn't say it did, I said "/it's fair to argue/ that magical kids mature faster than muggle kids." They are given and then trained in the use of what amounts to a deadly weapon at the age of eleven. At the age of thirteen they are, all on their own, with little or no input, choosing classes that will help determine their careers. They are left for long periods of time with little or no adult supervision in an old castle. They start making actual decisions about careers at the age of fifteen. They seem finish enough schooling by the age of seventeen to start on high-level professional career tracks.

That's all at least two to four years in advance of similar progress among muggle kids.
