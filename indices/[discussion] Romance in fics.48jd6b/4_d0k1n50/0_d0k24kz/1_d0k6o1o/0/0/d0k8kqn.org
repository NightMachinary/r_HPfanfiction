Your argument about the responsibilities of magical children is good, but I don't really agree with it. Maturity isn't a bar you fill, or something you can measure in percentages. True, children in warzones, children who have to stand on their own two feet and children who know the harsh consequences of a big mistake handle pressure and responsibility much better than their peers. Harry's a perfect example of it, because he shows that while you can be very mature in some areas (facing Voldemort and fighting back, handling life and death situations extremely well) he's very underdeveloped in others (his date with Cho, afraid to go into a girl's bathroom during CoS).

I don't think more responsibility will make magical children develop steady relationships at an earlier age. Not necessarily, anyway.

But in the end, it's a story, and the author has every right to bend whatever rule to make their story click.
