Yet kids tend to have their first crush at 5 or 6, and it's typical at that age for kids to imitate the trappings of real relationships they see around them.

On top of that, it's fair to argue that magical kids mature faster than muggle kids.

So you're right that a fully functional a romantic relationship is beyond the 11-year-olds of Hogwarts, but the first steps of trying may not be, and with a little dose of magic, it's not unreasonable for some of those early steps to transform into something later.

In canon, James latched onto the idea that Lily was the girl for him right during the first train ride, didn't he? It was only because he was a toerag that they didn't at least start holding hands or something in first year. So I'd say that there is even canon support for at least the /possibility/ of a lifelong romantic relationship getting its first, tentative steps as early as first year.

Unlikely, to be sure, but not categorically impossible.
