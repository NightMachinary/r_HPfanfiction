Those fics are largely because they can't make the characters personally interact so they need to force the issue. Harry and Draco don't really engage beyond Draco making snide comments, so something needs to push them. Snape and Hermione have a lot in common, but also loathe each other and avoid each other where possible.

"You must get married/have sex/be in close proximity to one another, or else."

Boom. Incentive to work on those issues!

It's very rarely "Harry and Hermione were soul bonded. Which worked out fine because she was totally type A and he was very intuitive and reactive with a better sense of perspective," or "Harry and Luna were sympathetically traumatised children together and it was super sweet".
