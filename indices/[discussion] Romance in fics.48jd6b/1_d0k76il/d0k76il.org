Romance is different for everyone, isn't it? For me, the moments I realized I fancied someone were when I was alone, thinking about that person. It never started in the middle of a conversation. But that's just me.

Remember that the story written by a person, and they will probably use their own experiences in writing. Often times a work of fiction is actually an autobiography in disguise. Not that there's something wrong with that, of course.

But you do have a point that the "he looked at her and he momentarily forgot to breathe [...massive internal monologue...]" trope is used very often in fanfiction. Sometimes it works with the style and focus of the fic, sometimes it doesn't.

I don't hate it. It's often fun to read if the writer can properly convey those feelings to the reader. But I do dislike those moments where the protagonist has a massive internal monologue right in the middle of a conversation, which leads to awkward moments. I'm more of a rambler myself in those situations, so I can't imagine just staring at someone and not saying anything to them. It feels strange when I read something like that and it stands out too much.
