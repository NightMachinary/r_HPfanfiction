It depends on the context. If it's eleven year olds and they fall madly in love with an accidental magical "bond" or they're "mates" than yes it's a major turn off. But if they are say seventeen and it's the amazing mystical bond or mate thing then I'll enjoy it and probably even love it.

However that's probably not what you were thinking about in terms of romance. I don't think HP fan fiction really has the canon material to write a good "love at first sight" romance. I'm not saying that the writers are incapable of producing well written romance I just happen to believe that because HP was not primarily a romance or IMO have a slow build relationship that was the main story of two people falling in love and being together. I often look elsewhere for my romance fix.

Again there can be some great romance for HP but often times I believe the tone doesn't match with the romance or it becomes weird and sloppy. The latter often seen in my experience with A LOT when Harry is the main character.

No not a heartless bastard I don't often really like what's offered in romance section for this fandom.
