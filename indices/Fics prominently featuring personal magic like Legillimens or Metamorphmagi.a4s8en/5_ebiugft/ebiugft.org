Legilimency/Occlumency aren't character traits, are they? Some people might be more adept at it due to their personalities (for example, Severus being a natural Occlumens due to childhood abuse leading to him using emotional shutdown as a strategy), but it isn't genetic the way Metamorphmagi are.

Anyway, linkffn(The Mind Arts) is a fic that focuses on... well, the mind arts. linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted) focuses on Metamorphmagus abilities.
