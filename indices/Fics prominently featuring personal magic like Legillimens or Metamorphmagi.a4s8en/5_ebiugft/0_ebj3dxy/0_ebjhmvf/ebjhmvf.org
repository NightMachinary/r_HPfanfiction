Nah, hereditary magical traits was a fanfiction trope long before the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies came out. For example, the ability to perform Legilimency and Occlumency are seperate hereditary traits in "The Well Groomed Mind", which was published starting in 2012. I've seen the same concept in a few other fics but I can't remember them off the top of my head.
