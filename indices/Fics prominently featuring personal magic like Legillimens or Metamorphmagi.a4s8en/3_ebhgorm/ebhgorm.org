[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059][Holly at Howarts]] is an entire series focusing on Dudley's daughter Holly, who is an empath, meaning she feels the emotions and pain of everyone around her as if they were her own.

It's presented as a rare gift that only happens once or twice in a generation and Holly spends a lot of time learning to control her gift so she can properly differentiate other people's emotions from her own and block out pain so she doesn't get completely crippled by other people getting injured in her vicinity.

It's a really great series and I can definitely recommend it.
