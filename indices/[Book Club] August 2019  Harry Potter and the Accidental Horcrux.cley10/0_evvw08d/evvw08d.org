I liked this fic for the (mostly) well written interaction between Harry and the scarcrux. There are some great moments where Harry has to deal with the consequences of his choices. However, since first reading this fic I've read others that handed that plot seed better. All in all, I have mixed feelings about this one.

The main issue I have with this fic is the author's choice to follow the stations of canon so closely. This was particularly ridiculous in 4th year when Harry managed to entirely avert Voldemort's Triwizard plans early on. It looked like the author might finally take the plot in a new and interesting direction after that, but then at the final hour the author just stuck in a deus ex machina of Harry getting randomly kidnapped by a Death Eater, so the resurrection happened in nearly the exact same way as canon regardless. It felt like the author was blatantly phoning it in because they wouldn't make the effort to come up with an original plotline even when it makes the most sense to diverge.

The fic does have its strengths, namely the well crafted interaction between characters. I loved the twisted mentor-mentee relationship between Harry and the horcrux. Their talks with Dumbledore were some of the best moments in the fic. The relationship between Harry and his friends was also well-written (though painfully tropey sometimes).

Unfortunately, in more recent chapters the author almost completely axed the interaction between Harry and the scarcrux. There's a plot reason, but it's so contrived that I'm left with the impression the author just got tired of inventing the scarcrux's dialogue and tried to write the character out of the story. It's a very dissapointing and baffling choice to me because the scarcrux has been a central character from the beginning, and it's the only aspect of the plot that I really enjoyed.
