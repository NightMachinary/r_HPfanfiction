  However, since first reading this fic I've read others that handed that plot seed better. All in all, I have mixed feelings about this one.

Do you have any examples of ones that did the scarcrux plot better? I really like the interactions between them in this fic and would love to read more fics with this plot line.

I fully agree with your review. The dialogue and the twisted mentor relationship between Harry and scarcrux was very well done but the reliance of the author on stations of canon just drives me crazy. I do like this fic overall though.
