"Hit the Ground Running" by Tozette (completed in 2014) is the closest I've seen to "Accidental Horcrux", though its plot only spanned year one. Unfortunately Tozette took it down, but it was truly an excelent fic.

Other scarcrux fics go in very different directions. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12780767/1/A-Memory-of-Shadow][A Memory of Shadow]] starts in the summer after first year and has a somewhat softer personality for the scarcrux. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] takes the 'befriend the scarcrux' idea and runs off at high speed in a bizarre but somehow amazing direction that occasionally leaves you looking at the stations of canon in the rear-view mirror with a dazed and confused expression.

I've read a few other fics in which Harry talks to a horcrux in his head, but these are the only ones I can remember off the top of my head from favorites.
