I havent read Accidental Horcrux specifically, so I wouldnt know. But in general, I find splits like that are usually arbitrary. For example the Arithmancer, it ends at year 4, but the ending of year 4 doesnt finish the plot any more than the endings of year 1,2,3 do. Same with the brightest witch in the darkest house. If canon was split at end of year 4 randomly I would put it here too. I would call a fic complete if there is a complete change in plot/setting/tone for the sequel, aka something like Voldemort dies and then you have a sequel. The Changeling does that.

I dont know in which the accidental horcrux goes.
