I read it a while a couple of years ago, so I am vague on details, but it stuck with me- I was just thinking about it recently. In my opinion, it has some of the best development of characters who we hardly know in books. Avery and Theodore Nott are the ones I remember , but I think there was also a friendship with Anthony Goldstein? And the angst was pretty bleakly scary at times, which can be hard to achieve. I'd give it 8/10.
