The problem with this fic is that I forgot it pretty much immediately after I read it, which speaks to the quality, good enough to read bad enough to forget. What I can recall is often sub par writing, long winded repetitiveness, and endless angst. Nothing especially interesting or distinctive to separate it from other fics using the same hooks. I can't remember the plot, but I'd bet on a canon rehash. I never got through the sequel.
