I second Brown Coat, Green Eyes.

I meant to ask this very same question this morning, but what I'd love to hear about are people's favourite crossovers where the other series /isn't/ that popular. Something unique but awesome where someone's melded their favourite little-known book/movie/cartoon with HP and done it right.
