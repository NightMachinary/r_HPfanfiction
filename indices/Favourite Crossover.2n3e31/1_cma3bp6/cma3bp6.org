The Denarian series by shezza is my favorite Dresden crossover. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza]]

My favorite Star Wars crossover: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]

Wand and Shield is the most well-known Avengers crossover and for good reason. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield]]

This Avengers crossover is short but has a lot of potential imo. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8582660/1/Of-Hel-and-Earth]]
