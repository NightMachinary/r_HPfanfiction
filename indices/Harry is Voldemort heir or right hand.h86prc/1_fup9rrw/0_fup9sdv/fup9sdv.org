  AU Fourth Book. Fleur was the champion of her school, she was more than a 2D character, more than a pretty face. Harry Potter was destined to be Dark Lord's equal, the next Albus Dumbledore. And the Triwizard Tournament was meant to only have three companies. No godmoding. Dyslexic author. Written for reviewers' Fleur/Harry pairing requests. Might update 2021.
