And still the one thing they haven't added is justified text. For some reason I fail to understand this. Whenever I read fanfiction anything I prefer it like that. Do I just have some weird form of OCD or are there other people that get annoyed by it? The thing I like about AO3 is that I can download the fic and then use ReadEra.

That's what I use; ReadEra. Simple and nice customisation.
