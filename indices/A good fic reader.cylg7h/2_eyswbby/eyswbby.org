I usually download all fics as ePubs (I use [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][fanficfare]] on the command line, but it also works as a plugin for Calibre), and then I can read them with absolutely any ePub reader (there is plenty of them). Another benefit is that I have now archive of plenty of fics, which are not available any more.
