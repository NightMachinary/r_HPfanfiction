As a child, he definitely did. It is right there in the conflicting choice he was faced with. It is right there in every humiliation and his isolation. He cared. It is why his anger and pain turned to bitterness,resentment and hate. He hated himself for not knowing or being able to deal with it and he hated others for putting him in that position.

As an adult, he take ownership of his own guilt when he pledges himself to protecting Harry. He accepts that he has to face whatever comes in order to keep Harry alive and see Voldemort dead. I think perhaps the only person whose opinion he really cares about is Dumbledore's.
