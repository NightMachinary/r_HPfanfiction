There is a difference between caring how people perceive you for purely practical reasons, which is what most of your examples are of, and caring about it for emotional reasons -- i.e. preferring people to respect you/be kind to you/etc. Snape definitely always cared in the former case, but his behaviour sometimes suggest that he didn't care /emotionally/ how people thought about him, which I figured is what OP asked for.
