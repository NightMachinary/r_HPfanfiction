Maybe you're right, but I think it'd be hard for a human to distinguish one from the other and not conflate the two. And Snape's reactions to a bunch of scenarios demonstrate him as someone who can't use his supposed Occlumency mastery to do that well either.

His reaction to memory leak, his final dialogue with Harry before his death, his interactions with Draco, Narcissa, and Bella: I think at least these three count towards both types you've described.

Oh, and he goes out of his way to make people aware of Lupin's nature in 3rd year as well. Which implies Lupin's another person whose opinion and state of mind he's interested in. Otherwise he would've just been /indifferent,/ and at most gone through the motions of making wolfsbane for Lupin because Dumbledore told him to.
