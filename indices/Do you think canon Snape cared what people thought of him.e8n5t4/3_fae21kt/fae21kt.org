Just by being a professor he would /have/ to care how his students perceived him (what they thought of him), because a class of school-age children can easily turn into a zoo if the teacher-figure fails to make them fear or respect them.

He cared about Harry finding out about his school past and memories enough to become enraged, cancel the occlumency lessons despite Dumbledore's orders, and, arguably, cause for Harry to keep having a backdoor inside his head that was used by VD on multiple occasions and even lead to an ally's death.

The "person x doesn't care what others think of them" is a silly notion to me in general, to be honest. Unless that person is a hermit living in complete isolation, no matter how they'd like to see themselves, they obviously care about opinions of others about them. Because opinions dictate treatment and determine available developments in social interactions.

He heavily penalised house points for even a perceived disrespect from students. He wanted Draco to see him as enough of an authority figure to follow his directions and heed his advice. He wanted Narcissa and Bella to trust him and see him as competent enough to be included in their little family meeting, etc, etc.
