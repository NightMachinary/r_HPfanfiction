First, you know you aren't alone because you asked how everyone else deals with these types of reviews. So take a minute and think about that. No really, think about that. EVERYONE gets these reviews. That story you were blown away by, the one that made you cry, made you laugh, inspired you to put fingers to keys. Yep, that story, that one, that author has one if these reviews. Think of them as the bus you miss by a minute, the traffic jam when you're going on holiday, the hole in the toe of your favourite socks. They suck, but they shouldn't/don't stop you doing you. They are part and parcel of trying.

If it helps I once got a review from a reader, which, because my chapter length was a tad long, was split over three separate reviews (lucky me) and culminated in the pronoucment that I had RUINED their Thanksgiving. (Not being American I was a bit nonplussed and felt only slightly sorry.) It was chapter 52 and to me, one if the weakest chapters in my fic so I was a bit sensitive about it. I took a break and did a bit of reviewing of the chapter trying to prop up the bits I thought were poor and gave myself a day to indulge in self pity, but ultimately carried on and completed my story. So, in the spirit of answering your question here's a piece of only mildly related 'sage advice' that I learnt as a hapless teenaged equestrian - if you fall off the horse you have to get straight back on or you'll loose your nerve. You might get hurt, you might be afraid, but you will never get good at it if you stay on the ground.
