Thank you <3 I think the thing that makes it a sore spot for me is - yes, even the greats get downright cruel reviews sometimes, but...they're the greats. I'm just a 'new' author on my first story in ages, that had not too much attention, and someone already hated it SO much.

Also, I don't get how a fic (even a bad one) can ruin anyone's day - your reviewer sounds ridiculous!
