This was the 'name' of my anon flamer, and the word itself makes me mentally flinch a little bit now. I didn't know someone could pack so much seething hatred and condescension into such a short word..

It almost sounds like we had the same reviewer, honestly. Sharp tongued, seemingly intelligent enough, and able to cut right to the bone with what they say. :(

Harry Crow - agh. That was one I liked initially, it started out interesting enough, but I just couldn't finish it. To me, it wasn't bad, just SUPER not my style that I liked to read.

Thank you <3
