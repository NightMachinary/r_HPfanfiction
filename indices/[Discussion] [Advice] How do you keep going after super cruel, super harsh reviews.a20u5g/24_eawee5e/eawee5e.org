Your "reviewer" was just a dick.

Even if he might've had a point or two -- like you said above -- he didn't have to be a complete asshole about it. There's a difference between harsh criticism and plain meanness.

You'll have to learn to ignore this stuff, though. Cruelty hurts and it's shitty, but there's really nothing else for it. Taking what is true and leaving the rest behind like the garbage it is, that's the only thing you can do as a writer. No one is going to be loved 100%.
