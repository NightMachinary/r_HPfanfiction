On the very first fanfic I ever posted, I got added into a community called "The Horrors of [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]" lol + received a review from who I believe was the community's moderator. I can't seem to find the review anymore but it pretty much was a very disheartening one that really discouraged me from continuing the fic. But there were a lot of other reviews who encouraged me and my story regardless, despite my admittedly less than stellar abilities to write lol.

​

But at the end of the day, I just thought to myself "Why am I writing this fic"? It's not like I'm aiming to impress anyone in particular. I just want to write the kind of stuff I want to read and hopefully improve along the way! I want to have fun doing what I'm having fun doing without worrying too much about highly negative reviews. I usually just thought along these lines while trying to stay positive about it.

​

That being said, I'm really sorry that happened to you. I hope you continue to write more in the future!
