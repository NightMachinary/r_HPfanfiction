that connection between your brain and the keyboard probably isn't going to become clearer on its own. if you have an interest or a passion like that, you owe it to yourself to develop it. positive recognition on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] is a nice side effect :)

also, cut yourself some slack. it takes some courage to post a story for public consumption (or at least I imagine that I'd be quite anxious about it if I wrote). it sucks that such a negative reviewer found you early on. don't let them ruin it for you.
