It's not good - I freely admit. I rushed it, I was excited to write again, and it shows. They're OOC and the idea and execution are weak, and I should have used different people OR made it longer and went more in depth on why _____ was doing/saying/acting _____. Flamer was super right about that. I just wish they hadn't torn me a new one about the writing, quotes, references, and all the rest as well. I'll PM, but be warned, it's weak. I'm kind of embarrassed of it now, tbh.
