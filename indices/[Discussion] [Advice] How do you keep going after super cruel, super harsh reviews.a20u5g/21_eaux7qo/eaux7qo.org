1. now you've got me interested in your story. pm?
2. as you say: even though there might be relevant (even constructive?) criticism contained in these reviews, if the tone overall is this hostile, you're dealing with someone battling some kind of demons or whatever. say a prayer for them, if you want, but realize that this isn't personal. something about your story may have triggered the hate, but it's not really about you.
3. another option is that you have not just triggered some kind of unconscious response, but that you have actually encountered malevolence. someone doing their best to hurt you just because they want to. if you feel that is the case, definitely report the reviewer. And ignore everything they wrote.
