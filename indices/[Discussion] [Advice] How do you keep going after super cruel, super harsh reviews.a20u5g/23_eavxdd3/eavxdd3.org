Someone simply said that my Hermione started to be way out of character and it has weirdly bothered me enough to not post the next chapter. That was 11 months ago..

I've definitely read some out of character fics but never felt the need to shit on the author by writing a horrible review.

Others asked for me to continue but for some reason I'm second-guessing my ability... Despite fan- fiction being the most out of character a story could get!

I would keep going if I were you. SCREW. THE. REVIEW. Challenge yourself to write better. Challenge your story and figure out how to make it a winning star that YOU love. Don't let them stop you from writing - they've already forgotten and moved on to criticise someone else while you're still mulling over this.

Keep going! x
