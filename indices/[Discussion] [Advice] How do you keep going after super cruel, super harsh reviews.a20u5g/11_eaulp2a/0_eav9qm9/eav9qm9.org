I really appreciate this! But I have to admit upfront - the story IS rather bad. Looking back, I got way too excited to write again, and didn't take the time to characterize well. It's OOC and the idea execution is a mess. I really should have used different characters or made it MUCH longer so I could delve into some backstory on WHY people were acting oddly.

If you'd want to read it and let me know about the writing in general, but ignoring the ridiculous plot and Hermione, though - I'll send it along <3 thank you!
