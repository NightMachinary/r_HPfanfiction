Spacebattles, actually. The Mods [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/16247085/][had to intervene about three times]] until the last idiot of the bunch got the message that they weren't "providing blunt criticism" but breaking the site rules.

But that's par for the course - a lot of people don't understand that just because they don't like something doesn't mean it's shit. And a lot of people can't manage to criticise something without insulting people - pretty much the minimum standard for criticism that deserves to be taken seriously.
