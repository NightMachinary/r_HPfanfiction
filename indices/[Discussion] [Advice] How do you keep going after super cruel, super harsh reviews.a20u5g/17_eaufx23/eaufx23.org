I know where you're coming from - I had a whole bunch of people gang up on me when I posted my first story on a forum.

It's really simple: If someone isn't providing respectful criticism, then you can and should disregard it. The opinion of people who cannot be bothered to be polite when reviewing fanfiction are worthless; they're not writing to help you; they're trying to bully you and score "points" with their clique.

They're not objective - they're just trolls.
