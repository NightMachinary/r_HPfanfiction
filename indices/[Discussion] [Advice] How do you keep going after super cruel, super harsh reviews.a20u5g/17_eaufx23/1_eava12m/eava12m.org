I wasn't sure if reddit would be nicer or meaner in reviews, at first. Back when I used to post (10-12 years back) FF.N reviewers were generally super supportive and nice, and even the flames didn't have THAT much personal attack quality to them. Actually, I worried reddit would tear me apart and FF.N would be neutral. Though, the guy apparently came from reddit in the first place.
