This is almost definitely a troll, and the other commenters so far have given useful feedback, but I know for me that having as many ways of framing things as possible helps, so I'll say this.

Even if you are as terrible at writing as the troll says, which I highly doubt, there's nothing terrible about sharing terrible fanfiction. I've read my share of fanfiction, and if it's outright terrible, I don't make it to the bottom to even review it. Even if it's mostly terrible, there's going to be something that drew me through it. Like maybe it was a structurless mess that I couldn't follow, but the dialogue was great and the characters felt alive while reading it. Maybe the spelling was really bad, but the core was solid so I could enjoy the story enough to get over my confusion at words.

Even if it's just a self-insurt or a deliberate sob-fest, those have their place. Fanfiction is a realm to explore yourself as a writer, without the obligation to make new characters every time. It doesn't have to be good. The more you practice, the better you'll get.

I wish you all the luck.
