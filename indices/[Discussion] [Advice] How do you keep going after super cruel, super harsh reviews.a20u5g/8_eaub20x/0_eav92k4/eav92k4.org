Thank you! And I get where you're coming from with the 'draw' to certain things. I usually dislike self-inserts, but I've read one that I absolutely loved. I can't remember the name now, but the self-insert was Ginny's twin sister who had read all the books before getting tossed into HP universe, and was really weak physically, but awesome magically. Even the description had me going 'eh, this sounds a little silly..', but reading it had me hooked instantly.

I also LOVE this older fic that, looking back, has some questionable writing off and on, but the plot and the portrayal of Ron kept me going; I've reread it probably 7 or 8 times. (Recnac Transfaerso by Celebony).

Thank you for taking the time for your comment - seeing all of this and reading other people's experiences makes me feel a lot better, even if I don't know if I'm ready to get back on the horse just yet.
