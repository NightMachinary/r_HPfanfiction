The sad truth is that this will not be the last cruel review you will receive. People are unkind for no reason and give it no thought. However, something that I always thought about whenever I got reviews like that is, "the person who wrote those words likely is not even thinking about it now, so why should I? Why should I give them the satisfaction of letting their words hurt me when they themselves aren't even consciously aware of them anymore?" and that really helps.

Another think I learned (from Stephen King) is to have someone is trusted and loved to read your material first before ever showing it to anyone else. This person will be honest in their critique, but also loving in the way they deliver it as to make it more conducive to a writing environment. Me personally, I have my cousin or my aunt. They both rock and are lovingly honest with me.

I wish you luck in your future endeavors and remember, write for yourself first and your audience second. That is a key to being happy with your writing.
