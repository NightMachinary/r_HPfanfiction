  You're wasting your time and ours.

I mean, if this guy really feels that his supposedly valuable time is being wasted by reading your fic, then why in the name of Merlin's most baggy Y fronts is he wasting his time writing a review to it?

I know I'm being harsh (and a bit stupid), but I don't think you should bother yourselves with reviews from people who've written zip zilch nada themselves, unless of course it's constructive criticism. I've always had this problem with movie critics who love to shit on movies. Yes, the movie was probably crap, but what gives you the moral high ground to demean it? If you were so talented at understanding cinematic nuance, then why the fuck don't /you/ go out and make something on your own, even if it's a five minute short film?
