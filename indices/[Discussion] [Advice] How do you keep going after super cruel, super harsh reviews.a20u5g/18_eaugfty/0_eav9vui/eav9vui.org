He found me on reddit and had a bone to pick, I guess. Maybe something I'd said somewhere else pissed him off and he followed me. :/

The reason it bugs me is that he hit me in places where I was already weak and worried about, so it just sort of confirmed all my worst thoughts. It's one thing to know "everyone is their own worst critic", and another to have an outside party say "yeah, and you're right to be, you worthless loser".
