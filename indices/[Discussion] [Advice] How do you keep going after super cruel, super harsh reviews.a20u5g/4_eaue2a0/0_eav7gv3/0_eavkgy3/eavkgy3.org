Did /you/ like it? Because quite often, I'm writing HP fanfiction because this particular plot doesn't exist.

Also, was your plot better or worse than 'Harry has Draco's baby' or 'Draco has Harry's baby' or 'Harry Potter inherits somehow-ignored vaults from one or all Four Founders that none of his recent ancestors did and goes on to Show Everyone Up'? (I think there is room in the world for all those fics too).
