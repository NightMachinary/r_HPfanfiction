Decide if you want to take the criticism and apply it to improve your stories or... don't.

You're writing free fiction that you couldn't make a profit on anyway for people that /choose/ to read it.

Write for you, and, if you choose to take constructive criticism, do so for you: because you think the criticism will improve your writing and because you /want/ to improve your writing.
