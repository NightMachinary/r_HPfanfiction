Mine was anonymous (of course), so I guess I can assume they haven't written anything either. Maybe I shouldn't allow anon-reviewers, but in the past (those 10-12 years back, when my stories were MUCH worse) I liked to hear from the people who don't have an account and just want to read.

Thank you, this and all the other comments is making me feel a lot better. It's just that the reviewer attacked the crap I was already super worried about, so it just had sort of validated all of my worst fears.
