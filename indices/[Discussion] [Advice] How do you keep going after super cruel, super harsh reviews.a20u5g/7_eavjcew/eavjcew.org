I have been reading fanfiction for over 15 years now and I have read some really horrible ones, but not once have I left a bad review. I just close the story and look for something else. The reason I do this because I also used to write fanfiction (years ago and in German) and while I got some supportive feedback like "I liked this part, where you...", a lot of the feedback was very demotivating. Germans are sometimes real stickler for grammar rules. I was 14/15 and got reviews nitpicking my grammar, syntax and punctuation. But there was one review which stopped me from writing, while I usually wrote Alias fanfiction, this was my first (and so far only!) Harry Potter fanfiction. I made a one shot, changing the timeline after the 3rd book when Wormtail was randomly caught by McGonagall and concentrated on how happy Harry was to have a family. The review was "Changing the events of the canon because you don't agree with it, is a weak and cheap writing idea which makes all following books obsolete" ... That's what fanfiction is for!

Maybe I'll pick it up again but this time in English, don't want to write in German ever again :/
