Oh this was in the early days of the HP community and especially the German fan community. German fanfiction was/ is very different from English considering tropes, styles and format. This was also before book 5 came out and during the very long wait for the next book I had just started hanging out in forums. The Harry Potter forum I frequented had a great community with lot's of things going on and that year they had this Fanfiction competition , which I had written the one shot for. The review was from one of the judges, which is why it was so harsh. I got an honorable mention for being the youngest writer... still very hurtful
