If they're so concerned about 'wasting time' one wonders why they bothered to spend so long writing out such a rant.

The fact is, nothing anyone writes will work for everyone. My writing may not work for you, your writing may not work for me, and that's just fine. Idiots will be idiots online, and as writers we just have to ignore them. I know it's hard. Especially if they're repeating things that your own inner critic says already, repeating what you already know to be the case, but overstating it so much.

I would suggest going back to the positive reviews. Remind yourself that the voice of dissent is not the only member of your audience. You're not writing for him. You're probably never going to be writing for him. If you give up, you're letting one jerk dictate the direction of your writing. Reclaim your power, write for you. Write for the encouragers. If you can't ignore or forget him, then use him as fuel; prove him wrong.

And no matter what, you're not wasting your time. All writing is practice, progress toward the ever-better writer you can become. Don't let him steal that from you. There is no such thing as wasted writing. Just press on.
