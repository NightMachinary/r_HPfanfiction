While I won't deny that he might have changed at the end of the war, that does not magically erase his countless crimes. Just his sixth year had earned him several lifetimes for war crimes (not wearing distinct insignias, hiding between civilians, attacking civilians) as well as the usual fare of using Unforgivables, treason and attempted murder, all of which fall under adult law and do not recognise coercion as an excuse. Even taking everything and a plea bargain into account, that should give him at the very LEAST a decade in prison. Otherwise, it is an insult to justice and someone like Hermione would make it her life's mission to see him punished. And Romance in Azkaban does not sound feasible, even without the Dementors.

(Which is also the reason I find Bellatrix redemptions a lot more believable because she actually was punished for her crimes while Malfoy or Snape were not).
