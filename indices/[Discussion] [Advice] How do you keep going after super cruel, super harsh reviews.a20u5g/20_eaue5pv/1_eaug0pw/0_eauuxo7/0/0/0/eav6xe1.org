There is a small window where a redemption would be feasible, between her prison break and the DoM battle (so there is no bad blood between Harry/Hermione and Bella). She would have to prove her value to Harry's cause (preferably by slaughtering Death Eater) and she would never be a good person. At the same time, her actions significantly helped the war effort and together with her already served years in Azkaban it should amount to enough to leave her past behind. This would, however, lead to a rift between them and Neville, who would undoubtedly never forgive her.

For war crimes the perpetrator usually was taken to the nearest ditch and shot? All things considered, it should be way more than 5 years on probation. He might avoid execution with a plea bargain and snitching on other Death Eaters, but there are hundreds of counts of war crimes he would be guilty of AND the assassination attempts on Dumbledore with their collateral damage (eg Katie Bell).
