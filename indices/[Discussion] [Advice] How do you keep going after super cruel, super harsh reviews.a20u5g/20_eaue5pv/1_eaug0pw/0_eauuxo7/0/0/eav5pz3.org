I find that strange, myself. I can't buy Bellatrix redemptions at all because she had no interest in being redeemed. She was crazy, evil, and unrepentant up until Molly cut her down. Draco, on the other hand, was arguably young enough to be turned around and was reluctant and scared from the time he first joined the Death Eaters. He was absolutely a bigot, but I don't have a great need to see him rot in prison.

I think Dramione /could/ work (though it would be unlikely) if he got five years probation, and we actually saw him go through that and unlearn the blood purist views his parents taught him before there was any hint of him and Hermione getting together.
