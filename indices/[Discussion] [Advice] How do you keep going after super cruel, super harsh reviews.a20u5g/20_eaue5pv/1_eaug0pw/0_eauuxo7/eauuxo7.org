I mean, I guess it could be seen as that sure. But given it's a fictional universe and also Draco Malfoy was a teenager pressured into a terrorist organisation by his family, I don't think it's unrealistic to think he could be redeemed (I agree the pairing is probably not realistic but my love of the pairing resulted from some well written AUs so eh)

Also can confirm, not a Nazi sympathiser.
