I mean, I play a lot of online games. Dota, CS yeah im used to being told how deep into my own ass my head seems to be. I can shake it off very easily, it doesn't bother me but jesus is it tiring, It would just be easier to not have to deal with that. it really doesn't help anything. It doesn't help you improve, it doesn't help them improve, it doesn't improve group morale, its just one guy dragging others down so everyone is as miserable as they are, and thats just a sad way to exist.
