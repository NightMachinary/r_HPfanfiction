Of course! Online trolling is a pointlessly destructive activity, and the world would be a better place if people didn't get their kicks doing it. But, as long as that's not the case, better to try to teach people to brush off that kind of nonconstructive criticism for what it is, rather than help them feel better when it hurts them.
