  OP is asking for advice on how to do that
#+end_quote

The advice on how to stand up to that is usually coming from people like [[/u/meterion]] and [[/u/rek-lama]]. You may have noticed that the rest of the comments in this thread are more like group therapy grief counseling.

Having a group hug and pitying each other isn't exactly the picture of standing up to something. It's just more proof that a single mean comment can dominate their lifes and make them miserable for weeks.
