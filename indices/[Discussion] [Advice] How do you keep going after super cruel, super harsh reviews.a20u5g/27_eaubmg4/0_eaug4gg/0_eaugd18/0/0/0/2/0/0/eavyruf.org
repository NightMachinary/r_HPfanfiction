Your comment is contradictory to me--you're saying there's no such thing as oversensitivity, but not being able to deal with any hate is literally being overly sensitive to it.

Of course OP has their own their life and experience and whatnot. I am only offering the practical advice that if his reaction to a single flame is putting a stop to his entire writing process, they need to remove themselves from that situation. Especially since there's no real way to stop flamers on FF.net.

Note that I did not tell him to "man up" as you say, but to not expose himself to things he can't emotionally deal with, until he becomes better equipped to deal with them (if ever).
