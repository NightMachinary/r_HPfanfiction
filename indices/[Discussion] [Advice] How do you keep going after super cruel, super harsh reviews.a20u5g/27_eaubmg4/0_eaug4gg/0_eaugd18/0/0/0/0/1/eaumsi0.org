Haha, thanks. Comforting/reassuring OP is kind and all, but it is addressing the symptom of being upset, rather than its cause.

I've noticed this is pretty common in a lot of amateur art communities, especially fanfiction, and I have the idea it is because there's not many with formal art education in them. After all, one of the fundamental things you learn in it is not to take criticism personally, and that attacks are not criticism.
