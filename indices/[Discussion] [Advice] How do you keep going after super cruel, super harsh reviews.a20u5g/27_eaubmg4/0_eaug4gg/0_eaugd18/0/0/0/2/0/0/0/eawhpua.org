1. OP is a she, please respect her pronouns.
2. Man up was an example
3. Perhaps you did not understand. There is no being /overly/ sensitive to anything. Any level of sensitivity is valid and acceptable. I do understand what you were saying. I just had a problem with you calling OP oversensitive, different people have different thresholds, there isn't a "too much" or "too little". OP said she has anxiety, which makes her sensitivity /involuntary/. Stuff like "grow a thicker skin" doesn't help with mental illnesses bro
