If someone calls you a cunt on the internet, you call them a cunt back and go about your day. At least that's how things used to be.

These days it's more like: take to Twitter, raise an outrage mob, and whine about how you're being oppressed because of your identity until the UN invites you to give a speech about "cyber violence".
