well A, most weren't just executed with no trial most were tried in The Hague, Even then before being executed they were not stripped of their humanity, they were not starved, stripped of their names, or experimented on.

also yes gas based executions are pretty horrific compared many other possible ways of executions, hell a proper hanging, where the neck gets snapped, is more humane than death by cyanide like Zyklon B, or suffocation by carbon monoxide.
