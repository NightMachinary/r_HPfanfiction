Some people can't just not give a fuck. Don't you guys get that? Can't you guys empathize? Mental illnesses like anxiety make it so people /involuntarily/ get affected and /give a fuck/. OP can't help /giving a fuck/. OP is asking for help on how to handle it, which I applaud her for. Many people suppress their emotions and that's not healthy
