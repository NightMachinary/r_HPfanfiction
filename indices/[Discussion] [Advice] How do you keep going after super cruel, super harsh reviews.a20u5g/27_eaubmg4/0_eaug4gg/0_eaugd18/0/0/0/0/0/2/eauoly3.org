  Standing up to it isn't fighting hate with hate. It's realising the problem and learning how to address it. Insulting back someone who insults you is like fighting Nazis by gassing them back. That's not how it works.

That's exactly how it works. What?! Do you think you can hug them do death?

  "Grow a thicker skin" is easy to say, hard to achieve. Everyone is different and everyone's life experience is different. This affects mental issues like anxiety. I'm not saying OP has anxiety, but just comparing it. But some people just DO get affected easily and there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. OP is asking for advice and help, which is the right thing to do.

Of course it's hard. That's why you have to work at it and practice it every day. It doesn't come naturally to anybody.

  It isn't useful at all. Don't you think OP already thought of that? It's not that easy you know.

Most life advice is pretty obvious. I know exactly what I should be doing in my current situation... actually doing it is a different beast entirely and doesn't make people wrong for giving me the correct advice.
