Well, that answer's obvious: you either flame back, or you ignore it and move on. This is not what OP is asking: he's already taken it personally, had it ruin his day, and is now wondering whether his reaction to it was justified.

  But every time I start to write, I just 'hear' that review like a fucking Howler, and i haven't touched the story re-write since.

To be straight up: Yes [[/u/ChewsOnBees]] , you are being oversensitive, this is an overreaction. There's always going to be a selection of people who flame in reviews, and making a massive deal of it like this is telling them exactly what they want to hear. Criticism, whether unwarranted, vulgar, inaccurate, or otherwise, is something all artists deal with when putting their work out for the people to see. If you can't deal with things like this, I can only recommend sharing your stories with just your friends and family until you don't let it get under your skin.
