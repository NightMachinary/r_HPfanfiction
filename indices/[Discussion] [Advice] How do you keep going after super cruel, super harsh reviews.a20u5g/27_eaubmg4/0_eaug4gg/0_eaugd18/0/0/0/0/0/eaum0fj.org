Standing up to it isn't fighting hate with hate. It's realising the problem and learning how to address it. Insulting back someone who insults you is like fighting Nazis by gassing them back. That's not how it works.

"Grow a thicker skin" is easy to say, hard to achieve. Everyone is different and everyone's life experience is different. This affects mental issues like anxiety. I'm not saying OP has anxiety, but just comparing it. But some people just DO get affected easily and there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. OP is asking for advice and help, which is the right thing to do.

I don't think the other comments were very support groupey (I liked the lobster one) but this isn't about that. It's about the comment at the top of this thread in relation to OP's post. It isn't useful at all. Don't you think OP already thought of that? It's not that easy you know. People have their own struggles and that's okay.
