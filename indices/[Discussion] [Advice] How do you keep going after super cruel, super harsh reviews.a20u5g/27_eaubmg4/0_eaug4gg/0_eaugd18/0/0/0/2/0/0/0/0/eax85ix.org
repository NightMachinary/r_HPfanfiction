1) Sure, but I'm not sure how you expected me to figure that out when there's nothing to indicate that on OP's post.\\
3) You can argue that there is no such thing as too much or too little of any kind of reaction and any emotional response is okay, but... that's pretty far removed from the actual reality of OP being unable to continue writing her story from that sensitivity. Again, I am not saying that an excess of sensitivity to critique is Bad, or that she needs to Change, but to manage the kind of critique to expose herself to. You are assuming that I'm making some judgment about her character, whereas all this is, is practical advice.
