You don't fight hate with hate, you simply call someone annoying you a cunt and then forget about them. Or even completely ignore them.

We recently had a politician stand up in the Bundestag and complain about some hatemail she was getting. Imagine Bismarck standing in front of the Reichstag and complain about mean letters. Now guess which one of those is the most influential figure in German history and which one is a running joke.
