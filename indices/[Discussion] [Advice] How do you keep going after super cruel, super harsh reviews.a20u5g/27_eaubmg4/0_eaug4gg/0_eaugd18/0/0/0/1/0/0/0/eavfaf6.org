I agree that politician is being a bit of a whiny bint. But every person and every situation is different. OP isn't whining about hate mail lol. They're asking for help on how to deal with it, which, imo, is the right thing to do.

People used to just insult people back when they were insulted. This created an aggressive society where people weren't allowed to feel upset. Now, people speak out about issues they feel are important, and we have a supportive society that brings people up, and gathers to fight for what they believe in. People are more accepting of each other, and while I won't say it's perfect, I prefer this to a society where it's not okay to get upset sometimes.

Emotions are good. Learning how to express them them in sensible, good ways, is good. Suppressing them is not.
