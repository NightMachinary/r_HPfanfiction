Every human being is different. There is no such thing as "oversensitive". You can't say something like that without knowing OP's entire life story - perhaps they have experienced things that make them more sensitive to hate. Telling someone to "man up" or "grow a thicker skin" is telling them to suppress their emotions, and that's not good. Instead, people should teach how to express these emotions in good ways. But I do agree with the last part - you're going to get hate. If you can't deal with it, you should probably stop posting fanfic
