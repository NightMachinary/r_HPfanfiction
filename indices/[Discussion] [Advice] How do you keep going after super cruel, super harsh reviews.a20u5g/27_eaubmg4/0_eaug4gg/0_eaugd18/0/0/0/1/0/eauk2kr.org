Don't fight hate with hate.

Idk where you find the "whining". I only see people speaking out for what they believe in. I think that being able to do that and have a voice is very important. But I guess you can have your opinion. I can see why you think that. But "these days", we don't tolerate shit anymore, and if raising an outrage mob on twitter will help that happen, I don't see anything wrong with doing it
