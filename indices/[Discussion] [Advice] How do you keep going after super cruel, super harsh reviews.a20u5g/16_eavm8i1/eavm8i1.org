People love to mock other peoples hard work(especially if they hate that person).. Trust me, I know just get rid of the mean reviews and gradually forget about the bad reviews.. Instead of cruelest review, I would say cruelest reviewer as they called not just my fanfics bad but also, my art and singing.. I wont name this jerk who said all these mean things but, he also called me names, turned 2 people against me for my mistakes and finally removing him from my life, and has criticized many others including several people I know then like a month or 2 ago, hes like "Im gonna go apologize to everyone" but I reject it coz even though Im a Hufflepuff and Pacifist, he hurt me too much
