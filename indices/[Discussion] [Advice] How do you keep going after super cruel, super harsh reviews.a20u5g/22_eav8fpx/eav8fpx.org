My most vicious reviews are all along the lines of "you're an idiot, stop writing because no one wants to read this." Thing is, I write for /me,/ not random strangers on the internet. Sure, if they want to give me advice on phrasing or grammar or whatever that's great, but the plot is /mine/ goddamnit and /I/ decide what happens in /my/ stories. If they don't like it, then they don't have to read it.
