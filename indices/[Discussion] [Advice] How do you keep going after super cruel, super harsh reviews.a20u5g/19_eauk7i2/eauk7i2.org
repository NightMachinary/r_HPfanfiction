For one-line trolling, I got a variation on a classic: “this isn't funny, I hope you get AIDS and die.” The fic was then several years old, with 300+ positive reviews and 500+ favorites. It was a silly crack one shot, not something I'd poured my heart and soul into.

The formulaic troll review still hurt my feelings. Like you, I'm sensitive and I can't suddenly have a thicker skin because it would be convenient, or because someone tells me I ought to, or because intellectually I know that this is how the internet works. I can work on not being bothered by childish nonsense, but I can't flip a switch and be someone else who has a tough skin simply because it would be rational to have one.

So: if it's an anonymous review, I delete it so I won't be tempted to go back and look at it, unless I'm feeling uncommonly don't-care, and then I let it up my review count.

If it's not an anonymous review, I block the writer so I know I won't have to hear it again.

Then I write or post something else. I can't help my instinctive emotional reaction, but I can control what I do next. My advice to you? Polish up your next chapter one last time and post it. You wrote this story because you wanted to hear it. Likely someone else does too. And when this story is publicly completed, on to your next inspiration for a while. Then, when you're over the emotional reaction, decide whether you want to rewrite, take down, or leave up the fic that for the review.

Sorry that happened to you, by the way. It may be the natural way of things, but it sucks.
