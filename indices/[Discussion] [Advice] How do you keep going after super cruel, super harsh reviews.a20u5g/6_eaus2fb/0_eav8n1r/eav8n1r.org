An anonymous reviewer just named "Really" sent it in, along with another (but shorter and less hurtful) review for the first chapter of my fic.

While I will PM you the story if you really want, I have to say - it's pretty bad. Like, I go back and reread it, and it's exactly as stupid and OOC as people have said (both polite and not). In hindsight, I got waaaay too excited to be writing a story again after being inspired by someone else, and I didn't take it slow enough to be reasonable. I either shouldn't have used the characters I did, OR I should have gone slow and made it MUCH longer in order to explain why people were acting the way they were. Really, I'm embarrassed of the story quite a bit now. I just wish the anon hadn't attacked my writing style as well as my content, because THAT'S the one that hit me hard.
