I've never gotten any downright cruel reviews (knock on wood), but I have gotten some negative ones that I found to be really unnecessary. Like, I got a review on a 5 year old story that just said it was too short, even though the word count is shown right there, and a comment on a different story informing me that the creators had contradicted the premise of my fic (although it wasn't contradicted within the show itself).

As for getting past mean comments, I think it's helpful to keep in mind that enjoyment of fic, like enjoyment of all media, is highly subjective. No fanfic is going to please everyone, because we've all got different tastes, so just because this person didn't like your fic doesn't mean no one else will.
