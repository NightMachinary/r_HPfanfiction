  I got the review in a hospital car park where I was visiting my mum, and I let it get it me more than I should have.

It's true that the way we react to these things is coloured by the way we are already feeling. I had a pretty mean review on an old completed fic about eighteen months ago when I was halfway through sixteen weeks of chemo. It bounced right off me. I had so much shit going on, felt so rough and didn't know if I'd ever write anything again, it just seemed irrelevant. It would probably upset me more now.
