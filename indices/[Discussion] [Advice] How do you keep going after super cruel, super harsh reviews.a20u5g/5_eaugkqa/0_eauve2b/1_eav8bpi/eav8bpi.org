I remember you! You're the one who writes in a way that sounds like Hill House/Shirley Jackson! <3 Your stuff puts me in a 'big ass blanket and rainy day' mood when I read it, and I always 'see' your stuff in like, sepia tone.

(I hope this vaguely makes sense to people, because I LOVE what an unusual reaction/mood I get in my head from it!)

I like your point here - I don't have a LOT going on in life except (briefly) that story, so I feel like that's why it stung SO bad. If I had more going on, I may have been able to laugh it off.

Also <3 chemo sucks, but so does cancer. Glad you're doing better, both health and keeping on writing. I had A.L.L. as a kid, and I don't remember it all well, but I remember some of the damn chemo and ughhh.
