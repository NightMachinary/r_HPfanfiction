It was definitely you, I checked :)

I can't even imagine what my parents dealt with on their end, or what it would be like to be going through it yourself when old enough to be more aware of all of it. I was so young that I think most of it just rolled off of me like "Well, that's the way it is", because I had nothing else to compare it to. If I were to relapse and experience it again now, I figure there's no way I'd be so easy-going or calm about it all.
