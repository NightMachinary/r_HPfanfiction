I'm really sorry someone did this, it's really mean. You have to wonder why they came back and read more if they didn't like it.

Everyone's been there. A while ago someone left an anonymous review on an old fic of mine where they just didn't get the humour and didn't hold back in their criticism or disappointment. Unfortunately I got the review in a hospital car park where I was visiting my mum, and I let it get it me more than I should have. I eventually realised it was silly to cry over something someone clearly knew was unreasonable - if they had faith in their words they would have signed in and allowed me a response.

You had constructive criticism previously and you were very good natured about it. That says far more about you than the person who wrote such nasty things about something they have made the decision to keep reading (for free!) And didn't have the balls to leave their name with.
