I think (iirc) they both came in once the second chapter was put up, so at least the person wasn't waiting around to attack me. That being said, the completed 3rd and 4th aren't ever going up - because I don't know if that guy will be back, and because people were right about the ridiculousness of my plot and characters. Just...most people were way more polite about it when they told me.

I started re-writing the story again last night after posting this here (hardly the same story, actually, only keeping some of the quotes I used that I felt embodied Luna and the -SLIGHTLY- same plot line, but replacing Hermione's part in it with a random 2nd year Ravenclaw Muggleborn, and Luna going to Hermione to have a reasonable and intelligent (and much less OOC) discussion about it instead.) but I found that I kept second (and 3rd and 4th..) guessing myself every paragraph. 'Is this said in a way ___ would?', 'Is this quote too stupid and cringey to use?', etc.

Basically my old fic is haunting it's own re-write.

I'm super sorry your asshole reviewer got you while you were at the hospital <3 You're tough as nails, tbh. <3
