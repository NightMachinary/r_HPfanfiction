Was yours 'Really', as well? :/ They mocked me for being a redditor, but they sounded to me to be one as well, as I certainly got targeted by them from promoting here. They also hit the nail right on the head with my deepest worries and insecurities. A lot of other people said, on here or FFN or PMs "hey, this idea is a bit messy and the characters are really OOC", but they were very diplomatic about it (and 100% correct, looking back) and didn't attack..well, the writing itself or me, personally, the way Really did.

Sounds to me like he reviewed your shortest stories because he was too lazy to read anything longer. :/

I would have taken a "this is shit go die" over what he sent me, honestly. Those are easy to throw off as "bratty 10 year old" or something.

Even when you aren't writing a story, you make me feel some strange way with your words. Like something between melancholy and chills.

Also, I love what you said about leaving a fic up out of spite!
