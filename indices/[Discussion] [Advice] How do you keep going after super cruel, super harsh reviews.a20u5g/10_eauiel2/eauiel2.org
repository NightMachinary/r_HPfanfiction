I had two reviews from the same 'guest' troll as you. They managed to very accurately pinpoint my own insecurities about my writing (I even wondered if they had trawled my profile for clues, but that seems a ludicrous amount of effort to go to. Surely everyone has more productive things to do with their time than that?). One of the reviews was mean but relatively mild. The other was vicious and it still hurts to look at it. It said at length how boring my prose is and painful to read. Also that I had interesting ideas but anybody else would be able to make a better job of writing them (that was the most hurtful bit!) Both of those were on finished one shots. One of them I had been planning to delete anyway, but I've left it up for spite now. Along with the review which I think says more about the reviewer than the writing.

​

These are more sophisticated reviews that the usual 'go and kill urslef' type, which are easy to ignore. The reviewer knows how to aim their barbs for maximum hurt and effect. How do they know that? Perhaps they are a failed writer themselves? Anybody's guess. They can hide on the internet and be brave enough to leave anonymous insults where in real life they are probably frightened to open their own front door.

​

'Growing a thick skin' is all very well but I think creativity brings a particular vulnerability with it. Every time you post a piece of writing, you are laying a little bit of your soul out there and if someone wants to come along and stamp on it, there is nothing to stop them. All you can do is be prepared and have a strategy to deal with it---or don't look at your reviews at all. I've had a few of these over the years and they always hurt, though this was the worst. Sometimes it takes a few weeks to get over it and I don't think it ever stops stinging. I'm still reeling a bit, but I unexpectedly started writing a new piece and I'm sure that was a reaction to the reviews.

​

So I suppose my advice would be to start working on something new.
