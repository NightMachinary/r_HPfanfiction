1. Nothing in canon says that James was an Auror, that's pure fanon. At best, he was an Auror trainee since the formation takes /year/ after school (at least 3 I think), but the most likely option is that him and Lily just joined the war effort straight out of school without taking any careers and relying on James inheritance to live.
2. The Potter luck is also pure fanon, and is generaly used to descrive Harry's luck, or his ability to land in the worst situations (Acromantula's den, in front of a Mountain troll), and leave with almost no lasting damages, James has nothing to do with it.
3. Fanon created several theories to explain why Dumbledore wasn't the Secret Keeper, chose the one you like the most. Maybe someone can't be the Secret Keeper of several location and Dumbledore was already guarding a Secret, maybe James and Lily insisted that one of their best friend, brother, guard the Secret . . .
4. I remember reading an interesting theory that said that the Fidelius relied on trust to work. Because of it, placing any aditional protection other a Fidelius would mean that you don't trust the Fidelius, weakening of even destroying it.
