  First of all, James, oh Jamesy poo. According to Harry potter fanfiction, the potters have this thing called "potter luck" so why did he die?

  Second of all, most Fanfic lore, states that Lily and James were really powerful and smart.

Well, What I think, is that the Potter Luck is a Double-edged Sword. In case of Harry, while his luck saved him many times, it is shown to be one of the things that really put him in those situations.

About Lily and James being smart, well, Voldemort was smarter. He also had all information about their wards including the Fidelus thanks to dear old Wormy, and he caught them unawares. Any additional charm or ward they may have put on the house could have been systematically disenchanted by Voldemort, and he also took down the Anti - Apparation wards and then put his own up so that they cannot run.

Also, there is no mention of James being an auror anywhere in Pottermore.

  Dumbledore was the secret keeper to Grimmauld place, why couldn't he have been the secret keeper for Godric's Hollow?

Because the Marauders trusted each other more than anything, and at that time Sirius's Suggestion that they use him as a decoy and Wormy as the real secret keeper sounded very much good to them.

  They could've made an escape plan in case Moldyshorts came knocking at their door.

Don't you think Voldemort didn't think of that? Or he didn't ask Wormy about the Potters' Protections? Wormy was a goldmine for info on the Potters. He would've pointed out the loopholes in their defences, and if Magic leaves a signature, he would've masked Voldy's.

And they didn't even expect that Wormy would change sides. They had no way of knowing, and that was why none of their escape plans would work, anyway.
