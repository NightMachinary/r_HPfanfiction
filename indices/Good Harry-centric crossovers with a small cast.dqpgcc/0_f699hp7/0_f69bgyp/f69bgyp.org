linkffn(10784770) was pretty great in that regard, even if the relationship was kinda meh (had good and bad sides to it). Could have used a bit more narrative focus after getting together.

linkffn(10839027) was ok, although it's Harry and Luna dropped in another world. Pretty cracky and enjoyable, but no Nobel Prize candidate. Although I haven't read the last few chapters yet (the author took a long hiatus).

I don't find a lot of male characters interesting because they feel very stereotypical to me (from a male perspective), which makes them rather boring. And quite a few of the ones I like are interesting due to their canonical het relationships or what it symbolises (eg Anakin Skywalker, James Potter or Edward Tonks). And for others like Moody or the Master Chief, well I am not interested in shipping them with anyone. So I don't really have a shipping pool for male characters. For example, from Harry Potter, there are Harry and Sirius.
