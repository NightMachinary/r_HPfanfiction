I have a bad habit of getting an idea and then reading a bunch of stories with the same general plot. I recently read a lot of stories where Harry isn't the boy who lived. It's been two weeks and two of the stories have updated with new chapters, and I genuinly did not remember having read one of the stories. At all, mistaking it for another one and then just being confused.
