..... I now identify with the bored immortals that like to dimension hop to see how different timelines are progressing:

'oh is this the one where Harry found his core and started 'mapping it' and that's how he became OPAF, or is this the one where Magic so loved him it made reality like a dream to him? Or is the one where his parents live and hide in Germany until he's 7 and it turns out Harry is the reincarnation of Tom's mentor? Oh gosh I'm just so lost, guess I have to start from the beginning or I'll just be completely lost!'
