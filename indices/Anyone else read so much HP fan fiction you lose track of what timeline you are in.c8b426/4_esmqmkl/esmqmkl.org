I sometimes imagine a HP meta universe (and would probably do so in other cases as well if I end up reading fanfics of it) as an infinitely sprawling network of timelines and divergence points, representating fanfic authors' various takes on things -- for example, looking at Harry Potter the character's timeline(s) would have a major junction point at September 1st 1991, showing all the various Sorting outcomes and what have you -- and several timelines thin out on character deaths, but not entirely, because of the occasional death-prompted Peggy Sues, jumping back to earlier points, or "alive!character" fics, etc.

Sometimes I even imagine an Department of Mysteries artifact which works somewhat similar to the Mirror of Erised, but instead of showing your deepest desire, you can request it to show an universe where X happened/did not happen, and it would reveal the most likely results of said change ("Show me an universe where Dumbledore didn't put on Gaunt's Ring") -- or reveal the most plausible means of how an universe gets to such a point if build-up is needed ("Show me an universe where Harry married Luna"). Said artifact would be harmless for people happy with their life, but dangerous to people with major regrets (similar to the Mirror), being tempted to see how things could have been, despite the inability to actually go there. There is a Lily-centric fic where an artifact in Purgatory works somewhat similar to this -- I liked the premise (but think some of the scenarios in the fic itself implausible) and have been curious if there's other fics with a similar premise.
