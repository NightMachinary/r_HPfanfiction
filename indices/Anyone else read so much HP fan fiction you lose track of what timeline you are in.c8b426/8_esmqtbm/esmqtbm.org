You know, if a fanfic isn't extremely memorable I'll basically forget everything about it in a week, save maybe a few things. Titles especially, I can never remember titles and associate them with a fic. Basically, reading fanfiction for me is less searching for a good story, and more feeding this weird 'zeitgeist' of Harry Potter in my head.
