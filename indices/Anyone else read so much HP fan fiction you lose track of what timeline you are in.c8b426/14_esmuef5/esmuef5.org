Yes and no, I have gathered over the years that I am somewhat odd in my Fic reading habits in that I keep a meticulous categorized record of fics, a kind of library including fics I've either read or intend to read. This has let keep a distinct separation in my head of the elements that are from canon, and from fanfiction. That said, there are elements from fanfiction that I effectively include into the canon, my own personal headcanon. The only absolute criteria being that it doesn't contradict canon to do so. One such element is from my all time favourite fic, "A Cadmean Victory" by Darkness Enthroned, in which there is a rather shady potions supply store in Knocturn Alley called "The Spiny Serpent" which is run by a vampire. This does not contradict canon in any way, and it has the benefit of expanding on an area of the universe left mostly untouched. In other words, the perfect place for fanfiction.

So no, I don't lose track of what's canon and what's not, but I do add in elements to my Headcanon that are not in the source material.
