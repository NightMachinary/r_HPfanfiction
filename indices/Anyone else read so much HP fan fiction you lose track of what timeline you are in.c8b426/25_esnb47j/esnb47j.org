Sometimes when I think of characters, My fanfic bias starts kick in.It isn't really that bad, Mostly just whenever I think of background characters, I think of little quirks or way they might act.

Don't worry it isn't any of that Ice queen Daphne things that come to mind. (Nothing against the trope, I'm just not really fan of it.)

That's the case for canon, At least.

But for fics, I have to reread them when they update sometimes when they're too similar to other fanfics.
