I agree with that point of view entirely, that fan works can be just as interesting (or more!) than the story they originated from, but I also think it's important to remember what the source work was or you experience "canon drift", where the fandom seems to collectively edit their memory about what actually happened in the series and think fanon is canon.

Now I'd never say fanon is bad, since it provides a useful starting point from which to expand the HPverse like with the various students of Slytherin, but it gets annoying when people try to correct the author of a fic about how "wards" work (don't exist in canon) or how Sirius used to be a playboy (extrapolated from a single detail, never confirmed).
