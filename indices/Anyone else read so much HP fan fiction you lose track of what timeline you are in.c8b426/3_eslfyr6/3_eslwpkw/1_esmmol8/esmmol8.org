Agreed. Granted I don't like certain things but it's mostly just because it doesn't fit in the Harry Potter world. Wards for instance in my mind is just using that instead of saying a defensive enchantment over an area. My one thing is making sure whatever additions aren't overpowered and if they are then both sides should have them otherwise the story loses the appeal. Or making something like Harry is a god because we have to make him special and give him cool stuff to be able to do just because even if he'll never use it again after it's introduced. Case in point. “What arm is your wand arm? I'm ambidextrous” but that then never becomes relevant.
