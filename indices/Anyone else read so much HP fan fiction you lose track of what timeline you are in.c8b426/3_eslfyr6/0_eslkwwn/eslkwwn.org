Well, a counterargument to that is that while you can consider canon as the central unifier of all fanfic. All fanfiction takes the characters from canon and puts them in different situations and tinkers with them, if we don't consider canon to have a central role then we lose the deep characterisation that JKR did that makes fanfic so enjoyable.

In fanfic, nobody describes how Harry or Hermione or Ron look like or how they behave - writers just assume that readers already have an image in their heads for them and know them well. This is all due to the canon's central importance within fanfic.
