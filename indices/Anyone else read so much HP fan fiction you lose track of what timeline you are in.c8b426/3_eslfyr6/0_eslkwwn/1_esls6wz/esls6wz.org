Eh, I don't think physical descriptions need the base material strictly for the reader to have a clear image of the characters, that is mostly an issue with the writer and the way they direct their scenes. Someone competent will sneak in descriptors in between actions and narrations to remind you of who they're talking about. In Reign of the Serpent the author does describe Harry and Lily to the reader; you don't need to read the original saga to know what those two look like there.

In terms of characterisation, well that depends on the type of fic we're talking about: a canon-compliant one will obviously be quite reliant on Rowling's work. A 5th year fic will expect the reader to be familiar with book 1 through 4, but a large-scale AU? One that starts with, say, the fall of Voldemort? Well then, Harry and many other people's characterisation then falls on the ideas and talent of the author behind it, not so much their canonical versions.

Ultimately, I'm not saying to dismiss canon at all, for the community would not exist without it. My point is sometimes we focus a bit much on what is canon and what isn't, when in the end it is us as individuals who give meaning to works of art. We get to decide how important they are to us, and to that end "canon status" is pretty irrelevant.
