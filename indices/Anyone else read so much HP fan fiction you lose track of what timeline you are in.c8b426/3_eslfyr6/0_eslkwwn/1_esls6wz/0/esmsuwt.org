But even beyond that, the world already has a lot of history the fans know. The characters might turn out with different characterization, but most of the time it doesn't erase their relations to one another. Even in an AU, unless its explicitly or implicitly stated, a reader will start reading with the mindset that Harry is James and Lily's son, Lily was friends with Snape, the Death Hallows exist, Dumbledore is the leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organization that fights Death Eaters, the Weasleys have 7 children, Hogwarts was founded by 4 people, etc etc.

Even in a large-scale AU, even if the reader doesn't strictly /need/ the original material, it's always there as a background you can fall back on. We the readers fill in the details in our minds with unprovided information which makes the fanfiction that much richer in a way that, if it had been an original story, might just be blander.
