The main reason I value canon is that it is the only unifying thing that can be used in a debate. Anything else just become an arms race of using certain tropes as evidence. See the Ginny bashing debates of about 10 years ago (and my goodness, it really has been that long, hasn't it) for examples of how this can begin to go poorly.
