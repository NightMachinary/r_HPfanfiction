You know, I always thought this concept of canonicality (if that's even a word) can be pretty silly sometimes, I mean it's all made up shit at the end of the day, the only difference is that Rowling owns the IP and the rest of the community doesn't, but if a fan-made work connects with you in a meaningful way, then in your mind it can be as valid as JKR's work. And isn't that what matters at the end of the day? We're all alone in our own minds, so our perception of fiction can be anything we want it to be. Am I making any sense? Point is fanfics are fun.
