So true. Also, I actually like the idea of an ever-expanding fictional world. Basically, when the author gives access to their work it becomes something else entirely when it goes through the perception of the reader. I don't fully understand authors that don't like many interpretations of their works. It's just so amazing to see how a fictional story can keep living like that. So yeah, true 'canon' is a complicated term if you think about it.
