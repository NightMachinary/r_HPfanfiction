Yeah I see what you're trying to say. Just sometimes people are irrational, that's a fact. I think it would be better after this problem with canonicity and different interpretations would be discussed more broadly because now, unfortunately, the whole fanfiction thing is more like a dirty secret outside fandoms. I don't like this at all, but hope it will eventually come to something.
