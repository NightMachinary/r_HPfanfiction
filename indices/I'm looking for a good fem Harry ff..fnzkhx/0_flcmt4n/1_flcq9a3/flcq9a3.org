Certain Dark Things is eventual Harriet/Snape, though he isn't so repulsive.

Edit: I'm pretty sure Protection from Nargles and its sequel, Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor are not F/F stories. The tags don't have it, I read the first a while ago, and unless the second has a surprise genderbender, it's not F/F.
