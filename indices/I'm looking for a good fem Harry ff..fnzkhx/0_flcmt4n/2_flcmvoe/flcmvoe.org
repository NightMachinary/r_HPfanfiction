  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  "... The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky... Some say---""It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead."---POTC quote.The Higher Entities end up letting three souls have a second chance at life. One flash of green light the colour of death. Three souls return to the Living. History is rewritten. And Fate laughs.Or...The one story where Gellert Grindelwald takes a leaf out of Gru's book and adopts a kid despite being a former Dark Lord with no parenting skills whatsoever... And of course the kid is none other than Hadria Potter, who unintentionally drives him up the wall for all of three years. (After those three years, a number of people are driven up the wall, including Gellert, and it's totally intentional by now).

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
