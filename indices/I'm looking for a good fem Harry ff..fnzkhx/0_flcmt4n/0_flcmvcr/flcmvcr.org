  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

#+begin_quote
  Being reborn as a daughter of the House of Black was bewildering, but realising they weren't actually evil was another problem entirely. Despite a name and gender change, Harry Potter wasn't someone who would let their family suffer for no reason. Lyra was a Black, and Blacks protect their own. Time travel, genderbending - fem! Harry, slash and fem slash, same-sex pregnancies.
