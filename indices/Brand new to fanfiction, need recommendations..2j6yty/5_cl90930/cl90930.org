[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing Up Black]] was my first real taste of hp fan fiction. It's a great alternate-universe where Harry is rescued by the Black family and is magically altered to be the supposed son of Sirius. Warning, it's incomplete. My second real fan fic read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]]. After Snape dies, he's transported back in time to his worst memory, the day he lost Lily's friendship.

I read those two to completion and they got me hooked. Maybe you'll have a similar experience. Oh, and here's my current favorite fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy][A Promise From Her Boy]]. Only 20k words long, and it really tugged on my heartstrings.
