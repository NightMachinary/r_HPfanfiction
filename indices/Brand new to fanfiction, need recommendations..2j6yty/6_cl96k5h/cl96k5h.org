[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness]] Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a classic, at least for me. The level of development given to relatively minor characters in the series is awesome. This one one of the first ones I read, and I just keep coming back to it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1550595/Thanfiction]] I would also really recommend pretty much everything by this author. There is a really good sequel to DAYD called Sluagh, and it's just as good if not better. There are also a ton of little oneshots that give you extra peeks into the lives of his characters.

1000/10 would recommend.

They are very long though. I'm a fan of long ones, but they're not for everyone.
