It depends on what you want. In a sufficiently big and old fandom, thousands upon thousands of different premises and ideas have been explored, with a hugely varying level of quality. Do you want to see a story where Voldemort is the hero and Dumbledore the villain? There are many of those, and a few are even readable. A passionate romance between Draco and Hermione? Ditto.

You strike me as an unreserved fan of the books, so I would recommend stories that capture their feel of the early books. Here are two:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]]: Harry and Hermione investigate the disappearance of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sally-Anne_Perks][Sally-Anne Perks]], who, in the books, was sorted just before Potter but then wasn't called to be tested for the OWLS (even though her name would be between Patil and Potter, both of whom were called). What was probably an error by Rowling, the writer spins out into a mystery.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]]: Simply put, Ron was born a girl. Changes ensue, but the spirit is preserved.

Some fanfics explore characters' ambitious sides. Indeed, the Sorting Hat had tempted Harry with greatness, if he were to choose Slytherin. What if he had? Unfortunately, vast majority of fanfics that answer that question are complete crap, but a few are good. The best one (in my opinion) is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On_the_Way_to_Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]. Of course, Hermione does not lack in ambition either, and she goes through her own Slytherin journey in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]].

There are other categories. I'll try to post more when I have the time.
