I'm sure plenty of people will recommend Harry-centric stories, but since we already have those without fan fiction, I'll give you these instead:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is the definitive Snape story, and in my opinion the best piece of fan fiction ever written. 100% book compliant, so this doesn't have a happy end... but this is the story of Snape's life, so happiness doesn't have much place there. But this is a must read if you want a slow paced character piece that will take a character and really give him depth. 650k words (that's 2/3rds the length of the entire seven HP books), but worth it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is arguably everything good about fan fiction. It pokes a bit of fun at how characters are portrayed, has moments that are funny, angsty, impressive, and subtle - sometimes all at the same time. Also, one of the rare cases where the author absolutely nailed the characterizations, and makes brilliant use of the alternate universe. At around 100k words, it's an easy and smooth read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] is my favorite Ron-centric story. It has quidditch, romance, and a short and sweet narrative. While Ron stories usually suck, this one is a must read. A very to-the-point 15k words that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8444317/1/How-Crap-TV-Saved-the-World][How Crap TV Saved the World]] is a darkly funny one-shot. At under 7k words, it is the shortest of the bunch, but the twisted humor is downright awesome. Easily worth the short read. Also: RITA RITA RITA!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9515485/1/Hednon-%CF%9F-The-stickey-feather][Hednon ÏŸ The stickey feather]] is everything that's wrong with fan fiction. This is the definition of a crackfic. Also, eww. Also, funny. Again, eww.
