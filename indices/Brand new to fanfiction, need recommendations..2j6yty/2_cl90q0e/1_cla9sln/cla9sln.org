This is the story that got me hooked on fan fiction. I saw an oblique reference plus a link to a review on an unrelated blog I read regularly, followed the link to the review, where I found mention of this subreddit and of fanfiction.net, and I've been hooked ever since. At home I have the Chrome extension (don't remember the name) that tracks your browsing time & displays a nifty chart. 40% of the tracked time is on fanfiction.net. Reddit is around 20%, and no other website is in double digits.
