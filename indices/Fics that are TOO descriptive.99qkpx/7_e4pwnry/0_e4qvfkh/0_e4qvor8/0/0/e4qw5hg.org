Yeah, those usually are fine, or at least I've yet to encounter a bad example of such a scene. I think the best way to do something like that would be to imagine any new place you've been. What do you usually notice first? In my experience I would say the people are always first, then the size of the area I'm in. Small streets of Rome vs say the large imposing buildings and crowds of NYC. Don't go into the minutia of things that are not relevant to the story, but rather focus on the vibe. Is it an open area unlike Diagon Alley, are there more shops etc. Things that contrast what Harry is used to, but without going into the exact blueprints of the bookstore he's passing by, with the quaint little tables outside that seat four. That have red and yellow embroidery on it and banners that are 3 feet long waving melodically in the wind. :/
