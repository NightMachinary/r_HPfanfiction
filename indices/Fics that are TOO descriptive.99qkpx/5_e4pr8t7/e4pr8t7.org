The problem is that in fanfiction, more words equals more views, favourites and reviews. So it's rewarding for writers to write a bunch of useless crap like a 10k words long shopping trip, drama that's completely unnecessary for the plot (but very useful to push dat wordcount up to the 300k) and just useless side detailing in general. Bonus points for splitting the story up into hundreds of ridiculously short chapters.

Add [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] 's point to that and that's how you get to 300k words long stories that could just as well have been written in 100k words.
