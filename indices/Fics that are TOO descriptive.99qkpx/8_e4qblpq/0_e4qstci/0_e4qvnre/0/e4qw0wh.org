wow. I've learned something new today. I would never have imagined that he wrote those long descriptions out of necessity. I ended up hating realism after reading his novel, though. I think Hennry James's(not sure whether I remembered his name correctly) descriptions are also long and I couldn't finish his novel, either. It's interesting that I personally can read long inner monologues, but the description of the pattern of flowers on each plate in the cupboard is too much for me.
