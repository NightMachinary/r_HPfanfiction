One of my most vivid memories of my college 19th century novel class was the prof telling us how his wordiness was directly connected to his financial woes! Not an author I've returned to for pleasure reading. I'll take Hemingway's brevity over Balzac's â€˜and now to move on to describing the next flower in the garden in lengthy detail' any day.
