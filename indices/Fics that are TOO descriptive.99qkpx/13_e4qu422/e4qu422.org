Most of fanfics fall into this character. Pacing is one of the most common issues in amateur writing (if you get past the obvious stuff).

Amateur Level 1: Basic sentence structure, grammar & spelling, Correct direct and indirect speech

Amateur Level 2: Pacing, basic plot, characterization, consistent POV

Amateur Level 3: character arcs, complex plot structure & mapping , themes, distinct narrative voice
