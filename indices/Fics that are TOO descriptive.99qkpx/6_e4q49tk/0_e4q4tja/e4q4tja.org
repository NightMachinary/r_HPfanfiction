I notice in some of the poorer stories characters seem to go through 5 different emotions in seconds. One minute they're laughing, the next they're having an emotional moment and then finally shouting.

People can cycle through emotions-but surely it's a bit much to have them going through such extremes so quickly. They have to add some emotion to every word they say.
