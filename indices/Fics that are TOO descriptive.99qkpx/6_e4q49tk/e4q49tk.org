Tangentially related to this: writers overexplaining, hashing and rehashing characters' feelings. I don't necessarily need a window into every tiny feeling every character is having 5 times per chapter. In fact, often brevity explains feelings much more powerfully and a certain amount of ambiguity can make the plot more engaging.
