The area that I see things being over described the most is with houses. Oh my god, houses. There are so many fics where Harry interests one or more (usually more) houses and the author almost always can't resist the temptation to describe every single room. I don't necessarily mind if a character inherits a house or multiple, but I don't want a house tour.

The most recent chapter of a new fic that I have been enjoying did this and even though they were less descriptive than the average author who does this house tour thing I still sat through it thinking "I don't care" the whole time.
