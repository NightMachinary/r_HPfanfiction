  The worst thing an author can do, IMHO, is recap canon. I hate stories that start out by rewriting the books in summary form. I can see it if something from canon changed, but if it's just canon, then that's not okay.

Yep, it's the worst when authors try to write a fanfic as if I don't know the original books. I'm unsure whether it's some kind of hubris (they think it has to stand on its own, even though it's fanfic and not an original novel) or just imitating successful authors (who's works stand on their own because they are original) without thinking about it.
