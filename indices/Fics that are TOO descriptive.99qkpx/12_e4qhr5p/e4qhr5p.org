Radaslab and Sinyk both who have written (or are writing in the case of Sinyk) are gilting of way too much description.

The worst thing an author can do, IMHO, is recap canon. I hate stories that start out by rewriting the books in summary form. I can see it if something from canon changed, but if it's /just/ canon, then that's not okay.
