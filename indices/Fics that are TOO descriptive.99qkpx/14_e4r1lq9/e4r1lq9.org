Once read a story that was had an alright amount of description for the first 15 chapters... not too much as to drown a person, not too little to give them nothing to lay out the scene... chapter 16 was eight times the length of every other chapter, went into so much detail that over half of it was a description of a lunch on a plane that didn't even pertain to the story, and was the lunch of someone that wasn't even in the story before that chapter.

I don't even remember the rest of the story before it because of how inane this part was.
