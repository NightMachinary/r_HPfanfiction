I find the opposite to be true. Without enough details the world becomes flat and boring, and the story starts to read like a five-year old is telling it. This happened and the this, and then another thing. You don't have a chance to get invested. I also think it's lazy on the writers end, and silly on the reader's. If you don't care and just want them to get on with it, maybe you're just not into that story?
