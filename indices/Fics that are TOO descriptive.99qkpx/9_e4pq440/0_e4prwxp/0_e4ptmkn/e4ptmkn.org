Yes description can be over done, but the op mentioned things like what Petunia made for dinner. To my reckoning that's a basic thing in a scene and if dinner is at all important should be mentioned at least once. I see a lot of people advocating for less description and very few with any suggestions as to where you draw the line.

Most of the time these types prefer books written in first person. The style is very different from third, and quite difficult to pull off, but it is a haven for less detailed descriptions.
