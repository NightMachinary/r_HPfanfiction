Some detail, NOT EXTREME detail, and not everything. 'Oh they mentioned a thing, it must be important to the plot!' Does not sound exiting to me. And frankly I'm tired of the hyperbole. Having details that don't relate to the plot is a good thing. It is boring to know that everything is critical to the plot and will come back to be important. It's fun and whimsical. But we can't have that. Gotta get to the point as fast as we can.
