  If every piece of world fluff became important later none of it would be subtle foreshadowing, it'd be obvious.

And that's a problem why? Your readers won't know what it means, they will just wonder why you put attention to a certain detail until you reveal it. That's not bad... that's good. For me as a reader that's one of the most exciting parts of reading and you're intent on taking it away?

It sounds ridiculous to try to describe everything in extreme detail just so that the reader stays completely in the dark all the time. That's some kind of reverse Checkov's Gun and it makes no sense to me ("I'm just going to drown individual things that could be noticed in a blanket of details, so that they don't stand out").
