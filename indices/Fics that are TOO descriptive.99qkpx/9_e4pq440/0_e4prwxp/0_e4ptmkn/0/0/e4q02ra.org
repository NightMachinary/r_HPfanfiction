  Yes description can be over done

But I find underdone to be much more egregious. Too much can be fixed with editing. Not enough requires learning to write better, while a horde of people shout about less being more. No one puts in the whole recipe/process to make dinner. The hyperbole is not helpful. Advice like spread character descriptions out, only describe a specific thing once in a chapter or don't mention the character's hair in every chapter are more useful.

World building details are another matter entirely, as they often have nothing to do with the plot, but could also be foreshadowing. Sirius and his flying motorbike are the former in the first book, but become the latter in the third. If every piece of world fluff became important later none of it would be subtle foreshadowing, it'd be obvious.
