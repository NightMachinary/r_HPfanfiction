I don't know how fic writers do it, but every book I've read that's first person used the pov to skimp on details. Crime scenes get a quick it was the most gruesome sight I've ever seen, but oh boy is that attractive guy described in every rippling detail. The villain was evil and ugly, his stone castle was old, but his voluptuous, nubile daughter had trailing hair of gold and eyes that sparkled liked gemstones. the bookcase that hid the secret passage was oak, but my love interest's jeans hugged curves that would not quite as we descended the stairs. Their voice was like warm honey over velvet, or some shit.

If you're doing better that that, Kudos! I've just seen it used as an excuse not to detail the world because the pov character 'wouldn't notice that.'
