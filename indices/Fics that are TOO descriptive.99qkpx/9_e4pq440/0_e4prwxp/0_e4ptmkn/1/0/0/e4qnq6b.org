  his voluptuous, nubile daughter had trailing hair of gold and eyes that sparkled liked gemstones. the bookcase that hid the secret passage was oak, but my love interest's jeans hugged curves that would not quite as we descended the stairs. Their voice was like warm honey over velvet, or some shit.

Oh dear, I'm getting Dementia Raven flashbacks hahaha. So since I'm writing in present tense I do describe people's clothes as they are, but had I been writing in past tense I might've even switched the colors around, since experiments have shown that we don't remember crap about that pink fluffy shawl's color if we don't consciously take it in.

And because I have autism my fic is tagged with "Unreliable narrator" because my mind is blegh and will manage to turn a spoken sentence into something else entirely. So hello miscommunication. It's a balancing act.

And boy was it confronting to read through two year old diaries to hunt for my own personality flaws! But it also told me a lot about myself, and I'm so hyped about writing myself as I am instead of unintentionally writing Ideal Me.

Ah, this went a bit off-topic since I also tend to sneeze whatever I'm thinking about on the internet haha.
