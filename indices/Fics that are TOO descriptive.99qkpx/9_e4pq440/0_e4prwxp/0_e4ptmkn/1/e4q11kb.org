  Most of the time these types prefer books written in first person. The style is very different from third, and quite difficult to pull off, but it is a haven for less detailed descriptions.

/screeching tire sound/ Wait what? People expect less details in first POV? Ha, the fic I'm currently working on isn't in this fandom and a self-insert, but as I have ADHD and notice absurd little details in real life, it's stuffed with descriptions.

Idk my beta seems to think it's fine. Maybe my readers just skip to the dialogue (which is wedged in between body language, usually a sentence or two and a "he says" tossed in every now and then.
