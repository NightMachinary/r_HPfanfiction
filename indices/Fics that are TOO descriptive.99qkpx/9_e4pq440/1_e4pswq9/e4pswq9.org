I think there's an appropriate level of detail that you could ideally maintain. Not everything needs to be plot relevant, and if you only describe plot relevant stuff in detail, it's immediately apparent how important it is/how related it is to a later solution/revelation. Meanwhile, not having some slice-of-life elements, or something describing, makes the world feel more "dead." Harry Potter fanfics can kind of get away with less, since as readers we're drawing on info in the books, movies, and other media to supplement texture within the world, but some description of "unimportant" things is still good practice. You can still balance that within the context of broader events that move the plot forwards.

In Sorcerer's Stone, we have a pretty clear series of events at Hogwarts- Harry is good at flying, which leads to the altercation with Malfoy and getting on the Quidditch team. Getting on the Quidditch team leads to both the fake duel with Malfoy and the cursing of his broom during Quidditch. The fake duel with Malfoy leads to Harry and his friends learning about Fluffy, while the cursing of his broom leads to him getting a lead about what's hidden on the third floor.

However, the "unimportant" events related to Quidditch- learning about Harry's dad, reading by the lake, learning about Quidditch history, describing the match- easily fill in the world and make it feel more alive.
