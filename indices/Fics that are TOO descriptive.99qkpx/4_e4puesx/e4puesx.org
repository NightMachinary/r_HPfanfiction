I feel the same about Whispers in the Night, which I'm giving a second go.

First, everyone is given alternative pronouns (e.g. McGonnogall = the hardened battle axe of Hogwarts, Amelia Bones [a very key character] has to be called the head of the DMLE like once a chapter, etc.). Everyone's clothing has to be described ad nauseam, especially if it's the short, form-fitting skirt that one of the love interests happens to be wearing to a normal Tuesday morning breakfast in the Great Hall. Then, every time someone says something (usually movie-script-esque poeticism and depth), 9 other characters' reactions have to be added before we get to the next piece of dialogue. And so on and so forth.

I'm going to trudge on but the story is rumbling on in first gear or neutral 90% of the time.
