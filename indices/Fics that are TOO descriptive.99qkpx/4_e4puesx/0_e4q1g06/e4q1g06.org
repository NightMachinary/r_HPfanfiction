I gave that one up for much the same reason. After the "Greengrass Problem" subplot dragged on for about 10 chapters when it could have been done in 2 or 3, it was too much for me.

Edit: rereading this much later, I don't know what I was thinking. That was /Soul Scars/, which is more tolerable than /Whispers in the Night/, but does have the same problems. And apparently, they're both so tedious that I mixed them up.
