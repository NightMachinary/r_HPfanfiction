Yes this is commonly found in novice writers. They can't bear the thought of the reader not being able to see exactly what's in their head as if it's a film, so they stuff in loads of mundane detail.

All description should have a purpose, for character, atmosphere, symbolism, world building, etc. Slipping in a few "said Harry, munching on his toast" is fine, showing him selecting bread and putting it in a toaster is unnecessary unless the toaster is important to the plot.
