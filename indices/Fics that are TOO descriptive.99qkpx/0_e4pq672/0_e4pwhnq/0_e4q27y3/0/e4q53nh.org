It is worth slogging through. I have yet to read a fic where there remains not only good conflict (Daphne doesn't have it easy) and a relationship that moves from "I don't know you -- acquaintance I don't like --> grudging friend". It also remains the only Harry/Daphne fic where they don't get together within the first 100k words. Could this fic be written in half the words? Yes. Still worth reading however.

The Legacy is an above average fic that immediately comes to mind when I think of marriage contracts. Well worth a read.
