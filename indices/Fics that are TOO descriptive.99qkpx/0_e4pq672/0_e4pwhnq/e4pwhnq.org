Brevity in description is important. The poster child for lack of brevity is The Legacy, which involves convoluted marriage contract history and rules which take about 3000 words to describe. Even putting aside the fact that the author could easily describe the same thing in 500 words by simply being more efficient, where the fic really goes wrong is that it /repeats the description multiple times/.

First some goblin tells Harry. Then Harry tells Neville. Then Harry and Neville tell Daphne. Then Harry, Neville and Daphne tell someone else. And so on. Not once does the author use the phrase "They proceeded to explain their scheme." Instead, the author fully details the entire conversation, all 3000+ words of it. Every. Single. Time.

The mechanics weren't even that clever/interesting to start with, never mind the tenth time you get hit over the head with the same essay on the topic.
