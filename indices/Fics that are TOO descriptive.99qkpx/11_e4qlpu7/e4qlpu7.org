I cringed just reading your post. Yes. YES. I can't stand overly descriptive stories, be they original or fanfiction. If I can get away with it, I drop them right away; it's just not worth it when I can find much better works to read. As a beta reader I take on varied types of stories, but I'm really sick of YA and slice of life precisely because of this phenomenon. The worst is that they tend to be the products of new writers who feel all these details are vital to the story and won't accept concrit aimed at trimming their descriptions and purple prose. I'm getting upset just thinking about it...
