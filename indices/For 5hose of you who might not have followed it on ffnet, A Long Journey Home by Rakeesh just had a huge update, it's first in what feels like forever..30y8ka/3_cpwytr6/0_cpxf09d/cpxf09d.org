If anyone else decides to do like me and sign up, once your account is created, you sign in with your email address, not your username. I picked a name like Word1 Word2 Word3 and wasn't able to login. I tried every combination I could think of, but it didn't work. I finally notice that the prompt said "email" and not "username." Once I tried my address, it worked.
