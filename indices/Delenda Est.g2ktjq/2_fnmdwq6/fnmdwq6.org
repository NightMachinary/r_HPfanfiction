I reread this recently actually. Harry doesn't stay annoying long. He's stubborn at first, but then he gets into changing things (hopefully for the better). I don't recall the muggle tech being a big thing.

Honestly, I found Bellatrix to be the most annoying part. Young-Bellatrix isn't a psycho Death Eater, but she fixates on Harry (which is actually pretty understandable) and then she fixated on politics (which struck me as “she's smart and bored and doesn't know what to do besides politics” not as her having any particular interest in politics). Smart and bored and not knowing what else to do besides entertain herself is actually kind of her base characterization the whole story actually.

That being said, I did enjoy the fic. I think it's worth reading.
