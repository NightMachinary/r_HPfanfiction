The guns-more-powerful-than-magic thing doesn't change, no. But it doesn't get any bigger or 'worse' by your metric, either. If memory serves, it's more of a motivating factor than an active part of the plot.

The changing the future thing does, though. He gets very proactive in some interesting ways later on, he just has to come to terms with rewriting everything he knows first.

Personally, I'd say it gets better, but I'm not overly bothered by the 'muggles are scary' thing like you seem to be, so I suppose my opinion probably isn't all that indicative of whether you'd enjoy it. I know some have said it gets a bit meandering in the last third though. Sorry, I know that's not all that helpful, but I would say that it got better, yes.
