I wouldn't call it exactly /unreadable/, but I was definitely disappointed in the second half of the story. The first half was really good IMO, but after Harry and Bellatrix return to the present, all the conflict and struggle just basically evaporates. The really unfortunate part is that there were plenty of plot hooks that could have been used to change that and present a real challenge, it just didn't happen.
