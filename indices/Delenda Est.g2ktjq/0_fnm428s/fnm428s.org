Well I would say whether a fic is good is all in the eyes of the beholder. I actually like the story. I think its one of the few Harry/Bellatrix that i think is realistic. Eg harry meets bellatrix before she goes off the deep end and becomes the insane deatheater that we all know.

As far as in terms of Harry not wanting to change anything remember this is after the 3rd year time turner where he was repeatedly told he can't change anything that he already knows has happened or really bad things happen. He'll slowly change this opinion.

In terms of muggle vs magical I believe the story does a decent job of balancing the two.

Now whether you should continue reading that's a personal choice. I would recommend that you keep reading. What's the worst that could happen you. You hit the end and decide that the story wasn't as good as you were hoping it would be. Or you reach the end and go Wow, that story turned out better than I thought it would.

Either way you were able to keep yourself from being bored during the quarantine by reading some Harry Potter fanfiction. That's a win in my book. üòÅ
