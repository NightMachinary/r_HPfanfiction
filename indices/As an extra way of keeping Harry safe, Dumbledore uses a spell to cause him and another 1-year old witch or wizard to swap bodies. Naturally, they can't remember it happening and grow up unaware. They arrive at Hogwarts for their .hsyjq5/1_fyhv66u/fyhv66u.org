In linkffn(Best Laid Plans by Don Sample), Sirius decides to protect Harry by swapping him with a randomly-chosen infant in the US. As the infant he swapped Harry with was Xander Harris, it didn't really work.

And I can't remember the name of the story, but there's one that has an almost throwaway scene with, if I remember correctly, Dumbledore explaining to Draco that he's actually the real Harry Potter and had been swapped at birth for protection. After Draco leaves Dumbledore's office, we discover that it was a prank by Harry using polyjuice while Dumbledore was away from the school.
