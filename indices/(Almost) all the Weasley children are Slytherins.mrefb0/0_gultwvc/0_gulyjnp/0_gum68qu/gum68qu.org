The Ron argument makes sense, just had to leave him as Harry's dorm mate for later storylines.

I put the twins in Puff for their loyalty and willing to toil to build their craft and future empire, which plays heavily into my series. Plus the Puff and Slytherin dorms are in the dungeons and I have a head cannon they set up prank mazes in the maze of halls between the dorms so they would love the spare practice and they can sneak out to meet with Percy and my oc to plot what they are up to through everything that goes on in the school.

Ginny I put into Ravenclaw for the same skilled dueling reason you had listed as she studies various charms and hexes the others don't in the series to help the order and da when she sees that the fight is coming up.

But your placements are really good, mine were just fitted to suite my story and really as the prompt listed they really could go for any house on several traits. With the exception of Bill and Charlie who sadly don't have as much to draw from in the books to fill them out beyond the typical Gryffindor cookie cutter shape they were typed as.
