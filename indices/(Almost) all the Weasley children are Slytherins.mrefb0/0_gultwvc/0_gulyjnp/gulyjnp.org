I honestly see Ron in Slytherin too (if it wasn't for all the bloodpurism in that house). He is ambitious - see his reflection in the Mirror of Erised. He was also the one who wanted to be an auror first - that wasn't Harrys idea. Auror is one of the most difficult carrier-choices you can make and even if he didn't stay there, he was an Auror for some time. He is also cunning - being good at chess means he is at least a bit cunning. It was also him who tricked the Slytherins in OoTP so they could get to Harry and Hermione and it was him who found a way to cheat at Divination.

On the other hand I see Fred and George in Ravenclaw. They are geniuses, even if not in the conventional sense.

Ginny on the other Hand is the epitome of Gryffindor for me. She is very brave but also very impulsive. We know she got into the Slug-Club because she hexed someone - in front of a teacher. She did it to defend her friends, but it wasn't a very well thought plan. She also led the resistance against the Death Eaters in their own school.

On the question who belongs to Hufflepuff? Aside from Percy I could imagine everyone of the Weasleys there. They are all very loyal.
