I spent minutes trying to find the mistake and when I found it I spent 5 minutes laughing hysterically. I am not a native speaker tho, so that's why it took me so long to find the mistake.

But seriously, there are so many common typos, I also like it when they forget the "s" when writing "she" or forget the "s" for the 3rd person singular form of verbs.
