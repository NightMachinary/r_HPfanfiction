Wondering and wandering are also frequently switched.

But the one that really irritates me---especially in the (admittedly rare) cases where an author gets them COMPLETELY BACKWARDS (i.e., uses them consistently but completely switched)---is THEN versus THAN. This is taught in /second grade/! If seven-year-olds can learn it, why can't fanfic writers?
