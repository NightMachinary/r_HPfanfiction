What irritates me the most is when a writer uses action/beats incorrectly.

"I'm not sure that's a good idea," Daphne shrugged.

...What? You can't shrug words.

That should be either:

Daphne shrugged. "I'm not sure that's a good idea."

"I'm not sure that's a good idea." Daphne shrugged.

"I'm not sure that's a good idea," Daphne said, shrugging.

Or a variant of one of those.

Actions cannot speak.

Another?

"Maybe," Ron nodded.

Ron, or any other anatomically correct human, cannot "nod" words.

Seeing that is immersion-breaking, for me. I mean, typos I can ignore, but the above? Eh.
