So it's not a common word, but it really irritates me when someone says something like “they banished the garbage” or something. Okay where'd you yeet it to? Unless you mean vanished. Like it's said in canon that there's a banishing charm that's the opposite of the summoning charm (duh) and there's a vanishing charm, that removes things from existence. It's a small thing but that's what irritates me the most
