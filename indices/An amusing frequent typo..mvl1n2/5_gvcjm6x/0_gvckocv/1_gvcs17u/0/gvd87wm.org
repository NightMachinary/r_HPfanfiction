  Yes, this is why it helps to have somebody else proof your work. You know what it's supposed to say, so your brain can fill that in regardless of what is actually there.

Very true. Even better is to have it read back to you. I use VoiceDreamReader with a couple of Ivona British voices. Things like the above stand out easily, as do missing or doubled words. What's especially surprising is that there is just enough of a difference of intonation for me to realize when I use the wrong form of to/too/two!

I can't recommend VDR highly enough, though with the caveat that purchasing a couple of Ivona voices makes a huge difference. After you use them a bit, it's easy to forget that it isn't a real person reading for you.

And as a bonus, you can use it for any ePub, PDF, or web page you have, thus allowing you to turn fanfic files into audiobooks.

Tip: I also recommend using one particular voice just for proofing your own work and another voice or voices for other things. Creating that separation will make it easier to not feel like you constantly want to correct other people's work because your brain will tend to associate just one voice with proofing.
