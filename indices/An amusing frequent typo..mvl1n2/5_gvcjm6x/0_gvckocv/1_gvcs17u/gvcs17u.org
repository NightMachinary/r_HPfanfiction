Yes, this is why it helps to have somebody else proof your work. You know what it's supposed to say, so your brain can fill that in regardless of what is actually there.

One of the tricks I use when I do professional editing is to read the document backwards. It makes incorrect words stand out more when you are mentally reconstructing the sentence forward as you go. You can also use this on your own works.

And, maybe it's my age, but I proof more accurately on a dead-tree copy. Typos figuratively jump off the page at me from a printed work: it's my superpower. Seriously, my eyes jump to the part of the page with a bad word (not to be confused with a naughty word), even if I haven't consciously read that far yet.
