People grabbing other peoples poop..

Like "He grabbed her waste" instead of "he grabbed her waist"

Or this silliness "he grabbed some cloth from the draw and put it on"

Im sorry he grabbed what from the what? Cloth is just a sheet a fabric, its what clothing is made of.. unless he is wearing a bloody toga no way he is wearing just cloth. And your wardrobe has drawers, and you can open one drawer, but draw is an action (and now i will draw my gun and shoot you) but you can not open a draw.. Its like saying "now i will fill a grab" it makes no bloody sense.
