The one that gets me most is verb tense randomness. If you're telling a story in past tense, stick to it! Same with present tense. Some authors switch tenses within a single sentence, and it drives me up a wall. In general I'll drop those fics within the first few dozen paragraphs, because I don't care how interesting the premise is, if you can't keep even a basic level of tense consistency I'm not going to be able to expect plot or world consistency either.
