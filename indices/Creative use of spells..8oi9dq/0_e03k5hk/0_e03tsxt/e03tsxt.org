Also wanted to add a not too common fic: Echoes of Power, Part I: Anger linkffn(3322666)

Harry gets really creative with his use of spells. Some highlights include:

- Creating a bubblehead charm around someones head, then shrinking it to change the pressure and destroy the inner ear.

- Using warming charms and beard flipping charms to distract opponents.

- A great scene focuses on just what your talking about. Harry duels someone using only the cushioning charm.
