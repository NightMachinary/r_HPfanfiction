Well, it is the opposite for me, I hate nearly all of the more important characters in HP for various reasons (like Hermione being lauded as being super smart, but she didn't even pick up on the fact that Harry was an abused child! Damned, I am not very observant myself - but even I picked up on the fact that two of my friends were beaten at home!).

Sirius Black however is a character I love because he didn't give up and become miserable (and looking for vengeance - which I totally would have done in his shoes!), despite having spent over a decade in Azkaban (!), his immaturity is refreshing!

Regular adults in most cases are either boring or annoying and almost all of them a hypocrites, who were trying shit out as kids that they will now try to forbid their kids from trying...seriously, I am not into kids (don't want any!), but if I did? I'd give them advice, but I would let them make their own mistakes (at first I'd try to shield them from repercussions, but as soon as they are old enough I'd step by step dial back that protection!) and I wouldn't be very restrictive and strict (that doesn't IMHO help - hell, I was very creative when going around my parent's restrictions as kid, hell I sometimes went to be early to play video-games during the night because my parents didn't allow me to play for long during they!)

So yeah, I love Sirius! Especially since he's not a coward like Remus, a snarky git like Snape, a child-sacrificing asshole like Dumbledore, a follower like McGonagall (she tells Dumbledore not to leave Harry at the Dursleys but doesn't have the courage to pick him up after Dumbledore leaves and find him a better home? Pathetic! Can't controll Snape either!) etc.

Sirius is an enjoyable character for me!
