I think (or at least I believe and I hope others do to) that it is ok for me to love Sirius as a fictional character who is just so interesting as a concept and someone I desperately want to meet and analyse and study,

While still not holding them as an moral example to real human beings.

I love Sirius I really do. I love him because he's fictional. If he was a real person I'd be a wary of the guy and definately wouldn't be able to as easily overlook his actions but as a character he is fascinating.
