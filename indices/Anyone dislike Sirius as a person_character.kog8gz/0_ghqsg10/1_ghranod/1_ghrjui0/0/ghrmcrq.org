Sorry, I forgot that might read differently outside of certain circles. But "boundaries" are a concept relative to family therapy theories; they're not necessarily physical, but more relate to the social/emotional interdependence of individuals within the family system.

Families with diffuse boundaries err on the side of emotional dependence / enmeshment, whereas families with rigid boundaries are more disengaged. For example, in enmeshed families, parents can be overly-involved in certain aspects of their children's lives (eg, helicopter parents) or may rely consistently on their child for emotional support or otherwise share information / put expectations on a child that are beyond typical developmental capacity (eg, the child who takes care if their parent when they come home intoxicated).

I can explain further, but I'm not sure if anyone has even bothered reading this far, and I spend so much of my time writing clinical assessments in line with this sort of stuff that if no one's reading, I'll just kindly dip away.
