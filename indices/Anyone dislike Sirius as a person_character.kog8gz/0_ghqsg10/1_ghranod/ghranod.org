I largely agree with this thoughtful post: the idea of Sirius is awesome, for everything you said, plus the fact that this--having a long-lost family member who loves you to bits--is kinda the dream for a lot of kids in Harry's position (ie, emotional abuse).

But as for /liking/ Siruis... It's challenging. As a kid, I wholly accepted his character through Harry's eyes, and so I loved him. In fact, I was beyond distraught when he died, and didn't start book 6 until years later, because I was so upset.

But reading as an adult... It was a completely different story. I saw him instead through the eyes of the other adults in Harry's life, and found their criticisms to be almost lenient. I definitely feel that children should be surrounded with as many people who love them as possible, but Sirius... He really needed some support.

And in absolutely no way am I saying that that makes him unlovable. /However,/ it does frustrate me how he relied so much on Harry. His boundaries were really not appropriate at all, and his choices were questionable. The fact that he loved Harry doesn't really excuse all that. It just makes it harder. : (

So I don't hate him, but I can't say I like him, either.
