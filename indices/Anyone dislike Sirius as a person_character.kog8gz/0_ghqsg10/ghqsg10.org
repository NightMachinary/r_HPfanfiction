I... Don't know if I like him as a person but I love the idea of him as a character.

Grows up in a strict aristocratic household. Rebellious heir to an estate. Is disowned for a variety of reasons, one being put into a different school house that was out of his control.

He hates his family and what they stand for. But is forever one of them. He is stubborn and self righteous and proud. He is ruthless and cruel. And always thinks he is right so doesn't even see the consiquences of his actions.

He's wrongfully imprisoned for 12 years and still goes back to fighting with the people who betrayed him and didn't fight for him even when they definately should have. He doesn't have the time with his godson. He never got to be happy.

I don't know if I like him because he's not 'good' but I am completely fascinated by him because how could he be 'good' after all the shit he's been through you know? I can't tell whether I hate him or love him...
