Idk about OP, but IMO:

Harry starts off being powerful enough to fight off a hundred dementors and has enough will and power to turn the priori incatatem spell back on Voldemort in GoF. He kills a fucking basilisk at twelve. Then in the OotP and on, all he suddenly knows is expelliarmus. Yeah, he's really, really good at it, but it's not as impressive as everything he accomplished as a younger wizard. He put in so much work to survive the GoF but you don't see him try to learn anything to fight against Voldemort because the last two books are focused on hunting horcruxes.

Even as a teenager, the final battle never sat right with me. Their duel was so anticlimactic. You mean to tell me you've hyped up Voldemort for 7 books and he just dies because Harry's DISARMING spell backfires?

Not that Harry isn't impressive. He totally is. He went through all he went through and he still had the capacity to not hate Tom Riddle.
