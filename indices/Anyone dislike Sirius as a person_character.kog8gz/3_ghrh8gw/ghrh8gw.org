No, I find him to be an enjoyable character and the type of asshole I wouldn't mind knowing.

He's reckless, he's cruel, and I've always said he and Bellatrix were a lot alike, but no matter how old I get I'll always appreciate that he was the one character not intent on treating Harry like a sheltered kid. I also think he devolves in development post GoF for the sake bof plot in the same way Harry and Dumbledore do.

  It's also not cool that he thinks Harry is supposed to be just like James.

Less of this and more of trying to live vicariously through Harry in OotP.
