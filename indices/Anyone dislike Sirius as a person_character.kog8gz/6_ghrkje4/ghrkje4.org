I really really don't like him as a "person" and I have some issues with the way he's written as a "character", although they're not insurmountable. I view him as a quintessential Black, but a contrarian. Cruel, condescending, hypocritical, but unfailingly loyal. I also think that if JKR actually meant for him to be intelligent she failed abysmally. He's, at best, impulsive and reckless to the point that his intelligence is a non-factor in nearly anything he does, before and after Azkaban.
