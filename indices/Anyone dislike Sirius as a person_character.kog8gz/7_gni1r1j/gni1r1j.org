As a character, I can appreciate him. As a person, not so much.

It's ironic that he hated his family so much when he acted like them all along .... the only difference was which side he was on . Him and Bellatrix share so many traits and I think even Narcissa didn't act like a Black as much as he did .

He is unlikable .

And there must have been a reason why nobody thought he was innocent when he was sent to Azkaban, right ?
