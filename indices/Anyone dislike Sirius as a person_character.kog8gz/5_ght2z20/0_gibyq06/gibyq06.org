  Lupin suddenly disappareared for the duration of GoF, was quite insignificant to Harry in OotP and then became closer to him again in HBP

I think this was in character. While Lupin did give Harry Dementor lessons, he never told Harry how deep his friendship with James went until a moment called for it. Even then, he doesn't make it sound like they are best friends - and this is the son of the man who not only turned Animagi for him, but also financially supported him until his death. The loss of James is devastating to Lupin, but not once in his interaction with Harry in POA gives an indication of this. Until he meets Sirius and threatens to kill Peter "in a quiet voice".

He is a detached character, he keeps people at arm's length. There is so much self hatred in the man, you see it manifesting best in an intimate relationship: the one with Tonks. He spends an entire book running away from her, and then once again, dumping her when she is pregnant. That itself tells you how bad his self hatred is. I see him getting close with Harry again in HBP because he recognised that with Sirius gone, Harry would have some expectations from him and he addressed this. Frankly, they became closer in DH, after Harry shook him to senses with that confrontation. Harry got through his walls then.
