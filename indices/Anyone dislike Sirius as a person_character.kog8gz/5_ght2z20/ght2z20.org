I am not very fond of Sirius. Recklessness is a personality trait I don't appreciate in real life, and I have no reason to appreciate it in fiction. As far as I can remember, I have yet to encounter a story where being reckless actually pays out and the characters can honestly say that it was worth taking the risk. Sirius's role in so many stories is to be the hothead who rushes into an adventure, causing only suffering to the good guys. Since I know that from the moment he suggests doing anything, I usually hope he would not be in the story.

I like it when Harry has a patient and considerate father-figure, like Lupin. But if Lupin is in the story, the narrative doesn't feel like it has a place for Sirius. One of them must be left out, or the story will become too complicated. Rowling seemed to think like this, because Lupin suddenly disappareared for the duration of GoF, was quite insignificant to Harry in OotP and then became closer to him again in HBP.

Also Sirius's character and role in fan fiction stories has affected my view of him. I strongly dislike him being a shallow womaniser. And I'm totally fed up with the trope that Pettigrew is caught at an early point, making Sirius a free man. Pettigrew has such a massive plot potential, and to waste it just to give justice to the writer's favourite character is really bad.

In my story Pettigrew actually convinces those of the good guys who find out he is alive that he is just an innocent poor man who never did anything wrong. Nobody learns the truth about Sirius, and everyone suspects him of arranging the Triwizard thing and Voldemort's return. Even after Pettigrew is revealed to be a Death Eater, Sirius is still believed to be a Death Eater too, because nobody has any information that suggests otherwise. It is believed that he was a double agent just like Pettigrew, and that he tried to kill Pettigrew in order to protect his own cover.
