Poor emotional boundaries, little to no impulse control, a little bit feral for someone born into a family that saw itself as royals...not someone I would necessarily like if I knew him as a person, but as a character, he is great. His greatest redeeming quality is his capacity for love and loyalty. His relationship with Harry breaks my heart in so many ways.

Edit: Rowling does like him - she just doesn't think he is "wholly wonderful" because of his hypocrisy with regard to Kreacher.
