He's a hothead. Kinda like Ron. He acts before thinking and he doesn't fully realise the consequences of his actions.

I don't have that much sympathy for him because as harsh as it sounds part of me blames him for ending up in Azkaban. First there didn't put in any contingency plans when they made Peter the Secret Keeper. Then he went after Harry and let Hagrid take him away. He could have followed behind and taken him from the Dursleys. After that he went after Peter he just broke down a bit.. he didn't get up and sometimes it seems that he chose to stay in Azkaban rather than fight for his freedom or for a trial.
