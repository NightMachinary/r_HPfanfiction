Well seeing as +most+ all of my short fics are romance/smut, my process is probably a bit different from people who actually tell a good long story, haha.

That said, most of my ideas come to me when I'm falling asleep or talking with HP-loving friends. One silly fic I wrote centered around Hermione discovering that after the war, a surviving Severus Snape had been providing his voice for audiobooks. The idea only came about because I had been discussing it with a coworker who's also a very huge HP fan. Otherwise, as I said, I think of them when I'm falling asleep. I imagine two characters, put them in a room together, figure out the tension or emotion of the situation, and work from there!
