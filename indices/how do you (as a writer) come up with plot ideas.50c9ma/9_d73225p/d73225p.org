I'm a weird blend of "organic" (flows freely) and "organized".

Usually my plot bunnies come naturally. Sometimes at work, when daydreaming, falling asleep, and even while reading a book or watching a movie. The plots hit me and I go "I fucking wanna write this shit like right now!" I've never used prompts, but I have toyed with the idea a few times.

But then I construct the plot. Every fic I write, except for oneshots, has a file labeled "Fic Title Info" where it contains character info, timelines, major events, and even excerpts for future scenes that I suddenly become inspired to write but am not ready, structurally, to throw it in. The character outlines help a LOT, especially when I make minor changes or add things like certain scars on Harry aside from the obvious one.

So the plot idea itself comes organically, but I always try to structure my plot to ensure proper continuity.
