I usually start with an idea for one particular scene, either between characters or an event.

Then if I get a few more scenes I'll note them down too. At this point it's not really a story, more a collection of interactions that I like that don't make sense on their own.

Eventually, I can slot these ideas together, and a plot starts to appear. It also means I can pick out sections and try them with other bits I've noted down for different ideas.

It's not really an efficient way of writing or developing plots but it works for me.
