Steal everything.

No, I'm not joking. All of my ideas come from either something I read or something I watched. Basically the only original character I've ever come up with is a telekinetic boxer, and I'm using him for my own IP.

Remember kids, the only difference between plagiarism and originality is how you mix it up.
