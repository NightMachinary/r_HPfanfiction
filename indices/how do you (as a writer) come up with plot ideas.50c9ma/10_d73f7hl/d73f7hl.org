I get ideas from TV shows/movies I watch or from news stories I read or from stories friends tell that amused me. Not 100% original, but what is, these days? ;)

As for plotting, I write an outline, and then I clean it up by doing the same method JKR did (at least [[http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/JK-Rowlings-Phoenix-Plot-Outline.jpg][like in OotP]]). I'm not someone who can get an idea and run with it, see where it goes. I must plan the story out to the very end.
