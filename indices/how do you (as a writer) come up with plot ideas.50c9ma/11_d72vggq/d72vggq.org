I don't really like setting my writing based on code. Usually it's just me doing x and then thinking "well what would Harry do here?" i.e., I've been playing Minecraft. I just started writing a "Harry's sent to minecraft'verse, doesn't know why but he's got his wand and he's found some dude named steve's journal. Gotta survive while Hermione et al figure out what happened."
