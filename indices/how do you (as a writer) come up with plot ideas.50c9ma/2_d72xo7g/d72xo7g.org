My methodology can best be summed up as:

#+begin_example
  I'm not a *writer* per-se. 

  I'm a DM who writes.
#+end_example

Most of my scenes start from an amusing premise, or what I think would be the natural result of how the previous scene ended. I then ask myself "What would X, Y, & Z do in this situation... and what happens because of that?" on loop until I look at the last line and say "Damn, that's a good stopping point." Like most DMs will tell you, if you plan on your players doing one of 4 things, they'll find a way to choose option 7. My characters do the same things to me a lot, but that's half the fun of writing without a pre-scripted plot.

It helps that I based most of my important characters on people I know. So when I got stuck on how to have Amy Madison handle something in my Buffy The Vampire Slayer fic, I literally called the girl I based her on (Amy in particular had a lot of gaps to fill in her characterization) and said "What would you do if...?"

... of course then I had to explain /why/ I wanted to know what she'd talk about if she were out clothes shopping with Faith Lehane. But that's how my story gained a Beta.
