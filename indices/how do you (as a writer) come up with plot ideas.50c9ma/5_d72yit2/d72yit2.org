It always starts as a random idea, usually in the form of some sort of divergence. Like, what if Harry took Luna as a date to Slughorn's Christmas party, and ignored the distraction caused by Draco? Then, I start making bullets points to what would change afterwards. Perhaps that's not the best example since it is basic, and nothing would really change in the end other than Harry's love interest. But, I have hundreds of snippets like these, and they never go anywhere, but if I write them down, there's always a chance I'll go back and revisit it.

For something not as random, I'll go into more depth with an outline. For example, I've been plotting and writing and scrapping, and rewriting a sequel to my H/FD story. It is difficult, because there are some ideas I have at the beginning that don't pan out, but the trick is to not get too attached to any of them and be able to scrap them as I go if it stops making sense within the context of where the story has gone.

It ends up being a long list of bullet points. I come up with a general break down of chapters, and I try to estimate how many words each idea will take up to try and control the pacing and chapter length of the story - I don't want one chapter to be 3k words, and the next to be 8k.

So, for bullet points, I'll just write down an idea. Like, my story will have auror!Fleur and prefect!Harry. So then for each, I will follow up with a little blurb about how I want those to interact with the story. So, for prefect Harry, that means there needs to be a scene with Harry getting his badge, Harry meeting the other prefects on the train, and Harry getting into a conflict with prefect!Draco, things like that.

For a larger plot point, I will go in depth with actual paragraphs. For example, I have to figure out a new plot for Voldemort when a lot of the puzzle pieces change. The only thing that doesn't change is that Voldemort still wants to prophecy. So, how would I go about that if the situation makes it so Harry can't be tricked into bring all his friends to the DoM to get ambushed.

Furthermore, I tend to have certain scenes that I really want to includes, scenes which are some of the prime reasons that I'm even writing a fic. Like, I'll write the basics to a Yule Ball scene weeks before I get to actually write it, because there's some clever dialogue I want to include or a certain way I want to describe a character interaction. There's a lot of little snippets like that.
