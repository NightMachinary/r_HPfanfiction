I've never thought, “I want to write a fanfic, what shall I write about?” The idea or subject has always come first. I tried a random plot generator once just to see what happened and all it generated was nonsense. I have always had some sort of ‘Eureka' moment near the beginning of the planning process though I can't particularly remember most of them.

I do remember the first story I wrote, which I started before I knew fanfiction was even a Thing. I knew I wanted to write a story that gave Sirius something to do in the weeks before the battle at the DoM but I didn't know what that story would be. One evening (and oddly I remember the moment quite clearly), I was out walking and for some reason the phrase ‘Black Death' came into my mind, rapidly followed by the idea that it might not have been called after the symptoms of the illness, but the dark wizard who created it. And then I had a story.

So I suppose at the plot-development stage it's really a stream-of-consciousness thing for me.
