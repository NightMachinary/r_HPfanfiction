It depends on the story. For my most recent fic, the climax appeared perfectly in my head without any context, completely out-of the blue. It was a case of creating a detailed plot around that image of Harry sitting at a table, urgently trying to get his godson away from a killer without raising suspicions. For this story, I had a whole notebook filled with details, mapping out the entire fic so I could slip in important things from the beginning - like a certain news article or casual mentions of Colin.

While other fics I'll freely admit I've made them up as I've gone along. My humour fic started because I wanted to write Harry coming into contact with Aunt Marge again, and of course she had to blow up. So I just started writing, and, well, the fart jokes just wrote themselves.

I would say most of the time I lie between these two extremes.
