I read the works that inspired JK Rowling or parts of them... And I look up background information about JK Rowling's life and things in the books and what Jk Rowling said on Pottermore or on Twitter...For me it's most about extrapolating the information from canon, in a what I hope is a logical way, to fill in the gaps and come up with something new that clashes as little possible with what is written in the books (within the limitations that come with being a way different person from JK Rowling). Sometimes I think about whether I would like to read a computer-created fanfiction, just like there are "Rembrand" paintings created by a computer, and I think I would be excited to read one.
