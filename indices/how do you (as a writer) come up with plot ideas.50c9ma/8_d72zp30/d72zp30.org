A good number of my plots come from reading a badfic or thinking of a cliche and going, "Okay. What if I did it better?" Like the cliche wrong boy-who-lived fic except the brothers are stuck together like glue and don't end up becoming enemies. Or reading a fic where Lily and James actually are resurrected through the Mirror of Erised and going, "I wouldn't trust anything that came out of a mirror." and thus the evil mirror people are born.

Otherwise I think, "what would screw over canon as much as possible?" Or I ask my writing partner, "hey, what do you think would happen if X?"

On at least one occasion though it's just begun with a single line and me deciding that it would be a great opening to a fic.
