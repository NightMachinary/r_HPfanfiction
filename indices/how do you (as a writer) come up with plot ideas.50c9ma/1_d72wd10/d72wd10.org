Ideas themselves come to me when I daydream. Most of it is rubbish, but sometimes I get some nice little idea.

Plot is something I create without emotion. I believe in the use of traditional story structures when it comes down to simply building a story from ground up. Time lines, arcs, character development,... All of it is planned and written down in short sentences, bulletpoints or tables.
