While I don't mind fics that feature OCs, I would personally not read a fic that has /only/ OCs. I mean, I read HP fics for a reason -- watching various HP characters in interesting situations. I consider the HP characters far more important than the HP universe. Basically, I would rather read a bunch of HP characters being stuck in the universe of Star Wars somehow, rather than a group of Star Wars characters being stuck in the universe of Harry Potter (I don't read SW fanfics).
