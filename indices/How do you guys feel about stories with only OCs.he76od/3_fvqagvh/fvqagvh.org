I read and enjoyed Alexandra Quick, and that has practically none of the canon HP characters make an appearance by virtue of being set in America (and since the fic started pre-Fantastic Beasts, it's not even Ilvermorny): linkao3(16927533)

A Harry Potter fanfic, to me, needs to consist of one of the following:

- Canon Characters.
- Canon Setting/Mechanical feel.

You can absolutely make a fanfic with none of the same characters, set in an OC magic school, and still have it count as a Harry Potter fanfic.
