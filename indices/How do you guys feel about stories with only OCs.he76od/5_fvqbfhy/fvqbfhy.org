It's what I write. And very much what I like to read. Because I like the setting, but feel bored by the characters of the trio. Not because they're bad characters, but because of simple overexposure; we know them too well

I have Harry as strictly an unseen character although he's widely gossiped about. Ron and Hermione have a brief amount of screen time, with a couple of lines each. I focus on the students in two years above the trio so I've got some canon characters to play with - the Twins, Cedric Diggory, Angelina Johnson - but so I've essentially had to compose an entire student body for that year, some purely inventions, some fleshings-out of canon characters of which little other than name is known.
