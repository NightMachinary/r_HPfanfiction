Depends on the subject. Exploring different magic without warping canon character into something they're not? Yes.

Stories about unsung heroes in any of the wars?

Obscurial recovery fic with found family fic with some poor muggle out of their depth?

OC werewolf who was raised solely in the wizarding world out in the muggle world by choice doing their best

There are a lot of interesting situations that don't need canon characters or canon characters can't fulfill.

Muggleborn animagus being petty to their muggle neighbor.

Muggleborn support group.

Families of muggleborns support group. Hey Hermiones Parents

Squibs doing important magical research.

It'd be a hard sell and tagging it so people can find and read it would be a nightmare. It'd probably have to be its own like category. Like...Harry Potter Original Works or something.
