What if it's a whole new plot? Like it has the same setting (Hogwarts) and some of the same characters (teachers mostly), but it's set around now and it has a different conflict and everything. Would that be of interest to you or anyone else?

But thanks for the examples, they're really great ideas. Good prompts for sure :)
