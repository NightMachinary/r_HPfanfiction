At some point I do have to /wonder/ why you'd use one thing and not another.

As an example, if you're using Hogwarts as a location but never using the canon staff, that's a bit strange - either you might as well go full OC-magic-school, or you should probably use the canon characters in the background /somewhere/ if there's no logical reason for them to have disappeared.
