I guess there's no real reason for it, maybe I should just use a whole new school. The only thing is, then the story loses the last bit of familiarity of Hogwarts, you know?

I probably will have some canon characters be mentioned, but I'm not a huge fan of The Cursed Child characters, and my story would be set around then.
