You could absolutely go the Alexandra Quick route with it.

Nothing wrong with a fanfic that only uses the barest skeleton idea of the works it's based on.

That said, if you /have/ a reason to use Hogwarts, you should probably include the characters that'd logically be there in /some/ way or another - even if it's in the same capacity that Daphne Greengrass exists in canon.

Also, you can safely disregard Cursed Child in the opinion of most fanfic writers/readers, the epilogue is more up-in-the-air.
