I don't use reviews except for here, on hpfanfiction. I otherwise don't use the number of reviews to judge a fic or read the reviews to see what they say. 99% of reviews are junk saying:

- OMG I love this!
- Wow that scene where Draco and Hermione lost their virginities to each other was so hot!
- When are you going to update? I know it says it's on hiatus, but soon, right? This is my favorite story so you have to.
