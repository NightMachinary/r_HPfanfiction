Reviews are for the author for me. I'd only "review" in the sense of recommending to other people if I like it, and it's in no way as detailed as the former. I try to review everything I've read and liked if the author seems active, and in those cases, it's praise. I leave critique if they mention they're looking for feedback or some gentle suggestions otherwise - the kind of stuff that can help them without too much investment. Critique or praise, I love when people mention specific things from the story in reviews, so I try to add something like that.
