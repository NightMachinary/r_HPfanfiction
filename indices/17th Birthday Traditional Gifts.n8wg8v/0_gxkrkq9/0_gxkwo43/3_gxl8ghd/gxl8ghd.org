If you go by folklore... witchcraft is a gender-neutral term. It refers to the act of practicing magic. Like witch and craft. Wizardry I think it has to do more with cultural aspects because we often hear terms such as wizard money, wizarding world, etc. So I don't think they were intended to be gender based. In fact it's only the HP lore that establishes witches and wizards as based on their gender. In classic folklore a witch is anyone that practices magic regardless on their gender, while wizards are the ones that have surpassed basic spells and rituals and rely more on conceptual magic and they are usually depicted as elderly men with long white beards and pointy blue hats with stars on them. However by the classic definition Lily should have been a wizard as well.
