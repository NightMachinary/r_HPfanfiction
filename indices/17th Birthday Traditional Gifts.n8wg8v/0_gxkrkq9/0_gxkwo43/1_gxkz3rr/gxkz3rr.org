Technically speaking, witchcraft and wizardry used to be two separate aspects of magic. Witchcraft was more the magic using a wand such as Charms and Transfiguration. While wizardry would be more Potions and Herbology magic along with rituals, somewhat like the "witches" at the Salem Witch Trials. It is only after each meant separate things that they now have been gendered.

Edit - fixed because I had them mixed up at first
