You have those mixed up, which is understandable because of how the two are portrayed in modern times.

Witchcraft was hexes, curses, spells - which in HP would be things like Charms and Transfiguration. Every man and woman ever tried for witchcraft was accused of something like that.

Wizardry was alchemy and similar magical arts. At Hogwarts, that would be Potions, Herbology, and flying. John Damian was a famous alchemist in the court of King IV of Scotland. He became famous when he attempted to fly in a homemade chicken suit by leaping from the parapets. It did not work, but he survived, so... yeah. Mixed results.
