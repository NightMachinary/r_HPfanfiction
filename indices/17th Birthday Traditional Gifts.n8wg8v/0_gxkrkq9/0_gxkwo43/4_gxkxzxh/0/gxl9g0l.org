She was/is very good at worldbuilding, considering the succes and the interest of the world she's built. What you must understand is that - even though it doesn't feel like it - the harry potter world is soft worldbuilding, where the rules aren't hard and fixed and everything is mapped out, unlike hard worldbuilding, where it is. everything is made or written in service of the plot and Harry's experiences en viewpoint. And that's not a wrong approach. It just isn't hard worldbuilding, but it gets treated like that and under that kind of scrutiny it'll always fall short.

A good example of very soft worldbuilding are the worlds from the studio ghibli movies. A good example of hard worldbuilding are the Lord of the Rings books.
