Wizards probably receive a watch or something as significant because of their coming of age, if it's not just a Weasley thing: Witches... I'm not sure. What would a woman from a few centuries ago get from her parents upon reaching eighteen?

That's the sort of cultural norm you should look into for ideas.

Now, if they didn't give anything to daughters reaching that age (quite possible -- I know very little about that time period, honestly), I suppose something like a family pendant, ring, or heirloom would work for the story? Hair pins passed down from mother to eldest daughter, maybe?

You gotta remember that this "gender neutral" viewpoint is actually quite modern (being a few decades old at most) and not everyone subscribes to it (in this context, I doubt that everyone out there would give their daughter something the same they would give their son, if they still followed this tradition in the first place).
