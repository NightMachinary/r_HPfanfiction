I think "wizard" is an acceptable neutral term (just my opinion) and besides Mrs Weasley was speaking in reference to Harry. And I think that a lady's watch is as good a gift, valuable and practical and symbolic, to a witch as well as a wizard.

However, IF fanon wants to consider another kind of gift for a lady, I think a necklace or bracelet with a kind of magical pendant such as found in Dresden Files would be a good gift.

I do not like the implications of anything related to Amortentia.
