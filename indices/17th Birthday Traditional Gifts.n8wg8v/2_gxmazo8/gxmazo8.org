I've looked into this sort of thing before, and as I recall, women started wearing wristwatches while men were still using pocket watches. And before that, they wore watches as pendants.

So depending on what time period you want to say the tradition started, it would make sense to give a witch what would essentially be a pocket watch on a longer chain.

Alternatively, you could look at it as "it's traditional to give children a piece of jewelry when they come of age," and watches are the only piece of jewelry that most men wear, so that's what they usually get. Women, meanwhile, could get any number of other pieces of jewelry.
