The twins, in recognition of Harry giving them his Triwizard winnings, give him a stack of Extendable Ears. Playing around with one before his trial starts, he happens to overhear a DMLE representative questioning Umbridge on why exactly she ordered a Dementor away from Azkaban over the summer, but Umbridge brushes him off, telling him that she has a trial on underage magic to sit in on.

By the time Dumbledore gets there, Harry's in full-on Phoenix Wright mode, defending himself by accusing Umbridge.
