A pretty simple one, though not necessarily one implemented early on. Harry actually uses the communications mirror he gets. Maybe have Sirius give it to him during the Summer, or still during Christmas but have him explain what it is and not be so vague. Or have Harry actually open it instead of being worried about Sirius. Hell, he'd just been kidnapped last year, it might be good to have a way for Sirius to get to him. If Sirius hadn't been so vague and Harry so paranoid about Sirius coming out of hiding for him, the entire end of OotP wouldn't have happened, and Sirius wouldn't have died. That could have a pretty big impact on the rest of the series.
