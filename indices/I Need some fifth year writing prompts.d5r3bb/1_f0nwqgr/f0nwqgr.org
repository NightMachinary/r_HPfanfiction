What if Umbridge didn't go all "heavy-handed crazy torturing dictator" but worked to turn Hogwarts against Harry and Dumbledore by being charming and politically shrewd? And tries to use competent DADA lessons (with heavy involvement of Aurors every week to make up for her own lack of skills) to win the hearts and minds of the students?

Alternatively, Harry actually manages to keep his temper in check and doesn't blow up at Umbridge. Instead, the trio undermines Umbridge by fopcusing on her failures as a teacher.
