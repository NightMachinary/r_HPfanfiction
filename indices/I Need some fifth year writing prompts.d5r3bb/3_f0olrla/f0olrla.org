On the Hogwarts Express, one of the Ravenclaws quietly asks Harry what went down at the Graveyard because Dumbledore didn't give any details while the Ministry and Prophet all but imply that Harry offed Cedric, which said Ravenclaw didn't believe after 4 years with Harry. So Harry explains what had happened and the Ravenclaw is all supportive once Harry gets to the gritty details. So they keep talking, the topic changes, and without them noticing, it's dark and they are 10 minutes out of Hogsmeade station.

Can be used as the first step to a romance when said Ravenclaw and Harry simply talk more and more, become friends first and date afterwards. I don't think that this could work for a Harry/Cho fic though because Cho was too heavily invested in the situation and we saw that she didn't cope well with Cedric's death at all. Padma, Sue Li, Morag McDougal, Lisa Turpin or Mandy Brocklehurst, hell Terry Boot for all I care yes, but not Cho, not with that scenario.

Or keep it platonic and explore how the year would change if Harry had more people in his corner since the Ravenclaw would undoubtedly share that knowledge with their friends, if not the entire house. Harry would probably not be nearly as inclined to talk back to Umbridge, which means fewer detentions, which means less stress and angst from him. And if you make it a romance, well, Harry would certainly find some solace in that as well (as long as the girlfriend does not bring up Cedric all the time).
