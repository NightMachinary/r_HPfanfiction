Or what if harry semi lost his trial at the minestry? He got kicked out of Hogwarts but didnt lose his wandrights (last heir potter, triwizard emancipation, whatever would alow it) and now has to figure out how defeat Voldemort, while doing selfstudy, or beeing "forced" to go to another school (reverse trope? Harry wants to stay and fight but is forced to change schools?)
