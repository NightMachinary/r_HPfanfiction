Umbridge is caught sending the dementors after Harry by someone who is both powerful enough and willing to take her to task over it, and they send someone to protect Harry, who only arrives in time to see Harry fight them off. When he hears that Harry was caught using magic outside of Hogwarts, Fudge is delighted at first, thinking that he can arrest and expel Harry, but once he finds out that a) Harry has a wizard witness who can attest to his having acted in self-defense, and b) a high-ranking Ministry official whom he personally appointed sent a pair of dementors to attack a child, he realises that he has no case and that his career is a dead as he claims Voldemort is.

People immediately lose faith in the Ministry, the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore ends immediately, and people start to wonder if maybe there isn't something to these Voldemort rumours, after all.
