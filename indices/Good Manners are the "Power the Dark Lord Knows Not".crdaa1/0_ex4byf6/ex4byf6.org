/The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened .../

/Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong .../

/And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapour hanging in the air ... it's gone wrong, he thought ... it's drowned .../ */please/* /.../ */please/* /let it be dead ..../ /^{- Excerpt from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}/

Then suddenly an inhuman scream echoed through the graveyard. A black shadow rose from the cauldron and flew away into the night sky. The steam settled and Harry could see clearly again. The cauldron was still there, the liquid inside sat calmly. To the right, Wormtail was lying on the ground, motionless.

Huh...that went well, Harry thought.
