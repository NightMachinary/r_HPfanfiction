That's, like, every Good!Goblins fic out there. Harry minds his Ps and Qs with that one goblin whose name he remembers from that one time years ago, which warrants a meeting with the Greatest Warrior Goblin King "Ragnarok", who's then so impressed by a snot nosed child with the kind of manners drilled into toddlers that he puts the entirety of his billigerent, war-like, wizard-hating "nation" at Harry's disposal, who then take over the plot, defeat all of Harry's enemies, cure all his ills, and then thank him for the privilege.
