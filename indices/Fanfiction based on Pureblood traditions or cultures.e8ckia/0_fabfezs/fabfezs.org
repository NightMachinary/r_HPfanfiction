Someone else recommended this earlier this week and i've been consumed for the past three days. I'm on book 3 out of 4 now and the 4th is still being updated. It's been really good and super original. Lots of secrets, in-depth magic and intrigue. Tom rRddle is leader of an opposing pureblood political movement and they've passed through laws making so only purebloods can attend Hogwarts. Give it a try! linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)
