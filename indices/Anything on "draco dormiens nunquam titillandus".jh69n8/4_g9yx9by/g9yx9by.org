linkffn(you poked a dragon) it is very good and canon compliant so far but diverges beautifully the only other fic that does it better is linkffn(forging the sword)

Both fics involve a death that pushes Harry and his friends to understand the actual consequences if the fail in their “adventures” and truly become serious about surging and winning against Tom and his followers
