None that I know of. Photography/painting is the furthest I've seen anyone take it (and the latter as a dig against either Dean or Seamus, since painting was considered a housewife's thing and not suited for men). There's definitely painters, spells to imprint paintings with someone's personality, and there are definitely photographers (even if I don't remember much beyond functional photography, i.e. newspapers).

Beyond that, though? I draw a blank. Maybe someone else knows.
