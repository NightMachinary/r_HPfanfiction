This seems to have been deleted off ffn but if still alive here [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/fleur/aon/a/0/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]]. It has a diary!Riddle defecting and joining Harry's crew on a magical zeppelin. They fight the other horcruxes that have assumed the bodies of the longterm patients of St Mungos(the Longbottoms, Lockhart), and these guys are substantially more badass than canon. It also has one of the best uses of Time Turners I've seen.
