The Heir of the House of Black

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]

Harry dies and gets the option of going back to stop a new (post voldemort) threat. He goes back, but is born as an older brother to Sirius and Regulus. Marauders' era.

Tropes I normally don't like, but that are fine for me here:

OP Harry, Super political slytherin kids, specific pure blood social conventions
