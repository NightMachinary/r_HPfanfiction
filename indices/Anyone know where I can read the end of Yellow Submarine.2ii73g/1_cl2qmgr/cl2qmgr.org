The author used to have a pretty active LiveJournal account, but I don't know what its status is. (It was invite-only at the time and I fell off the access list awhile back.) According to this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/56/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][update of Backward with Purpose]], she also has a Facebook identity for her writing persona. I'd start there and see.
