I'm interested too... tbf, it became a little tiring for Harry to find the love of his life, his soul mate at 12, 13, 14, 16 or 17 years old...

So I prefer post-Hogwarts fanfics, where he is not marrying Ginny.

But as far as we know, Lily, Narcissa, Andromeda and probably Molly, they all got married early enough to get pregnant before they were 20, so I think that's something in their world.
