I suspect that your timeline would end up looking a tiny bit like that of the Terminator series... or possibly Primer's. 'Time' preventing Old Tom from killing Young Tom ought to imply that time would take steps to prevent a recursive infinite loop from ending reality...

Dumbledore goes back in time... and then steals Baby Riddle and brings him into the "present" which would be 1980 at the time? Now There's no old Tom who grew up in the past to provoke Albus into going back in the first place.

Assuming that the multiverse self corrects for paradox... Albus would have to (perhaps unknowingly) end up reaching into an alternate universe and absconding with that universe's Riddle or else Maybe strange things happen if you try to AK /yourself/ and reality does't bother to confirm that Tom Riddle and Tom Riddle are both natives? They're only /technically/ different people after all.

Other than that I think the concept is a plausibly self-consistent background explanation for Manipulative!Dumbles as I think its called on FFN?
