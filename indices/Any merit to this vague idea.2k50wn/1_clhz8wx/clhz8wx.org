Not sure about this. Seems like it might fall victim to a classic situation where Dumbledore sets up overly complicated, manipulative plans that are shockingly stupid for someone of his supposed intelligence.

It has the bones of an interesting premise - the setup is certainly twisty enough. I just wonder what it would be about, then? If all the setup ends with Dumbledore placing Harry with the Dursleys, how is the actual story going to be different than canon?
