I mean, I firmly believe there are no bad ideas, but that might be a bit of a... longer journey than most to make it a good story. In terms of popularity... well, plenty of weird stories are popular and plenty of popular stories are in need of more work. So, y'know. It's possible. I think it could definitely be a good story though, if you took the time to set it up right.

Generally, you ask yourself the whys and hows beforehand and be sure to set up as much of that supporting internal logic as you can in the openers before you get into the weird. To take the pairing specifically:

- How would they get together?

- Why would they get together?

- What point would the characters need to be at to get together?

- How would the characters have to grow to get there?

- How could you make the audience buy into that journey?

- How could you make the audience 'ship' them?

Basically, start with the assumption that the pairing would work (both character-wise and narratively) and work backwards from there in planning, then write forwards to take the readers on a journey to the point where they agree with the first assumption. Maybe you'll like the story you write, maybe you won't, but you definitely won't be able to write something in a believable way if you come from a point of not believing in it either.
