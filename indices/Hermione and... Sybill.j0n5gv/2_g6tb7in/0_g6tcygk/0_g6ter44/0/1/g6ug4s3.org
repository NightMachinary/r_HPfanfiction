I've seen some truly strange and horrid ships.

Besides the obvious ones (Drapple, Draco/Ebony, Hogwarts/Giant Squid) there is Hermione/Sorting Hat, Hermione/OC Ghost, Hermione/Gwarp, Ron/Gwarp, Fem!Harry/Aragog, Luna/Threstal, Whomping Willow/Daphne/Luna/Hermione/Ginny + a few other girls, Harry/Norberta, Fem!Harry/Troll, Hermione/Troll, Fleur/Snakes (literal Snakes), Vernon and Dudley with Fleur and Cho, Harry/Hogwarts, Harry/Gringotts, Dumbledore/Voldemort, Dumbledore/Griphook etc.

In other fandoms there is Goku/Anne Frank (yes, the Holocaust victim) and Jason Grace/Brick among others
