I mean, there's a sizeable portion of the fandom that pairs Harry with people decades older than him who believe his mother is basically an animal or even murdered his mother themselves. If people ship what's basically Adolf Hitler/Joseph Goebbels and Randolph Churchill (Winston Churchill's kid), then they'll ship anything.

And eh, I'm just a random voice on the internet that doesn't know you at all, so I can't comment anything whatsoever on you personally. It was simply a remark that you need to come at a story from a place of believing in it, because it'll be harder to make it believable to others if you don't.

But yeah, like I said - I firmly believe there are no bad ideas, just stories that could use more work. :)

Of course, if you actually don't wanna write the story, this absolutely is not an insistence you should. Again, I'm just a random voice on the internet so you probably shouldn't listen if it was one, but it definitely isn't. You do whatever you feel is the right thing to do, I can't advise you on that. All I'm saying is that if you put the work in, you can find a way to make anything work in an interesting and believable way.
