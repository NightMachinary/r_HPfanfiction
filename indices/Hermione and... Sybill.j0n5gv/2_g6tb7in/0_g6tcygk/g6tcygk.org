So this is coming from a place where he just wants me to write, I think, and it has sort of swelled into something he thinks I can achieve. He does accuse me of having no faith, so he'll agree with you there. While I don't necessarily agree or disagree with the ship itself, I suppose I could manage it well enough. I'm more shocked that anyone agreed with it, because my answer was a pretty instantaneous “no.”
