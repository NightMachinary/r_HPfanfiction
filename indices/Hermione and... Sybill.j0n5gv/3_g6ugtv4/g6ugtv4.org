I'd read it.

Love/hate relationship, time travel fic where Hermione goes back in time to stop Snape from hearing about the prophecy. It's done easily enough but in doing so she becomes the potions professor instead. Cue teacher hijinks and Hermione being eternally exasperated by divination and its professor. It feels a lot like shipping Hermione and Luna.
