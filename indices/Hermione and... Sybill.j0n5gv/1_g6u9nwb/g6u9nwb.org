While not really a ship I'd personally care for, I'm of the mind that with enough work, there's few things that are truly unworkable. You simply have to twist the universe and experiences enough for it. There's plenty of fics with ships I initially don't believe in, but whose content managed to convince me that it could definitely work. Just the other day I read a Hermione/James fic, a ship I had no expectations for, but which made it work well in the end. I've also had the same experience with a Tom/Luna (the fic didn't actually ship them, but it did manage to make me want it in said fic).
