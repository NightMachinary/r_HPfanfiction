Not really. If you think about it wizards don't really care. They believed that Hagrid opened the Cos, they expel him but let him work in school. Snape was a known(no imperious excuses) DE but they let him teach in a school. All of that because Double-door said that they are ok. So if you think about it, if Harry said something along the lines "he needs to atone and work for his sins, to cleanse his past and make amends with our society", They would give Draco a badge before they even give him his wand back.
