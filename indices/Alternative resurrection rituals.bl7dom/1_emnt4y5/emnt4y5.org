1. the apprentice upgrade - grab a useful body and feed it to a Dementor; once that soul is removed, spirit-Riddle occupies the body; through some ritual, his soul is empowered to take ownership of the body permanently. Can lead to flights of vanity, where the sorcerer shops for better and better bodies to squat in.

2. fullmetal golem - construct a powerful set of armour; use some sort of enchantment to place the horcrux into the center as the 'heart' of the machine; make like Dr. Doom and build a bunch of replacements, too

3. Sic Semper Memorex - Grow a clone; take possession; pitfalls of this method are unusual requirements to sustain the clone body, like monthly bathing in the blood of sacrificed virgins, or having to upsell the cloning process as a television spokesperson
