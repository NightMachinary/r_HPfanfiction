I'm guessing alternative to getting a new body. Like if he had the philosopher stone or something like that.

I was thinking of the stone as water, bone Ash for earth, Phoenix Ash for fire and living soul for air... Other some mix ritual like that.

Another is a Living portrait, I based on Dorian gray

Dorian Gray is the subject of a picture by a painter called Basil Hallward who develops a level of worship for the young man's beauty. After having his soul trapped within a painting, Dorian gained immortality. He does not age and seems to be immune to all conventional illnesses, diseases, viruses and infections. You can make it so that it needs charging of ambient magic of sort to trigger the creation Of a painted body (oil or paint based body mixed with Ash of the previous if it was un fixable or even slow Regen of ashes from that night of LV's death piling up)

The one I'm using for my current fanfic that I'm writing (trying to write) is inspired by Galatea and Pygmilion..

"The Actual Potter" Living stone given life or a giant soul doll.... (It is a Diary!TMRxfem!HP where Harry's power he know not is Potter magic... Literally, like terracotta soldiers, Golems, gargoyles, living/haunted doll... Soul Dolls. Basically a fusion of Peverell necromancy and Linfred the Potters enchantment and artistry skills. Because pottery reminds me of clay sculpting or porcelain figurines)
