I am reading it now. Like the interaction between H/Hr. But really dislike how Harry reacts to the rest of the world. He is being quite a push over over everything. Why would Dumble ever allow someone like Gates watch over Harry when he is clearly evil??? Dumble may be a lot of things but one thing for sure he is not dumb. He sees through people. Having Harry turn retarded def dont help with the war.
