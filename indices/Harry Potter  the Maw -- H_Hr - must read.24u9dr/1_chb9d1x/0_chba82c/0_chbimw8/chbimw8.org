I understand the background more as the story progresses. But its just weird that Harry doesnt actively try to do anything that might help him win the war. He knows he has to face Voldy yet he doesnt really train himself that hard besides physical exercises. Its an interesting concept to include a character like Gates but I just couldnt enjoy it.
