Actually, /do/, in this case. Those were good instincts.

I reviewed it to hopefully aid and succor others who've had the misfortune of reading even the first two chapters of this story. See that for details, if you must.

In short, it isn't good. Just straight forward character torture, almost by the numbers. Right down to the cheesy tone and dreams of Voldemort being "scary" in a vague way. Old school schlock in the worst sense.

Okay writing quality in a most basic sense. Doesn't flow, isn't engaging. Just bad in general.
