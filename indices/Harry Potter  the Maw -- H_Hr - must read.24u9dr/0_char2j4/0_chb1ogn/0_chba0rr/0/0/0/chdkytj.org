Thanks for the save as it doesn't sound like I'd be interested in this fic at all.

Do you have any good recommendations for H/Hr fics? I don't care about length, completion status, or rating. I'm almost done with my current story and the only thing I could think to do was reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][this]] for the fifth time.
