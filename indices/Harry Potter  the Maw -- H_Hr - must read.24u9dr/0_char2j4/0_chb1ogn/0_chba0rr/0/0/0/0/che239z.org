Well, I've got some really cheesy ones on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etimeloopedpowergamer][my fav list on FFN]], but if you want dark done right, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] by [[/u/wordhammer]]. Arty, strange, and very very different. That M rating also isn't just for show or a few f-bombs, so be warned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] is good but unfinished. Gets a little long at times, but has some good ideas. Less of a horror show than my other suggestion, too. Most unique time travel idea I've ever seen, and well presented.
