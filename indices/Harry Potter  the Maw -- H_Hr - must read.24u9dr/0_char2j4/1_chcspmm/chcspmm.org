  Could you explain where the title comes from?

  Hmmm...the Maw in the title of this fanfic is more of a symbolic thing than anything else. A maw in normal terms is something unsatiable that sucks up everything around it. When I came up with this title, it occurred to me that Harry is going to be thrown into one big figurative maw in his sixth year, so that's where the title came from. The necklace and Voldemort's ambition are two such examples of a maw; where it sucks up everything and leaves nothing behind.

  The maw mentioned in the title is rather ambiguous; but it is mainly a reference to Gates' necklace, and, more symbolically, the depth of human ambition, hate, and love.

  Something had changed, but what it was, he did not know.

  Perhaps it was his new knowledge of the monsters of the world, of those demons that never truly die.

  The knowledge that, beyond the iron fist, behind the rows of teeth and fangs, and down its slick throat is the monster's maw. It is the maw which separates the monsters, divides them into categories, makes them cruel in their own different ways, driving them. It makes Voldemort kill and torture the innocent. It made Gates torment Death Eaters.

  [..] Harry could glance at it, fleetingly peek into it, but no more. Not the best Legilimens in the world could. The maw was something off limits to everyone, even to the monster itself. It was too immense, too intricate for it to be quantified or even expressed.

  The unanswerable questions of the maw still and will forever exist: What lies at its bottom? Who knows its depth?
