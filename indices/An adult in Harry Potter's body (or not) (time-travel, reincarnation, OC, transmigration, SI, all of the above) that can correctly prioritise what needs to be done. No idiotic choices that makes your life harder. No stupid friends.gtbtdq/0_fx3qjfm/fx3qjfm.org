In a similar vein, can we get some "Adult Reincarnated in Harry Potter" fics where the MC actually staunchly refuses to even consider romance until the girl (or guy) is at least 17-18 because the thought of dating an underaged teenager disgusts them? It's kinda squicky when a 30 year old dude gets blipped into an 11 year old HP's body and immediately starts GROOMING GIRLS TO DATE LATER.
