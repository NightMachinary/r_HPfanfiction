Not insulting at all, I understand where you're coming from. I think it depends on how the writer writes the relationship. Sure there are some fiction where it's all instantaneous with soul bonds or mates, I don't always like it but some stories are okay. With good structured fan fiction, a Harry and Voldemort ship can work. It all down to the situation that is being presented by the writer themselves and how they're playing in the sandbox.

With the death of his parents, I think it depends on how they're trying to portray Harry. Is he the sometimes angry teen who loves his friends to pieces? Or has Harry been abandoned at an orphanage, having lived through a similar childhood as Riddle? Perhaps a neutral Harry in the war, knowing that the only the people he cares about are safe?

All of those types of Harry also depends on the type of Voldemort the writer wants. Is he really just a madman, with the mindset of only the Pure-Bloods are worthy of magic? Or could he be restored to a better state of mind if Harry gathered all of his soul into one body?

It's not my go-to ship, not by a mile, but it was the only fiction I thought of that matched the OP's request very closely with the way Harry is presented in this.
