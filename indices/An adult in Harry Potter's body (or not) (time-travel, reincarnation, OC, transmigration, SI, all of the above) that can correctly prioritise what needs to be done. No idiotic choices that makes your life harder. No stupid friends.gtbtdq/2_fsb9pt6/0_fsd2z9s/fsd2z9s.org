I don't read slash in general, but I can see how some would like it.. that said, I can't see how you read a ship between Harry and Voldemort. Not ridiculing, I'm honestly curious how that happens without an equally evil Harry - and even then, does he just forgive the murder of his parents..? Does it come back up if they bicker in the relationship like cheating would in non-enemy relationships?

I know that sounds like I mean it in an insulting way, but I honestly can't wrap my head around the idea.
