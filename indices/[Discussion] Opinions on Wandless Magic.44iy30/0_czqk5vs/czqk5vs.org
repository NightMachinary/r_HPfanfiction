The existence of wandless magic has always made sense - isn't that what accidental magic with little kids is? Changing a teacher's hair to a new color is fairly advanced for a little kid, I'd say.

Maybe we'll see more of it, but I hope that it doesn't go overboard. Good stories have limits and challenges. With wandless magic, making it more costly and/or less precise ensures that a person doesn't become too godlike. It also makes a certain amount of logical sense - tools help us do things more easily and with more precision than we can typically manage with our bare hands.

I fear, though, that it may just be employed without limits and sense. It aleady is in some cases, after all.
