In my own fic, wandless magic plays a very small role and I've emphasized that without a wand, magic is harder to do and is a lot less precise. A wand is frequently referred to as a "focus," and so consider what a lack of focus does.

Shield? Summon? Banish? That wouldn't be too hard.

Transfiguration with a lot of delicate details? Almost certainly not.
