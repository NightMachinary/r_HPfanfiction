  I disagree. According to the new material, they'd have to be fairly powerfully adept to make the Ministry appeal to the ICW about it.

I may be missing some context, but it sounds like someone was just complaining about someone else lucking out with a powerful animagus form. Animagus magic is well-known worldwide. Heck, Viktor Krum partially transfigured himself into a shark.

  Further, they've spent centuries blending both wanded and wandless magic.

Yes. Hence my venturing that AfricanWizard minus wand beats Harry minus wand, but Harry plus wand beats AfricanWizard minus wand. I don't know how much of an advantage wandless magic would be if both parties have wands.

#+begin_quote
  On another note, the general assumption is that wands lend ease and precision, but not necessarily power.
#+end_quote

Whose general assumption?

#+begin_quote
  Also, on a logical note, the wandless strength required to damage a human would probably not be a massive amount wizard or muggle, piercing flesh ( or even just destroying organ, etc) probably not that hard.
#+end_quote

This is assuming the arsenal of spells castable by a reasonable wizard without a wand contains such magic and that it's precise enough to actually aim it at said organ, all at a meaningful range (because if you have to touch someone to do it, you might as well just stab them). Or, is this one of those "I can cast an Engorgement Charm, but only on their brain, so that they suffer a cerebral edema!" acts of cleverness?
