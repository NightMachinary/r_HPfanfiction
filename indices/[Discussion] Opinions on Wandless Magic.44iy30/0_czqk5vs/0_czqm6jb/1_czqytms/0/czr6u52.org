I disagree. According to the new material, they'd have to be fairly powerfully adept to make the Ministry appeal to the ICW about it. Further, they've spent centuries blending both wanded and wandless magic. On another note, the general assumption is that wands lend ease and precision, but not necessarily power. I'd surmise whatever power benefits derived would depend almost entirely upon the wand materials and branch of magic practiced. All that to say, a better analogy to me would be: some people can easily lift 150lbs unassisted. And some can do it easier and faster with a forklift. In a one on one battle, I'd be more inclined to believe they both have an even shot all things being equal. Additionally, my own head canon ( and others I've read ) lean toward the strength of wandless magic being derived from practice. This lends itself to the analogy above. If you don't workout your muscles or your magic, neither will be strong. Also, on a logical note, the wandless strength required to damage a human would probably not be a massive amount wizard or muggle, piercing flesh ( or even just destroying organ, etc) probably not that hard.
