  all in all it's just a tool - a crutch!
#+end_quote

Tool creation and use have been critical in making us what we are as a species. I'm frankly astounded that anyone would call them a crutch.

Is electricity a crutch? Is your computer a crutch?

Is a Stradivarius a crutch? Did Michelangelo use crutches when he created his statue "David"? Should he really have used his bare hands?

A tool can only properly be deemed a "crutch" when a person is capable of achieving the exact same effect with (more or less) the same effort, but allows their dependency on the tool to impede the development of valuable or necessary skills.

Writing fanfiction is arguably a "crutch" if, by doing it, I avoid developing the skills necessary to create my own, original fiction that would be just as good or better than my fanfiction. Training wheels are a "crutch" if my use of them allows me to avoid learning how to balance on a two-wheeled bicycle.

There is no evidence that wands are a "crutch" and, based on millions of years of history of tool development and use, absolutely no reason to think that they would be. We can add to that the evidence from canon that wands are a desirable addition rather than unnecessary.
