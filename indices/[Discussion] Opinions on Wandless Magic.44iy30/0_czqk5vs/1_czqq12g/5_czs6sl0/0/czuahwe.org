If you can do without tools, then yes!

Can we light our houses by waving our fingers? Nope, so we need the "crutch"

Sure it is (even if it's beautiful and brings music to life in the right person's hands!) and yes, Michelangelo did - then again he couldn't just wave his hand at the stone block and have it give him a statue so he had to (I am not against tools, you don't understand: I am against their use if it's not needed or doesn't speed up the process significantly!)

Sure there's evidence: Cultures which are slow to adopt them (if something is really great then everybody wants to have it, if not then it takes time till everybody gets himself one (of whatever we are talking about)...like early cellphones, sure they were neat but most people didn't need or want them!)
