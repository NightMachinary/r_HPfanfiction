Why should it have - a lot of - limits?

I mean people were clearly doing magic before the wand was developped! The wand may cut down on expended magic or maybe it makes focusing easier or something, but all in all it's just a tool - a crutch!

They just depend on their wands now and don't even believe they can do without, which renders them a muggle without it basically (ok: They can still "teleport" (and do animagus transformations if they ever bothered to learn how - sadly Harry the slacker didn't, despite it being possible to ask damned Sirius Black for the process and it being another link to his father and maybe even helpful for survival -.-) but that's it and even that doesn't work if there are wards in place!)

I always thought it strange that something like this was not utilized in the books - is it a form of government control (like some fanfiction suggest that declaring stuff as "dark magic" because most wizards and witches can't cast it and because it's tremendous advantage if you can) to keep the population more docile (as in: Easier to subdue? I mean a simple disarming-charm is enough in most cases!) or is it because it can't be tracked (some fiction suggests that they trace underage magic through the wand, so a witch/wizard not using one could get away with a lot!)?
