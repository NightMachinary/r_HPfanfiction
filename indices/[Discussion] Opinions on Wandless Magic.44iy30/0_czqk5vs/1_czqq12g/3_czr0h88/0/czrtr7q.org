Well, that's not exactly true if learning it is very difficult and if the other party (Voldemort etc.) knows about this, too!

Maybe, sure tools make stuff easier - but then again there's a saying: PCs are needed to solve all the problems we didn't have when we didn't have PCs! (Now adapt that to wands, maybe wands create problems of their own? Not that something like that is ever directly stated, but it's implied: A wizard without a wand isn't much more than a muggle, so it creates dependence which is always bad!

Not really, which of the tools we (muggles!) use weaken us? (As in make us helpless if we are without those tools) I am coming up empty (at least when looking for something I depend on on the scale Harry Potter wizards depend on their wands!)
