  Well, that's not exactly true if learning it is very difficult and if the other party (Voldemort etc.) knows about this, too!

Then the addition of "wandless" to "magic" is pointless. Everyone is doing the exact same things as they were before, but they're waving their little pinkies instead of sticks.

  Maybe, sure tools make stuff easier - but then again there's a saying: PCs are needed to solve all the problems we didn't have when we didn't have PCs!
#+end_quote

Complex tools create new problems that need solutions. Wands, however, are much more like hammers or axes than they are like PCs. People were building things and using wood long before they started fashioning stone into axes and hammers, but the creation of such tools made the work easier - and was a very important step in our evolution as a species, too.

There are certainly situations where being able to do something without a focus is handy, but there's no obvious reason why doing so should be assumed to be superior. The use of tools is what's helped propel us to the top of the food chain, not shackled us.

What's more, let's not forget the fact that in HP, non-humans are /forbidden/ from using wands. Forbidden. Not allowed. Banned.

Does anyone here really think that the Ministry is likely to force goblins and other creatures to use a superior form of magic? Of course not. If wands made you weaker or helped the Ministry control you, goblins would have wands fused to their hands at birth.

Goblins aren't looking to use wands because they want more shackles from the Ministry. No, the only reason for wanting wands - magical /tools/ - is because they would allow goblins to perform magic /better/.

  Not really, which of the tools we (muggles!) use weaken us?
#+end_quote

A wizard without a wand is a muggle. A muggle without /any/ tools - which is the /correct/ comparison - is a weak, slow, soft bit of lunch. Strip /all/ the tools away from you, and you're slower than other predators, have no claws, have little protection from the elements, and likely won't survive for very long in the wilderness.

We muggles depend on our tools even more than wizards and witches depend on their wands. Because we don't have magic, we don't have a single all-purpose tool, but the dependency is still there.
