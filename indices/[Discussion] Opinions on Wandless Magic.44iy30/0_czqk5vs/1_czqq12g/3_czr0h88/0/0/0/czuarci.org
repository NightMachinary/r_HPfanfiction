Not pointless:

You can't be "disarmed" anymore, so you are always dangerous (unless there's something that can suppress your magic)

Hm...maybe it's just denying them access to something usefull and not something that changes society on a fundamental level (like say the microchip and the internet did for us!)?

Na, about the same (we just need more stuff for similar effects) and no, you aren't helpless without tools:

You still have your mind and memories and you can make makeshift tools - you'd still have a better chance against say a wolf than a wizard without a wand has against say a werewolf (even if he or she uses a tree branch or something like that for self-defense!)
