Indeed, I thought so, too and I thought it more strange that Miss "I want to know everything" didn't look into this (surely the library at Hogwarts or a book shop (Florish and Blots etc.) would have had books on that), I mean she learned how to wipe other people's minds for god's sake (not something on the normal curriculum!)

Maybe, maybe not...maybe the detection of muggleborns works more like Voldemort's taboo (Name recorded directly at birth through some sort of country-wide enchantment or something!)
