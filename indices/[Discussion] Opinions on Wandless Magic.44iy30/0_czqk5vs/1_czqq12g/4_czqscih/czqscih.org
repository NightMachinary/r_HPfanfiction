I would imagine that they can track wandless underage magic otherwise how would they ever discover muggleborn students?

It makes sense to me that wandless magic would be harder to control and less precise (since the wand acts as a channeling tool) but I do think it's strange that there was seemingly little to no wandless magical instruction. Like you said, it leaves them almost completely defenseless if their wand is taken or broken. JKR deciding that there are some cultures that only very recently began using wands makes this even more baffling, since before I just always assumed that it took an especially talented witch or wizard to be able to pull it off effectively.
