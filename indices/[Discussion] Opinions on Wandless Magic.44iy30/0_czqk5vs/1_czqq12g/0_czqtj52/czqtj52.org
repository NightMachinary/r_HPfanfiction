A tool's not always a crutch to make things easier. It also can allow you to do things you couldn't do otherwise. So it's possible some things cannot be accomplished without a wand no matter how well-trained someone is at wandless magic. I mean, African wizards and witches must have adopted the use of a wand for a reason. Another possibility is that it requires so much increased focus and power that it's actually a handicap in a fight. I consider Voldemort's use of a wand as evidence that wandless magic should have some serious limitations. He traveled extensively. He was all for power in any form. Why would he rely so heavily on his wand unless there was an advantage to doing so?

As for it not being taught, we don't actually know that nobody taught wandless magic in Britain. It just wasn't taught at Hogwarts. 3-year auror program maybe? We know there's exchange student opportunities too.
