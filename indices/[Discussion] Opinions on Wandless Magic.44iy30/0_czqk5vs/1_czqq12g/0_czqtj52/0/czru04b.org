If Hogwarts is the best school they have, then it's quite neglectful to not teach their students IMHO...

As for Voldemort: He wants to be seen as the epitome of British wizardry, so he'd only use other forms of magic if he has no choice (and at not point in the books have we truly seen him disarmed!), because he doesn't want to appear different (he projects a pureblood facade which might get cracks if he shows of foreign magic!)
