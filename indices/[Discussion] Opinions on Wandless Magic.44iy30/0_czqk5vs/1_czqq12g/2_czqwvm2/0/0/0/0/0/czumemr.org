Centuries after all the other nations - and they don't say that they will stop teaching wandless magic, will they? (Maybe they get their wands later in life (third year or so)? (so that no one can argue against wandless magic by saying: I am having a wand, I don't need it))

Well, mobiles need charging, you need to take them with you (that one does apply to a wand, too!) etc. while a phone-booth could be found at most public places (which is no longer the case sadly -.-), so there wasn't as much need!
