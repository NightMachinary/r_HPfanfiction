Well, by your logic we wouldn't have cellphones today (!) as they didn't add much to our lives when they were first invented (they were clunky, unwieldy, heavy and didn't last long - not to mention that they did cost a pretty penny!) as not many people back then wanted them (or could afford them!)...but manufacturing got the costs down and technology made them last longer, made them smaller etc. and so soon we did adopt them (despite them not really being needed, hell you could argue that you don't need a cellphone even today! It's just a convenience item and wands might be the same (and a way to show status...at first only the wealthy had them and later on every peasant could afford them!))
