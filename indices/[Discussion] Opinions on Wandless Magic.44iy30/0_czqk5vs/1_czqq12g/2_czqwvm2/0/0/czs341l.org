  Why would it be necessarily weaker?

Simple common sense really. If wands were simply a tool that makes casting easier then they wouldn't have adopted it, both pride (in their wandless casting) and cost (wands are expensive, more so for Africans as wandmaking isn't a native profession) would prevent adopting the wand.

Now if casting magic with wands produces better results then adopting it would make sense.
