  Why should it have - a lot of - limits?

Why else would African wizards, who are very proficient at wandless magic, adopt a foreign tool? This heavily implies that using wand has a huge advantage over wandless magic. What that advantage is, is for the writer to decide.

Sadly though I think that many writers will fail to read this, and simply use wandless magic as a way to empower their favourite character without giving it any form of disadvantage. Basically no different what is currently happening, /oh joy/.
