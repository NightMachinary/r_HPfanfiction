If anything I'd expect the african school to be much more involved with the magic side of Voodoo, Spiritwalking (they /do/ use Dreamwalking aparrently) and that stuff. You know, the kind of magic that is /actually/ practiced there (with meager succes, but still). Anyway,...

Pottermore.

I'm really split about this site. On one side I'm glad that Rowling still tries to deliver, but on the other side I feel like a lot of what is delivered is inferior to what is already written somewhere in the "Professional Novel-tier" on ff.net.

She has a tendency to make stuff super-OP. I mean, if wandless magic can deliver as well as any seventh year with a wand, why use a wand? Why aren't Aurors trained in Africa to at least have the "secondary" option of blowing someones head off with a hand gesture? I know the arguments of tradition, isolationists british,... are going to be named, but over the course of the centuries, someone with power ought to be like "hey, this could be really useful" and "why are we using something any fifth-year could take from us by a simple spell?".

Well, at least this explains one way of how the Marauders were able to become Animagi that soon.

Also, the comment:

  Much (some would say all) magic originated in Africa,
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what to do with that. Who was the first wizard/witch/shaman/mambo/priest that made something glow white, or summoned flames to feed and protect the tribe/clan/nation? Was the first kind of magic some ritual of a natural religion? Tell me, Joanne! This is was infuriates me so on Pottermore. Any kind of worlbuilding is done with a wordcount that other fiction authors use to introduce you to something. This only leaves me with, at the end, barely more than I had before.

Anyway, if this is what wandless magic is like, I think its entirely too strong. I was always a fan of wandless magic being unfocused, hard to pull off and time-consuming to learn. Now it seems like you could just not use a wand and be fine. Then why use it at all? Wands are chunky, wands are feeble wooden sticks that can break, wands can be taken from you, wands are simply the inferior way of spellcasting if there is close to no advantage to wandless casting. If the africans adopted the wand as a useful tool (for whatever spells - Rowling worldbuilding once again in action), why didn't the europeans adopt the wandless casting? At least for their elite troops. At least for those guys who could really do with some sort of secondary weapon should their foci break. I'm not inclined to take colonialism as an answer to that. For one because the Statute of Secrecy got established before colonialism took on its most ridiculous forms with the introduction of Darwinism and second because colonialists (despite what people might say) were rather eager to copy or steal as much unknown know-how from the natives as possible. If some wizard colonialists came, they ought to be fascinated by the wandless casting and try to learn it.

In the end this is gonna be just as much ignored by me as the Potter family tree. Charlus and Dorea all the way, and african wizards use wands or other foci as long as I don't get some limitation to this blatant OP-ness of african wizards.
