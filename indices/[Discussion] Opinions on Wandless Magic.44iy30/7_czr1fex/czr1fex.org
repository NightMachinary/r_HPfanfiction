I personally love this.

I think a lot of people try to approach Harry Potter too literally. Me personally, I've always been a sucker for the symbolism.

So what is a wand? It's a piece of mundane nature (wood), coupled with magical matter (magic core) that chooses a person based on their personality (self/soul) and says something about your character and the way you use your magical power.

So it is a sentient tool which helps you tap into your magical power. Without it and learning to use it, your self is what causes magic. Accidental magic is this sort of magic.

So if the self drives wandless magic through emotion, need, conviction, very primal needs and wants. The wand chooses you based on it's attraction to your self, arguably knowing what type of character you are better than you (a la the sorting hat). The wand also allows more mental/specialized tasks without primal convictions.

What would allow that much control over wandless magic? I think it would be self-knowledge. Maybe the greater African wizards have a great cognition of who they are and what they are about. 'Knowing thyself' is really hard to do, having an aid at really knowing what you'r about, such as your wand, might help in honing in the intent and conviction at channeling magic.

One other thing that this might imply is that different cultures and ways of life affect how magic is used or allows itself to be used. It's not exp. 343 to level 13 mage, it's organic and mercurial and extremely contextual, maybe even sentient. It could work against you, such as Harry's luck and path to victory against Voldemort (who I don't think magic liked very much).

She could research more into these cultures and differentiate further, but Harry Potter isn't particularly about world building for me personally. But I wouldn't mind if she acquires more of a world building focus.
