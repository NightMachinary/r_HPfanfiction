Y'know, the problem with wandless magic in fics wasn't that wandless magic as such wasn't "canon", but that in most of them

1. it's as effective or more effective than wanded magic, at least when the protagonist uses it, so why does anyone bother with wands?

2. it's only Harry who gets to do it, and nobody else even tries, because he's That Extra Special, and Dumbledore has conspired with the Dursleys to Suppress His Potential, etc..
