Some amount of it is canon, that much has been known forever. But authors seem to go overboard. Harry's already a special character - hero from a young age, chosen one, etc. He's already a special snowflake, so giving him arbitrarily ridiculous powers that no one else has is pointless. Like, being able to shoot wandless stunners out of your hands - is that really necessary? And, I've seen stories where he casts wandless killing curses. There's no way that makes any sense, yet people still write that sort of thing.
