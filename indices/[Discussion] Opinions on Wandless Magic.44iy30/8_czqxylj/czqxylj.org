I thought wandless magic was already part of canon. Didn't Remus conjure flames in his hand without a wand in PoA? And aren't animagus transormations wandless as well?

I think wandless magic can be a really good tool in your story. Like "Harry loses his wand while he's on the run and has to relearn magic." But you've got to be careful not to make it too overpowered. Maybe make it wild, sporadic and somewhat out-of-control? Like Harry has no real control over it?
