I think part of the support for wandless magic comes from a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy][naturalistic fallacy]].

*Wands = technology*

*Wandless = natural*

Natural is always better, right? The imperialistic, industrialized Europeans have cast aside our harmony with nature and our own bodies. The Asian and African magicals laugh at how the Europeans limit themselves with their wands!
