It was decent of her to concede the value of wands even to the African wizards.

I've been working on the assumption that wandless magic was harder, simpler, had shorter range and really couldn't pull off transfiguring other things but it would be optimal for self-transfiguration.

Also, Harry lighting up his wand in the alley wasn't exactly wandless magic- he made the wand light up. If he had lit up his shoe, it would have been wandless. Instead I see that as a case of a well-trained wand responding to a vague, distant invocation.
