I think this might lead to more people using wandless magic as another avenue, instead of something to simply achieve out of strength. Clearly they're all capable of it, it's just a matter of figuring out, or remembering, how. When you've been trained to channel your magic in a specific way, I can see it being difficult to relearn that. I'd love to see that explored.

Some people are bound to be stuck in one mentality. Like Neville for instance- he's learned to channel his magic in a specific way, using a specific tool, and up to a certain point he had little confidence in his abilities. He seems like someone who would be stuck in a 'this is what works' mindset and thus be relatively unable to make wandless magic work. But someone else who could sort of *tell* what their magic felt like as they channeled it (something I've seen in fics) might be better able to change how it works.

As for the self transfiguration, that also seems like a "Well this way works, let's use it!" that's less hindered by strict processes and rules. It does specifically say 'self transfiguration,' not 'animagus,' so for the time being I'm considering the two to be different. We know that wizards can self-transfigure, Slughorn transfigured himself into a chair, didn't he? This is similar, they're changing themselves into animals though. But the Animagus process is a strenuous and long process, involving holding I think it was a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a solid month.

Tl;dr, if you've learned how to channel it one way, learning to do it a different way might be really difficult. So start young! And the self transfiguration doesn't really change anything, and probably ties into the channeling it a certain way.
