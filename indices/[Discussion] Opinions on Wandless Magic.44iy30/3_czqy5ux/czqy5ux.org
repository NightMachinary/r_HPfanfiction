I would simply treat wands as tools - they make magic far easier. Wandless magic is harder, weaker, less effective. Impressive in the "Wow, that guy can carry 100 kg" sense, but to transport a few hundred kgs of the stuff you use a pickup, not him. Basically, make wandless magic a nice trick, a thing African Wizards do for cultural reasons, and something that can be a life saver in some situations.

Selftransfigurations could be a sort of talent among certain people, like a metamorphmagus, not specifically connected to wandless magic.
