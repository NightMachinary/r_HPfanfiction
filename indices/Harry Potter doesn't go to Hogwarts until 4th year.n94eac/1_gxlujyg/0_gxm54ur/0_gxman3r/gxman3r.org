Ok I think it was this one. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12833921/1/]] ) The Harry storyline has its strengths and weaknesses. it's been a while since I read it, but I do remember finding it an enjoyable read, and seeing how his absence changed things, as well as how a Harry who didn't grow up in such a shitty situation affects things once he gets called by the goblet of fire
