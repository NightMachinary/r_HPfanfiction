Here are a few I remember:

  The Dursleys refuse to let Harry go to Hogwarts, which means he doesn't receive any magical education until his name comes out of the Goblet. The story has a sequel that is currently udpdated.

  I can't remember the details (or plot) but Sirius took Harry in 1981 and left Britain. Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts until the start of his 5th year (so no Tournament but I thought it could still fit).

  Harry is found by Mrs Zabini that leave the country with their son. Harry and Blaise grew up as brother and doesn't go to Hogwarts until Harry's name come out of the Goblet (which seem to happen in 6th year, not 4th but whatever).

  Lily survive the attack and leave to the USA with Remus and Sirius. Years later, Harry goes to Hogwarts as a part of the Ivermorny delegation and I guess (couldn't read this one past 2 chapters) that he is later selected as a Champion.
