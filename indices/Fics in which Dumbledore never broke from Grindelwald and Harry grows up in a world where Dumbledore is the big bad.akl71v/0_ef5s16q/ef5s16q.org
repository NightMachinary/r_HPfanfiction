I think linkffn(Phoenx Corrupted by iamneverwhere) fits your request at least partially. I am currently in 4th year so I can‘t be certain in which direction the story will go and how the open questions will be answered, but the fic has:

- a different outcome to the duel between the two Dumbledores and Grindelwald
- an antagonistic Albus Dumbledore
- a good Tom Riddle that is not simply canon Dumbledore with a different name (he‘s quiet different from canon Tom and less egoistic because of a different upbringing. How his upbringing is related to the point of divergence has not yet been explained at the point where I‘m currently at)

When I started reading this fic, I expected a bad fic because with this rare premise I thought I would have seen it recommended more, especially around here, but up to this point I have been positively suprised.
