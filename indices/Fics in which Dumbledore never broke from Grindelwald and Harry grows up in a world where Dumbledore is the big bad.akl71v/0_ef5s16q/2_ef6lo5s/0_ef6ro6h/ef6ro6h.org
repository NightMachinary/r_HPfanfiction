The plot goes its own way mostly, although there is a triwizard tournament in 4th year, this one at Durmstrang though and some other smaller similarities. You will find small things and events from canon picked up and used in a different way, e.g. the chamber. So while you will recongize some things from canon it never feels like a revisiting of stations of canon, imo.
