  Reborn into the world of Harry Potter, Poppy Evans has only one goal; make sure she's not the only magical Evans alive by 1982. And maybe save that smug Potter while she's at it. Regulus Black didn't fit into the equation; he wasn't suppose to be so distracting. A Mature SI fic

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

  War is looming over the witches and wizards who graduated in 1978. Thrust into an exciting world where you party hard, find a job, take care of your friends and take love where you find it, they quickly learn that this is not all there is to life. Everything turns sour as they are faced with increasing paranoia, traitors from within, and morbid revelations about Voldemort's soul. Can the wizarding world be saved from the Death Eaters, or will they all go down fighting?My take on the first wizarding war and the rise of the Order of the Phoenix. The story follows many different characters and their experiences in the war and is written from different points of view. OCs are kept to a minimum and will not play big roles in the story. Canon-compliant to begin with, but turns into a horcrux hunt starting from chapter 25.
