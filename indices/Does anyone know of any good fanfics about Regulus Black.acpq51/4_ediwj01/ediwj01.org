I love:

Linkffn(The Soul Crossing by KitMay) - made me cry like a baby. Very sweet, novella sized. Reg/Hermione

Linkffn(Ready for the Storm by calebski) - amazingly written, sadly unfinished. Maybe some more positive reviews would convince them to keep writing? :D Reg/Hermione

I'm also really enjoying linkffn(Black by wishingstar21) - it's ongoing where Regulus is brought forward rather than someone going back. Reg/Hermione

I also have an ongoing Reg/Hermione fic linkffn(Silver Tongue, Golden Heart by maeveiluka88)
