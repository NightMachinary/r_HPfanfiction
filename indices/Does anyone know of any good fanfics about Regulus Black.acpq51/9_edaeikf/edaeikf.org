Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

linkffn(11191235)

Regulus's name doesn't make an appearance until chapter 78, but he becomes a major character, and I really liked how he was portrayed in this fiction. He escaped from Voldemort once he found out that Voldemort made a Horcrux, and after chapter 78, he and Lucius Malfoy help Harry destroy Voldemort's horcrux.
