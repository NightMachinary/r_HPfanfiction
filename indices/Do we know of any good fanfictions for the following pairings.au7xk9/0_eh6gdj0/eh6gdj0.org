Harry/Bellatrix:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with her.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Harry thrown back to 1970, busted a Death Eater raid, and thoroughly impressed her.

--------------

Harry/Hermione:

There are lots of fics about that pairing, you might want to visit [[/r/hpharmony][r/hpharmony]] too. I have some latest ones here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929), is a decent new â€˜Wizards in Space' fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/][Harry Potter And the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), casts the postwar Trio as treasure hunting curse breakers. While look for Atlantis, they stumbled on something incredibly dangerous and got mired in major international conspiracies. You might want to read its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petuna Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), to get a better idea of this AU.

Harry is blind in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), and never went to Hogwarts. But he develops super power later on and is joined by an injured (and slightly crippled) Hermione.
