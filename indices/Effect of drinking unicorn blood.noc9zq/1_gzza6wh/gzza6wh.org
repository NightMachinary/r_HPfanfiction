My interpretation of the curse is that once the effect wears off, you cannot heal anymore. Your skin cells don't replace each other, your blood doesn't clot, nothing. You'll quickly go into complete organ failure. However if you have the means to do so, you can keep living as long as you have unicorns to kill and drink their blood.

However, I believe it comes from HPMOR where they say that you need to kill the unicorn by drinking the blood, so you can't hit it with a killing curse and then drink. You need to find a way to incapacitate a unicorn and drink its blood directly from the source until it dies from blood loss.

You can't store the blood either, it needs to be drunken from a live unicorn.

My fic slowly reveals about this.
