I think it had to do with the soul/essence of a person. For Quirrel, although he was possessed by Voldemort who had already ripped his soul, I think it affected Quirrel himself as well. His essence became tainted and unclean and he became less human . This may mean that his soul itself was damaged, his magic may have become tainted, or his loss of humanity/self. Basically changing him irrevocably in a negative way.
