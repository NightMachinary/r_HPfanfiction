I've always read it as a killing of the spirit, in a way. Not literally destroying the soul like a dementor, but draining a person of what makes them a person until they're a shadow of themself.

So it's taking away their ability to enjoy the taste of food, or feeling rested after sleep, and emotions are muted, any joy or sorrow or anger or triumph has basically been dampened permanently. So you basically cannot enjoy the remainder of your life.
