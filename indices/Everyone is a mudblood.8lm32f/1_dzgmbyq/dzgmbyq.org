The Bible would be irrelevant to most purebloods due to the century long persecution by religious authorities. Religion in the Harry Potter world would be a lot closer related to various pagan practices, not the organized ones hunting them. Using the Bible as sources would make purebloods laugh at you, dismissing any argument you may make by default.

As for "turning the insult around", that's not effective at all. Insults work because you allow them to affect you. You are one choosing to be offended instead of rolling your eyes and walking away (ignoring physical violence/bullying is a different can of worms). But if you insist on "returning fire", it would be a lot more effective to strike back where it hurts.

For example, let's say Malfoy shouts "You are a filthy, ignorant Mudblood Granger". She could argue

  Technically, everyone is a Mudblood because there are pureblooded Muggles and from their point of view, you are the Mudblood.

Or she could go for the counter attack

  And yet it was your mother lusting after my muggleborn cunt last summer because she was desperate for a good shagging. A shagging I gave her with a fat Muggle strap-on. She is quite the pureblood whore, and your daddy's pathetic little cock is simply not doing it for her. And given how annoyed Parkinson looks all the time, you are unable to get her off either.

Ask yourself, which one would get the better reaction from the surrounding crowd?
