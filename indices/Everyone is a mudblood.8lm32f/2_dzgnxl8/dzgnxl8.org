Nah. A better one would just be to do as Dumbledore did: point out there's no such thing as a pure-blood. All they do is disown the squibs and blood-traitors from their families. They're as "impure" as anyone.

Or, if they're even bothered by it, point out how sad it is that they'd rather screw their own mother than have a nice time with a Muggle woman. Sirius's parents were second-cousins and the Gaunts can barely remember who fathered and birthed who.
