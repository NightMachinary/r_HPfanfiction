I could have sworn the idea of mudbloodedness came from equating muggle blood with mud, not from the miscegenating between wizards and muggles.

In this sense of the word, muggleborns would have the muddiest blood amongst magicals, and muggle pureblood would mean pure mud in your veins.

I could be wrong, but I don't think your version is canon, and quite frankly I wouldn't want it to be. Having the "bad guys" support blatantly retarded ideas that the "good guys" easily prove idiotic is extremely lazy writing imo.
