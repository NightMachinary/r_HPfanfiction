To play the devil's advocate here. Until the concentration camps started, the Third Reich's policies weren't "blatantly retarded" in the context of that period in history. Apartheid in South Africa, Jim Crow in the US, and the general dislike of the Jewish population by the world meant that Hitler was seen as radical, but not outrageous.
