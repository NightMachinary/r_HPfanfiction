It feels stupid, but blaming an innocent group is a theme throughout history, and even today. It's a political strategy to gain a hardline constituency. Britain and eastern european immigrants, Trump and Mexicans, and of course Hitler and Jews. Humans are irrational, and finding an outlet for blame works well.
