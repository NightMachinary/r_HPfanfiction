The idea to blame an innocent group in the first place is blatantly stupid. And the Harry Potter conflict was just as simple, a fascist, racially motivated terrorist group taking over, led by a man only paying lip service to his own ideology.

That is a straight Third Reich ripoff, with the Death Eaters filling first the SA and then the SS/SD role.

As for the Third Reich, starting the War against the Soviet Union was stupid. The plans for Operation Sealion were utterly retarded. Hell, the Halt in front of Dunkirk basically lost us the war in 1940.
