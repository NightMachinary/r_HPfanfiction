  So pureblood supremacy is bad writing?
#+end_quote

Depends on how it's written. It's very easy to make up plausible reasons for the pureblood movement, and if you go and use "the muggleborns stole their magic from squibs" or similarly easily disproven concepts while having an MC dismantling the whole enemy ideology in spite of being a little kid, I'm sure going to call that bad writing.

  The Third Reich was bad writing?

I wasn't aware Hitler was fiction, and I damn well hope you don't believe that nazism can be summed up as "let's take over a country so we can kill the jews".
