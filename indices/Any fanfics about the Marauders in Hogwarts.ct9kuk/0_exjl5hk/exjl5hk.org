I would highly recommend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/42273][Midnight Conversations]] series by Thistlerose and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/88363][home is where you build your heart]] series by malapropism! You haven't mentioned ship preferences, but if you like Remus/Sirius or James/Lily there's plenty of exhaustive fic rec lists out there that I'd be happy to link.

(unfortunately, the home is where you build your heart series is seemingly abandoned, but all the individual fics are completed, so it's still a pretty satisfying read)
