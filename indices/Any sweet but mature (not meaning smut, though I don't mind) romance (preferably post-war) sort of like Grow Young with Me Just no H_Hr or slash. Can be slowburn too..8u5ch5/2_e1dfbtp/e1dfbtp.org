- Maybe Days to Come linkffn(Days to Come): H/D, Harry split from Ginny but its relatively believable compared to some other fics. Harry and Daphne sort of become friends due to his social ostracization and it goes from there.
- The Quidditch World Cup linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): H/L, Harry met Luna again after a couple of years and the two started hanging out on and off till eventually ending up together. Warning, goes to some darker places with Luna, but not something unrealistic either.
