Yeah, but QWC is from TE7 and I've never read a single fic of his that has a good ending, in my prerrogative. I actually did read QWC halfway, when I got bored of the amount of (surprise surprise) quidditch in the fanfic. TE7 writes quidditch phenomenaly, but this time I got bored to pieces.

Days to come is lovely and I did enjoy it very much. It was thinking of that style that I asked for something like that. Or like Unspeakable Beauty. Or a more romance focused Vitam Paramus (also wayyyy too much quidditch imo, and one of the less horrible endings from TE7, just extremely lackluster compared to the rest of the fic.)

Thanks though.
