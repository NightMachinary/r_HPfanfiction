I don't hate quidditch, specially if its TE7 that is writing it about, and I love the fact that he uses Titus in a lot of his stories, which is a character that I enjoy reading. My problem is when there's more quidditch than plot or romance or character development. Which is what I felt when I read QWC. But if you say the ending is good, I'll get back on it, Harry/Luna is one of my favourite pairings after all.
