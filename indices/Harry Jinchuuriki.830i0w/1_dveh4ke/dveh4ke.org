I only know two. Neither in Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5852062/1/Multicolour-Post-Its][Multicolour Post Its]]: Naruto is Harry's jinchuriki. Set in the Leaf.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8530656/1/Shark-in-the-Leaf][Shark in the Leaf]]: Harry has the Tree Tails. Set in the Leaf. I wasn't a fan of this one but I have high standards and dislike most of Naruto fandom so maybe you will be.
