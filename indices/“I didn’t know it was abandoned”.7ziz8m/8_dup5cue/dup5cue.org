It's interesting - I've never understood the attachment to complete fics. I think it's because I have a very "sandbox" approach to fanfiction, where the only "real" story is canon, and I have closure with regards to that. Everything else is just playing around in the toybox of canon, and so I'm much more interested in finding engaging ideas than having a complete literary experience (if you want that then really fanfiction is the wrong place to look, given the standard of writing/plotting/pacing/structure).
