I'm here to offer a little hope: I recently picked up writing again after a hiatus of 4 years. I have finished a couple chapters and will start uploading again soon. I'm not sure how my followers will receive it, but I for one am excited to be back into the writing mindset. I will absolutely finish this story, even if it takes me 4 more years.
