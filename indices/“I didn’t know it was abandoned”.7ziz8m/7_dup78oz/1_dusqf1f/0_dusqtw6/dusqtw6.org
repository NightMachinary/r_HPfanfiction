I started out that way, but as my story went on, my chapters became longer and more complicated and they took longer to write. Eventually life got in the way and I was unable to write more. I chose to upload what I had by then, hoping inspiration would eventually hit again.

When I started writing I was 17 years old. I am now 26 and obviously don't have the same amount of free time I had back then. I work full-time and battled a wicked depression over the past five years.

I know it's frustrating when your favourite fic seems abandoned, but priorities change over the years. Some of my favourite fics have been abandoned halfway as well but at least I got to read what the author has come up with so far. Better to have had something than nothing at all, imo.
