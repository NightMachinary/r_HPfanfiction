If you like natural 20, I just discovered a similar story, called Harry Potter and the Girl in Red, that I thought was decent.

It appears to still be active, but stories have a bad habit of going from being regularly updated to completely inactive just as I get caught up to their latest chapter, which just happened. So we'll see if my bad luck on that happens here or not I guess.

I followed rent a hero too when it was live, was so sad when it stopped updating. The worst one for me was probably What You Leave Behind. FF says I added an alert on 10/16/2015 and it last updated 08/08/2015 :(. Had a bunch of mysteries in it that I really wanted the answers to.

Wand and Shield I also added an alert for 2 months after its most recent update.

This is currently happening with the pureblood pretense series, which has had one update in the past year. I really hope the author starts updating regularly again eventually.
