For me, it's the stories I read by active, updating authors that then turn into inactive, not updating ones. I was following Rent-a-hero when it was live, as well as stories like Junior Inquisitor and Courage and Cunning. All three authors have vanished from the face of the earth. Sir Poley's Natural 20 is similar, but at least he is active on other forums.

Links to above stories:
