linkffn(Time Warp by kittenn1011)

It's a pretty unique time travel story that /really/ ends on a cliffhanger.

What makes it unique: the fast pace (it doesn't drag through every single detail of the books to show every tiny little change) and the fact that Draco came back in time too. I don't think it was Harry/Draco either, which is also rather unusual.
