The Mirror of Maybe....I still read even to this day, and I'm always pissed it's not complete nor being worked on.

When I first started it a long long long time ago, I thought it WAS still being worked on because there had been a recent update. Well, that update was the author saying they were no longer working on it - or that it was on hiatus.
