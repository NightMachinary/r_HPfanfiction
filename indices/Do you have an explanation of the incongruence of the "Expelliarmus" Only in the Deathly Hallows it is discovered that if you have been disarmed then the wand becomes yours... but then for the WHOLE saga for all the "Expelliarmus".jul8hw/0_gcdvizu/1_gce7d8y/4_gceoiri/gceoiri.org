There was no way in the beginning that Harry would win in a straight 1:1 duel. Voldemort is decades older and more experienced than Harry who's barely a legal adult, Harry is not a wizarding prodigy (except for flying on a broom but that's pretty much useless in this situation).

Besides, the Elder Wand is not "just" a stupid plot, it is actually an important thing - Voldemort, like many powerful people, falls because he thought he was immortal, infinitely powerful and knew everything. And like many before him, he discovered in the end that it is very easy to fall even from a small mistake.
