So change actresses. The whole thing in 6th year was that Harry was suddenly awestruck by how pretty Ginny was - that doesn't make a lot of sense if the person playing Ginny is plain and unattractive.

They changed Lavender Brown from black to white! You think it would have been more jarring to replace Ginny's actress with someone less repulsive?
