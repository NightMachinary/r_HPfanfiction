I disagree. Book 6 entirely changed the tone of the series, because JKR has a ginger fetish and got distracted.

Book 2 - Harry kills a basilisk w a f-ing sword.

Book 3 - Harry chases away a hundred dementors with a spell most adults cannot manage

Book 4 - Harry bests Voldemort in a magical battle of will

Book 5 - Harry trains his school chums and they defeat more than twice their number of LV's best Deat Eaters / /then/ Harry throws off LV's attempted possession

Book 6 - Harry forgets all of the things that happened for the last 5 years, spends all his time thinking about his best friend's little sis/his roommate's girlfriend ðŸ¤®

See? There was a clear arc of Harry building to defeat Voldemort that could have been utilized. It's silly to say "oh LV is older and more experienced".

Grindelwald was what, 40 when he almost took over the world? Gee, if only the ICW had thought to find an old man to fight him, there never would have been a war in the first place! After all, /no one can win against someone decades older/!!!
