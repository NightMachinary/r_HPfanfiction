  Book 2 - Harry kills a basilisk w a f-ing sword.
#+end_quote

He only manages to do this with a sword with special properties and survives by the sheer luck of having a phoenix come to him - without his tears he'd be a goner.

  Harry chases away a hundred dementors with a spell most adults cannot manage
#+end_quote

One might argue that adults can't manage the Patronus spell not due to a lack of magical ability but rather by the lack of happy moments they can focus on. Let's face it most of adult life is one fucking drag.

  Harry bests Voldemort in a magical battle of will
#+end_quote

... supported by the spectres of his dead parents and by the sheer dumb luck of his wand being the twin of Voldemort's. Again, more luck than skill.

  Harry trains his school chums and they defeat more than twice their number of LV's best Deat Eaters / then Harry throws off LV's attempted possession
#+end_quote

They manage to survive, which I grant shows decent abilities. Harry does get possessed by Voldemort and only saved by Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Harry forgets all of the things that happened for the last 5 years, spends all his time thinking about his best friend's little sis/his roommate's girlfriend
#+end_quote

Not just that. They were surviving being the No. 1 on the Most Wanted list for an incredibly long time. However, survival skills are different than fighting skills, shown by them being bested and captured by Snatchers.

  Gee, if only the ICW had thought to find an old man to fight him, there never would have been a war in the first place!
#+end_quote

The problem with dark lords, dictators and similars is that too many adults don't /want/ to fight them. Either they're too terrified to do anything (and to lose what precious they have), or they are comfortable with/benefitting from the situation. It's no coincidence that most rebellions start at universities or in youth movements...
