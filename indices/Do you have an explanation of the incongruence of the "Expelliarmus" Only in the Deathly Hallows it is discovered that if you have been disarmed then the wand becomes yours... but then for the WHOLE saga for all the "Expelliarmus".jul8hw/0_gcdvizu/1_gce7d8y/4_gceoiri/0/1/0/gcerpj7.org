I must have missed the part in Book 6 where they left Hogwarts and started the Horcrux Hunt.

Yes, Harry had help with most of his adventures, but he still was the one to do it. If it had been Ron in the graveyard, would he have been able to "push the beads of light" back towards LV? Of course not - not because Ron is stupid, but because Harry is the goddamn hero/protagonist. Of course he is strong enough to take on LV!

And I'm sorry, saying "oh, just because this little boy can cast a spell most people can't isn't that impressive" is like saying "yea, that 9-year old piano prodigy is neat, but if I spent 30 years playing I'd be just as good". The whole point is that a little boy has so much ability/skill/power that he is doing things adults would need years to accomplish.

That is, I assume, what JKR was going for. It was the "hero's journey" for the first 5 books, then a bumbling clown show for 6/7.
