  The whole point is that a little boy has so much ability/skill/power that he is doing things adults would need years to accomplish.

Not really. The point is that (especially adult) wizards are stupid and ignorant to what is going on. They live their lives and that's it for them. They don't /want/ to do anything, to improve - some are outright /resisting/ any attempt of doing so. In our world, it would /never/ fly that it comes down to literal children to find the snake because the teacher is so utterly incompetent it hurts.
