Two things: (1.) JKR had always written herself into a corner with the whole Harry v. Voldemort thing; it's why to my tastes, PoA is the best book in the series. It's the only one where 'prophecy' isn't the asspull that gets Harry out of things with serious plot armor and instead, actually feel as if he's in real, no-s**t danger from Sirius. (It also highlights the whole BS 'prophecy' angle because it shows how the MoM and the Wizarding World goes on high alert for Sirius, but can't stop falling over their feet and losing control over bodily functions anytime Voldemort's name is mentioned.) BTW, WHY THE HELL is the ICW even mentioned if they can't even come in and help out with such a huge problem as LV and his coalition of evil? After all, if they take over the UK, it's a staging area to start into Europe proper, and to expand from there! Why didn't we see MACUSA or any of the other magical governments being asked for help, or at least to send 'advisers' to assist? Why didn't an ICW task force of THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of wizards and witches just drop into Scotland all 'Omaha Beach'- style and overrun the Death Eaters, et al. with absolute overwhelming force? After all, people are still alive who fought in the war against Grindenwald, and the world simply would not want a Second World Wizarding War... especially considering that now, all of the major Muggle powers have access to NBC weaponry and pinpoint delivery systems worldwide. Really, several cruise missiles launched at the Death Eater locations outside Hogwarts would have solved the issue - but then again, it seems that the British WW would rather have allowed LV to take over rather than appeal to help from the Crown. (It also seems VERY hard to believe that if the British Muggles haven't found ways to deal with problematic magical British subjects, the American No-Maj - I always thought that term should be used as a descriptive for both singular and plural - certainly would have for similarly problematic American citizens... and would have shared. 'Special Relationship' and all, you know.)

(2.) Book 6 should be called 'the Twilight' of the HP book series because of the romance angles (and Book 5 was horrible enough with the Cho subplot). I mean, from the description we've been given of love potions, listening to Harry's inner monologues concerning Ginny and his actions, it seems to me that he's definitely been dosed with a low-level love potion alongside an equally-powered compulsion potion keyed to her. I mean, all of the girls around him (including Hermione, who IMHO has been more of a friend and companion than Ron, but that's another story) that he could notice, and he suddenly starts to drool over the girl who can't even speak in whole sentences around him... (This is also real shady when you consider that since second year, he almost always spends a good portion of the summer around Ginny and it's just when he turns of legal age in the UK - sixteen in England, Scotland and Wales - when Harry suddenly starts to grow horns around Ginny.)
