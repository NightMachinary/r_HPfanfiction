Tons of adults use magic their whole lifetimes. Most cannot cast a Patronus, which Harry did at age 13, chasing away a hundred dementors. At age 14 he bested LV in a magical battle of wills.

It's just flat out untrue to say JKR was being 'consistent' by inventing an absurd cheat-key like the Hallows. If anything, Books 6/7 were wholly inconsistent with the way she'd wrote Harry the entire series.
