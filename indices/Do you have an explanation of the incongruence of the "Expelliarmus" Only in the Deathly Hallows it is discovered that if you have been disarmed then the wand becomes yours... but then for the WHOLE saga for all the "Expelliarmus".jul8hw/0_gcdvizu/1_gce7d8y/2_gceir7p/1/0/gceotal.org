Just because a story has magic in it does not mean it should lose internal consistency. Magic is portrayed as a subject that takes a lifetime of practice to master. Voldemort has had a lifetime of practice in addition to possessing legendary potential.

It simply does not make sense that Harry could best him if we are to respect magic as an art or science of any difficulty. If you wish to abandon that notion in your fic then feel free - I am glad that J.K Rowling did not.
