I would argue that Harry defeating him wasn't a deux ex machina. She could have left the wand and hallows out of the story completely and it would have still worked. All the way back in book 1 Dumbledore straight up says that the reason Quirrel couldn't bear to touch him was because of the power of his mom's love. All through the series that's given as the sole reason for him having to stay with his abusive horrible blood relatives during the summers. And it's brought up repeatedly that the thing that makes Harry different isn't power levels, it's that Harry can love. Love is one of the core recurring themes in the story.

The appearance of the hallows was kind of annoying to me because it hadn't even been hinted at before this. Like yeah the cloak was introduced early, but it's was never mentioned in that context. Like when Ron said "whoa they're really rare!" he could have added, "There's one in a story mum used to read us about three brothers that tried to cheat death," and left it at that. Or done something even more subtle if she didn't want to leave an obvious clue.

Up until the hallows were introduced, I had a strong inkling it was going to end with Harry hugging it out or letting Voldemort kill him and surviving through the power of love. Which would have worked regardless of the wand Voldemort used, because the thing that allowed him to survive the second time was that he willingly sacrificed himself so nobody else would die in his place.
