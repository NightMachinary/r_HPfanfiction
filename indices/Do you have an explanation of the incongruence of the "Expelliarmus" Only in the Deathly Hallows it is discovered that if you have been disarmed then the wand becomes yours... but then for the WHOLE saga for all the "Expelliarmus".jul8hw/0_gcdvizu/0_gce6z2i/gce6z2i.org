I think this whole sorry confusing mess could have been avoided if JKR had just written that the "allegiance" thing was a peculiarity of the Elder wand.

There was no need to make it so that all wands had this weird trait that most people would experience, but then no-one seems to know about.

Just stick with Ollivander's original explanation about wands: namely, a witch or wizard can use another's wand, but won't get results as good as if using their own.

That's a perfectly good explanation for why Hermione could use Bellatrix's wand, and Harry could use Draco's, and Ron use Pettigrew's, though less successfully than they use their own - without introducing any plot holes.
