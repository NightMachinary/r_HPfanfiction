[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could][The Little Veela That Could]] has a variant of the horcrux as a core concept of the story, in this case the concept of a "light horcrux" where a love sacrifice can create a kind of soul link/mix between two people; the attempted scarcrux prevented Harry from being able to play host to Lily's spirit however as they kinda destroyed each other. This is mostly background though as the main story is Harry takes a spear through the heart when a crazed merman tries to kill Gabrielle at the end of the second task, and his death turns her into his light horcrux, and then it turns out that Veela who bond like that before they hit puberty become obscenely OP super-halo-power love-triggered angels instead of fireball-tossing anger-triggered birds (but everyone had forgotten as the last instance was millennia ago), and they even meet Lucifer (who isn't evil). Yeah it kinda goes nuts lol, and even pokes fun at itself in the epilogue's omake.
