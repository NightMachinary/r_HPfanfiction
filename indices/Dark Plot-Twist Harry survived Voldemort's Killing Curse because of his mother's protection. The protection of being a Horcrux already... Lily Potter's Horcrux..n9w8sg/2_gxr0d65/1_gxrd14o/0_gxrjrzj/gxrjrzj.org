The sacrifice of one form of attachment for another... That could be one way to look at the Horcrux creation ritual.

Voldemort felt very little or no link to any of the people he killed making Horcruxes, and the more he made the less human he appeared, so you could say he was sacrificing his attachment to humanity in order to attach his soul to the material world/plane whatever. I guess the cumulative effect could have impacted other thing besides empathy like sanity and whatnot.

Lily in sacrificing James, whom she loves would be able to maintain her empathy and sanity, and still be attached to the mortal plane. The strength of the attachment sacrificed might even affect the quality of the Horcrux created and how well it defends itself.

One issue that could crop up is the whole re-absorbing the soul piece if you feel remorse thing. If she ever gets a body, she might re-absorb the Horcrux in Harry by accident (regretting that she, Harry and James never got to be one big happy family and poof, it's gone)
