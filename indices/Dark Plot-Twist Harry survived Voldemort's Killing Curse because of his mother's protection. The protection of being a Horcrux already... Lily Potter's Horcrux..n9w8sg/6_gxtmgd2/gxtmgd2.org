Actually my favorite theory by far (not sure if I picked it up somewhere or this is an original thought) is that he survived because he's the master of death. And how could he become the MoD in the first place if he were to die as a baby? Basically it's one of those HP time travel concepts. Harry survives the encounter with the horde of dementors in book 3 because his future self dealt with them. And he survived Voldemorts AK as a baby because he's the master of death (in the future). But does death really limit itself to time?

But obviously Lily sacrificing her life through a magical ritual for her baby is far more beautiful/poetic.
