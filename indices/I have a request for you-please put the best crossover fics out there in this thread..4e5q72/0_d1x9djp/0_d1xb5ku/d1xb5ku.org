I wouldn't call HP:TLA great. The integration of the two universes is seamless, but Harry is just such a cowardly arsehole that it kills most of my enjoyment.

A few other additional recs:

/That Which Holds the Image/(HP/Doctor Who)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

/The Wizard From Earth/(HP/Man From Earth)

#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

/Happiness is a Broken Wand/(HP/LotR)

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape just wants a new, peaceful life in Middle Earth, but with a vicious war arising and a new Dark Lord gunning for him, he'll have to fight to get that wish. Magic and battles, familiars and friends. Slytherinesque cunning shall always prevail.

/Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex/(HP/Sherlock Holmes)

#+begin_quote
  A Sherlock Holmes mystery set in Victorian Hogwarts. A valuable artefact has been stolen from Hogwarts School, with a Muggle student the only suspect, and Headmaster Black summons Holmes to retrieve it. But the case is not as clear cut as it first appears

/Failsafe/(HP/LotR)

#+begin_quote
  Tackling the last traces of magic Voldemort left scattered around Britain, a magical disaster causes Harry and Ginny to wake up in the dungeons of a ruined fortress. It doesn't take them long to realise that something is very, very wrong... Post DH
