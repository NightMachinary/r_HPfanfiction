  That Which Holds the Image(HP/Doctor Who) Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

I have /always/ wanted to see this play out as a concept, and I'm so, so glad someone wrote it! Thanks for this.
