*Great*

/Harry Potter: The Last Avatar (HP/Avatar)/

#+begin_quote
  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]

/The Black Prince (HP/GoT)/

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

/The Shadow of Angmar (HP/LotR)/

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

/The Denarian Trilogy has a rocky start, which is why I've put it in "good" rather than "great". However, by the time you're reached the second in the trilogy, it's well written and gripping./

/Retsu's Folly (HP/Bleach)/

/The Havoc Side of the Force (HP/Star Wars)/

#+begin_quote
  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

/Wand and Shield (HP/Avengers)/

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

/Discordant (HP/SW)/

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

*Short or WIP*

/For Fallen Souls (HP/LotR)/

  AU. What cannot remain dead will never cease to be, so the elves really shouldn't be surprised when one of their enigmatic gods fall from the sky.
