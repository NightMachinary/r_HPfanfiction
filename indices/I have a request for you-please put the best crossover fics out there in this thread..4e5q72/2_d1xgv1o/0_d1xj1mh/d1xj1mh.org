The summary of that one puts me off. The set-up sounds so convoluted and illogical, and the main purpose of the fic sounds like family fluff that degenerates Harry emotionally into a little kid so that people can care for him like a doll... sounds saccharine sweat and just dull.

Does it actually have a proper heroic adventure plotline? I might check it out if so.
