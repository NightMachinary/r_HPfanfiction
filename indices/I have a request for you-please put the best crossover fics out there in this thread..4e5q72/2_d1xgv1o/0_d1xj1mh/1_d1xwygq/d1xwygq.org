It really picks up after chapter 10 or so. The author explores the realistic consequences of Harry being Thor's son, including an alliance of numerous dangerous villains formed specifically because they learned of this. There is also the fact that Harry and many other characters grow and are hurt both physically and emotionally during the story. The writing in later chapters has been compared favorably to that of Jim Butcher and Brandon Sanderson.
