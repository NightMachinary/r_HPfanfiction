Realistically though only the latter two options would make it vaguely interesting. The first one is kind of the antithesis of having Magic as a thing in the universe, what's the point of establishing a story about magic, where there is no point to it. Just write a whole muggle AU or its just going to turn into Muggle wank. Its one of the things i like to see conserved in a fanfic, is that however shit the Magical World is, it's still preferable to the Muggle one.
