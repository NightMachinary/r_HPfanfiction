There's a fic where he decides not to compete and snaps his wand and leaves Hogwarts and everyone is shook. Of course, the plot twist was that because he is fated to defeat, or at least fight, Voldemort, the prophecy's magic was stronger than the magic of the tournament's contract so when he breeched the contract by not competing, he was able to keep his magic. But no one knew because at that point the prophecy was still largely a secret.
