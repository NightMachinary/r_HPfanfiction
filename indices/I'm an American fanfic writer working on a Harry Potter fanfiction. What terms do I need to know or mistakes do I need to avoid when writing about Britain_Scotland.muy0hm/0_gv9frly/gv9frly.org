Pancakes. We don't eat pancakes for breakfast unless we are in an American themed restaurant. Ditto waffles. Our waffles are potato waffles and they come out of the freezer and go in the oven to be had with fish fingers and beans. Wizards probably dont have them, they're a Muggle convenience food. Our pancakes are more like the French crÃªpe, and we eat them as a dessert option (and sometimes just as an evening meal on Shrove Tuesday) usually with lemon and sugar. We can get maple syrup now but it was really uncommon in the 90s.

Not all rich people are posh, not all posh people are rich, and even the wealthiest aren't usually hereditary aristocracy. The Weasleys are more likely to be titled than the Malfoys tbh- flashing the cash and the influence is considered gauche.

We don't wear "khakis." What you guys call khakis, we call chinos. Most people wouldn't put a young child in them- they're for posh people, social climbers and people who live in the Home Counties. We wear jeans, and kids seem to wear a lot of cords (for reasons I cannot fathom a huge amount of children's clothing is couduroy).

"Pudding" generically means dessert. What you guys call pudding we'd call a mousse- it's not quite the same but we (sadly) don't really have what you call pudding. A pudding here can also be a specific type of dessert, a sort of steamed cake with syrup or fruit. Goes with custard.

Mexican food wasn't a thing here at the time the books were set and tbh, having eaten it in San Diego, what we have even now is pants.

Speaking of pants- unless one is from specific parts of Manchester and Lancashire, "pants" are underwear. Trousers are trousers, and pants go under them. Women don't call our pants "panties" because we are grownups- the term in most of the UK is "knickers." "Pants" can also, as I previously demonstrated, mean "rubbish," as in "the Chudley Cannons were pants, not that Ron would ever admit it."

We don't have air conditioning- we don't need it. Our weather isn't extreme. It rarely snows in most of the UK and when it does it doesn't settle. Our climate is mildly cold and very wet. It rains in the winter so the snow doesn't settle. It rains in the summer. Spring? Yeah we invented April showers. Autumn (not Fall, ever), yep still raining. The terms most applied to British weather are "chilly" and "damp." One bit of sunshine and everyone is outside, we never know how long it will last.

No one calls anyone an "old coot." Dumbledore is more likely to be referred to as "that daft old bugger."

On which note- insulting someone is a sign of friendship. The ruder we are to each other, the more we like each other. If a British person is being icily polite to you, they absolutely hate you. If they're calling you a "daft c*nt," you're their best mate. If a Scotsman ever calls you "pal," run. Run like the wind. You're about to be punched.

Only regulars in a pub sit at the bar. Everyone else sits at tables. Bottles of beer are for BBQs and watching the football at home- in a pub if you're having beer you're having a pint. We drink all the time. Sunday lunch? Glass of wine. Saturday night? Glass of wine. After work? W I N E. Four pints is a light after work drink. We have 16 year olds that could drink grown American adults under the table.

Scottish people /do not, ever ever ever/ say "och aye the noo." Och aye is fine, the noo is fine, but I have no idea why they get put together as some sort of Scots saying. "Och aye" means "oh yes" and "the noo" means "the now", ie "right now"/"at once." No one would say "oh yes right now" as some sort of random saying. So have McGonagall say "och aye, they're silly buggers alright those Weasley twins," or have her say "I'm coming the noo, can't have any other bairns [Scots for children] getting hurt." Don't overdo the Scottish words- my dad's Scottish and him and his sisters speak in regular words that all English speakers would understand for the most part.

And, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO ONE HAS CREAM IN TEA. We have milk in tea, or lemon juice in some types such as Earl Grey. Cream in coffee was fashionable in the 90s for some reason but no. Milk. I think where you guys have got confused is with the term "cream tea"- that's a fancy meal of little sandwiches, tiny cakes and the key element- scones that come with jam and /cream./ It's served with a pot of tea, hence the term "cream tea" but no one in their right mind would actually put cream in tea. We also don't really have it iced. It's served hot, with milk. Also, at the time of the books, no one would have had a coffee machine. Coffee was instant, and served after dinner. Tea is drunk throughout the day.

There's also a huge class element to how tea is served. Working men have it in big mugs, brewed really strong with lots of sugar, which is measured in teaspoonfuls. You put the teabag in the mug, pour on boiling water, let it stand until it's the colour of treacle and then add milk and sugar. Upper class ladies "having tea" together have loose tea from a teapot, brewed for anywhere between 3-5 minutes and poured into dainty cups through a tea strainer. The milk goes in first if you're using a china cup (out of necessity- they crack with heat and the cool milk mitigates the boiling hot tea) but every other time it goes in last. They may have sugar and if so it is in sugar lumps, served with silver tongs. More than two is considered common. Middle class people don't tend to take sugar, will generally use the mug method (but not brewed so strongly) but will have a teapot for special occasions or fancy company- and they'll just put the teabags in the teapot (one per head plus one for the pot). Water is boiled in a kettle, then poured into the pot whether you're using loose or bagged tea. You don't boil tea, you boil water then add it to the dried tea.

I think that's enough for now, I've probably overwhelmed you! Give me a shout if you want your thing properly Britpicked though. I enjoy doing them!
