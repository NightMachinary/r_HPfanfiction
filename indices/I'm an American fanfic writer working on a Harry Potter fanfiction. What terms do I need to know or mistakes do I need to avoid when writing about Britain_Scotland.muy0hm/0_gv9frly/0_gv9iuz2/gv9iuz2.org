If I could upvote this another 50 times I would. I very much appreciate the time and effort putting into describing the social intricacies of tea - if I I have to read one more fic where someone serves their English breakfast tea with LEMON and NO MILK I will be absolutely apoplectic. I may even go as far as to purse my lips and tut in disapproval.

I would add to this that we only have finals at university, which doesn't seem to exist in HP-verse. We have end-of-year exams. OWLs and NEWTs are also externally set exams so no extra credit or anything like that.
