Yep, some more education stuff: OWLS are the equivalent to GCSEs and NEWTS are the equivalent to A-levels. There is an external exam board marking and regulating them, which is partly to standardise exams across all schools and partly so teacher bias won't make a difference, so that could be something to suggest that there's more than one English magic school (or at the very least some home schoolers).

Also, end of year grades don't matter. Like, at all. In normal schools teachers would decide who goes into which ‘set' based on them but as there's an appalling lack of teachers and no OFSTED (school inspection board) it seems Hogwarts does not have sets, so if you suck at a subject then that's just too bad. If you're advanced then that's also too bad. Also, extra credit is not a thing, it does not exist. That's because homework does not go towards your end of year exam result. Asking for extra homework is mental and something no British student would consider, ever, and also something no teacher wants to give as it means extra marking for them.

Boarding schools tend to have ‘study hall' which is a time after lessons (an hour or so) where students have to spend the time studying. It seems Hogwarts does not do that but if anyone wants to include it in a fic that would be cool.

I also think it's very unrealistic that there was no unofficial smoking spot at Hogwarts. In any other British school there'd be a place where teachers wouldn't check- or if they do it's really easy to see them coming- generally behind the bike sheds or behind the sports hall, that the chav kids smoke at. I choose to believe that there was and Harry was too oblivious to notice.
