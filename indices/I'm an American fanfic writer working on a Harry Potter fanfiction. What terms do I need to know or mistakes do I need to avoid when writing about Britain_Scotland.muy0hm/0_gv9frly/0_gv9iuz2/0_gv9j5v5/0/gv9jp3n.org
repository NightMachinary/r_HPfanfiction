Yessssss this is a pet peeve of mine!!

One that I've started noticing as my level of pedantry skyrockets is "grade." We only use grade in the context of the letter achieved in an exam (e.g Harry achieved a grade O in his DADA OWL). We would say that a teacher marks a paper and a student in a year of school (e.g. fifth year); we wouldn't use "grade" for either of those.
