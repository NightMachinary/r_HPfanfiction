The bit about the bar v tables at the pub is a detail I didn't know I needed, thanks!

Also appreciate the acknowledgement that cream in coffee was a 90s fad. The farther away from the 90s we get the more I think we lose some of the details that help immersion. Sometimes I see today's pop music referenced in series-years fics and just... Sigh. The actual music of the 90s can take me back in ways that other details can't, and seeing newer pop hits in a story set in 1998 is very jarring to me.

Ok now I feel /old/. Don't mind me as I fire up 90s playlists on Spotify ;)

Thanks again!
