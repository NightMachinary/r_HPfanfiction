Statistically speaking a very small number of students at a school level get taught really anything about this - or they didn't a decade ago, I accept this may have changed. When I was at school it wasn't on the history curriculum until GCSE level and History was an optional subject AND you only got taught it if your school happened to choose that pathway - my school didn't I learned about Germany between the first and Second World War (significantly more interesting IMO).

So as [[/u/HeckingDramatic][u/HeckingDramatic]] said over here literally no one cares about the revolutionary war ðŸ˜‚
