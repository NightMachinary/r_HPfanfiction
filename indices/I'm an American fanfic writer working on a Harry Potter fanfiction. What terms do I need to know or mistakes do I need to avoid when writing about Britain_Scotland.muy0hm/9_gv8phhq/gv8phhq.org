If you search the sub for the word 'Americanisms', there's a bunch of threads where us Brits have furiously written out our pet peeves :)

For the most part, as long as you're writing "mum" instead of mom, you'll probably be fine and most people don't mind the occasional mistake. But it's worth finding a friendly Brit, maybe through the discord server, who can Brit-pick your work. That way, they can identify cultural mistakes (like constantly having pancakes for breakfast!) as well as words.
