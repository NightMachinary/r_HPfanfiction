Distances are not measured in blocks. What on earth is a block? If people walk they tend to say how many minutes it takes to walk a distance.

Wearing a jumper (sweater for you Americans) in summer. WTF. Just because it is not as hot as in Florida... a lot of Brits (especially men) will start wearing shorts and t-shirts in April when the temps hit 15Â°C. There will be some really hot days (meaning over 30) in summer but only for like 2 weeks if you are lucky. And then that streak is broken by rain. The numbers of times I have read someone put on a jumper in summer is just too high.

Not that common today but in the 90s nearly everyone would drink tea. My cousin started drinking milky tea when she as 6 months old. Hot chocolate is a treat, not an everyday occurrence. For a comfort drink, always go with a mug of tea even if it is a child.
