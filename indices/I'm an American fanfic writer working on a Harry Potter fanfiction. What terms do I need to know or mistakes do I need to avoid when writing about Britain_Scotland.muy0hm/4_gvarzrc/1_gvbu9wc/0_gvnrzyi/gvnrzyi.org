I did say 'most'. :)

Singapore on Thames. Damn, I haven't heard about that in a few years. If memory serves, even the guy who proposed that saw it as a secondary option to take up as a back-up plan for a way to shore up a weakened economy should Brexit have turned out badly. And just because our politicians have suggested it as a possibility, doesn't mean people have requested it. Recent polls have shown a significant majority of YPs polled (Leave Voting YPs, specifically) would prefer more regulation, not less. Even London CEOs apparently have warned against over-deregulation according to the Financial Times.

Also, we can absolutely ignore that some British once came up with some ideas. We were a massive hub for philosophy during the enlightenment - they came up with a tonne of ideas we don't really care about on a larger scale (eg. we're the original home of the Puritans and nobody would consider us Puritanical anymore). I'm talking culture, not philosophy or ideology. For something to become a part of culture, it has to be popular with the majority of people in a society or group. An idea being proposed does not an idea accepted make. If random people on the street and in coffeeshops were talking favourably of de-regulation - if soap operas and stand-up comedians started to make jokes about it and knew that everyone would get those jokes - that's how you know something has become part of the Country's culture. Even descriptions in favour of Singapore on Thames only say it's popular with votes of more Libertarian leanings - if it were a thing, that would make it 'Libertarian Culture', not 'UK Culture'.
