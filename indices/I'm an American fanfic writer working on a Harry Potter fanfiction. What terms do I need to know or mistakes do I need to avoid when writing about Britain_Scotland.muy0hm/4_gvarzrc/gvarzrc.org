Pretty much everyone has covered words at this point, so I figured I'd try hit the cultural end of things. There are a few things that tend to out writers as American.

Religion - Not a lot of Hellfire and Brimstone Baptists in the UK. Our closest equivalent is Catholicism (which tends to be more "You're all sinners, pray for redemption!") and our other main faiths are Church of England and Protestantism (which are both a tad more 'chill' than Catholicism). Even when we were more Religious (which we would've been, back in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s), it was still more of a 'High Holidays only' sort of faith - attend on Easter and Christmas, that sort of thing.

Money - (Most) nobody praises the almighty dollar (or pound) or big business or likes de-regulation here. I don't think I've ever actually had or overheard a conversation about taxation. Any fic that features venture capitalism or talks about turning everything into a business ("I'm going to buy St Mungos and run it like a business!") or the like will out you as an American near-immediately. We also don't really have 'small family banks' like America seems to - we pretty much have several big banks (Barclays, HSBC, RBS, etc) and that's about it.

Guns - Incessant comparisons of wands to guns, and remarks on how 'Colt made everyone equal' or how great it is that everyone is armed ABSOLUTELY come off as a big indicator of an American. Most people in Britain have never actually seen a gun and honestly couldn't care less about the things.

Mockery and Sarcasm - Generally, we're a lot less reverent about things here. If it exists, it's fair game to take the piss out of it. That includes parents, authority, religion, money, guns, and absolutely everything else. There's very little that's sacrosanct here, including ourselves.

Institutional Irony - This is the best way to sound culturally British. Everything here is pomp and circumstance, done ironically. We're not a sincere society. If you want people to stand for the national anthem, make them sigh and roll their eyes at the injustice of having to stand up. That kind of thing.
