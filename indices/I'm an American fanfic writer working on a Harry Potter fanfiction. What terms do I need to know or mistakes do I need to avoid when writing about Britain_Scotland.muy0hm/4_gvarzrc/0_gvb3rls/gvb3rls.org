  Money - (Most) nobody praises the almighty dollar (or pound) or big business or likes de-regulation here. I don't think I've ever actually had or overheard a conversation about taxation. Any fic that features venture capitalism or talks about turning everything into a business ("I'm going to buy St Mungos and run it like a business!") or the like will out you as an American near-immediately. We also don't really have 'small family banks' like America seems to - we pretty much have several big banks (Barclays, HSBC, RBS, etc) and that's about it.

IDK, I feel like Vernon's social circle would be full of these ideas, definitely people who would want deregulation so they could make their drills or whatever else his mates sell for cheaper and sell them for more profit. A big part of the Leave campaign was based around deregulation and they won so it must have some resonance with the public, plus all of Harry's life up to but not including DH would have been under Thatcher or Major and deregulation was a huge part of Thatcherism. Uncle Vernon is definitely a pro business Tory!

I've heard a ton of people discuss tax, but I work in politics so maybe that's skewed my sample of people and what they find interesting!

I feel like there's definitely people out there in Britain who would /want/ to buy hospitals and run them as business but thankfully our system stops that kind of privatisation of existing state assets. It's important to note that private hospitals do exist, as do "private banks" which only work with high value individuals and in all honesty Gringotts even in canon feels more like Coutts than TSB, but given the entire wizarding world banks there we have to assume it's a regular high street type bank.

  Guns - Incessant comparisons of wands to guns, and remarks on how 'Colt made everyone equal' or how great it is that everyone is armed ABSOLUTELY come off as a big indicator of an American. Most people in Britain have never actually seen a gun and honestly couldn't care less about the things.

Agree with most of this, no one would say Colt made us equal and the majority of Brits wouldn't have a clue what that means and we just don't love guns the way America does. But the comparison of wands to guns is canon, the Prophet does it in PoA. Most people in Britain don't have a gun, that's true, but we all know what they are and what they do so it's a legitimate comparison- a wand in the wrong hands is as much a deadly weapon as a gun. Plus don't forget that handguns were only banned in the UK in 1996 so for the majority of the canon timeline guns were more commonplace than they are now- Vernon has one in the first book and that would have been perfectly legal in 1991.
