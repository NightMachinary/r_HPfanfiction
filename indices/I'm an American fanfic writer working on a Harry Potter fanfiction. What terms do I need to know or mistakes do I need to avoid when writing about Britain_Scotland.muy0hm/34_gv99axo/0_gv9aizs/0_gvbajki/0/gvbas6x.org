Pre sentenced prisoners in the UK are, if not bailed, still in prison but it's called being "on remand" and they're held in a different wing to sentenced prisoners.

Also on this, in the UK you cannot pay someone's bail. It's at the discretion of the court, if they say you're bailed you're free to go until your sentencing (often with conditions). If they say no, no amount of money will change their mind.
