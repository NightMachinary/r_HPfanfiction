There are definitely wrong things to write, but getting the right tone and vocabulary for all characters can be very difficult even for British people (especially now, at a 30 year distance from the 90s). Just like there are a ton of different accents across the UK, there are also a ton of different ways of speaking and sets of slang/vocab. Based on location, class, age, ethnicity... A lot of the advice I see on here and elsewhere says "use this term" or "this is what British people say", when in fact it doesn't all apply to everyone, and using some things for the wrong character will sound potentially worse than using an Americanism
