It's not directly related to what people call 'britpicking,' but on a somewhat similar note, there are guides for how to write the various accents and speaking mannerisms seen in Harry Potter. There used to be several automatic translators, but the Fleur and Krum ones are defunct. The 'Hagridizer' can still be searched for and found, but it does a passable job at best.

If you want the rules for how to write that way, [[https://manu86.livejournal.com/25048.html][this link will explain them]]. Most of it is just straightforward replacements, like the Bulgarian/Krum rule of W=V, i.e. /"Ve are looking for vater,"/ or how the French don't understand the letter H and all THs become Zs /"Dear 'Arry, zis is 'ardly ze way to treat a woman trying to 'elp you, non?"/

To be brutally honest, if you just remember that Ginny, the twins, and Ron don't want to get on the bad side of their "mum," then nobody will likely notice anything. You only need to remember a couple of common word usages, and that's all it takes.
