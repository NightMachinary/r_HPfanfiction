Extra credit isn't generally a thing in the UK, but it must be in some way at Hogwarts because hermione gets over 100% in her charms exam in philosophers stone! I've always thought she corrected one of Flitwick's questions.

I think the major difference in how I'd describe extra curricular activities is that in the US, something like choir or orchestra/jazz band is a class that's on the schedule. In the uk, that's an after school (or maybe lunchtime) activity - you're not going to get a grade for it.
