Tbh I think 106% or whatever is the kind of thing a teacher would put as a joke, not as anything seriously calculated. Like yeah, a corrected answer or way too much detail or five examples given when only two were asked for. And since first year tests would have virtually zero impact going forward, it wouldn't matter.

And yes that's a very good way of looking at extra curricular activities, I'd not realised that was a scheduled class in the US. I think our orchestra was at something like 7pm, the funk band was at 4pm, you could do steel drums one lunchtime, choir was likely after school too.. and yeah no grades, but you might get to go on a trip to the local OAP home to play christmas carols.
