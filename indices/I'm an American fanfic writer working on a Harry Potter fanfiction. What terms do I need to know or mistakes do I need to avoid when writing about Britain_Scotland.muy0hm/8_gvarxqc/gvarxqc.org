We don't have midterms, and I think pop quiz is an American phrase. Extra credit just isn't a thing, because until GCSEs (I.e. OWLs) and A levels (NEWTs) there are no standard tests and in my (admittedly state) school you couldn't get held back a year for non pastoral reasons because you don't have to "pass" a year. Rumours of that sure, but didn't happen. We also don't 'graduate' until the end of uni.

I've read some where people are amazed that there are no dances usually, it's just the Yule Ball. That is normal. You might have the occasional disco (very naff) for years 7s and 8s, but a ball or prom for people finishing exams is a new concept and I think probably not in many British schools at all in the 90s. I associate balls with universities.

What muggleborn british kids might expect : way more sports teams (football, tag rugby, rounders, cricket, athletics, netball, gymnastics even rowing given its a posh school). Sports day. An orchestra (not 'band', I still haven't grasped what this is). Choir. French club. Chess club. ^ obviously some of these do exist, it's sport especially that's missing. We had to do PE every week and there were lots of sports teams on top of that.
