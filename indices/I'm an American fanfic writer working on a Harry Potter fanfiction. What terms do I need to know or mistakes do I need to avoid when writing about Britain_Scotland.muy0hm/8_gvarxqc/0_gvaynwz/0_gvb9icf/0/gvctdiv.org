In fairness I'd love to see a really British sports day in a fic. Everyone has to compete in at least two things, there are no real prizes, nobody really cares, and there's a bake sale going on for a charity at the side by some keen group. Someone has organised a stall where you get to throw sponges at a teacher, and there's a choir performance going on at the same time so people keep getting pulled out of lessons to rehearse.
