Ugh sports day.

Although the races where they got the audience involved was always fun.

Like the teachers race, mums race, dads race, toddlers race (for the younger siblings not started school yet)

Other races in sports day would be like the egg and spoon race (eventually replaced with a small potato because of the mess), 3 legged race, sack race (eventually fell out of favour because of too many kids falling over and burst lips/bitten tongues and bloody noses. At my school anyway).

Tug-o-war was always my favourite though
