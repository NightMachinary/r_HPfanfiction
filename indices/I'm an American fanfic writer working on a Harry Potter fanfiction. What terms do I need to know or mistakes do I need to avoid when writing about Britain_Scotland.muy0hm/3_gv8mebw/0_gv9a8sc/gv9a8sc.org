Pants are trousers in parts of Manchester and Lancashire, but generally speaking yes pants are underwear- male underwear usually. Speaking of underwear, Idk what sort of fic OP is writing, but if it involves a sex scene please be aware that adult women in the UK do not call our underwear "panties." "Knickers" is the term for women's underpants over here. "Panties" makes British people cringe so hard we might turn inside out.
