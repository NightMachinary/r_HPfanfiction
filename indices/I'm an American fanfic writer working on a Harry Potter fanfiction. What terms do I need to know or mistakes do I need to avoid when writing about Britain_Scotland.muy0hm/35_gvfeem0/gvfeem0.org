2 things that apply to basically all of Western Europe from what i know at least.

1 Weapons aka Handguns are not common or easily available in Europe and in the Uk most police officers don't carry handguns

2 Whist the Anime craze went through Europe it was not so prevalent as in the Us (at least where I'm from) therefore the false notion that the Katana was indestructible super swords that can cut through everything never was established if you want to give your character a sword use a European one. (Generally Anime and Harry Potter don't mix to well)
