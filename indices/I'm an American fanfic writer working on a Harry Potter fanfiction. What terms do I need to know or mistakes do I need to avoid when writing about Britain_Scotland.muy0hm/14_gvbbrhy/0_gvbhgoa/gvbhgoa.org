Hogsmede is the Scottish version of Diagon Alley surely?

Or, more correctly, Diagon is the English version of Hogsmede, Hogsmede is clearly superior as it's a whole village and Diagon is just one road.

I do see why this peeves you, but also when wizards can be anywhere in a microsecond it doesn't really matter- if you live in Aberdeen it's no bother to you whether you're flooing to somewhere in Edinburgh or somewhere in London- but from a worldbuilding perspective having each big city have their own magical street is interesting and stops the overdone "Diagon Alley and Muggle Oxford Street Shopping Spree" scenes.
