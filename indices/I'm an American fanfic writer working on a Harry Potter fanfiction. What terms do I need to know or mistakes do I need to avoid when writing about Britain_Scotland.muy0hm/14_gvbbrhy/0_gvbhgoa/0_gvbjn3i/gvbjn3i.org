I mean if anything I've always found hogmeade to be like.... it's a place that functions better like a holiday town? Like the shops make most of their profits during the summer and hogmeade weekends but throughout the rest of the year it's more like a trade town? Lots of surrounding farmland and fields of crops and the like.

It partly functions to keep the school functioning too? I mean where else would all the food come from?

For example yeah Edinburgh is the current capital of Scotland but Dundee is Scotland oldest city. Even Dunfermline (now considered a town) used to be the capital of Scotland in centuries past.

St Andrew's is steeped in history and I've been to Falkland Hill and the Town and could totally believe there couldve been magic there in ages past. I mean everyone knows theres Haggis to be found up there. Ben Nevis too.

And have you ever seen a highland cow? Fucking majestic man!

Or look at Loch Ness. There's definitely a magical nature reserve there! How else would the muggles have so many sightings of the "Loch Ness Monster"

And our national animal is literally a Unicorn.

Just sayin'. It clearly stands to reason that theres magic in more places that just London and Hogwarts.
