Haha my dad is from Dunfermline. The Old Town definitely has a magical district, I'd put money on it! That huge palace isn't ruined to magical eyes, they're hiding something from us Muggles for sure. Plus the Glen in the middle of the town has a hidden lookout spot called the Witches Hat- that's clearly a portkey/apparation point.

So Ben Nevis- yeah there's a secret magical route off the main path. And the whole reason muggles aren't allowed to swim in Loch Ness without permission is because the people who run it are squibs who can see when the Loch Ness Monster (the UKs biggest Kelpie) is around or not!

The reason everyone only goes to Diagon, even if they live in Scotland, is because the Ministry is so heavy handed that they regulate where Hogwarts supplies can be found. I see what you mean about Hogsmede yeah, that absolutely makes sense. Scotland is definitely more magical than the books let on, why else would Hogwarts be there and the only remaining fully magical village? It's deffo the Ministry wanting more money into London, just like the Muggle government.
