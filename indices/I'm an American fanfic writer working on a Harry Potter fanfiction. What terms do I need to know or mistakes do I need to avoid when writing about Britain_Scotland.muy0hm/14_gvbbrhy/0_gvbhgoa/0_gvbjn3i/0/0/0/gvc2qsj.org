  To be honest for who wrote the books (a scottish woman on the dole) the books became very Anglo-centric and middle class in my opinion.

Urgh totally. I did a double take when I found out she was Scottish because the books just feel so incredibly English. And Southern English at that. The films as well- the Hogsmede people, Rosemerta especially as we hear the most from her, should have Scots accents.

I also feel like there's this idea pushed through the books that it's good and noble to refuse financial help- like how the Weasleys never get any assistance and Molly is painted as the sort of person that just wouldn't take state benefits because it's "charity." And you'd think for someone who's lived on the breadline JKR would know there's nothing noble nor moral about struggling when help is available- but like you say, it's a middle class attitude and the book is full of them.
