  Witches Hat- that's clearly a portkey/apparation point.

I'm going to need to search that out next time I'm through there. Also Falkland has a place literally called "The Hidden Place" but that palace though..... I love driving past it.

  , even if they live in Scotland, is because the Ministry is so heavy handed that they regulate where Hogwarts supplies can be found

I could totally believe that.

To be honest for who wrote the books (a scottish woman on the dole) the books became very Anglo-centric and middle class in my opinion.

I mean this nothing against the English, just the more fanfiction I read and more plot holes you discover the more you realise how much her world building is.... lacking.

Which is a shame because if she did proper research, world building and the rest of it I have no doubt the world of Harry Potter could've been that on par with say Lord of the Rings.

It could've been rich with it's own history and cultures and languages. I mean Tolkien might not have liked the fact that's what he was likely to be remembered by but he didn't half ass it and you can't say he wasn't dedicated

Harry potter could've been so much More. And I'll admit she did try I guess (side publishing like Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them [the textbook] and Tales of Beedle the Bard) but then you look at fantastic beasts the movies and it just feels.... half arsed.

The less said about Cursed Child the better. I couldn't even finish that it was so bad...
