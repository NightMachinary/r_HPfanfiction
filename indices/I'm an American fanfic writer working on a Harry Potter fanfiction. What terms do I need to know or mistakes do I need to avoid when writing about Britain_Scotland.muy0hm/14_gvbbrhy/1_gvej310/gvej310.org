I could definitely see Hogsmede and Diagon Alley as the only wizarding shopping options.

Two big reasons:\\
Wizarding Britain seems to have a very low population who don't really buy that much, so you don't need a lot of shops.\\
Distance doesn't really matter, you can apparate or floo to Diagon Alley from anywhere and get there faster than any muggle can drive to their local supermarket.
