Also there are two main types of name calling you can tell apart with different mannerisms/tone of voice

1. If you like the person and call them a dickhead "Oi dickhead" they said while laughhing,smiling, grumbling with a playful smirk or in a sing song like voice can be used as a nickname of endearment

2.If you dislike the person "Oi dickhead" they said angrily, with a scowl, snarled would be an insult.
