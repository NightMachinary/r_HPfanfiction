However calling someone an arse or arsehole is in British English still, it's just spelled differently.

Technically a term and a semester aren't quite 1:1 but they're close enough.

Other things for OP:

I read a fanfic recently which was /oh so/ American's-idea-of-britain.

Everyone was obsessed with doctor who and referenced it constantly (we don't do that); everyone was a royalist (we aren't); the prime minister had extreme powers (no, just no); the weather was always wrong, or described with the wrong words (we have 50 words for rain, a drizzle isn't rain!); Snow, like they seem to think all of the UK is plunged into snow for 3 months? We might be further north than most of Canada, but we have the gulf stream. And a lot more besides.
