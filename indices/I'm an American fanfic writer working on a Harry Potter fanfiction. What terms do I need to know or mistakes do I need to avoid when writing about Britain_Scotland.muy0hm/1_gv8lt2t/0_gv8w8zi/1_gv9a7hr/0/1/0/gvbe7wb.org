Obviously not, that person was clearly just an awful antisemite and I'm sorry you experienced that.

When we say "the ruder we are to you the more we like you," it's more like we'll be coldly polite to people we dislike which to other cultures may look like we are being friendly/professional but it's not, it's an insult. And then we give our closest mates horrible nicknames- my best friend calls me "pig hog" and I have another close friend who we both call each other "oi fuckface."

But yeah, insulting someone, especially a stranger, racially in the way that happened to you is not part of that jokingly rude friendly culture. As a nation we have a strange sense of humour but most of us are decent people who know where the line is.
