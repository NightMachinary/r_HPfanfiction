God no! Asshole or arsehole in the UK is a "mild swear"- if you were the parent of teenage boys you probably wouldn't tell them off for calling each other arse/assholes but most parents would go postal if they heard their kids saying cunt.

Conversely, amongst adults in many regions of the North of England and Scotland, and some Londoners, calling your mate a cunt is a term of endearment

Yep, we are weird. Basically the ruder we are to you, the more we like you.
