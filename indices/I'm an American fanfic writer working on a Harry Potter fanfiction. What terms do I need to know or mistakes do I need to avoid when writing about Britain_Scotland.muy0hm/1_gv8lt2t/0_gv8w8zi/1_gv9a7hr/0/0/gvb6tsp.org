But you would never swear in front of your parents. Yes they've heard it all before and know you swear but it's a respect thing.

I'm 27, I have a brother that's 40 and dear lord we would never swear in front of our mum!

Dad on the other hand.... after a drink probably

Also as a kid, you would NEVER get away with sticking the middle finger up without an adult threatening to break it if they saw you doing that again. Or the Vs. Theyd get glued together. (All empty threats of course but you wouldnt dare do again in front of Those adults)
