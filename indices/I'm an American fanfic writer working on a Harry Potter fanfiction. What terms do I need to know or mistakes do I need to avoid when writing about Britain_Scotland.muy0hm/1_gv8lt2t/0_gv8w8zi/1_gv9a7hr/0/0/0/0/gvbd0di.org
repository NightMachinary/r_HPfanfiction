Oh yeah like once you're old enough and mature enough you get to be mum chums but even so.

I think though it was my mum was very proper and she came from a Very catholic family so it was quite ingrained.

I mean we got to the age when we could but we would still get a stern "language!" "Sorry mum."

My dad is a lot laid back but I still remember the first time I swore in front of him he looked so affronted! Looking back I'm pretty sure he was taking the piss ðŸ˜‚
