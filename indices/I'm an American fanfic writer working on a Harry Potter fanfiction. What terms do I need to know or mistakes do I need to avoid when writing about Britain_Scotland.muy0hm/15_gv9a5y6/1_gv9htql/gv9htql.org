Biscuits are basically softer, buttery, and flakey scones. The gravy used in biscuits and gravy is made up of sausage, pan drippings, milk, and flour, all of which was more or less affordable. Biscuits and gravy was a meal for the poor working class that was often made out of the fat from when you cooked sausage along with the other stuff, which was all somewhat affordable. It's become a staple food in the US.
