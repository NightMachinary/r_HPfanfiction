Cookies do still exist, though! They're a particular type of baked goods. Think chocolate chip cookie - anything of that kind of consistency is still a cookie, but it's also a biscuit. You could absolutely offer someone a biccie and have it be a small cookie, but you can't offer someone a cookie and have it be a rich tea biscuit or chocolate digestive.

And gravy is brown. I have no idea what the US, white gravy is made of or like, but gravy in the UK is brown and historically made from the juices leftover from cooking meat (although it's usually just cubes or powdered stuff nowadays). Biscuits with gravy is such a fucking weird concept when you consider the British versions of each.

Oh nooo, why does white gravy have milk in it? Oh god that sounds horrific.
