Yeah, that's gravy anywhere outside of the southern US: sausage gravy horrified me the first time I saw it too (I'm Canadian).

The biscuits sold with the revolting white gravy are... basically a croissant with a more bread-like consistency. Still flakey, still buttery.... but more bread. I guess? They shouldn't be dry, but the bad ones often are.

And for the record, I'm fairly sure that the majority of people here in North America have no idea what the fuck a scone is. I read the word, I smile and nod and think 'tea snack' and carry on. I assume it's something like an Italian biscotti, but honestly I have no idea.

Re: milk in gravy - /If/ you're being a cheapskate and/or don't have sufficient drippings to make gravy the correct way, a bit of milk can help mellow the flavour from bullion if you happen to fuck up the measurements, same as adding butter. It's not something I do often, but it's a decent fix-it tool to have.
