Homemade breakfast biscuits and gravy is one of my faves, so maybe I can explain the creamy gravy.

The gravy is made from pan leavings of ground sausage, which is less "juices" and more oil. So I add flour to brown in the oil and use equal parts beef broth and cream for the liquid. Almost like a bechamel. Season to taste and throw half the sausage back in so all the flavors meld. Save the other half to top the dish or use in another dish later like maybe pizza topping.

When we make gravy for a roast, that's usually cooking down the juices and using something like a cornstarch slurry for a thickener if needed.
