Here's what you do... all the words for things you know? NONE OF THAT WORKS. Islanders (as I call them) just make up random nonsense words for literally everything. Just make shit up and we'll believe you. The only people who will call you on it live in the UK anyway. :)

- Sweater = jumper
- Pants = expletive (used like shit! or fuck!)
- Pants = can also somehow mean underwear
- Chips = fries
- Pudding = any number of absurd things, none of which are actually pudding
- Bloke = guy (think dude, but with less DUDE)
- Bint = rude slang for (typically/always?) a woman
- Pikey = Brad Pitt

You should be GTG with that list.

CHEERS! (which means like seven things also)
