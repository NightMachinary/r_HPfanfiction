Sweater refers to a style of jumper, so we still use "sweater". A knitted jumper (a la Weasley) isn't a sweater though.

Pants isn't used like "fuck", it's used like shit, more often as "that thing is pants"

Pants never means trousers, but it does refer to men's "Y-fronts" (knickers, boxers, or undies for other terms). It's not generic.

Chips are different to fries; we also have fries, but fries are skinny and thin, chips are thicker cut. Most people have chips except at fast food places.

Pudding is just dessert. What Americans call pudding we don't have in the UK. We also have a dessert cooking style called "pudding" (e.g. Christmas pudding or spotted dick) which is where a kind of cake that was traditionally steamed in a ball.

Bloke usually refers to a white-van-man type man, it's not generic. Not all men are blokes.

Bint isn't used a lot, and always refers to women but can vary in intensity from "old" to "slag" to "cunt" depending on context.

Pikey is a slur referring to travellers. Don't use it.
