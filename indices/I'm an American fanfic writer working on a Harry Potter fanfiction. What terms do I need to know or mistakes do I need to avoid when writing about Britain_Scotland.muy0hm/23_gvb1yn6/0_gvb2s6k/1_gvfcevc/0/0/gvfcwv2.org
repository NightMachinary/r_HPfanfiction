Granted yeah. All muggles have one so likely muggleborn/muggle raised would definitely have them.

Harry would definitely have one and Hermione. Ron would be won over by the convenience of it.

I dont think Molly would ever have one. I dont think the burrow has electricity and even if it did it would probably be safer away from Arthur.

I doubt many purebloods would have them either I guess.....
