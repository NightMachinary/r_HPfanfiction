OoF another thing but our houses are quite small, google British streets. Surrey (where the dursleys live) is expensive afff, it would have been expensive round the 90s too bc surrey is basically the rich ppl part of England lol. Not rly important but like Scotland has big big mountains and it's cold as shIT. Wales has more hills, not full on mountains but it's so fucking hilly, you genuinely get so tired so quick bc EVRYWHERE is hilly,, not much flat land. England is pretty flat but depends where you go, it varies a bit. (This is all based on places I've been though so if someone wants to correct me go ahead)
