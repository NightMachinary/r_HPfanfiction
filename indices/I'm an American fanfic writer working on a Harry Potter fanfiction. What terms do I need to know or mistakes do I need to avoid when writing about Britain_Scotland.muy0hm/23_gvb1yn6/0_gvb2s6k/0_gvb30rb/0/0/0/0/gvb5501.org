Some mORE, not every school has a sixth form (mine didn't) so yeah you basically go to a different school (college) from 16-18 and then a different school for university. Education is free till 18 but then you have to pay for uni. We ALL wear school uniforms till 18 (you can google some) we don't say GYM it's called PE (physical education) we say gym for like,,, an actual gym but PE is the class name, we have PE kits which is our uniform for pe, usually it's like a regular shirt with the schools badge on it and whatever jogging bottoms, some stricter schools will require you put the school badge on the trousers. This stuff only matters if you write about like Harry or whoever going to primary school though. We also don't do group projects really, we don't have shit like “this project goes towards 40% of your grade” that's not rly how it works here,,,, but you do have free reign there with Hogwarts bc hogwarts isn't really gonna be like regular English school... another kinda dumb thing but bullying is kinda different here looollll what I know abt America is like from TV but it's not like that,, someone won't steal your lunch money bc we don't rly have lunch money in primary, you either get a hot lunch form the dinner ladies which is all pre paid or u bring a packed lunch (your own food) uhhh we don't have lockers so,, no getting shoved in one lol.
