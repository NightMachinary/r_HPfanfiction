Our school system! You go to reception (kindergarten) then year 1 to year 6 is primary school, Secondary school is year 7- year 11, you start secondary at age 11, finish at 16 bUt at hogwarts They have Sixth form which is year 12-13 but no one calls it that they just say College/ sixth form. Sixth form is when you stay at your secondary school, college is when you go to a different school directed at 16-18 year olds and do A-levels (NEWTS) you take GCSEs (OWLS) in year 11. (This is all muggle stuff but it could be useful) also at the end of school like when you leave everyone signs ur school t shirts and that.
