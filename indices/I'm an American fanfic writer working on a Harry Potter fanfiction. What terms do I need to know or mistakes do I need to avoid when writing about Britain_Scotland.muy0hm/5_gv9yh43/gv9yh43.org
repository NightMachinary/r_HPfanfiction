Corsages aren't a thing in Britain, so if you do a Yule Ball scene don't put one in.

Minor thing I noticed: swear words get used different amounts here, so "fuck" is used for much more severe things and the more common ones are "bloody", "bastard" or sometimes "shit". Like if you stub your toe you use one of the latter and you generaly only use "fuck" while incredibly angry.

Personally I don't mind this too much, but some words, such as "colour", they have a u in them.
