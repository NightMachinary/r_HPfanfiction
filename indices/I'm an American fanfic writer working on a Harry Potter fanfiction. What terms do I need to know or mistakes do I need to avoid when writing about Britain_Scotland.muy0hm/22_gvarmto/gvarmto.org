Honestly, I don't care or even notice since I'm not a native English speaker. I'm pretty sure most of the fandom is the same. If you want to go for accuracy then that's great but other than British people scoffing at you for some tiny cultural mistakes, you'll be fine. It's fanfiction, YOUR fanfiction so the creative freedom is yours. You can have harry eating pancakes for breakfast, it's fine.
