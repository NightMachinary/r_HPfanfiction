Even thought they used the Anglo-American system in the middle ages, I'm sure there will be adaption and evolution in the Wizarding world as much as in the Muggle world. Only makes sense. And I think we have lots of indications for that. For example the plumbing system in Hogwarts. Up until 1840, indoor plumbing systems only existed in rich people's homes. Or the modern kerosine oil lamp, invented 1853. Or even the chimneys in the castle. domestic chimneys first appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. But Hogwarts was founded around a thousand years ago. So we can surely assume that things changed in the Wizarding world also. In my opinion the metric system is canon for a fanfic in most cases (except those who are written from founders time perspective), as the metric system is the state of art in great Britain and Europe for quite some time now.
