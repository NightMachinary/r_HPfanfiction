British secondary schooling begins at 11. You leave age 18 or just before your 18th. The school year usually begins at the start of September (my school begins September 3rd, but hogwarts begins September 1st.) we have breaks at the end of half terms called, as said before, half term. Our first one is a week in October, although Hogwarts doesn't seem to have October half term. We break for Christmas around December 18th-december 21st, and come back to school around January 4th-January 7th. There is another half term in February consisting of 2 weeks, although hogwarts seemingly doesn't have that, or at least its not written in the books. Then another two weeks around Easter, a week off in May and then usually break for summer around the middle of July. You may want to write the summer holidays longer for hogwarts, as they seemingly do not have all the half terms.

We have days off according to certain bank holidays. For instance, I have today off. You may want to look up British Bank Holidays.

We do not put cream into tea. It's milk (we have types of milk too! Green cap is semi skinned, red cap is skinned and blue cap is full fat. Dunno if that matters to you lol) milk and sugar or perhaps no milk but instead lemon and sugar or lemon in ho ey in certain Earl greys. Tea is very important to British culture. Younger kids don't generally drink coffee. I hate coffee, but my siblings only really started drinking it at 14.

School days are usually made of five periods, six if you have an after school booster/study session or club. Periods consist of one hours lessons. For instance, my 6th form education (exams equivalent to hogwarts newts, which you start age 16/17 and finish age 17/18) we have a tutor period from half 8 to 9, lessons begin at 9. First period ends at 10, then there's a five minute movement bell to get to your next class, which begins at 10:05. 2nd period ends at 11:05, then a 20 minute break. Third period ends at 12:25, then an hour lunch, then fourth and fifth period until the day ends at 3:30. I have clubs or study period after school sometimes.

We call 'pants' trousers.

When we ask to got to the bathroom, we generally say "Can I go to the toilets?" or "miss can I go to the loo?" (and then turn to our friends saying I'm just going to pop to the loos, be back in a min or so)

We usually say mum. Some accents/dialects say mom, such as Birmingham. Some may say mam or ma. mother if you're from a posh or well spoken area.

'hot cocoa' is called hot chocolate.

Detentions usually occur at lunch or after school. It's not really a thing to have Saturday detentions unless you've not attended the detentions set in the week and or truanced.

Skipping lesson is what we call bunking. Teachers will call it truancy lol

British food!! Here's a list of food my family typically eat for dinner (please look them up so you know what they are) : Shephards pie, roast dinner, cottage pie, sausage and mash, spaghetti bolagnese, vegetable pasta, fajitas, casserole, stew, fish and chips etc etc

What you call 'pudding' is what we would call mousse. 'pudding' for us refers to things like treacle tart, sticky toffe pudding, jam roly poly etc. We love Victoria sponge cake. Absolute British delicacy. So are custard cream slices.

There's a bit of competition, I would say, between the North and south lol.

We hate our prime ministers most of the time. Would be nice to see that mockery within wizarding culture. We call Boris Johnson BoJo, dickhead, twat etc etc

List of British insults: Dick, dickhead, twat, twatface, piece of shit, little shit, bitch, slag, slapper, prozzie, cunt, cuntface etc etc

Honestly, one of the things I find weird in Harry potter is the constant use of last names. Maybe it's because the wizarding world is more formal, but our teachers all call us our first names. One of my favourite teachers used to call me Rossi, because my last name is Ross, but it was like an affectionate thing. Friend sobvs call each other by first names. Hell, even the people I despised with all my being I called them by their first names.

All in all, just please check the spelling of words and use the British versions. :)
