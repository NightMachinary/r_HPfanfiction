It's actually my biggest issue with the canon books that Rowling clearly loves the Halloween aesthetic so makes a big deal of it - the idea that a village square in 1981 would be packed with kids in costumes trick or treating and shops would have decorated for Halloween pisses me off every time I read it. In the 80s you would be lucky to see a pumpkin in a window.
