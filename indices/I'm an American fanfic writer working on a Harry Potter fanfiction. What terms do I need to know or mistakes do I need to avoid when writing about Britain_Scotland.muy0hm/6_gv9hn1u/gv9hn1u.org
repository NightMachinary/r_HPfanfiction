Halloween. I've seen this in a few stories I've read recently with pumpkin picking, pumpkin carving, visiting the farm, etc.

People in the UK don't go to pumpkin patches and pick pumpkins or really trick or treat. This may have changed from when I lived there but what I remember was pub crawls in costume and that's about it.
