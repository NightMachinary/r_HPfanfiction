In scotland where I grew up (dont know about anywhere else) we would carve a pumpkin and leave it outside and those were the houses that you could call on. Ones without you leave alone.

Also we would go trick or treating but we called it Guising.

I remember one kid who went out with 2 masks and 2 different hoodies. He would do a circuit of the street with one mask/hoodie then a second circuit wearing the other mask and hoodie and got double the amount of sweets. Genius.
