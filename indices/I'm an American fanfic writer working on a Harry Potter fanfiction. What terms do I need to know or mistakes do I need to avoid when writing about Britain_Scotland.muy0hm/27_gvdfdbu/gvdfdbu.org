I've seen lots of good suggestions here, but one that I see occasionally that I always notice: "little league" is not a term here! You wouldn't have little league quidditch - maybe under 11 quidditch or something along those lines.

For the most part, though, britpicking details don't really bother me. Sometimes it's fun to try and spot something that shows the author isn't from the uk, but some of my absolute favourite pieces of fanfiction have some pretty obvious ones in without it being too distracting. The quality of the story and how it's told are always going to be most important.
