im not talking about a fic where harry is in love and that gets him motivated or there is some ritual where he bonds or something that gives him power. I'm talking about where harry being in love hurts voldemort like [[/spoiler][in the forgotten contract where harry has sex with susan and realizes that he loves her it gets rid of the horcrux and hurts voldemort.]] .
