Why is her last name Black? Why would Regulus care to tell a muggle his last name if it was just a one night stand? And why would the mother give Darcey the last name of a man who is, for all intents and purposes, a deadbeat who had no part in raising her? Why would the adoptive family keep the last name Black?

That's impossible. From the Order of the Phoenix, "Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name 'Regulus Black.' A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth." If we ignore the Black family tapestry Rowling made, and go on information in the books, Regulus could have died (depending on his date of birth) anywhere from late 1979 to late 1980. This would mean that Darcey's conception would be, at its earliest, still be over a year after the twins were born (April 1, 1978). She would either be in Harry's year or Ginny's. As such, she would not attend with Tonks.
