I wouldn't use Gringgots as a inheritance test, it's fanon quite a bit of people hate it.

Is Darcy known as a Black important to the story? What happened if until the story ends she (and everyone else) the doesn't know about her heritage?

If it is important, I'd rather make another subplot rather than using gringgots. Maybe make her questioning her parentage since she's a child, but she never found any leads. Until Sirius saw that Regulus had a child in the black tapestry. Or make her question her adoptive parents to find her biological mother.
