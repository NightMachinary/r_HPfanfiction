I like to think Harry kept it, just because imo it's just so cool. I think it's neat if Harry can still speak to snakes.

I could make up some canon justification, but that's what it ultimately boils down to.

  It is strongly hinted that upon the horcrux's end in the Deathly Hallows that Harry lost the ability to understand Parsletongue.

Where is this? IIRC Voldemort's horcrux is the reason Harry can talk to snakes, but nothing else is really said.
