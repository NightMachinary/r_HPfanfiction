The diary horcrux was clearly capable of imparting the ability, otherwise Ginny would not have been able to open the Chamber of Secrets. While I think Ginny retaining the ability would be an interesting angle for a fanfiction, such a situation doesn't seem remotely canon-compliant. Thus once the horcrux was removed from Harry, I assume he lost the ability.

I also think Harry having it by bloodline is pretty far-fetched. Lily was muggle-born and James wasn't even hinted to have it, aside from it being heavily counter to his character. Even if the Potter bloodline is old and well-connected, the family's stance on blood purity would keep them from being a match for any of Slytherin's line.

Obviously it isn't impossible, but I think Harry being a Parselmouth post Deathly Hallows is extremely unintuitive.
