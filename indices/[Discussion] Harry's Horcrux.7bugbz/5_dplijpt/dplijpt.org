I think more important is the question of the nature of parsletongue, a blood magical trait. I think that the theory of magical resonnance by Horcrux is invalid. I think that Harry has the ability because he is very far related to Salasar Slytherin from his father side. Potters must have been of the Most Noble and Ancient House to have been married to Dorea Black. Futhermore, the Potters are descendant of Ignotus Peverell amd the Guant from Cadmus Peverell side, the Peverells related to Salasar Slytherin.
