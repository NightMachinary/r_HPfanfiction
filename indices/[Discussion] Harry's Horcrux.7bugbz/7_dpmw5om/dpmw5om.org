Him just loosing the trait seems ridiculous to me. Why would he be able to do that, but not retain /anything/ else of Voldemorts abilities or knowledge from the scar?

To me, you're going to have to either decide that the ability somehow got /transferred/ to Harry so he /keeps/ it, or he shouldn't have it in the first place. The idea that he looses it with the scar but the existence of the scar has literally no other real-world consequences for Harry just seems contrived to me.
