I haven't read /His Dark Materials/, but I suppose the crux of it is in the mechanics of being a Parselmouth. If it acts as a permanent, two-ways "translation spell" it makes sense he'd lose it because it would truly be a magical ability. However, I always took it as being magically innate, but in-and-on-its-own not supernatural, /knowledge/ of the language.
