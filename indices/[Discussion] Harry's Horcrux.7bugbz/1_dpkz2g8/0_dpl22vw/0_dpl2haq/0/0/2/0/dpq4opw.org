True. It /is/ all in the mechanics of how Parseltongue works. It could be anything from a two-way translation spell, to my usual interpretation that knowledge of the language is automatically etched into the Parselmouth's brain, as it were, and they develop a sort of "blind spot" comparable to a Confundus Charm that prevents them from noticing they've switched languages unless they actually focus on it.
