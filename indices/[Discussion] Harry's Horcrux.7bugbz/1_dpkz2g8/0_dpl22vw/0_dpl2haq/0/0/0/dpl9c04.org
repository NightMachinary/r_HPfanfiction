He doesn't really speak with snakes though, I mean there is the dialogue with the Boa in PS, a few times he hears "rip... Tear... Kill..." In CoS (and 'open', 'speak to me,...') then I think nothing until the bits in HBP, and the few words with Bathilda-Snake.

I spoke /way/ more french, but I forgot most of it.
