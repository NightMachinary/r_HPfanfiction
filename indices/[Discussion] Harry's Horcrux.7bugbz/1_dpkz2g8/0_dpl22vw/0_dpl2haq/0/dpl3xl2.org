  Properly speaking, it is canon --- just a bit of canon some people choose to disregard.

Most of it is not written by JKR, and it really shows. Maybe I can accept is as 'extended universe', but as long as Rowling is alive what she writes counts more for me than something she 'approved', but that is personal preference of course.

  What do you make of my argument for why the practical aspects of how it works would suggest otherwise?
#+end_quote

Practically speaking, soul-magic seems to be a rather complicated thing, even in canon.

And sure, there are arguments like yours that it 'bled over' because there was no pain, but that is a dangerous assumption to make. If parseltongue can bleed over, can the secret of a Fidelus-charm bleed over? Where is the line?

The scar only ever hurt Harry when connecting to the "main" Voldemort, when there was a 'remote'-connection, and never simply from itself. So I assume the pain only really comes from the maindevort, and not from the part in Harry's body. Alternatively, maybe speaking with snakes indeed irritated him a little, but it was little compared to the constant /presence/ of Voldemort that he had for years and years.

I think this topic is a bit too complex to conclude it in either way without making huge assumptions about the magical system in Harry Potter.

I personally like to think that Harry was never a real, proper "Horcrux", but he had a soul-fragment of Voldemort inside him. It was not properly prepared, and implemented into the body of a growing boy. Harry's body and mind 'connected' in small parts with Voldemort's soul, in similar ways that it connected with Harry's, but since the fragment was so much smaller and not the original thing it had very limitedbody impact - only really the ability for parseltongue and the connection to Voldemort were really there.

  if I understand correctly, you're making the argument that it's more symbolically satisfying in your view, yes
#+end_quote

Yes

That has never stopped Rowling either :>

But for the tl;dr of my answer above: There are not enough information in canon to really strongly suggest either way, so I chose the symbolically more satisfying way.
