It is indeed a retcon, but while I understand why some people want to ignore it, that makes it Fanon Discontinuity. Properly speaking, it /is/ canon --- just a bit of canon some people choose to disregard.

As for your reasons for preferring a version where Harry lost it... if I understand correctly, you're making the argument that it's more /symbolically/ satisfying in your view, yes? What do you make of my argument for why the practical aspects of how it works would suggest otherwise?
