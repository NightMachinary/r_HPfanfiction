Cursed Child is not canon for many readers, including me.

It also even goes against "Word of God" when JKR said it he couldn't do it anymore ([[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/27616][link]]) "and is very glad to do so".

So at best that is retconned. I personally think that he lost the ability - Voldemort had marked Harry so thoroughly by the end, that no magical abilities or even physical scars were needed anymore.
