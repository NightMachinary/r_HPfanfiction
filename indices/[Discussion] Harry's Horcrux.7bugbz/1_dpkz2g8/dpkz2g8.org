/Cursed Child/ says unambiguously he kept the ability, and I don't like to go against canon, even when canon's a bit naff. Either way, it does seem to make sense for me that he'd retain it --- unlike Ginny who could only "speak" it because Diarymort was actively possessing her, Harry seems to be able to speak Parseltongue on his own volition, without /active/ interference from Scardemort himself; note how Harry gets no pain in his scar from speaking Parseltongue. I'd say the knowledge of Parseltongue "bled" into Harry's mind from Scardemort's, and the soul shard's ejection from Harry's scar and into limbo did nothing to erase what was already done.
