There are at least two long fics where parseltongue is the focus of the story, one where it's used for parselmagic (Snape goes back in time iirc, which interested me, but then all this healing magic took over) and one in which he rescues a poorly basilisk for lulz and mayhem.

I don't recall seeing one where a baby basilisk is used as a handy portable weapon, which is a shame. I suppose because a one-shot kill breaks a lot of plot tension. (There are plenty of fics where Harry decides to go on a murder spree).
