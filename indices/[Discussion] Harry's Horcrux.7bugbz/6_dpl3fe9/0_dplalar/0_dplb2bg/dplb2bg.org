No. It's a common issue that plagues the fandom. Harry gets so many arbitrary power boosts that don't actually add to the story. Like, Harry is a metamorphmagus just so he can change his hair color, then never use it, or Harry becomes an animagus, just because the author things it's cool, or Harry gets some crazy custom wand with a dual core of basilisk and dementor blood, but precedes to do nothing special with it anyways.
