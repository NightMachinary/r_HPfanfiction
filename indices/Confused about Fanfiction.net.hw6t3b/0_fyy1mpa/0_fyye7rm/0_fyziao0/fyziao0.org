Agreed. Not only do you have to deal with multiple different versions of the same tag, there are the authors that seem to want to post their entire fic in the Tags section. Just tag the major/important/central characters, not everybody that gets even a passing mention! If I have to scroll just to get from the title to the summary, I'm going to keep on scrolling.
