I avoid a03 for that reason -- the tags are unbearable. I find it much much easier to search things on ffnet. Or ask people here. The only times I've found something on ao3 worth reading were when someone here recommended it to me. I'll also get an average of ca. 500 followers on ffnet on my stories, while the searching and tagging algorithm on ao3 makes things so complicated that I'm lucky if I get three comments per chapter.
