Honestly, AO3's tagging system is a bit garbage too. You can't reliably sort out m/m without filtering out every single pairing individually. Half the time the tags are basically unique to that specific story or a full sentence.

FF.net has too little tagging, and AO3 has too much.

For searching FF try DLP's Scryer. You can search summaries for keywords to filter in or out.
