With the plethora of tags in AO3, it is a real pain to filter out specific content stories. I try to avoid romance stories, on FFN, I select the No Romance tag, and that is it. On AO3, a lot of the writers do not use the romance tag, so I have to go through and filter out the different relationships, click search, filter out even more relationships, click search, filter out even more relationships, until finally I get a list of stories with no romantic overtones.
