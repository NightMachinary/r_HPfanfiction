Aight, first, [[/u/Psantium]]? You're knocking this Wiki out of the goddamn park.

So, my favorite crossover is linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao). This is a Harry Potter/The Mummy (1999 movie) crossover, centered on Bill Weasly It's short, and still incomplete, but damn near every word in it is perfectly placed. The prose is amazing. The worldbuilding is damn good. The magic is wonderful. Go read this, and hopefully Zenzao will get more words of it out.

Fun fact: I always have to look up the name of this fic, because I spell Hamunaptra as Harmunaptra and I know that isn't right, but my brain can never recall the correct spelling.
