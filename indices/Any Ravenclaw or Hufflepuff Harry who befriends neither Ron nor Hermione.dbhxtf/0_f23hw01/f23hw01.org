linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Ravenclaw Harry in a universe where Nevile is the BWL and Harry's parents end up at St. Mungos. While a lot of the same stuff from canon occurs, it isn't depicted in the work so much as Harry isn't apart of the Golden Trio. Instead it focuses on Harry's efforts of becoming a master at transfiguration (Plus wizarding war stuff later on). Well written, dark, complete.
