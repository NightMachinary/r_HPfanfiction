Well you can see a bunch of different variations in [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/dimensional-shift-hp-private-sneak-peek/][Dimensional Shift]].

He spends only an hour in each dimension before skipping to the next. He's searching for one with specific criteria - a spell automatically moves him on. It's listed as slash, but is currently unfinished and has not reached a point where anything has happened yet, if you don't want to read that.

But, for variations, hard to beat: worlds where Harry died at one, where he died at 12, where Voldemort has taken the Ministry, where he's part of the resistance, where the Dark Lord is Grindlewald, where Harry has younger siblings, where only his mother is dead... lots of variations.
