Dimensional travels are plenty, time travels are plenty, but dimensional time travel is extremely rare. The only one I can think of is "Para Bellum", linkffn(9754483), the incomplete sequel to "Delenda Est". In that story, canon Harry and Ginny were attacked on Hogwarts Express by 2 Voldemorts, fortunately, they were saved by the daughters of Harry and Bellatrix from the other dimension.
