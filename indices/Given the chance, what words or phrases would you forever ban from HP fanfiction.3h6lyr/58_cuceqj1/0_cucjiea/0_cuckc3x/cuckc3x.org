Yes, quite.

In the United States, the word existed and was in use in the 19th century, and might have even earlier than that.

In Europe however, including Great Britain, it is very much a 20th century thing, and more late 20th century than early 20th.

So that some people in the eighties and nineties would use it in Great Britain? Sure, I'm not saying nobody would. But characters in the Harry Potter series, who are either living in an insular society, are Dursleys with their own dursleyish approach to anything, or don't really interact with any youths who could have learned to use that word ... yeah, no way.
