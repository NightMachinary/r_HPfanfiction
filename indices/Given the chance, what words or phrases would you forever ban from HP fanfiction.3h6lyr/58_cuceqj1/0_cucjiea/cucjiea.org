I agree that it's jarring to see certain characters use words like okay and other slang (I'd add Snape to that list, he is usually rather formal) because it doesn't match their speech patterns as Rowling has written them.

Having grown up in the eighties and nineties, though, I certainly don't agree that "okay" or "OK" were less prevalent then! OK is very old slang and, although it doesn't look quite right in Harry Potter, in my real-life experience 70-year-old people are just as likely to use it as younger. Maybe that's more of an American vs. British thing, though?
