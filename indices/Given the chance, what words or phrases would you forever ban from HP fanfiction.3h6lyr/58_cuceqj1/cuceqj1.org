“Okay”, “OK”, and other stuff of this sort.

I mean, sure, they are popular nowadays. But they weren't in the nineties, and especially not in a society as insular as the wizarding one. I can accept it when used occasionally in humorous stories because it's easy to ignore when you are laughing so hard that your neighbours can't sleep, but when it's a seemingly serious story and half the replies have slang words out of their time, sorry but just no.

Gets more annoying when you see older characters using this travesty of a reply. Because seeing Tom Riddle or Minerva McGonagall use that ... yeah, that's bad.
