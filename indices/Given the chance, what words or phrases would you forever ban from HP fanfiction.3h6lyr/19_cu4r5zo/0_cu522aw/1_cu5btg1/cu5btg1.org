However, despite the intense crying Harry Potter fans do over Americanisms, they /can/ be easily acceptable. I use sweets more than I do candy, but both words are in my vocabulary. Harry wasn't /that/ abused. He knows what TV is and it's likely a lot of it was US shows that crossed the pond. He and other Muggle-borns (more-so than wizarding families but even they'd have some) would know some Americanisms.
