You're reading some pretty awful fanfiction then. But regardless, /anything/ used constantly is annoying as hell. I figured this thread would be more about the dumber things like anything to do with m-preg or magically binding wedding stories. Instead it's just a bunch of people complaining about slang. Guess I should have expected it from the Potter community.
