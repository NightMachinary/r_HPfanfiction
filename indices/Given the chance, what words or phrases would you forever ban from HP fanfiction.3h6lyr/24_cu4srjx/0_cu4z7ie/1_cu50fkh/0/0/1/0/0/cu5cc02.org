You claimed that if the language wasn't in the book, it shouldn't be in fanfiction. You're telling me that /no-one/ in the British Isles, especially with how backwards the Wizarding culture is, uses older words or phrases, whether ironically or seriously? Come the hell on. One of Dumbledore's most remembered quotes is "Alas, earwax." When was the last time /you/ heard someone say alas with all seriousness? You forget that wizards and witches live a /long/ time. A number of characters in the books were born before 1900.
