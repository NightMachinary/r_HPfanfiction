Ugh, yes so annoying. I once read a fic where Petunia was refusing to take Harry to hospital because doctors were expensive and she didn't want to waste money. I left a review mentioning that we have the NHS in the UK so don't pay for healthcare at the point of access. The response? 'oh well in my fic you do have to pay.' Oh ok, thank you for relocating the Dursleys to America.
