Heh, I once did the same for “God” (case-sensitive) to “Shabranigdu”, which I only used when some author laid on capitalising this particular bit a bit too often. Because when it's already throwing you out of it due to the religious undertones that happen to have no right to be there (when they are justified I don't mind the capitalisation, though), changing it like that will at least make it humorous.

That it sometimes resulted in instances of “Shabranigdufather” and “Shabranigduson” ... well, I regret nothing.
