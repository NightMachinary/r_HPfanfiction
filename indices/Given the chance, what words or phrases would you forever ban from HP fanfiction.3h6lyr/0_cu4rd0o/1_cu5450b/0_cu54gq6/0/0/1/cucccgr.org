Yeah, pretty much that. I don't have anything against the nickname in particular, but most authors who do use “Mione” do it without any care that it is just Hagrid-speak of someone who is eating and talking at the same time and that he really is saying “Hermione” but the “Her-” part, already less audible than the rest, is simply lost in transit. And this means that most authors who do use it do unspeakable things to canon, to the point where it often is cringe-worthy to read.

So yeah, nothing against the nickname as it is, it is a possibility, however low, for some character to start calling her that way. But it's a red flag, the same way “should of” is (which exists because some people took “should 'ave” which is also Hagrid-speak and then decided that clearly “'ave” is the same as “of” because eff research of something); seeing it is a really bad sign for the likelihood of the story being good.
