/shrugs/ I still think that's okay. The point of fanfiction isn't to stick like glue to the Canon, it's to play a little. That can be with big things like AU stories or "What if?" ones, or it can be with the little things, like Ron using that as a more full nickname. Whether or not Hermione has issues with it is up to the author.
