I prefer Hermione Jane as a bit of a protest to how her character changed after the fifth book. Like in the description of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Anyone-But-Ron-HHr-and-DHr-and-Mionecentric-stories-no-RHr/42177/99/4/1/0/20/2/0/][this amazing community]], I see it as an amusing little protest.
