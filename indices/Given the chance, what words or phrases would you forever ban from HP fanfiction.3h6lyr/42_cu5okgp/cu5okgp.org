I can forgive a lot of things, but I can't forgive writing wherein Voldemort or any of his Death Eaters say anything is "cool" unless referring to temperature. Also, for them, people aren't likely to have "stuff," they will have belongings, things, or issues. They will also not exclaim, "Yay!" unless they're voting for something (and that's "yea," anyway). It's really nit-picky, but I just can't even.
