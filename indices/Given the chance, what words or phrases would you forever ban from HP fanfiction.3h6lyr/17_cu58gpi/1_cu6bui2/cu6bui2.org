On the bright side, you pretty much know a fanfic is going to be awful via the summary or the title.

Also, this one always gives me hives:

"In 1981, on Hallowe'en night, young Hadrian Potter's parents are killed... by Albus Dumbledore. He then is sent to live with the filth that share his blood. In 1991, on September first, Hadrian travels to Hogwarts after receiving his letter, but what Dumbledore wasn't expecting was for their "hero" born from the dark, to survive his childhood. Now, Albus Dumbledore has to deal with the monster of his own creation, Hadrian James Potter. But when trials appear in his path, Hadrian must quickly decide what to do, and whether to be a King, or a Pawn."
