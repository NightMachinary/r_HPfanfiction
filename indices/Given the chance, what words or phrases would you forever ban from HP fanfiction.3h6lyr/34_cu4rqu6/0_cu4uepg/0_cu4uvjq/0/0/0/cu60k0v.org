I like the idea that wizard are conduits essentially, pulling limited amounts of magic from a source. I connect this to the idea that the conduit functions like a muscle: it can grow by being exercised, stressed and gradually pushed beyond it's limits. Magical power can also be enhanced not be 'growing it' but by using it more efficiently, which depends on skill, study, refined control. Could a wizard with precise control cast a standard reducto but concentrate it's force into the area the size of pencil eraser?
