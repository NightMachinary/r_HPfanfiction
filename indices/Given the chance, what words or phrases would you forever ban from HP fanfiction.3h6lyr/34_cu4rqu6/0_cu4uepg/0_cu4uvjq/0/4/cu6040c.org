Something about summoning was never clear to me. Does it only pull things towards the summoner in a direct line? Or does the summoned object naturally work it's way around obstacles? Harry's broom was not in his direct line of site, so it must have dodged around walls, etc. But did he leave the brook out in preparation, or was it up in his dorm? Did it break through a window to get out?
