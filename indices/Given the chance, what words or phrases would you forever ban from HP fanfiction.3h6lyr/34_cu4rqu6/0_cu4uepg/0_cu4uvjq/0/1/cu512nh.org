I would argue that some are more talented and powerful from birth than others, whether it's because these people are more inherently powerful or not, I can't say. But you can't seriously argue that someone like Tom Riddle wasn't always going to be an extremely powerful wizard, though I guess it could be ascribed to a combition of his personality and intelligence. So perhaps you are right, perhaps it mostly depends on personality, intelligence and experiences among other factors, that truly set wizards like Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Riddle apart from from the rest.
