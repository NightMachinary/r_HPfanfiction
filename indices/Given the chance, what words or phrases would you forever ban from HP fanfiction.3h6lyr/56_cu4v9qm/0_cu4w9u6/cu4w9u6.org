In fairness, I'm British and I use the words snog and mate an awful lot - although my younger sisters regard it as a bit old fashioned and lame. Certainly during the 90s and early 00's though, they were extremely common to hear. But yes, I have seen fics where they don't let Ron speak without him saying mate and it's so annoying.
