Yes, Ron was the character I was thinking of. And all the British people I know moved to Canada after the year 2000, so that might be a factor in why I hardly ever hear them use the words mate or snog. Or maybe they're just trying to "speak Canadian"? But if that was the case, once Harry Potter became popular, wouldn't they revert to there old habits of using those words at least once in every sentence?
