Yeah, middle to upper class, I'd guess. All but one of them have the "BBC accent", so that probably is a factor. And the only one who doesn't is Scottish, so that might explain why she never uses the word mate. I didn't realize the word was so sharply class defined. You learn something new every day. Although I don't think the cast of The Inbetweeners was particularly middle class, and I don't remember the word mate showing up there that often. Though it's been a year or so since I watched it, so I dunno.
