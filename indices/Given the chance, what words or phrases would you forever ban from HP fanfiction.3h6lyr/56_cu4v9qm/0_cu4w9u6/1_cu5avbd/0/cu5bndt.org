I don't want to presume, but based on my limited knowledge of emigrating to Canada, is it fair to assume that the British expats you know are fairly middle class? Because that will have a big influence. The more middle class you are the less likely you are to use both of those words. It's a fairly common joke over here that a really posh person will try to relate and get along with his builder or plumber by calling him mate a lot, because it always sounds unnaturally forced from the middle class.

Mate is definitely still in very common usage though, and snog did have a resurgence around HP-mania. But as more and more Americanisms have filtered into our language it seems to me that it's declined in use. I will say though that I don't think 'makeout' has quite made it over here properly though.
