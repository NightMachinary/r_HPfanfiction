snog/snogging: It's just a terrible word that sounds kind of disgusting. Also, actual British people know lots of synonyms for making out, and wouldn't use the word snog 11 times in a single conversation to refer to it.

snark: The word snark is over-used, and much fanfic just contains too much badly done snark. Also, it makes me think of the poem /The Hunting Of The Snark/; I'm not sure how the word snark went from being a mythical animal to being an over-used word for sarcasm.

Mate: another over-used Britishism that needs to go away.
