I dunno, panties and bras have no other meanings. They also sound pleasantly soft. "Nickers" really doesn't even sound appealing.

And I agree with you that in the good fanfics, it isn't important. But in the kind of fanfics where it tends to come up, the atmosphere and background are so poor that it starts to matter.
