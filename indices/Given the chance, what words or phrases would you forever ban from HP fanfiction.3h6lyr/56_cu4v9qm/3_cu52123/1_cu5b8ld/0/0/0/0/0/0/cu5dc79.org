Well, I'm Canadian, and the only place I have ever read the word is in Harry Potter fanfic. I have never heard it used in conversation, or read it anywhere else modern. And I think a lot of people just look for spelling mistakes, and when the word isn't underlined, they assume they spelled it correctly. Based on the there/they're/their confusion I read daily, a little knicker/nicker confusion isn't even notable. :-)
