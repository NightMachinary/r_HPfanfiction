And "thongs" are shoes. If you're going to purposefully misunderstand words, why even discuss it? "Panties" or "bras" aren't exactly the sexiest of words either. But if you're writing Harry Potter fanfic, you're likely writing about 11-18 year olds in early 90s Britain in the equal shadows of past and future wars. Sexy words for clothing aren't really relevant. What do you think they're going to call them if it comes up?
