No, I'm not. I just hate the way the word "mate" appears in every single thing Ron says, in some fanfics. I mean, maybe some British people really do use the word that often. But I know 8 or 9 British people who moved to my country (Canada), and they use the word mate...maybe once an hour? Maybe? Not in every single thing they say.
