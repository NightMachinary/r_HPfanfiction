TV Tropes has a whole page on a pet peeve of mine, but I can't find the page (you're all welcome).

I can't stand it when a fic replaces EVERY expletive with "/Merlin's Beard!/" or "/Circe's left tit!/" or "/Goddess knows.../" or "/Morgana dammit!/"

Every now and then done well, it helps with world-immersion. Every other line? Then the author's just trying too hard.
