"The words prophesy and prophecy are often confused. Prophesy is the spelling that should be used for the verb ( he was prophesying a bumper harvest), whereas prophecy is the correct spelling for the noun ( a bleak prophecy of war and ruin). The differentiation between the spellings of the noun and verb was not established until after 1700" source: oxford dictionary, so unless you're a 17th century time traveller I will not accept the "sy".
