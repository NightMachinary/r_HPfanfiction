Tell that to the publishers. Unless people are frequently online discussing HP with people from other countries (and it's certainly possible to write and post fanfiction without that) they are going to go with the only thing they've ever known, which is lemon drops and Sorcerer's Stone, because that's what's in the book they have. They don't know it's been changed.
