I've more than once seen a writer try to use the hat song as foreshadowing/hints to Harry et al to win the war against voldemort (or dumbledore in bashing fics) /rolls eyes/

If I weren't so inclined to skip it as if it were a song fic, it might actually work. Unfortunately, it almost always gets a big ole nope from me.
