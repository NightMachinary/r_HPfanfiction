I never read them, but I assume it contains foreshadowing. Protip: don't hide key plot points in assanine song lyrics. Also, foreshadowing like this doesn't work well in literature where prophesy exists. Either that hat sees the future or Dumbledore has everything plotted out ahead of time and hides clues in the hat-song (psychopaths like to leave hints). If the hat does come up with it's own lyrics how does it get the information? Reading the newspaper?
