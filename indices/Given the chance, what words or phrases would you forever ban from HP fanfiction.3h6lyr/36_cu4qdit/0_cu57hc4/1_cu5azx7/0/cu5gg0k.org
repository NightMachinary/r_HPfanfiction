Rupert? :p

Well there's no name I like as much as Helen, but let's see---

I've seen Roger and Helen as a pair a few times, but I also like William (Hermione's super dorky grandparents naming their son after Shakespeare) or Chris (Emma Watson's dad's name. A nice nod without being as cringe-inducing as “Dan”).

Are there any names you particularly like? Or are you as bereft as I when it comes to Mr. Dr. Granger
