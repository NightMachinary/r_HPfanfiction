  "Leader of Light" / "The Light" (when referring to it as a side)
#+end_quote

While "Leader of the Light" is understandable, there are several instances in the books that would suggest that Light magic is, indeed, a branch of magic. With the presentation of "the Dark Arts", and the conflict of Harry and Dumbledore vs. Voldemort, that all also points to a "Dark vs. Light" scenario. Black is portrayed as evil, whereas white is portrayed as good.

Examples of probable light magic:

- Patronus Charm

- Lumos / Lumos Maxima

- Other DADA spells, counter-curses, counter-jinxes, etc.
