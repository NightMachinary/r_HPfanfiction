I agree that if there were such a thing as Light Magic (which isn't my interpretation), the Patronus charm qualifies. However, it's the only spell we ever learn about that harms Dark creatures and requires positive emotion and for all we know it is unique in that regard. Even Dumbledore, surely a master of 'Light magic' if it exists, uses normal fire spells to fight Inferi, not a fancy 'Harm Undead' Light spell.

I don't see why a glorified lamp would be considered pure or good - just because it produces light doesn't make it Light. Most hexes, jinxes, and even curses that students learn the counters for probably aren't Dark magic; countering a Jelly-legs Jinx hardly seems like 'Light' magic. I don't think we ever see them learning how to counter Dark curses - how would they practice? They'd hardly be able to cast Dark spells on each other to learn the counters.
