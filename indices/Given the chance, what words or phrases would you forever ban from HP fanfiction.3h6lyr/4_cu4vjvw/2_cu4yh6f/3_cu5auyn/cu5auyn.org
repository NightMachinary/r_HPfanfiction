One can classify spells however one wants, but it's not a canon classification, and, except for the Patronus Charm [1], bad guys can use the so-called "Light Magic" just as easily as good guys. "Dark wizard" and "Dark witch" are used throughout; but "Light wizard" or "Light witch" not once. Having a separate category for it is like having a separate word with a separate root for "any object in the universe that is not an a fruit".

[1] There was some Word of God that Snape is the only Death Eater who can cast it. To me, stuff outside the books is optional, so I am inclined to reject that, since it implies that, say, Lucius loves Narcissa and Draco less than Snape "loves" Lily.
