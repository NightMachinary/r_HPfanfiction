If we are allowed phrases, I'm going with "a pint of mead". Unless the character drinking it is hagrid, they'd fall straight over after a whole pint of mead! It comes in wine strength (most common) or liqueur strength.

In fact, any badly researched bits of 'British flavour'. As much as I detest Americanisms, when it is supposed to be a bunch of British kids talking, if you are going to add Britishness (or I suppose Scottishness in the case of mead, I haven't seen it much down south), research it beforehand if you don't know exactly what it is!
