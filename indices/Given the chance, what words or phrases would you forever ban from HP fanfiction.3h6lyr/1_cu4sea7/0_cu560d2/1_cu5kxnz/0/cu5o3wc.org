Actually that's a fanon interpretation. From the few elements we have of their structure and of their opinions in the book those families feel more like late-19th century/early 20th very wealthy families than medieval ones. They are not medieval clans, they are the wealthy British elite of the 1880's, the American east coast upper class of the 20th century or the Fascists bourgeois of the 1930's. They definitely do not feel "Medieval Europe".
