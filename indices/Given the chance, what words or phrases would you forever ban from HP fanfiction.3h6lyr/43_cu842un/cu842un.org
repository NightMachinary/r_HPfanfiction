'Mione.

Dunderhead(s).

"Always" (when used in the context of a cringe worthy Snape homage).

Eyes that are "Obsidian" or "Glittering", use of the word "Orbs" when meaning referring to eyeballs should be a hanging offence.

Smirk and Sneered.

If as never read another "marriage law" fic it will too soon as they are (in my experience thus far) invariably written poorly, focused entirely on story rather than plot and almost entirely without the internal, consistent, logic of the HP universe.

"By the Gods" or "Oh My Gods" - J.K has compared Dumbledore and Harry to John the Baptist and Christ. Wizarding Britain celebrates Easter and Christmas and while we can probably assume Wizards of other cultures hold other beliefs, the canon characters can probably be safely assumed to be of a monotheistic background.

I'm heartily tired of reading about Snape "pinching the bridge of his nose", yes he has a big honk, but how did this become such a "thing"?

And what's with all the "giving of significant gifts" which reveal the giver's true feelings and help the recipient discover their own (invariably) reciprocal ones. Blerrrrrrrgh! So OVER DONE people!
