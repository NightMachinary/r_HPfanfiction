Hmm you can always go for the obvious overused prompts like wbwl Harry and Harry gets betrayed. There are several...

-Harry gets adopted by either muggle or magical family

-Harry grows up in an orphanage (whether he grows up dark if up to you)

-What if prompts (What if Harry met Hermione first) (What if Cho went to the ball with Harry) (What if Snape didn't die)

-Harry gets betrayed (the typical depiction of Dumbledore being senile and Ron, Hermione stealing money from Harry)

-Harry becomes a Lord (very political, smart)

-Oneshots of Adult Harry (as an Auror, father, godfather..)

-If Harry died in the tournament (quite an emotional fanfic)

-If Harry's Patronus was different (interesting take, dramatic events can impact)

-Lily and James are alive (either they thought he was dead or some other reason)

Just prompts I thought off the top of my head. Hope this helps :)
