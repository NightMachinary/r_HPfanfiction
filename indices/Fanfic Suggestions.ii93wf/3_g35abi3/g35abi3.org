Lately, I'm in the mood for light, 50k words stories.

So that's my idea. I would love a fic about a holiday romance. I would really like something that have that feeling of summer, the passion, the excitement and the sensation of trying something new.

I honestly don't care much about who you choose to write about, but I would prefer an OC (if that's OK with you, not everyone wants to write one)

Bonus points if he (she) is really charming, daring, affectionate, with an easy-going attitude

Like I said, they're both young, it's just a summer thing, nothing serious but that doesn't mean it's any less amazing or has less imporntance that other future (longer, more serious) romances.

What do you think of it?

I hope you like the idea. Sorry if I had mistakes, I'm fairly new to English.
