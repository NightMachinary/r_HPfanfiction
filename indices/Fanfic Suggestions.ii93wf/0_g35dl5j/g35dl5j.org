Harry starts acting strangely after fourth year. He's hurting people and just smiling right through it. He laughs at random times for no apparent reason. He seems too calm. Some people swear he's been looking at them with a strange glint in his eyes. He just doesn't seem to feel guilty about anything.

Everyone thinks he's getting into dark magic, but it's worse than that. So much worse. Dark magic will amplify darker emotions like anger, fear, disgust, guilt. The dark exists wherever there is no light, and so it is difficult but altogether a simple matter to brighten the darkness.

But light simply pushes all darkness aside, and so is almost impossible to dim. Harry feels only positive emotions like happiness, love, peace, joy. All the time. No matter what.
