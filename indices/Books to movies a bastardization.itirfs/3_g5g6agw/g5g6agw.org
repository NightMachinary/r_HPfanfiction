Snape was miscast. Rickman was a good actor no doubt, but too old and attractive for the role. Going by the books, an Uruk-Hai from LOTR would have been as good a fit to depict Snape.

In the books Snape is an ugly, bitter loser who joined the magical Nazis and then defected when he didn't get Lily's ass. In the movies Snape might be dick in parts, but Rickman managed to give the character a certain mystique when a childish temper tantrum would have been more appropriate (revealing Lupin, his stance towards James, baiting Harry with the pensive, his desperate attempt at whitewashing himself via memories).
