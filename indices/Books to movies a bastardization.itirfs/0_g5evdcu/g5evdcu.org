I get that time was a constraint. I really do, so I don't mind them leaving stuff out.

I do mind that the director bastardized whatever he included. The director butchered Ron. He changed duel scenes. You know how much I wanted to see the duel between Flitwick, Minerva, and Snape? Instead we got some stupid flames being hex-deflected.
