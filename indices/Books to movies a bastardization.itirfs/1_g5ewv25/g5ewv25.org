Honestly, I don't really care about the missed scenes (at least in the first years). Writing a book is different from making a movie, and it's unavoidable that some things will be left out in the translation.

What's pissing me off about the movies are more things like The 6th one. I can understand how a realisator has to make some choice about which scenes to include, but in this movie, they basically ignored the main plot lines to focus on . . . Ron and Hermione love story. There are at least 3 plot lines that were more important for the plot but /teeeeeenage/ movie.

I also made peace with it, but it's annoying how Emma Watson was obviously the favourite actress of the realisators, and how they gave her a lot of good scenes at the expense of other characters (mainly Ron).
