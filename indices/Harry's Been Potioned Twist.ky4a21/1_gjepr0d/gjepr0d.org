"MALFOYYYYYY!"

The entire Great Hall of Hogwarts went silent as the grand doors slammed wide open and two dripping, hunched figures stumbled their way inside. Harry Potter was wearing the tattered remains of a shirt and several fresh cuts across his arms and face, while Ginny Weasley's fiery mane was a sodden mess, tangled with seaweed, and dotted with the guts of the beast whose horn she carried in her off hand. Both looked like they'd spent 30 days in the Arctic Circle with no wands and, having finally retrieved them, were itching to use them.

"I knew you were incompetent Malfoy" Harry spat, "but this is a new low, even for you! I'm not surprised you'd stoop to using love potions on us, but I expected you to at least have a dastardly plan. How long did you think an overpowering love of /ice cream/ would stop me for?"

"I'm still convinced the ice cream thing was just an accident and he was trying to get /me/ out of the way" Ginny snapped. "After all, we didn't see a single /robust Italian man/ the entire time we were in Norway!"

At the Ravenclaw table, the mention of Norway briefly lowered an upside-down Quibbler as Luna Lovegood pulled her attention away from a fascinating Runic puzzle to see what all the noise was about. Satisfied it was nothing important, she prepared to return to the interlocking /Ehwahz/ and /Sowilo/ ring when her mind caught up with her eyes and the Quibbler dropped to the ground, forgotten. "Horn...Norway" she mumbled.

"But we saw through your embarrassingly simple plan Malfoy: split us up, sending me to Switzerland and Ginny to Italy, so we wouldn't think to investigate the Malfoy property on Randsfjorden!" Harry crossed his arms as Ginny took up the thread.

"Hiding the artifact /inside the lake/ was surprisingly clever, but we found the temple and slew the guardian - it was no match for us!" As she shouted this (raising her voice to be heard over the din coming from the Ravenclaw table, where nearly half the students were dog-piling upon a thrashing Luna Lovegood, muffling her shouts of "Crumple-Horned" and "*kill them*"), Ginny threw the severed horn onto Malfoy's half-finished plate of kippers.

"Not so appetizing when you have to look your failed plan in the face, is it Ferret?" she asked with a sneer.

"You tried your best, pitiful as it was, to separate our love, but nothing can come between us. We're going to destroy the artifact and undo the magic fueling the potions!" Harry declared.

Draco finally deigned to speak. "Well, this has been one of the best breakfasts I've had in recent memory. As entertaining as it was to see you give Lovegood a coronary over her favorite beastie's brutal murder, I'm off to class. Toodles!"

"Hold on Malfoy, nothing to say for yourself? Are you that ashamed of your plan failing so spectacularly?"

"Hardly. I have no idea what's going on with the two of you, though I applaud whoever came up with those potions - I mean, /ice cream/ and /robust Italian men/? Those are some random choices for pranks."

"Ice /cream/-

"/Robust/ Itali-"

A panting Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, having reached the Great Hall just in time to catch Malfoy's last statement, both exploded in frustration.

"Ice cream, Pansy? Are you deaf or just stupid? The potion was supposed to make him fall in love with the Ice /Queen/!"

"Neither bitch, just not motivated when my clients skimp out on the goods. Try cheating some other Potions Mistress next time." Parkinson muttered, not looking up from her dog-eared Potions text.

Meanwhile, Zabini pulled out his wand and cast a Patronus charm. "Gregori, you /coglione/, quit trying to poach my women. For Merlin's sake, you're not even in the same country as me! You'd best start running now, because I'm on my way to pay you back for this, in spades."

As Daphne stormed out and Blaise dashed off towards the castle gates, Harry and Ginny shared a bemused look and then approached Pansy.

"So, Parkinson, think you can help us out and brew us the antidotes to the potions?"

"No need," she replied with a smirk, "they'll wear off in another 72 hours. Probably just best to avoid any Gelato shops until then, no?"

Shrugging, Harry and Ginny made their way over to the Gryffindor table, instinctively dodging the bits of table and miscellaneous spell fire that was escaping from the rapidly fading Shield Charm that now enveloped the entire Ravenclaw dining table.

Obviously takes place in a 100% Crack AU, because I couldn't think of any way to write about love potions in the canon universe without it being super fucked up (still is even in this one, to be fair). But since I was going off the rails, wanted to try and mix up some of the common characterizations.
