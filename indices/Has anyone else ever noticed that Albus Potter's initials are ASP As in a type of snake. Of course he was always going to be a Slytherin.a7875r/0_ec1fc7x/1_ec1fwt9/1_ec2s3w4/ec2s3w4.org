JKR is pant at consistency but sometimes she also lets nice hidden things like Trelawney "divining" that Harry is born in the middle of Winter but in reality more likely detecting Tom's soul shard and getting Tom's birth date.

And that's only one of the many hidden things. Sometime well hidden (Dumbledore first to stand (POA) and to die (HBP) from the table of thirteen), sometime not so much (/cough/ Remus Lupin has something to do with a wolf?).

But yeah consistency isn't really her thing but that's the problem of incremental writing and on the other hand all the missing things let that much possibilities for fanfics writers.
