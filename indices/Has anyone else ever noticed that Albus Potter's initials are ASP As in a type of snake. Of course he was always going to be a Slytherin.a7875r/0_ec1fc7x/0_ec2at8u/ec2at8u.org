I was gifted a Slytherin t-shirt, which I wear as a conversation piece, to discuss how poorly the houses, and especially Slytherin, were depicted. House of the cunning and ambitious? Containing /Crabbe and Goyle/?

Dumbledore is and has always been quite a lot more ambitious than Draco Malfoy, who has no real goals, no particular subtlety, and who relies on his father for everything.

On the whole, I think Romilda Vane's stunt with the spiked chocolates demonstrated more actual cunning than the whole six years of bullying from Slytherin.
