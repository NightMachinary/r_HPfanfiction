I personally don't like that he's a Slytherin. He didn't want to be there and I don't see why he would suddenly change his mind. I don't think he has any Slytherin traits at all. (and neither does Scorpius tbh)

I think that Rowling just kinda regretted the way she wrote Slytherin. In the books it's nothing more than the House of the bad guys and the racists and I don't think it was ever intended to be anything more. Even the "good" Slytherins are very morally ambiguous. However, now after the works have already been finished, she supports nonsense like the Cursed Child or that Merlin was a Slytherin in order to convince us that it's a normal House like all others, when in the books it obviously isn't.
