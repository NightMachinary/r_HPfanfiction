From [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6kup4/1000_years_is_a_pretty_long_time/][1000 years is a pretty long time]]:

Muggles in the 990s are completely different from the 1990s. Little basic hygiene, almost no literacy (unless you were a noble), dumping waste out onto the street...yeah, I'd nope out too. Granted, we have no clue what wizards did or were like, but I had to assume they were doing better in those days.

The problem is that Muggles drastically improved over the following centuries, and wizards refused to see that (or acknowledge it). The blood purists, I assume, don't like change that much, and with new Muggle-borns brings more change from a source they are unwilling to work with. They took an argument/belief that no longer exists today and ran with it. Even with wizardkind adopting useful Muggle inventions (camera, trains, buses, graphophone, wireless, etc) the prejudice still remains, and it's mostly willful. They could find out the truth, but they don't want to. Human nature at it's finest.
