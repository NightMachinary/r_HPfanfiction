There is no actual evidence that Old Family=Rich in Canon. We only know of the Lestranges, Blacks and Malfoys. And of those we onlx know the Malfoys to live in a manor, which they got when they were still part of muggle nobility.

On the other hand we know from Old families at least the Potters, Weasleys, Abbotts, Gaunts, Blacks and Diggorys lived next to muggles.
