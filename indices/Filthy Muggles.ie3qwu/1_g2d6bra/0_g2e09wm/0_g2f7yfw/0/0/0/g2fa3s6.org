Well, I wouldn't say the Weasleys lived near them, they live in the countryside, and used apparition and floo.

But even if they lived near them, we have strong evidence they either didn't pay attention or ignored the muggles completely. Thye didn't know nearly anything about them.

We do know Draco knew what a helicopter was, so he knew muggles could fly.

I wonder if they knew what a gun was, or a missile, or a bomb, or a nuke.

They certainly knew so little I doubt they would be able to mount an open offensive against muggles, and win.
