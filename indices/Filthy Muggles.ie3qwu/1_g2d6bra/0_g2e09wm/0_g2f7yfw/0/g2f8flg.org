Yeah, but the Gaunts were notorious to being poor, and practicing incest.

I agree however that not all old families were rich,

Funnily enough, those cited as rich, tend to be the biggest bigots. Well, Sirius said his whole family was dark, but we know Andromeda and Alphard weren't, we also know that only Bellatrix and Regulus(for a time) actively helped Voldemort, despite many other family members being alive.
