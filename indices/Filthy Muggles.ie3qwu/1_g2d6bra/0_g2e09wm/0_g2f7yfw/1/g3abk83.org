There is reason to assume old family = owns land though. Even applies to the Weasleys who aren't exactly rich.

Basically hundreds of years ago when wizards wanted land for themselves, the just put a muggle repelling charm on it, made muggles forget that it existed in the first place, and took it. Later on it also required modifying maps and faking records, gradually increasing the cost of land for wizards over time. So older families probably have their own land hidden from muggles assuming that they didn't sell it.
