I THINK they are willfully ignorant, and a wizard can spend years without seeing a Muggle(as far as they know).

Besides prejudices tend to be not very rational.

AND Grindelwald was already warning everyone about the Muggle's prowess with technology.

Heck, I think if I was a wizard I would have a revolver and practice quick drawing along with magic doubt a wizard can draw his wand faster than that, or dodge bullets at close range, just for surprise attacks though.
