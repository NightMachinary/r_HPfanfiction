There's All is Good in Love and War, which may be what you're looking for. Not one of my favorites, but decent all around.

linkffn(All is Good in Love and War)

Edit: Sorry, that should have been Art of War, not the one mentioned above. I'm not sure why the bot linked to the wrong fic for the first one, maybe it sees the title and assumes you meant "fair" instead of "good" but that would depend on how it's programmed. Anyway this is hopefully the correct link. linkffn(Art of War)
