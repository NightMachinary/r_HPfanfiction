You sound like you've done a lot of homework on Harry/Ginny stories. I'm presuming that you've read the major H/G writers such as Northumbrian, little0bird, hgfan1111, deadwoodpecker,melindaleo etc. Let me see if I can come up with any obscure ones. Off the top of my head:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1181280][Compromise:A Love Story]]: A sweet little one shot that captures the character of Ginny and her relationship with Harry beautifully.

Destiny Redefined- A different time-travel fic with the H/G relationship as the centerpiece of the story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/1/Destiny-Redefined]])

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7181871/1/Foolish][Foolish]] by Tonksaholic- This is a pretty Angsty story and I found it difficult to accept the premise of the story but it's superbly written. I'm sure that it'll break some of your rules but it's worth a read. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7181871/1/Foolish]])

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=374833][Of Teacups and Teapots]] is a light hearted funny fic featuring both H/G and R/Hr. One of those rare fics which manage to be funny without descending into Crack.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128876&textsize=0&chapter=1][Win a Date with Ginny Weasley]] and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=12536&textsize=0&chapter=1][The Best Mistake of my Life]] are H/G rom-coms. I'm not a big fan of the rom-com genre and hence not the best judge but I had a good time reading both these stories.
