Thanks for the recs.

Compromise is awesome, and one of those stories which powerfully affects your head canon. Cwarbeck was the author who made me realize that I like rom-coms, so I am certainly familiar with /Win a Date with Ginny Weasley/. Destiny Redefined had some excellent plot twists that make the story worth reading, even though the action scenes are meh. I second all three.

Haven't read the rest, but I'll give them a try. /The Best Mistake of my Life/ sounds the most interesting, so that one's next.
