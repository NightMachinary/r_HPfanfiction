How about a couple of obscure, old-school fics (as in, "The release of OotP makes this story AU")? They'll probably break a few of your rules but may be fun reading anyway, as they predate most of the clich√©s...

linkffn(Existence after Life by Cygnus Crux) and sequels linkffn(The Mind War by Cygnus Crux), linkffn(Union by Cygnus Crux), and linkffn(Wolf's Bane by Cygnus Crux). Published in 2002. It's been several years since I read them (they were among the first stories I read in the fandom), but I recall some pretty interesting worldbuilding.

The writing's a bit iffy for this one, and it admittedly delves into SuperHarry space, but it has a couple of good scenes (at least): linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dance of the Warrior by LordDragon73).
