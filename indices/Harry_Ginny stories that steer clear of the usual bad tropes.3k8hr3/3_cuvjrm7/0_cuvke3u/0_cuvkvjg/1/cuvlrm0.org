  Existence after Life by Cygnus Crux

Read this last month actually. And yeah, you're right, they are interesting stories, and the expansion of the wizarding world is interesting. The plot is mostly good too, with Harry being replaced by the mirror version of him. That said, the story has some major issues. Ron's characterization is atrocious. The story reads like a Ron bashing fic at first, and then changes to hero!Ron halfway through. I believe the author was trying to portray him as a flawed but good person, but the start reads like a bad Harmony fic. And Ginny (who is Ginny in-name-only, for obvious reasons) falls in loooove with Malfoy in less than a week, despite it being obvious to everyone except her that Malfoy was an evil git. And the lengths the author goes to leave Ginny's virginity intact is hilarious.

So a decent story, but Ginny is one of the worst parts of the fic, so I would hesitate to rec it as a Harry/Ginny story. I haven't read the sequels, though I do intend to pick them up again at some point.

And as a side note, the number of exclamation marks used by the author made my eyes bleed.

As for old school HG fics, St Margarets's stuff comes to mind as excellent, especially [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=4384&chapter=all][Magic Within, Magic Without]]. Truly excellent romance writing, which reminds me that I have yet to read her most recent work. There's also [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=12077][The Phoenix and the Serpent]], which I maintain to be the objectively best fic in the fandom, even if it is a virtual unknown.

Never read Dance of the Warrior, but I'll look into it. Thanks for the rec.
