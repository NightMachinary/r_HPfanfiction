Harry's quite the exceptional boy, who is in constant danger. He needs a very strong character as a lover, and in canon, Ginny is that. However, some authors make Ginny a very shy, stammering and blushing girl who can't speak coherently in front of Harry and /still/ have Harry falling for her.

JKR makes it quite clear that Harry only starts having feelings for her when she's able to be herself around him (as in, a strong and confident girl).

That's what OP's getting at, I think.
