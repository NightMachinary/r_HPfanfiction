I'm currently writing DH from Ginny's POV and desperately trying to avoid all the tropes you mention because they bother me too. I'm quite a weepy person myself (NO SHAME) so that's the only one I'm struggling with, but I am keeping a close eye on it. I'm not throwing my fic into the reccomendations because it's not complete yet, but I imagine people reading this thread will be good at catching that stuff so if you fancy giving me some advice that would be appreciated.

Otherwise, the best H/G stories I find are usually on SIYE, everyone there seems to have the characterisations pretty spot on. I like Bound and The Space Between by YelloWitchGirl although they can be a bit angsty. I also /LOVE/ These Cuts I Have by melindaleo but it is your standard post-DH, albeit more well written than usual.
