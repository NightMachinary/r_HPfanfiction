I have one that I think would do it and I've only ever seen it here once. Mrs. Granger's Summer After the War and it's sequel Winters After the War. While these two are set immediate post war, and quite canon-compliant, I feel that the sheer quality of the author more than compensates. Summer is almost entirely dedicated to Harry and Ginny's relationship with some setup for Winters' Auror plotline. They do seem to move their relationship along a bit to fast in Summer, but they absolutely pay for their haste in Winters. Winters has two major focuses to it, Harry and the Aurors trying to find and capture all the Death Eaters & lackeys that escaped the final battle while Harry simultaneously has to try and become a fully trained Auror, a task that should take 2-3 years in half that time. This sounds pretty generic except the author frames it as a grand mystery, several Death Eaters have straight up vanished and are suspected to be conspiring together to do... something. The author handles the mystery very well, dropping hints and clues as to what the DEs are doing without giving it away and keeping you interested the whole way. The Harry/Ginny side of things is just as well written with their relationship still looking to be in the 'honeymoon stage' for a little while at first, then the first cracks start to show once they both enter the adult world. As the pressure from the Auror plotline and Ginny's new job as a Quidditch player mounts you can almost see the cracks slowly widening over the course of numerous chapters until the whole thing blows up in their faces (the entire Harry/Ginny section of the story is the embodiment of your 24th rule's bonus points part). All in all I think these stories are incredibly good and I could go on for pages about the excellent OCs and how they mesh with existing characters, how the author's depiction of other European magical societies is deeply interesting, or how almost all the new magic introduced felt like a great addition, but that'd be wasting space.

Anyway, heres the link to Summer:

Sorry for the wall o' text, I just really like Winters.
