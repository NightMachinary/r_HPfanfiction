Heh. For some reason that cracked me up. Thanks, Wordhammer. I'll definitely give your story a read.

Brennus condenses all the worst elements of H/Hr fics into HG fics, which is why I dislike him. Ron Bashing, Dumbledore bashing, stereotypical Molly characterization, Muggle weaponry, One-sided relationships with the girl dominating (at least in /The Thorny Rose/). He could just write Ginny as a lovesick gold digger and complete the damn checklist.

Ironically, Brennus hates H/Hr shippers, and makes a point to run them down on his profile page. Not being a huge fan of H/Hr myself (which is more for the ubiquitous Weasley bashing than anything else), I might have reluctantly sympathized with him if he himself didn't read like an angry Harmonian who missed his lot in life.

Though to be fair to him, I've never read Homecoming. Who knows, it might even be readable, though I've definite cause to be skeptical.
