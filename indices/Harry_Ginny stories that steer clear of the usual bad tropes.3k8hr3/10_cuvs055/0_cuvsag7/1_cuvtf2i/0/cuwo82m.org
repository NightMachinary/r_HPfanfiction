Homecoming didn't have any bashing really. There was a semi-realistic look at Hermione and Ron's relationship, especially if Harry wasn't at Hogwarts, but it was mostly a minor side story. The story as a whole actually focused more on Tonks and Bill having a relationship and the friendship between Harry and Tonks. Harry and Ginny were there but kind of off to the side until near the end.

The only character I can really think of that was bashed was Fleur but it was kind of forced to explain the relationship between Tonks and Bill. I think my biggest problem with Brennus is his constant attempts to make Harry and Ginny dress and act like normal muggle teenagers and incorporate muggle tech, music, and fashions.
