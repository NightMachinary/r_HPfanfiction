I completely understand that you're tired of all those poorly written H/G fics (honestly, I feel the same), but if you hold yourself to these 25 points very strictly, you'll probably miss a couple of good fics out there.

That being said, I can't wait for your list of good Harry/Ginny stories. I hope that there's some in there I haven't read yet!

My rec would probably be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]]. It should cover most of your requirements, although a lot of the story does involve a very, very strong Harry and Ginny. Still, 20 out of 25 points (I think, do correct me if I'm wrong) is quite alright.
