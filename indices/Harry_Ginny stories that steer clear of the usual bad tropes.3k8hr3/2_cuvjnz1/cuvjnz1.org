linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) and linkffn(Backward with Purpose by Deadwoodpecker) are the classic H/G recs. Both authors have many other stories with the same pairing that are excellent.

linkffn(The Game is Afoot by Perspicacity) is another that satisfies your requirements. He wrote a few other Harry/Ginny stories (/Hallows and Pathos/ and /A Mother in Law's Love/, e.g.), but they fail in one or more places to meet your requirements (super wand in the case of the first, soul bonds in the case of the second).
