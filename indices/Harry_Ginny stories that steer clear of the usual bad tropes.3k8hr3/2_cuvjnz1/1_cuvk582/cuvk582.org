Thanks. These are the obvious recs, and I've read them multiple times, but it's nice to get them out of the way nonetheless. Just as a note, Hallows and Pathos is pretty good and I don't consider the Elder Wand a dealbreaker. I was referring to the indy!Harry wands with cores made of made of basilisk venom or giant piss or whatever.
