Sheesh, I was reading a story yesterday that was decent up to the end. In the last paragraph of the last chapter, Harry needs to get rid of the Elder Wand and before you can say /deus ex machina/ Ollivander gifts him a magically glowing unicorn horn wand with basilisk fang core. Then new wand literally does the magical equivalent of a b!tch slap to the Elder Wand and claims Harry. The end. Problem solved. *EDITL* I also recommended /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/.
