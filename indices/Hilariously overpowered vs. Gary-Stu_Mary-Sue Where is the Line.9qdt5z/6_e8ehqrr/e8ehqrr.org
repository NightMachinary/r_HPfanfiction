I only read OP!whatever stories when I don't have to take them entirely seriously. This means that a bit of humor or parody will make me much more likely to enjoy the read, but even without those I can decide the time was well spent if the protagonist's personality is alright.

In the case of the Harry Potter fandom, the one thing I dislike most is hypocrisy. There are plenty of OP!Harry fanfics where the kid acts with an entitlement that makes him entirely unsympathetic and where he's unnecessarily rude to +adults+ everyone. Basically if Harry is an unlikable arsehole then I'll quit reading on the spot. Since he can only afford to act this way in situations where he has something on his side (magical/political power, learned knowledge, foreknowledge, etc) too many stories of this kind seem to feature that type of ooc!Harry.

I wonder if that's a reflection on the type of authors that write these kinds of stories. Hmm ...
