Humor helps. If Harry time traveled or is being influenced by a horocrux, that also helps explain his power and especially if he tries to not show off too much (stories where Harry time travels but suddenly starts using spells like he is dumbledore in front of everyone but tries to pretend everything is normal are a bit silly). There's also a line between being powerful, even unrealistically, and being on par with Dumbledore at 17. People often cross that line when writing fics; there are a few interesting Harry Bellatrix stories that have him easily batting away Dumbledore and Voldemort like they are flies, which is tonally weird and just seems off.

Tsume Yuki made her Harry, an overpowered one, a prodigy which helps although I think it verges into Gary Stu-ness in the end.
