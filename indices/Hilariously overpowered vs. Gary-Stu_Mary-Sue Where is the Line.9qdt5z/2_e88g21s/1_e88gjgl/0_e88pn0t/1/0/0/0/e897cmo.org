  most movies I've seen have him struggling and suffering quite a bit

I was talking about the books, where he becomes POTUS after a 90s version of 9/11. Dude is like 40, married and has 2/3 kids. Also, The Sum of all Fears is very different from the shitty movie adaptation (Red October was fairly book accurate).

He is a security expert and has a degree in Naval History, yet can reform the tax system with little effort, fixes a Wall Street Crash which rivals the Black Friday, pacifies the Middle East, is best friends with the British Royals and destroys the Nuclear capabilities of both Japan and China.
