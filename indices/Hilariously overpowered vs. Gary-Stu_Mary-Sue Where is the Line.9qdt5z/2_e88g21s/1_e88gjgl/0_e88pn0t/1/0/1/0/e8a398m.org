I have the whole Jack Ryan series sitting on a shelf here, from Patriot Games up to The Bear and the Dragon. And they are all written by Tom Clancy, as is Without Remorse and Red Storm Rising. The Japanese war and 90s 9/11 is in Debt of Honour, the economy part is in Executive Orders and the Chinese war is part of The Bear and the Dragon.
