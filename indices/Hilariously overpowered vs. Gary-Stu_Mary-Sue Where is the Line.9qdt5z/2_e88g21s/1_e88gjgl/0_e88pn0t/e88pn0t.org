Examples would be Seven of Nine (Star Trek Voyager), James Bond or Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy). The difference between a strong, overpowered character and a Stu is how others react to them in universe. Take Barney Stinson as example, an attractive rich guys who goes through women like they were shots. But because the others aren't praising him for it (most of the time) but vary between morbid curiosity and disgust he does not come across as a Stu.
