Yes but In in the Harry Potter world, it's very tough to pull off.... Think about Dramoines how many Dramoine authors can actually pull off that pairing realistically? A handful at best (I'd say lena phobia and bex-chan) ....

Incredibly powerful characters which normally means Harry is very tough to pull off because you have to think what makes the Harry Potter series special, to me that's Harry being Harry and friendship.... So when you change those, you have to have a real good story... And it's hard to create one when your character needs no help(hence no friends) and they normally end up being Harry turning dark saying F**K everything and every single woman in the Harry Potter world the author likes falling madly in love with harry and him screwing them all ... Which isn't a very interesting story (atleast to me)
