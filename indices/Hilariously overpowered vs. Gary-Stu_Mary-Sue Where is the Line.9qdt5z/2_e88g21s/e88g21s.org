In my opinion, it's the tone of the story.... The 2 you posted above are made to be humor, so you don't take everything seriously, it's Meant to not make sense, It's meant for craziness

A lot of stories that have Mary Sues or Gary Sues aren't humor, they believe that is an actual portrayal of a character or want their character to be absolutely perfect... And that is the issue
