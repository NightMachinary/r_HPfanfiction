I think it's okay for stories to have a gary-stu, it's just how they're used that makes a difference. In those first two fics they're being used to create humorous situations and because the fics are both comedy it's actually helping the fics instead.

If the main conflict of the fic is defeating Voldemort then making a Gary Stu Harry would make that conflict a non-issue. If it's purely a romance then it's fine because it doesn't matter.

An example I think is linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is). In this one Harry is very OP and he actually did curb-stomp Voldie. But for me it's okay because this fic is actually about family, about Harry experiencing being the big brother of Sirius and Regulus. Voldemort was used as a tool to show how far Harry would go for his brothers.
