Sues (and thus, Stus) are characterized by 3 things: lack of conflict, lack of failure, and perhaps most important, lack of effort/struggle.

If we see a Harry Potter who has spent all of his free time studying, learning, practicing, and generally improving himself during his years at hogwarts, it wouldn't be too far-fetched if he could match Voldemort in a duel---or at least last for a while against him---without relying on the brother wands nonsense.

If he'd spent six or seven years learning, making mistakes and learning from them, /improving/, then him being a powerful wizard would be /earned/, and he wouldn't be a sue, because defeating Voldemort is the endgame.

On the other hand, if the story was more slice-of-life and about relationships or just schoolkid nonsense (or even about how cool magic is), then Harry being extremely powerful wouldn't make him a sue---it doesn't help him with his conflicts, and he can still struggle with a love life of some sort, or his friendships. It could even be a detriment, ostracizing him from jealous friends or making it difficult to make them in the first place.

However, in that same story, if /everyone/ instantly became his friend, and no one had any issues about him being powerful/wealthy/famous/etc and they never fought or argued and they always listened to him and all that nonsense, he would very much be a sue, because he would never struggle against anything, and never find conflict.

The most important part about making a relatable character is making that character /struggle/. It doesn't have to be extremely difficult or impossible, and it doesn't have to be omnipresent or constant, but it must require some form of growth to overcome. That change, that /growth/, is what makes the characters relatable and solid.
