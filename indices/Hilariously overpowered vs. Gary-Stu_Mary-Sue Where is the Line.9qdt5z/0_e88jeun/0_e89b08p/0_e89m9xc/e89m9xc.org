Paging [[/u/Murphy540]], because I want to address you both.

When you start considering Anti-Sues and pseudo-Sues, things get a bit more complex.

In the case of Anti-Sues (generally "unlikeable" or "evil" characters /in universe/), despite being "flawed" characters that might "grow," their very presence still strangles the plot. The world still bends to accommodate their main-character status, and rather than smothering a story with sugar, they become an edginess black-hole from which nothing, not even plot, can escape. Picture just about every Evil!Dark!Harry story that has more than the tiniest traces of bashing.

Contrast that to pseudo-Sue. It's not a well-known phenomenon, or even a common one, as I'd imagine that most who try for this end up with a genuine Sue or get labeled as such by the more plebian readers, but it does happen. In essence, a pseudo-Sue is a Sue-like character at first glance, but whose Sue traits are what /enable/ the plot, rather than kill it. The few examples of this I can think of all fall into the "wacky shenanigans" type of story, where the plot is less a struggle against a conflict and more a chronicle of a chain of events, where the goal of the story is the journey, not the destination.

For example, I suggest you look at /Core Threads, Taylor Varga/, and I/t Gets Worse/ - the latter two of which are /Worm/ fanfics rather than /Harry Potter/ ones. Each of these focus on a stupidly overpowered character that strangles any possible conflict.

- Core Threads: Harry Accidently gains the ability to grow infinitely in magical power. As his power grows, so does the scale of his group's antics until he's accidentally subsuming entire universes just by visiting there.
- Taylor Varga: Taylor gains the ability to turn into an invincible demon lizard. The story is her simply living her life (while innocently gaslighting her entire city through her ongoing prank). The entertaining part is how her antics are slowly infecting the city; the story implies she's an apocalypse waiting to happen and that she's malicious enough, when angered, to drive people to near-suicidal insanity. Conflict /can't/ happen, but conflict is also not why the story even exists.
- It Gets Worse: Taylor gets Sue-ness as a /superpower./ The universe literally conspires to humiliate any who would dare hurt her with as much lethality as they intended to inflict upon her. The story is a series of setups and punchlines, in which "rising stakes" are the buildup to the joke; you know, by the story's premise, that she's going to make it out alive, but you're there to read /how/.

The tl;dr of this is that the ultimate definition of what is and what is not a sue is simple: /do I want to keep reading about this plot-hogging protagonist?/ If yes, it's story, not an author's fanwank of their own creation.
