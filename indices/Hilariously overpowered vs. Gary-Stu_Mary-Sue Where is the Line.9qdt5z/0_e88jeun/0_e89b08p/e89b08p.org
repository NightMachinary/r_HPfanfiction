  However, in that same story, if everyone instantly became his friend, and no one had any issues about him being powerful/wealthy/famous/etc and they never fought or argued and they always listened to him and all that nonsense, he would very much be a sue, because he would never struggle against anything, and never find conflict.

  The most important part about making a relatable character is making that character struggle. It doesn't have to be extremely difficult or impossible, and it doesn't have to be omnipresent or constant, but it must require some form of growth to overcome. That change, that growth, is what makes the characters relatable and solid.

There are some cases where an author writes in conflict for the main character, but it still counts as a Sue. Typically the author wants to have some drama/angst in their story, but all the characters who are critical of the Sue are portrayed as irrational and unlikable. It's a black-and-white portrayal designed to make the Sue look tragically brave rather than actually point out weaknesses that the character needs to overcome.

As you said, growth/change after conflict is a good sign that a character is not a Sue, but I'd argue that it's also important for the opposing characters to not be two-dimensional.
