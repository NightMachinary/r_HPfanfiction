I find that light novel hilariously entertaining.

As far as a recent portrayal of Gary Stu(s), I would turn my attention towards the Fast and Furious series and the Mission Impossible series.

None of which, IMO, is supposed to be taken super seriously. So, you can indulge in the spectacle in front of your eyes. You know they arent going to lose, but you want to see what death defying stunt they do next, and that in and of itself is entertainment.
