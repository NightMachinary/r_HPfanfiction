Because of the whole "men are meant to be super powerful" bit. In terms of Geralt. He's a mutant. He's hated and has a borderline obsession with Yennefer and keeping Ciri safe. I'm not sure what "flaws" make him even more awesome.

It depends on the fanfiction you're reading. Prince of Slytherin, for instance, has Harry as rather powerful but he plays the Slytherin politics game while dealing with being distant from his living parents and his twin brother that was sorted into Gryffindor and is believed to be the Chosen One while Harry was thought to be a squib until he got his Hogwarts letter.

Then there are fics like Methods of Rationality where Harry is super smart and uses "rationality and logic" to use magic to his advantage and comes out stronger with no real struggle and is a condescending prick but still right because plot.
