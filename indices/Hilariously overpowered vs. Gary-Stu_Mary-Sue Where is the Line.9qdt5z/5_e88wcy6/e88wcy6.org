[[/u/Murphy540]] already gave you a very good answer, but I think it needs to be clarified.

OP!Harry isn't as closely related to Mary Sue / Gary Stu Harry as you probably think. Sure, a large subset of Gary Stus are probably also overpowered, but I wouldn't consider it the most defining attribute.

The origin of the term is in relation to female characters: It's applied to 'perfect' women and those women are rarely overly powerful (probably because a too powerful woman would be scary for many men and thus less than perfect). Mary Sues have no characteristics of their own: They are silent when it is right to be silent, they are loud when it is required to be loud. They are rogues when necessary and follow duty when being a rogue would be to their disadvantage. They are beautiful, but never vain, arrogant or conceited. Even out of hindsight they are almost always correct (because of author fiat) and when they give a spirited speech everyone is very impressed by their wisdom, charisma and intelligence.

When it comes to Harry as a Gary Stu being super powerful is more acceptable for men than women, so you'll probably see very powerful Gary Stus more often than Mary Sues, but all those other things are still required to make Harry a Gary Stu. For me the most revealing indicator of it is when they have no consistent characterization and instead always behave in a way that makes them look good and/or succeed.
