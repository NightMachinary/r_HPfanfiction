As a general rule of thumb, if you improve the abilities of the protagonist, you should in turn improve the abilities of the antagonists to an equal-if-not-larger degree. And likewise increase the immensity of the problems they face.

This allows you to retain the sense of there being a threat on the horizon. Without risk or danger or consequence, you have a boring story, and your character is a Mary-Sue/Gary-Stu.

It doesn't matter if their character is created well, in that case the story is a good character study, but the character still fits the profile of Gary-Stu in /that/ story.
