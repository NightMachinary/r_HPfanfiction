Hope you'll forgive the wall of text, I got on a bit of a roll.

I think I know what you mean. But also within fanfiction, canon isn't strictly adhered to. By making Harry prodigious or powerful, /that/ application of power becomes the thing he will bring to bear against his opposition rather than his canonical good fortune. If you make Harry more skilled, he must use that skill to some degree, otherwise you've wasted your words as an author.

It would be a little tricky for an author to define what involvement "luck" has canonically and either increase or decrease it. Instead I would imagine that having more dangerous enemies would constitute "worse luck" compared to the canon story. For example, it would be unlucky for Hermione to be killed by a more dangerous spell in the Department of Mysteries in book 5, or perhaps have her be incapacitated for a period of months or permanently maimed due to spell damage.

This might be an interesting starting off point for a story, where Hermione's injury at Harry's impulsive actions give him the impetus to become more skilled so his friends no longer get hurt.

In the same line of thinking - perhaps unluckiness doesn't simply elevate the power of the adversary (in the power creep you mentioned) - it simply makes the outcome more impactful in any confrontation. For example, Dobby /had/ to die because he saved Harry. If Dobby hadn't died then Harry wouldn't have "sacrificed" something to get to safety.

It is straightforward from there to analyse canon events and say "if something could go wrong in this situation, what could feasibly go /very/ wrong?" -- if we removed Harry's "luck factor" entirely, what are the lasting consequences or short-term losses sustained? And then because of the losses of resources or allies - what /else/ could happen as a result. Say Dobby doesn't die, but he's unable to get Hermione out of the cellar. Then Hermione is put in front of Voldemort and legilimized, THEN Voldemort knows that they know of the Horcruxes.

I would say that Harry possessed a certain competence, the Patronus Charm learned at age 13 allowed him to survive an attempt on his life two years later at the start of The Order of the Phoenix when the Dementers were sent after him in Little Whinging. Harry wins the little battles through competence, he wins the war through "sheer dumb luck" and the capabilities and resources of his allies.

Here are a few ideas I had that could feasibly happen because Harry's luck "ran out":

*Book One:*

- Kidnapped/assaulted in Diagon Alley.

- Followed home from Diagon alley by a person who means harm

- Immediately mobbed by reporters. Hounded as a celebrity

- Injured by falling off his jinxed Quidditch broom.

- Injured by the wraith/voldemort in the Forbidden Forest

- Injured by Centaurs / Acromantulas in the Forbidden Forest.

- When burning Quirrell's face with his hands, Harry's hands are also burned.

...

*Book Two:*

So many....

- Ginny does way worse under the control of the diary Horcrux.

- The Basilisk is much more dangerous, people die rather than become petrified.

- When pierced by the Basilisk tooth, /even with phoenix tears/ his arm is destroyed by the venom.

...

There's so many ways you can take these canon events and craft interesting dilemmas for the characters to deal with.
