By "luck" I was mostly meaning Harry's enemies holding the idiot ball when confronting him, so that he never actually faces the full brunt of Voldemort's powers. One example off the top of my head: Harry tells Voldemort he's the master of the Elder Wand. By this point Harry's holly wand is dead. Voldemort could have played it safe and just switched back to his yew wand without any risk of priori incantatem, at which point he would have beaten Harry in short order.

Basically, plot armour situations. Take away the plot armour and Harry would need to be massively more competent to win the war.
