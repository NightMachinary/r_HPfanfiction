Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is the best OP!Harry I have come across. And she (Fem!Harry) is REALLY overpowered. (also, i wouldn't consider seventh horcrux as OP!Harry). I think it comes down to the ease at which they solve their problems. As a reader, I want suspense and doubt as to whom will come out victor. Conflicts don't have to against other characters. And particularly with OP! characters, the main conflicts should NOT be duels. Relationships, internal conflicts, politics, and humor, would pose more challenge. Also, there needs to be a plausible reason why the OP! character doesn't use his/her powers to solve problems that can be resolved as such. The more plausible the reason, the better the story.
