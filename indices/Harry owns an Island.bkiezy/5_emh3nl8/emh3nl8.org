He partially owns an island in linkffn(darkness ascendant) and partially and outright owns worlds in linkffn(a trek to the stars by cole pascal).

Then there's that esama fic fire island or something. It's on ao3.

Oh, he doesn't own it I think but he's basically a pirate isoand king in one of derlacroix's stories. It's on ffn. I havent read it in years because it's super fanony.
