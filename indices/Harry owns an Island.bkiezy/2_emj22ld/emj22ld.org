I would advocate for this one. It's... a very UNIQUE fic. The author loves world building. (I would almost say has a fetish for it) But it is very creative and has a lot of interesting angles.

Harry does purchase an island, Drake Island. Then Fudge thinks it's Malfoy purchasing the island on the sly for smuggling, (Draco = Drake?) so does all sorts of bureaucratic twists to make it even more ridiculous.
