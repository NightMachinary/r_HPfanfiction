It's usually better to go back and edit your own comments, so it's less confusing for other people to read them. I think the foundation would be able to recruit death eaters in the same way they recruit D-class, by offering them reduced sentences in Azkaban. They'd use some well thought out combination of loyalty oaths to ensure cooperation.

I'd say they'd use the less talented death eaters for obliviation services rather than as D-class. It would save on amnestics, and if you take 3000 as canon, it would probably be more acceptable to the ethics committee. The more talented death eaters would probably be useful as consulting researchers (in Rookwood's case) or as a Mobile Taskforce in the case of front-line fighters like the Lestranges.
