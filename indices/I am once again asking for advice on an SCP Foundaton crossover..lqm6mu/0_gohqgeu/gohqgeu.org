Knowing the SCP foundation, it would probably end up in a conflict or inflitration of some sort. They are control freaks and will not accept anything less than total control of a massive anomaly like the Wizarding World who have litteral mind control spells, it would probably even be considered too dangerous for them to even make formal contact with the wizarding governments for fear of getting infiltrated.

I could see a nice plot point with wizards getting captured and contained having to escape.
