Star Wars does it for me, always. It was my first fandom, even when I didn't know what a fandom was. I'd spend hours on dialup trolling old message boards and fan sites while reading Young Jedi Knight books in middle school. (These books actually got me into reading in the first place, good old SWYA Books.) I met some really great friends by being involved in the Star Wars fandom too.

It has some great fics and novels and movies and some not so great ones, but the epic ancient/futuristic vibe in that universe is awesome. They've had space travel (in the old EU at least) for more than 35,000 years come the movies. So much history there, and such a huge world(s) to explore. Plus the whole clashing spiritual philosophies thing is always fun to read. Just an epic, epic fandom.

Basically if they put the Star Wars logo on something, then I want them to take my money.
