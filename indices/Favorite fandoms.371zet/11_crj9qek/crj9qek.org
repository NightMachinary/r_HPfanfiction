Dishonored. I haven't actually read that many fics, but I haunt [[/r/dishonored]] and lurk around the tumblr part of that fandom. There's some awesome art and I love the headcanons and AU ideas that people come up with (even when they're heartwrenchingly sad). It's the only thing that comes close to my interest in Harry Potter; all other fandoms I merely dip into briefly to read a couple of short fics.
