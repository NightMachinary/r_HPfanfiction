I'm currently hooked on anything related to Worm, a web novel about superheroes and super villains. It's always been a compelling setting because of the characters who inhabit it. For example, super powered characters receive their power after traumatic events - it sounds like it should create a planet of angsty woobies, but it's played maturely and gives many main characters a compelling back story. Even besides from that, few people hold the idiot ball, everyone has real reasons for what they do and why they are who they are.
