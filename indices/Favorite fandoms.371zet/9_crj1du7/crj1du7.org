I'm beginning to enjoy some of the DC comics universe fan fiction. It's a large universe and has a lot of interesting things in it. There are tons of opportunities for people to pick out just the things they're interested in and run with them. Or they can mash tons of things together to yield a canon-compatible story that goes far beyond what DC's authors ever envisioned (aka munchkining).
