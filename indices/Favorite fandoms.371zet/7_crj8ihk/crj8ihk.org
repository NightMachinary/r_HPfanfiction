EXO. It's a Korean pop band, and while I understand how writing and reading fics about existing people might be weird, I honestly see it as being about the images and personalities they put up for the fans, not the real breathing people. The Korean music scene is really, really different from that of the west, so in my mind it makes sense to separate the image from the person. That being said, I have never read a better and more thought-out fic than Arbitrage by fumerie. I don't even read fics anymore, apart from an occasional bored evening, but that fic will forever be imprinted in my mind as something incredible. Basically all my favorite fics come from the exo fandom.
