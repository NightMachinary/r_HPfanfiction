Mine are Percy Jackson, Star Wars and Eragon.

I loved Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series and the fandom, while repetitive and clich√©d a lot of the time, has a few stunning pieces of work.

Star Wars has always been a big thing for me. The first time I really got into the fandom was after playing Star Wars KotOR, I really wanted to read about Revan and Bastila, with the whole Light/Dark thing they have going it leads to some fantastic character building. And it's Star Wars so the action is always great.

I got into the Eragon fandom when I was just looking for something to read and after a quick search I found Reversed Life (See link below) which is truly one of the best things I have ever read.
