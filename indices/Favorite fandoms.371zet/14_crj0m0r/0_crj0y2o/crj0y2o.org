I am a fan of some of the Star Wars fics, especially Revan. I love how Revan was portrayed in KotOR. Also I liked Percy Jackson, but not enough for the fandom to guide me into its arms. Eragon...Eragon after meeting the Author, (and actually having coffee with him) plus the emotional ties I have with the series, it would have to be nearly perfect fanfiction for me to read it.
