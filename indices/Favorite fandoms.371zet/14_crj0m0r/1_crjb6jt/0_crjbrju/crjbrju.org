The crossover fandom is f*cking annoying. All anyone seems to write about is HoO guys helping Harry defeat Voldemort or Percy/Annabeth coming to teach DADA.

There are a few good original ones but I really can't be bothered searching for them, it's almost as depressing as sorting on Harry Potter Fanfiction.net for "Complete" and "Newest".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9199184/1/Danielle-and-the-Hunters-of-Artemis][This]] is one of the best PJO/HP crossovers but unfortunately not complete and it is probably abandoned.

  First story I'm putting on this website. When Danielle Potter was thrown out of Potter Manor in favor of her 'boy-who-lived' brother, she meets a certain group of man hating Hunters who take her to America. Welcome to the world of the gods, young witch. Twin story, girl-who-lived, minor bashing of Dumbledore and Potters.
