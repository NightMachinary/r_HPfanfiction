In regards to PJO, have you ever been to the PJO/HP xover page in ffnet lately(or ever)? It's disappointing that a fandom as large as that, and has a sizable number of xover fics, can't seem to write anything past the HoO crowd (+ whoever) protecting HP and co.

Moving on from that... thanks for the recs :) Personally, my favorite PJO fanfic would have to be Uphill and Against The Wind, probably because of the last conversation between Apollo and Harry before it got abandoned.
