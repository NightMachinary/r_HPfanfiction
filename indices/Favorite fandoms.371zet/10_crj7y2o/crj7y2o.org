Let's see.. After HP, Naruto is probably 2nd in good fics. Many gems. Other than that.. Well, I've read some Percy Jackson, but never any good ones, its a fandom filled mostly with shit.. Same as Pokemon.

A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones has a few good fics, I guess. And League of Legends has a few readable ones. For the most part though, the only fanfiction fandoms with enough readable quality fics to keep me hooked is Naruto and Harry Potter.
