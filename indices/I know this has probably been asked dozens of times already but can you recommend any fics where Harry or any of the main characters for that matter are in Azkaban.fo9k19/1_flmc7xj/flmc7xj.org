Here are some:

linkffn(Reflections Through Time by Perfect Lionhearted). Incomplete, but I thought it was well-thought-out.

linkffn(Save Yourselves Reboot by Havens Run). Also incomplete, and a bit over-the-top in places, but I liked it.

linkffn(Harry Potter Mercenary by DobbyElfLord). Complete, and a good story.

linkffn(My Hero by E4mj). More a character vignette than a story.

linkffn(All the Dementors of Azkaban by LifeWriter). Luna sentenced to Azkaban. Harry joins her.

linkffn(Contract Declined by Luan Mao). Good one-shot.

linkffn(I'd Rather be a Mudblood than a Mudbrain by pstibbons). Hermione in Azkaban.

linkffn(You Only Live Thrice: The Tale of Elsa Jones by pstibbons). Hermione in Azkaban.

linkffn(Out of Azkaban by Laume). Harry and Snape in Azkaban.

linkffn(Fugitives of Azkaban by BajaB). After the Chamber incident, Harry is put into the cell next to Sirius.

linkffn(Don't Look Back in Anger by RobSt). After the 3rd task, Fudge has Harry thrown in Azkaban.

linkffn(Betrayed by katydidnt). After his release from Azkaban, Harry goes muggle.
