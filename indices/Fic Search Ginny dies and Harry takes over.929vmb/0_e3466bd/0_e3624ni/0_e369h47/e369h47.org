  Do you have any other stories that aren't on FFN?

One-shots, mostly. The full archive is here:

The only other multi-chapter fics in there (that aren't on FF.Net) are

1. Alexandra Potter. I do not recommend reading this if you are reading Victoria Potter as, while much has changed, it will still contain some spoilers. It's also just far inferior!

2. The Mysteries of the Department. I believe I wrote this in 2007 and it's the second thing I ever wrote (the first is lost in some hard drive of a previous computer, thank god - it was about a half-vampire Russian wizard who was an offshoot of the Black family and became Voldemort's second in command. Very wanky.). "Mysteries" is quite awful but interesting in so far as it shows how I've developed as a writer.
