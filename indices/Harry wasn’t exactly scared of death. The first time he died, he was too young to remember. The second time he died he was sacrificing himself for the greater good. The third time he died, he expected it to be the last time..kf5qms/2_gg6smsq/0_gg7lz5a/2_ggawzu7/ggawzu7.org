They weren't doing very well but while Harry and Hermione were muggleborns and realized things where about to get deadly (deadlier?), Malfoy did not.

Voldemort grew in a muggle orphanage but his lack of a working nose made him ignore the particular smell filling the mudblood's hideout. and after Malfoy screamed the fiendfire incantation, he only had a moment to laugh at the puny shield cast by Potter before an explosion decimated his body.

When potter spoke about a gas main blowing up and killing the dark lord, every wizard trembled. What could be so awful that forced obliviators to erase potter's memory to replace it with a standard muggle excuse for wizarding battles?
