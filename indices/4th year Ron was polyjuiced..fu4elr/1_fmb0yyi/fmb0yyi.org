Not bad idea, but you get to the same problem as with the canonical HPCoS: how come that four Ginny's brothers haven't noticed that she was possessed while living next to her for whole year? How come Harry & Hermione (at least, even ignoring other Weasley siblings) didn't recognize that there is something fundamentally wrong with Ron, that he doesn't remember some things he really should?
