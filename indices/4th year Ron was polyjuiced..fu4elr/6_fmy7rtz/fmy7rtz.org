I always thought Ron DID believe Harry didn't put his own name in the goblet. The thing is A) Ron was a 14 year old boy who didn't always express his feelings clearly and B) believing Harry actually made the true source of his resentment worse. Once AGAIN Harry has had something Ron desperately wants handed to him on a platter. Harry (in Ron's view) doesn't appreciate the opportunity to go after all the things Ron wants for himself (recognition, escape from poverty when Harry already has a vault full of gold). That's what burns him up. A lack of trust in Harry was never the real problem.
