I have a couple! On a pale horse linkffn(10685852) Very very good fic! Unfortunately it's not finished but even as it is it's worth it! Death is a Master of Death Harry Potter form a parallel universe summoned to the harry potter universe during fifth/sixth year (sorry can't remember properly). The relationship between Harry and death is really great, at times heartbreaking while often hilarious. The relationship is often also viewed from an outside pov so that may be of interest to you! The relationship is mostly platonic I think, but can be read as romantic easily (death is a little touch starved). One thing though, I don't know how you feel about it so I thought to mention it, it contains Dumbledore bashing.

The master of Death linkao3(17672156) Includes time travel (harry from a couple years post canon goes back to the summer of fifth year) and a developing romantic relationship between Harry and Death. Harry also undergoes a morality shift due to being the master of death, which is interesting.

Also, I don't know if it counts but I cannot not include this series, which is one of my absolute favourites in the HP fandom:

Like a Ghost in my Town, which includes: Stand Against the Moon linkao3(2378855) Nose to the Wind linkao3(15562401)

Basically, after Harry becomes Master of Death he can be reborn as himself in a parallel universe every time he dies, but due to a series of events in his first life he is always born as a werewolf. The relationship between Harry and Death isn't center stage and it's platonic (the romantic relationship in both stories is Harry/Tom Riddle) but it's very enjoyable to read. Harry and Death are incredibly fond of each other, and they have inside jokes and fond teasing between them. Their relationship is explored more in the second story (which is my favourite) and it's amazing. I cannot recommend this series enough, I reread it every couple of months because I really love it!

Hope these are similar to what you're looking for!
