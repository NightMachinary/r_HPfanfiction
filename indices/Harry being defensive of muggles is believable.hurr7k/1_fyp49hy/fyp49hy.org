Can you imagine growing up with Malfoy around and not wanting to lift up muggles and muggle borns out of sheer spite?

He also idolized his mom, who was muggleborn.

He must have had one or two nice teachers and students who were nice until Dudley got to them. Or at least witnessed them being nice to each other.

Just fully recognizing muggles as human puts him ahead of even the Weasleys, who had no issue buying Ron "Martin Miggs, the mad muggle"
