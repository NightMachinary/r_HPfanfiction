It's understandable. Voldemort is like...a crazy magical racist trying to genocide the muggleborns away. Yeah, there are always those who turn a blind eye to that sort of thing but that's not in Harry's character. Furthermore, his mom was muggleborn, Hermione is muggleborn, etc. Can you imagine a half-Jewish person not caring about the Holocaust or a Black man with white dad/black mom turning a blind eye to the KKK in his neighborhood?
