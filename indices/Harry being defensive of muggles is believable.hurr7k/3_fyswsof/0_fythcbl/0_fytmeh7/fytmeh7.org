I get your point. I think "feels strongly about" is what is throwing me off. For example, Harry could feel very strongly that Voldemort was a monster, that he was committing genocide, and yet....recognize his parents gave up their life for him to live (not to die as a teenager) & that he was still a kid while far more qualified grown ups needed to step up. Therefore, he might bounce. I don't think he'd let the Dursleys bad behaivor impact how he felt about muggleborns/muggles, though.

TLDR: Basically, he'd care a lot but not necessarily feel a need to "risk his life"...esp. as no one but Figg basically checked in on him growing up.
