Pretty much, yeah. I for example like whales and polar bears and think they should be better protected, doesn't mean I'm going to personally go around decapitating fishers/hunters that prey on them. With feel strongly what I mean is that it's something so important to the person that they just can't stand doing nothing about it or just cheering on the side-lines.
