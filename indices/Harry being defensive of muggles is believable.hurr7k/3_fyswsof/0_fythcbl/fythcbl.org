Not ignoring, no. That's not really what I was talking about. By all means his character is one that would take offense at Voldemort's actions. What I was saying is that I don't think it is believable that he would take the fight against Voldemort as something so important on account of protecting the muggle-world (as in, if Voldemort was only really interested in screwing over muggles then Harry -based more in the real-life psychological expectations with the experiences he had during his life rather than how he does act in cannon- should realistically be rather uncaring about Voldemort (like I said at the post, while he probably would think it is wrong and wouldn't side with Voldemort it just wouldn't really be a fight he feels strongly about). Making use of your example I would say that it would be like a descent white guy hearing about KKK's actions in another city, he would know it's wrong, he wouldn't support it, maybe he would even talk against it with other people, but in the end generally he also wouldn't feel the need of going around the country hunting KKK's members, even if someone had told him that he was the only person capable of stoping the damn racists for some reason.
