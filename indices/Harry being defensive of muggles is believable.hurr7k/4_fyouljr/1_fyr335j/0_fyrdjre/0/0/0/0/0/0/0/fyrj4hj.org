Im trying to point out that he is a flawed character that was overwhelmed, when the freakin minister dosent know about the dark mark its hard to be effective.

Bottom point is exactly, book 1-4 Dumbledore dosent fit with later books because the audience matured, so Dumbledore is a victim of inconsistent writing.
