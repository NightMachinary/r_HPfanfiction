1. Not gulty untill provrn guilt
2. Grief acts diffrent for all pepole, Sirius had just seen his brother in all but blood dead, his wife and refused access to his godson. Tries to catch the person responsinle only to be caught off guard.
3. Muggles who dosent know the whole story, and a bunch of wrongly explained explotion, had Peter died there woulf be more pices than a clean cut finger to be found.
4. Dont blame Sirius, they could have had a check for the dark mark, Albus could of asked for unbreakable wows and so on.

Sirius was destroyed by the corrupt ministry that didnt even bother to give him a trial.

Dumbledore made mistakes he could of easily fixed, but hes a flawed man who only left another dark lord when rhey entered a deadly duel and Ariana died.
