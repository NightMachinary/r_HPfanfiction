Harry wants to kill Voldemort as revenge for for all the evil he has done, Dumbledore literally confront him with it when Harry claims he only does it because of the prophecy.

  "But, sir," said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, "it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---"

  "Got to?" said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!"

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it."

He doesn't think he is responsible, he just wants to kill him.
