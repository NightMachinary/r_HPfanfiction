Realistically though, cannon Harry would have absolutely no reason personally think himself responsible for stopping Voldemort though. Yeah, it sucks that a maniac genocide is slaughtering a nation, but we see it in real-life frequently and don't really feel any obligation of stopping the dictators. Harry has absolutely no real reason to bother defending the muggle-born population as a whole or the muggle world. Would make much more sense for a teenager to just not bother. The revenge reason kind of makes more sense, but then again many other people had the same reason to oppose Voldemort.
