I wouldn't disregard the friendship angle though - Harry is friends with Hermione and since she's muggleborn Voldemort's “agenda” affects her directly (especially after CoS, when they see the effects of TR attacking muggleborns). IMO that has to play a role in his defense of muggle(-borns) - maybe not to the extent you're talking about, but I feel like this alone would be enough to move from total indifference towards the issue and towards defending muggles and muggleborns.
