I've got you fellow badger! Well, not really, since there are so few fics to choose from, but here's a nice long one with multiple canon characters:

Finding Himself by minisinoo: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF]])

IIRC, Rozarka on Archive of Our Own has written a bunch with Cedric and with Zacharias.

You also might have more luck looking for specific characters - e.g. Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Tonks etc.

Also, a lot of fanfiction sorts Teddy into Hufflepuff so maybe try some next gen fics as well.

Also, try writing yourself! We need Puff characters, and maybe we'll have to write them ourselves :)

I swear I just read something amazing with a Puff in it, and I can't remember...
