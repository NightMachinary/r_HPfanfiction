Hmm, there was one where Cedric loved and was instead just courses in the graveyard - it ended up being Cedric/Hermione. An older fic - the sequel was abandoned before the sixth book came out I think. The name is escaping me at the moment - it's not the Psychic Serpent, I just remember reading it around the same time.
