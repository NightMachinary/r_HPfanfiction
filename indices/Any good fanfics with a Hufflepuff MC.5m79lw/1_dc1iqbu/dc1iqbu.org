I've written a half complete Susan/Justin HBP/DH romance that is 100% (AFAIK) canon compliant safely buried in my gdrive. It must be a stage new fanfic writers go through; writing something canon compliant out of JKR respect and admiration (missing moments, nearly OC characters, or pre or post epilogue). Sort of like the DLP post on stages of fanfic reading. I always found Justin to be an excellent potential MC. There is the implication he comes from muggle wealth, perhaps even some archaic peerage title. Being able to throw money around and buying respect, despite being muggleborn just seems like a really interesting aspect to explore.
