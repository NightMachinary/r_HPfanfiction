that's fair, but so far this fic has made me smile more than it's made me sad. It's suffused with moments of deep grief but it's also full of some authentically sweet moments. my expectation for this story going in was for something a tad more, I don't know, dreary. Given that i'm only 8 chapters in, maybe that will change; but that's okay because now the excellence of the story is keeping me enthralled

I made my comment in reaction to some other stuff anyway. Please don't take my sleepy ramblings too seriously.
