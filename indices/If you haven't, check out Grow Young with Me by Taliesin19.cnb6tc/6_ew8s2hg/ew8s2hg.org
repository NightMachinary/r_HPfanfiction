Amazing fic indeed. Really good characterization (not only on the kids even if what you say is totally true) and story. When I found this fic I didn't like non canon post DH but this one changed my mind. And chapter 18 was terribly well written as much as sad.

It's hard to have to wait so long for each chapter but it's worth it. If you didn't know she has a [[https://taliesin-19.tumblr.com/][Tumblr]] on which she give notice of her writing progress, answer question and write little side stories (Random Fact of the Week) in the GYWM universe. Highly entertaining and it helps to wait til the next update.
