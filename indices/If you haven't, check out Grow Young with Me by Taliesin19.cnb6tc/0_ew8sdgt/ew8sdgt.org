This is so kind of you, thank you! I gave that October 31st date kind of arbitrarily, but I'm really trying to get the next chapter done before that. I'm forever grateful for everyone's patience, though. I know the long wait between updates sucks :/

Edit: Thank you to the users who gave me the gold and silver! You guys are awesome :)
