I have read A LOT of HP fanfiction in the last couple of years, and I have to admit, there is not much which could stand up next to the “real” literature. So, it is noticeable for me when I have that very rare moment of “Holy Shit, this is so good, it cannot be a fanfiction”. The last one was linkffn(6622580). There are some (few) others, but this certainly stands out.
