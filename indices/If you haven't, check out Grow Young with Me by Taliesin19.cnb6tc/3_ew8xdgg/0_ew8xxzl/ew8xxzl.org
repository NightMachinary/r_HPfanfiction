Yeah it's less about magic and more about the difference between how the magic world treats Harry and how the muggle world treats him. And obviously family.

If you simplify it like that, it sounds cliched but the characters are a little more complex than the bubbly girl and the sad guy. You get to learn that in the later chapters. But these stories are not for everyone, I agree.
