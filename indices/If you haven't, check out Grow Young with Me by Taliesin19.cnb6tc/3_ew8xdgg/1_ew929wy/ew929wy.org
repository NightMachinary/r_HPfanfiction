Let me know some of your favorite stories. I bet I can make them sound shitty in just two sentences, like you did there in your last paragraph. Haven't even read this story, but what you did is just plain unfair to any story. Even more so as you haven't even read more than a few chapters yourself, as it sounds. And everybody else is saying how complex the characters are developed over the whole story.
