It has self contained stories. Without wanting to spoil too much, some parts of the story will not be as good as others.

Ahh to bad pureblood pretense is not for you. It has amazing combat, a well thought out political Voldemort, is wonderfully AU and is based on another story adapted to the potter world. But to be fair, the people around the protagonist sometimes suffer from selective stupidity. And even though it features magical cores, it does so in a , for me, refreshing way with important limitations and obstacles to overcome. Damn I think I'm gonna reread it.
