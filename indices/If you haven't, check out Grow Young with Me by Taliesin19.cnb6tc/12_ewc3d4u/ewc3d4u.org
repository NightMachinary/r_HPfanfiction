It's been sitting in my following list since forever, I've literally heard nothing bad about the story itself. I'm waiting for the story to complete so that I can finally read it, as I have next to no mental capacity to keep the updates in track. One story that imo also has outstanding next-gen characterisation is linkffn(ignite by slide), it's seriously (one of) the only one that stands out to me.
