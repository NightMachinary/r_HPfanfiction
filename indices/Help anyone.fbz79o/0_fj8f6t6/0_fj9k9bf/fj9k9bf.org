Kind of close but that's not it I'm basilisk born harry is travels in time to where Merlin was and has to go through the entire timeline. But in the one I'm thinking of he only goes back in time to the founders until he travels back to his own timeline. Also in the one I'm thinking about harry and draco polyjuice themselves as ron and Hermione during their trial. Also grindelwald is pretending to be Dumbledore while the real Dumbledore is in prison. The elves had placed fawkes with grindelwald to keep an eye on him. But thanks anyway.
