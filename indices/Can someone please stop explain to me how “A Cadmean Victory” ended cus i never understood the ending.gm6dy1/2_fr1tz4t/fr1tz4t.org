I have two prevalent theories. Choose the one which makes most sense to you.

Harry's wand was the Horcrux. Hedwig was also a Horcrux. Fleur kept saying that she felt a sliver of Harry's magic. That means the Horcrux was there but just wasn't perfect (probably made by accident). I think Harry made Hedwig a horcrux by accident as well. The ending however was Harry and Voldemort. Voldemort killed Harry but Harry, being a spirit, took over Voldemort. Voldemort lashed out and we saw how similar they truly were. We also see that Harry even as a spirit is as strong as Voldemort. Harry never truly died, so Voldemort did. Voldemort, with no other Horcruxes, could not survive being possessed by another. So Harry ended up Killing Voldemort the same way Voldemort survived in the first place.

*OR*

Harry made a horcrux and anchored it in the elder wand when he knew he couldn't win against Voldemort, he then possessed his owl (the same way Voldemort possessed Quirrell) to return the Horcrux and the other half of his soul (the one possessing Hedwidge) to his physical body.

This would explain why the owl's body was deteriorating.

It would also explain why Voldemort was fed images from Harry's life when he picked up the elder wand. The same way the locket corrupted Hermione by showing her what she feared, Harry's Horcrux showed love to Voldemort, which is what was supposed to be the "power he knows not" since the beginning. This in turn reminded Tom of a time long ago when he had loved (the ambiguous Myrtle parts of chapter 102).

Which stays within the idea of "no light or dark, only intent", as even what is considered the darkest of magics, a Horcrux, was used with the intent of redeeming instead of corrupting.
