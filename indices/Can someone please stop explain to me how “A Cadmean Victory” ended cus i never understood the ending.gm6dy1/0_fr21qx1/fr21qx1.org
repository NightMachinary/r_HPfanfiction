Ok, this is my interpretation, since the author left it open-ended. It has been some time since I read it all, but I often go back and read the first 30 chapters or so(I really like Painting!Salazar).

First, remember when Harry killed Pettigrew at the beginning? And used it to extract Tom`s Horcrux from himself by fracturing his own soul? He unknowingly made a Horcrux for himself, his wand(it got red hot and almost melted his hand). Ok, remember that.

In the end, when he and Voldemort duke it out and kill each other, Harry survives because of his Horcrux and absorbs a little of Tom`s power.

When Fleur is mourning him in his tomb in France, under their willow, Hedwig(taken by Harry`s soul) arrives with the Elder Wand and the Stone(that Harry had), so through a convoluted combination of having possession of the Three Hallows and having a Horcrux, Harry fully comes back to life.

A Cadmean Victory because he defeated Death like Cadmus Peverell tried to do.

A Taste of Ismenian Water is the epilogue, It shows an alive Harry, who questions if he`s fully Harry or a Voldemort thinking he`s Harry or Harry with some Riddle, so he casually infiltrates the Department of Mysteries and looks into the Mirror of Erised, confirms he`s truly Harry Potter, and then steals the mirror, because why not?

He then returns home, tells his wife Fleur he`s really Harry Potter and not "Harry Riddle"(she already knew that), and then is finally relived being reunited with his wife and daughter.
