This is so clever!

I had a problem with the wands.

I wish there were pics of them to help us choose which one to use. Also when you try to cast spells with the kids, if you choose 1 or 2, you get a choice to choose again, but whatever I choose next sends me to the sad ending waking up in my room, forgetting about magic.

I had to play through everything all over again, only made the right choice the third time!
