It's fairly straightforward with one caveat.

Disapparate can be combined with out, away and similar. It's the action of being somewhere and moving out of that zone. It's the starting location. He disapparated from point a and apparated on point b.

Apparate has the caveat though. While it means arriving to the destination, it also has a wider usage for the action itself. The spell is not an apparation/disapparation spell. It's merely an apparition spell.

When you perform the entire action, you apparate.

The Dobby story is clear - he came into the cellar, so he apparated into it. Say his starting location was the a meadow.

Dobby disapparated on the medow (exited the medow) and apparated in the cellar (Entered the cellar)

The same aproach can be used with what Hermione is saying. You cannot disapparate in Hogwarts - your teleport cannot have a start point in Hogwarts.

You cannot Apparate into Hogwarts - your teleport cannot end in Hogwarts.

I recommend mentally renaming it to enter and exit. Imagine you are going trough a doorway from outside to inside. You disapparate outside and apparate inside.
