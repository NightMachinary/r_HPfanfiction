As far as I can tell, it's the coming and going that's important.

Note that in GoF, Snape says:

#+begin_quote
  When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side.
#+end_quote

The fact that he specifically mentions both suggests they are different acts. As such, you Disapparate *from* one place and Apparate *(in)to* another, but the sum total of Disapparating and Apparating between places is simply called Apparating/Apparition.
