Yes, in that way it is two acts, but what Snape says suggests that one Disapparates first from where one is and then in a seperate action Apparates to a new location, which would mean that one could Disapparate but not Apparate and thereby be nowhere at all. Otherwise he could have just said "When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Apparate, instantly, at his side." However this explanation is not otherwise supported by canon so I suppose it is just a weird phrasing on Snape's part.
