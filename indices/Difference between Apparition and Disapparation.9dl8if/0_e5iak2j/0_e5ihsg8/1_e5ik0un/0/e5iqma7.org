  The fact that he specifically mentions both suggests they are different acts. As such, you Disapparate from one place and Apparate (in)to another, but the sum total of Disapparating and Apparating between places is simply called Apparating/Apparition.

From what I remember about how the Apparition class is described in canon, this does not seem to be the case. Instead, the witch or wizard decides on a target location and wills themselves there, with no seperate steps between disappearing at the original location and appearing at the target location.
