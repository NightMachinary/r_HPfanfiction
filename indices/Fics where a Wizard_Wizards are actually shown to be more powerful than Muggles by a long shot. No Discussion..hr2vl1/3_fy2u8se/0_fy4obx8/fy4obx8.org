Oh, I know /one/ fic worse than this one that isn't a dedicated badfic like /my immortal/ or /MOR/.

It's about a Harry that falls through the Veil, which turns out to be a Stargate that is locked to another, abandoned planet.

Sounds neat, right? Harry in space, surviving amongst the ruins of an alien world. Would be a great fic.

However, the entire 'other planet' thing lasts about half a chapter, and is for some reason used to power him up by having him fight against a bunch of Jaffa who he absolutely annihilates. When he finally returns (I forgot how, but it was a massive asspull) he turns the indy!harryness to eleven, returns to England which has basically not changed at all. He goes to Gringotts and gets his BloodTest™. After which he finds out he is Lord Potter™, Lord Black™ and Lord Peverell™. He, naturally, combines three Lordships into one, calling himself "Lord Potter-Black-Peverell".

But wait, there's more! He then insists that all who see him call him by this /ridiculous/ moniker, including Hermione, who fled to america when Harry "died". For some reason. And he didn't tell her he was back. So when he contacts her and says "oh btw I've been back for like 3 months" and she understandably is pissed that he didn't so much as say literally anything, he /threatens/ her for using his first name and not his moniker. He says something along the lines of "I have enough political power to make sure you're never hired by anyone, ever. I'll force you to live in poverty".

But wait, there's /more!/ Luna, of course, is a Seer™, who conveniently becomes cool and hot and not at all completely insane, and is then used to tie up the Stargate plotline in its entirety by handwaving it away using that canon's events.

It might've been the worst fic I have ever had the displeasure of reading.
