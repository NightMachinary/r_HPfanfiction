Alright, so this fic holds a special place in my heart. It's one of the worst fics I've ever, /ever/ read in my close to 20 years of reading fanfiction, but I always reccommend it whenever magic>>>muggles comes up. It has some insanely well written magic technology. When Harry meets Tony Stark, they literally dominate every single one of the MCU world's markets simply because Harry is the only source of magic, and Tony has the brains to come up with stuff that people want.

Read at your own risk. Every single plotline falls flat at the end, the Harry is the embodiment of everything that's wrong with the "Good Guy Harry" trope and they actually managed to turn the Black fucking Widow into a 2-dimensional indy!Harry Daphne Greengrass. But god damn is the magitech cool to read.
