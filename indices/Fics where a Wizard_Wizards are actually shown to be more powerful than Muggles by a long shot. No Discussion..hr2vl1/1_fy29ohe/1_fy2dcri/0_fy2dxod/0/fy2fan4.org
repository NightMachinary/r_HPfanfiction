She was. The whole school was. But that was fixed.

Ginny... I personally don't like her as a character, but she was pretty close to canon. She has to be attached to her boyfriend 24/7, gets angry, throws ultimatums when she doesn't get her way, and fights for what she wants. When you look at it from another angle, it doesn't look pretty.

Whenever I rec this fic, I do warn about the apparent bashing.
