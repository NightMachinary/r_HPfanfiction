Mmm. Her casting bat bogey at Malfoy two minutes after getting on the train for the first time was not canon, nor is her yelling and swearing at Hermione. Which also happened on the train before she stepped foot into the school. The kid was shy AF in canon at first and wouldn't talk around Harry let alone get into a screaming match with Hermione the second time she was around him.

Honestly, turning character flaws up to eleven and then focusing on those is a form of bashing. I agree with you about her as I'm not a fan either (which is probably why I found it so funny) but you have to admit that she was essentially a caricature of the love-potion-Ginny trope.

Aaaand the mental manipulation thing? That's kind of a spoiler, which is why I never talk about it :P I've recc'd this fic a LOT lol
