Ginny was not mentally manipulated, and I would absolutely call her characterization bashing (I also found it hilarious, but that's neither here nor there). Yes, there's a reason for the rest of it but it doesn't start to fade until part two and 130k words later. That justifies a warning, imo because the difference in tone (?) between part one and part five is pretty extreme.
