I really like the exploration of both sides in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/Saviour-of-Magic]])

Edit: I forgot to note that it's quite some time since I've read this and - especially the start of the story - doesn't get into muggle vs magical that much, but if you bear with the story it will have a very thorough comparison!
