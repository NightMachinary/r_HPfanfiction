I have little to no idea how the computers work. However, someone over at DLP, created Scryer, which is a "better" way to search fanfic.net. It searches all of ff.net not just DLP unless you restrict it to DLP. It lets you do a greater amount of refinement, which sometimes gets you better results sometimes just shoots back nothing.
