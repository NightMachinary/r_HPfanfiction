Im cool with unplanned pregnancy stories WHEN they make sense. If its just “oh harry im pregnant and its yours from that uh, one time we totally had casual sex that we are glossing over how that happened, you have tk marry me and fall in love now” then im gonna bounce. But if its like, thought out or something that /could/ happen based on events in the fic itself, then sure ill read it.
