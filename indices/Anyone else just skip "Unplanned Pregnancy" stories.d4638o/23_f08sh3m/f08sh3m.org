Yes - hell, I don't even read family stories (I myself would probably make a terrible father, so I don't have or want kids - don't want to let the world deal with kids I screwed up and I myself don't want to deal with kids, period!)

Pregnancy isn't cool and teenage/unplanned pregnancy is even worse! Hell, teenagers should IMHO get an abortion if this happens (having a kid and having to care for it would totally ruin their lives! They aren't financially independent yet, they aren't established, they haven't even really lived yet! Seriously, having a kid takes up a large (very large even!) amount of your available time - especially if you work full time as well - which means you don't have that much time for hobbies, friends, relaxing (kids do not care that you are tired, they can't at first and later on many will still ignore the fact that you are dead on your feet!))
