I think it can be done well outside of the Harry Potter fandom. I'll read them with smaller fandoms where you can't be as picky like Harry Potter or the fandom focuses more on romance. With Harry Potter and other fandoms it is a way to get uncommon pairings together but those just crash and burn usually with bad writing and I avoid it. If it is like former Hogwarts classmates that are friendly I'd give it a shot. However I like to read the cliched Hermione and Death eater type thing and if it comes up you know it's going to be bad.
