It's very rare to see abortion in fanfiction. I think it's because the audience for fanfic is so young, they don't really even know anything about pregnancy or family planning. I've maybe seen only one fic where the main character gets an abortion, and Ive written one myself, but it seems a lot of writers either come from conservative backgrounds, or just assume babies are a part of every romance novel (you have to admit, most of these fanfics are “romance” stories, and motherhood is part of that warped view of romance)
