I'll read them occasionally, but only because some authors do an interesting job describing magical pregnancy, like a world building type thing. But a ton of the stories I've encountered are very tropey, characters are very OOC, or they do rush the relationship aspect. Just because you're knocked up doesn't mean you're immediately gonna be in love and /happy/ together.
