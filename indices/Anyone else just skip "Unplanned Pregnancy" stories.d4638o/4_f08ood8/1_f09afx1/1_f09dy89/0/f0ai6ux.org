The way that I've analyzed Harry Potter's Magic System makes it so that Wizards and Witches are actually, physically, magic, if only infused with magic. This does explain a fair bit, like how Wizards have durability feats fairly above peak human even while unaware of danger, as well as why Wizards don't seem to have many stamina problems when using magic.

This also explains why an equivalent to Magic Circuits from Type Moon or a Magic Container from Fairy Tail isn't actually canon in Harry Potter, because of course Wizards and Witches are magic, that would only be mentioned in-depth in something like a Magic Theory class, which is literally never shown.

Anyways, under this system, it would be up in the air whether Magic Abortion is possible.
