Even ignoring the grossness of it, that is a WILD conclusion to come to; it has nothing to do with the actions in the first place! Lmao can you imagine doing that with anything else? "My infant son is crying all the time. I guess he needs to be circumcised!"

My only guess is that these menopausal mothers are having mid-life baby fever and they can't physically get pregnant themselves so they're foisting that idea onto their daughters as a weird kind of punishment for... I don't even know. Being young? Makes no rational sense
