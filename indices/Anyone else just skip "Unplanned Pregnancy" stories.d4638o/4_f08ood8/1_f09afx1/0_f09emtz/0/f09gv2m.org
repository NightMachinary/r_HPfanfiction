She is sixteen and grows older as the seasons go on. She has a boyfriend in canon, but that's just half of the pregnancy plots. The other half is Kim/Shego, a 30ish woman who is pretty much the Bellatrix Lestrange of their universe (most-feared henchman). And usually, it is some sinister plot by her evil boss of which she knows nothing about and whom she ditches when she realises that she is about to become a "father".

Also, in quite a few Kim's mother actively tries to get her daughter knocked up for some reason.
