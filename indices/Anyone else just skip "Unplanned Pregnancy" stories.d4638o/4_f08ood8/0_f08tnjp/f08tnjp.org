In a world of magic, I would probably curse them with something permanent (and get away with it! Like Hermione's "sneak" on Marietta's face...it wouldn't be sneak however, but something like asshole!)...seriously, some "pranks" (for me this is too serious to ever be considered a prank!) go too far and the "prankster" is in need of a good beating (note: I am normally against physical punishments, but there's exceptions to the rule!)
