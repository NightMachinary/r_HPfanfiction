Yes, there was a fic I read a while ago where teens would pranks each other by locking two friends in a closet with love potion. While this is pretty bad, the pregnancy that followed it seemed crazy. If my friends drugged me and made me knock another friend up I would be fucking pissed not loved up.

Why can't wizards just vanish foetuses in utero anyway??
