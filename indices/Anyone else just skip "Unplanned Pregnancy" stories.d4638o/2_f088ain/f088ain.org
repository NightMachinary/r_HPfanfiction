I agree. Personally, I find that the plot in the story is the most important point. I want a compelling and interesting narrative that delves into the Wizarding world's issues, not just skims the surface. A lot of my issues with these unplanned pregnancy stories is that they seem to skirt around those serious issues. The stories are mainly focused on the "romance" aspect, not what makes the ship work romantically. I tend to find these stories just aren't as compelling or well written so I just skip them.
