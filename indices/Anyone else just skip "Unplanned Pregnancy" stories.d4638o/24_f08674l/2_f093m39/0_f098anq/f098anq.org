I am glad to make you happy. However, now I have to tell you (no pressure! wink, wink) that I have a hard head-canon that Dudley works as a policeman with Mets (and perhaps a secret liaison with Aurors). The best use of his boxing skills (and willingness to stand to a punch) and Vernon would probably finally burst the vein, when his son works for government (not sure what's worse whether that or marrying a witch).
