As the author of the above, I got there by thinking:

​

- I think it would be interesting if Dudley had a magical child. We leave him in the books at a time when he's clearly figuring some things out and beginning to move away from the way his parents see the world: if he had a wizarding kid, it would really make him confront a lot of his own childhood and how the dynamics went on in his household and could be a really interesting story about breaking generational cycles.
- If he didn't just happen to have a magical kid, what character would he go well with?

  - Also, who do we know in canon marries a muggle? (Not that this would really be important to me anymore)

- Cho's actually a pretty great fit. She's similarly underserved by the narrative and would be interesting to explore, she has a different, complicated relationship with Harry. She's not close enough to Harry to feel weird about dating his cousin, but the romantic history makes it really funny. If you write them both a few years out of Hogwarts, you have enough leeway with both of them that you can make their characters be what you want them to be.

I started writing this in 2016 (and then discovered the first couple of chapters on my laptop this summer and decided I liked it and that I should keep writing) and at the time I started writing, I hadn't read too much fanfiction and seen that other people were doing the same thing - turns out I wasn't the first person to a) think of the pairing or b) use this specific way for them to meet.

​

Can't speak to why other people have written it, but that's what interested me about the combination!
