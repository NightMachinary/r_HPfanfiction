I was reading a few fics yesterday and it was centered around the main female character getting pregnant when she didn't want to. No mention of any other alternatives, it just focused on how she was stuck in the situation. I think not mentioning any type of contraceptive/abortion in these plot lines does a disservice.

The most thought-out "mature" stories I've read had characters properly react to an unplanned pregnancy and actually consider all their options. It's ridiculous that an unplanned pregnancy actually brings two random people together
