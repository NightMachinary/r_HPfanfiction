Ehh, I think it can be a fun way to explore some interesting concepts (How does Hogwarts deal with Teenage pregnancy? How does the wizarding world view out of wedlock pregnancy? etc).

Plus there is something interesting about taking a massive and lifechanging topic, and putting it into a world where, no matter how massive it should be, it really isn't the primary issue compared to, you know, evil magical nazi's taking over and raising zombies. An interesting perspective.

Of course, my preferred pairings (Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne, Ron/Luna) are not exactly... out there as rare pairs. The rarer ones I would like (like say, Harry/Katie) would be with him with someone around his year, not overly antagonistic... which is where I think you get a lot of these issues.
