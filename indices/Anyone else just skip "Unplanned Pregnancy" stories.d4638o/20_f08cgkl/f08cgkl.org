The idea of being pregnant and not getting an immediate abortion is terrifying to me. When I was younger and thought I'd have and give for adoption if I got pregnant, I had nightmares all the time.

I don't ever want to be pregnant, I hate babies, and I don't know if I ever want to have kids in any way, so the idea of getting pregnant, unplanned, and not immediately getting an abortion seems nuts to me. I get that some people want kids eventually, just not right this moment, and might decide the timing/circumstances aren't THAT bad, and go through with it... but deciding to get together with the other parent and coparent still seems horribly selfish to me. Parents splitting up is hard on kids, parents who don't get along is hard on kids, and that sets your kid up for that being a very likely outcome.

So... ya. I generally skip them. They set off anxiety for me, and anyway, them make everyone look like shite people and often ridiculous and completely OOC.
