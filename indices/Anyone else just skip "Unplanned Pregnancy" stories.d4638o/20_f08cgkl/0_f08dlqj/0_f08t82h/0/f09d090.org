Eh, the people with power (money, resources, influence) in their world are hung up on blood supremacy. They're the people who we'd expect to be sponsoring research ventures (or paying taxes that do so, if we think their world is appreciably socialized), and it seems unlikely they'd do so when they're not generally getting much out of it - they want to keep their blood lines pure! They don't generally need or want other people's biological children. If they've got to get rid of a pregnancy... it seems unlikely they're progressive enough that their elite want it known that their heirs had sex and worse a pregnancy outside of marriage.
