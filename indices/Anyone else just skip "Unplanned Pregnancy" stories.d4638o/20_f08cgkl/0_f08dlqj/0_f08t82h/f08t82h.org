I doubt that! They have freaking magic that mends bones in hours and can regrow vanished bones (as a muggle you'd be shit out of luck if your bones are gone! They do stay gone!)

Seriously, there have been women who were potionsmasters, healers etc. for centuries, the very idea that they don't have something to either transplant the fetus to someone who wants it or abort it is beyond stupid IMHO (magicals knew a lot more about the body than muggles did 150 years ago and even more so 200-500 years ago!)
