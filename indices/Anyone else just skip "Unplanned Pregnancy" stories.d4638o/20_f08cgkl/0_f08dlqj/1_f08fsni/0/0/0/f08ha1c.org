My ninth grade English teacher gave us the song on paper with a few edits to read and break down like as if it was a story. Listening to my teacher call a twelve year old girl immature for 30m made me want to bang my head on a wall. Especially since the song literally says she can barely spell her own name, and her family never supported her or gave a shit. To me that rings "twelve year old with 6yr olds morals and innocence, mixed with a 4 year olds knowledge." Don't get me started on how most songs shouldn't be analyzed deeply at all as then you normally completely miss the mark. Man in the Wilderness is literally someone feeling lost an a boundless world.

Edit: This was yesterday.
