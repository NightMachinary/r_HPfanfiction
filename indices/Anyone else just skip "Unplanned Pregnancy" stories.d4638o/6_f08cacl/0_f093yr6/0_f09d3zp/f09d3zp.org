I always find it a little odd when a writer will create a circumstance where I think Hermione absolutely would consider abortion even if she didn't choose to have one, only for her to transform into the glowing earth mother scattering petal wherever her non-swollen, bare feet kiss the ground. Of course these are also usually the ones where pain-free labor lasts about 10 minutes, there's no blood or goo involved, and the baby comes out clean and perfect and pink with Hermione's brown eyes, and postpartum depression or sleep deprivation don't exist.
