Honestly, I nope out of other media that does this crap too. I tapped out of Ugly Betty when they had that bitchy ex of Henry show up and imply she's pregnant with his child. Gross. I tapped out of Glee and that was the first episode. There were already a couple of tropes that annoyed me, but once the unplanned baby roping in a man stuff started, I tapped out.
