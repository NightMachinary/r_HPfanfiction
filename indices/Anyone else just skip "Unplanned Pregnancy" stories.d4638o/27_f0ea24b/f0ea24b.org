I dislike this trope in general. I'm not even sure why. Maybe because it's a complicated situation and it just makes me uncomfortable.I remember reading a story where this happened. It wasn't a bad story, but the fact that the characters barely got to spend time together before this unplanned pregnancy happened really upset me. Then it almost looks like they've skipped a step on the relationship ladder. It wasn't a death eater and a good character, but I still felt a little unsatisfied.
