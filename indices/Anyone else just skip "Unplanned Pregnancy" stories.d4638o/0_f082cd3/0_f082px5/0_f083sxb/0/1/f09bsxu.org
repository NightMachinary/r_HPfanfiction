I mean, they're right that Hermione's personality type are people who often become/identify as subs. Most people who are controlling, who rule with an iron fist in their day-to-day lives, are subs because it takes the burden of blame, planning, making sure everything goes right, away from them. So yes, I'd put Hermione down as a sub. I would also put Draco down as a sub, maybe a switch.
