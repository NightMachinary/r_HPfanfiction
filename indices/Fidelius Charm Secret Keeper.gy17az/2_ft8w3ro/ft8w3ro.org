Back to basics: the Fidelius works by taking a secret and hiding it in a soul. People focus a lot on where the secret ends up (the Secret Keeper) but I think you can make a lot more progress with making sense of the charm if you think about where the secret comes from.

The mechanism of the charm implies that secrets are found in souls and that the Fidelius works by /transferring/ a secret from its "natural" home (the soul of the "Secret Giver") and moving it somewhere else. By seeing the charm working as a transfer, two things become apparent:

1. Because you need access to the person whose soul the secret naturally is found within, you can't just cast the Fidelius on any piece of information you like. You're pretty much limited to hiding secrets which are within the Secret Giver's soul.

2. Because the basis of the Charm is a transfer, you cannot be your own secret keeper. But the definition of being your own secret keeper is not "residing in the hidden property", it is "receiving your own secret".

I would propose that the natural home of the secret of a property's location is the soul of the person who owns the property. This works quite well:

Grimmauld Place: Sirius Black would be the Secret Giver, Albus Dumbledore is the Secret Keeper and caster of the Charm.

Muriel's house (The Burrow is not under a Fidelius in DH; they move to Muriel's): Muriel would be the Secret Giver, Arthur is the Secret Keeper; Bill is likely the caster of the Charm.

Godric's Hollow: Lily and James are married, so jointly own the house, so are joint Secret Givers, meaning they cannot give the secret to each other. The transfer must be from the two of them to a third party. Pettigrew is the Secret Keeper. Lily likely cast the Charm.

Shell Cottage: Secret Giver is unknown. In the movies, Shell Cottage is said to belong to Muriel, but nothing is stated in the books as to its ownership. My inclination is to assume that someone other than Bill and Fleur owns it, at least at the time of DH, and that person is likely Muriel. So let's say Muriel is the Secret Giver; Bill is the Secret Keeper, and Bill cast the Charm.
