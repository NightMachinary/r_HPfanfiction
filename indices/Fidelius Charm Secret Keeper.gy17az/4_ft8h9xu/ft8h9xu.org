I always assumed that the Fidelius charm came in varying levels of power and the act of entrusting the secret to someone who could conceivably betray you made the charm stronger. It was a tremendous act of trust. If you chose to use the spell on yourself you would weaken the charm on some fundamental level that you wouldn't be able to see right away but would show up later. Like in DH when Hermione had to apparate the three of them into the forest because Yaxley (I think) tagged along and saw through the enchantments on Grimmauld place. That might not have been an issue if the charm was intact with only one secret keeper instead of everyone Dumbledore told now having that power.
