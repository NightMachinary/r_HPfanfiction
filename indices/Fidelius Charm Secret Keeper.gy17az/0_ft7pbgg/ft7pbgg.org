If I were trying to make canon fit, I'd do some handwaving about how the Order continued to study and improve the Fidelius in the 10-12 years between the wars. So that in the first war, this newly invented/recently rediscovered charm had some complicated requirements for Secret Keeper that neither James nor Lily fit, but by the time the second war rolled around the charm had been improved to where anyone could be a Secret Keeper. Maybe Bill's the one who figured that out, I could see his job tomb raiding giving him plenty of experience in how protective charms work.

How to give Voldemort access if one of the Potters was the Secret Keeper? Easy. Make James the Secret Keeper, have Pettigrew lure him out on false pretences. Voldemort kills James; now everyone James told, including Pettigrew, is a new Secret Keeper. Pettigrew tells Voldemort the secret, Voldemort goes in and kills Lily just like canon.
