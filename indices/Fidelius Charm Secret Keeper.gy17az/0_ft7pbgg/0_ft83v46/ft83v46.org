That first point is a great explanation of why the difference exists between when james and lily had the fidelius cast and when Bill and arthur had it cast eg the spell was improved in the past 15 years.

The second point which works to take the story back to canon would suggest that if you truly want to keep the secret that the Fidelius was protecting safe the secret keeper can never leave the safety of the fidelius protected property.
