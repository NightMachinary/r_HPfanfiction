I have a possible explanation why the Potters did what they did.

If the potters were their own secret keepers, and hid there, who could visit them?

Sirius Remus and Peter... as the obvious people to be given the secret.

Now Alice or Frank or in fact anyone wants to visit. No can do.

The Potters were hiding but wanted their friends to be able to be added to the set of people in the know. They're 21 and well... not paranoid enough to live in a war against voldemort.

​

Number 12 Grimmauld place: order of phoenix, they have a secret keeper outside

And give people paper to add them to the set of people with access, because the order is a lot bigger than the Potter family, and Needs to be able to add Harry and Hermione and the Weasleys to the set of people in the know so it can be a safe house. Having safe houses nobody can use is pointless for the Order.

​

Shell Cottage: Bill & Fleur live there. They only need other Weasleys to visit, so Arthur is a good choice.

Vice versa: Bill is not with the other Weasleys, but safe anyway, so if the really need to , for example get a real healer in they can.

​

Now a Sufficient Paranoid James Potter would have been his own secret keeper.

James & Lily are therefore mostly trapped at Godrics hollow with baby Harry.

The rest of the Marauders can probably visit ( James probably isn't going to lock them out, he's James Potter.)

The only way Lily's friends can see her is if James gets regular visits by say, Sirius, acting as a courier to bring James out to add persons to the knowing set.

Actually some obvious risks to that.

Catch Sirius and imperio him and James comes out with Sirius and well, Harry has one less parent. How long can you live at a cottage without going out for groceries.
