Do we get confirmation that Yaxley actually gains access to Grimmauld, though? It's been a long time since I read the books, but I believe Hermione just wasn't entirely sure Grimmauld was still a safe hideout. Did Yaxley actually learn the secret by travelling there with the trio, or is there the possibility that he could have been left there, staring at nothing where the house was supposed to be?
