When Yaxley followed Hermione, Harry, and Ron through apparition, the secret was exposed to him. This means that each time Lily or James left the house (which they definitely /will/ want to do, as we've seen with quarantine), they would risk not only their lives, but their location. Granted, the Death Eater(s) who discover their location won't be able to blab, but you don't want your enemy knowing where you live, as then they could sneak attack. If it were me, I'd want the secret keeper to be someone who never visits the place, so can never give away its secret accidentally.
