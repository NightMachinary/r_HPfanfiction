The most recommended one seems to be Magical Metamorphosis, which features trans girl Harry. It's decent, and definitely gives off some real feelgood vibes, though I'm not 100% sold on the characterizations. Still, worth checking out.

One fic I've recently discovered and really like so far is My Name Is Ron, which features pre-Hogwarts Ron as a trans boy. The rest of the Weasleys are portrayed as not really understanding what he's going through, and Ron simply doesn't have the language to explain... and their reactions to "Veronica" repeatedly claiming to be a boy range from total acceptance (Ginny) to bewildered concern and seeking a cure for the condition (Molly and to a lesser extent Arthur) to confused but supportive compliance and a resolve to learn more about this sort of thing (Charlie). I'm definitely interested in seeing how this develops.
