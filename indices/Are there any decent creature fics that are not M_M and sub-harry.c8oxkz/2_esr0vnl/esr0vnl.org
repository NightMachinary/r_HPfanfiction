linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix by midnight Jen) and its sequels all qualify, but frankly they have a few tropes of their own (like the bloody time traveling trunks among others). If you can get past that it's pretty readable.

linkffn(Infractus Somes by TekaWolf) is one of my personal favorites that is tragically abandoned. What's there is pretty good though.

Cheers!
