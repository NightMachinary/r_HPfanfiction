I know where you're coming from; ideas, after all, are plentiful and easy, But I don't think it's altogether fair to say any idea is worthless - it just isn't worth much on its own. A great idea can be ruined by poor execution and the reverse is just as true. I mean, who would want to read about an orphan boy who discovers he's a wizard and goes off to a secret school of magic?
