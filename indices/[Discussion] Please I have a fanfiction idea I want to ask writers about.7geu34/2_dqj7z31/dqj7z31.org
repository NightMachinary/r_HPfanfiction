I'm very taken with the idea of a traditional fairy tale where Hedwig is a princess enchanted into the form of an owl by a wicked fairy, and does everything in her power to save Harry, ultimately making the ultimate sacrifice for him. It wouldn't make more than a one-shot though and I'd be surprised if it hasn't been done already.

But OP, write the story you want to tell. If you try and write to please others you'll be doomed to failure because people don't like the same things. I mean, I know here on Reddit you'd be forgiven for thinking that they do, but this is a particular microcosm of the wider fandom and genuinely is not typical.
