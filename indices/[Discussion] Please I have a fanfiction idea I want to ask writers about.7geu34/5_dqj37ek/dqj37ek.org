It's possible... but you'd need to delve pretty deeply into her mindset in order to justify it. She could be like Pettigrew, in that she got complacent in her role as a pet, and simply didn't feel any need to summon up the will to become human again until danger struck. Perhaps her life was worse as a person than as an owl. Perhaps she lost herself to her owl instincts and became semi-feral.

I would say it's worth writing if you think it is worth working out. Good luck!
