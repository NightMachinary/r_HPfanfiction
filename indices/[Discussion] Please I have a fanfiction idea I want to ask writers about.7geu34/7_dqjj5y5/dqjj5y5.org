I think it would be good if you can find a reason they wouldn't show themselves to Harry. Like others have said, maybe she is a criminal or something, so she only reveals later on when she trusts Harry, or maybe she is forced by something (Harry in danger from something non canon maybe). I think that 7th year isn't really early enough to make an exciting story though. Like, all they'd do is just destroy the horcruxes and then go kill Voldemort. I would say to think about how she would change the plot if she was revealed at different times eg. before Pettigrew escapes would let her catch him so he wouldn't escape, forcing Voldemort to do something else to come back (maybe recruit Dark wizards from other countries Accidental Animagus style?) or OotP when the Dementor attacks, avoid the whole ministry hearing (because she casts the patronus and obviously she is above 17 yrs old)and replace it with some other plot.

Oh yea I'm not an author so take what I've said here with a grain of salt. This is just what I'd want to read.
