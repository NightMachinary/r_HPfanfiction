Why would she stay an owl the entire time? The war was won, even if Voldemort was still lurking somewhere (not sure how known Dumbledore's opinion was) it would be safer and easier to get a plane ticket to Prague or Rejkavik then posing as an animal.

The only reason why Pettigrew stayed as a rat was the simple fact that he did not think of traveling to Montana and making a new life there. Why would anyone else, who is not a war criminal that murdered at least a dozen people do that?

The worst part, however, is the idea of living through six books without revealing herself, especially since Harry could have used someone after the graveyard or the DoM.

The only way you could make this plot work is if "Hedwig" ended up on the wrong side of the war against her will ("help us or die"), was, therefore, wanted while looking for redemption and found Harry earlier. So we have involuntary Death Eater goon watching over Harry and teaching him about magic before Hogwarts. Harry ends up in either Ravenclaw (learn as much as you can to survive) or Hufflepuff (it is safer to be underestimated).

If you are looking to write a Harry/background character Horcrux hunt then there are far easier ways that do not require lots of alcohol to be believable on the reader's side. Tonks or Fleur ditiching their soon to be husbands, crossovers with another universe, Harry getting together with Cho and taking her on the hunt or even Harry's neighbor having served with the Mossad (still more realistic than hiding as an owl for 17 years).
