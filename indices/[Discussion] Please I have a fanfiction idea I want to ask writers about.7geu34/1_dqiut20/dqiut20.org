I am not a writer, at least certainly not a fanfiction writer, but I can give you my point of view as a reader (and I love reading Harry Potter fanfics).

Sure, your idea seems farfetched. But shouldn't you start writing first? I think that's the best way of exploring an idea and clearing your head. You've already got a few good workarounds for your idea on this thread. Why not start with them?

Also, was Hedwig really present with Harry all the time? In Hogwarts, at least, she was at the owlery, so nobody knew what she was doing during those periods. Even when Harry was back from school, he would regularly let her out. So, the argument that it's impossible to believe that she was an owl the entire time could be broken down there.

Plus, give your character a solid backstory and you'll have a good story on your hands. How about something similar to when Sirius was on the run and still tried to meet Harry in his animagus form as an explanation for why Hedwig doesn't (initially at least) reveal herself to anyone - she might be wrongly accused of some crime but at the same time she cares deeply and tries to protect Harry.

I don't know. Contrary to what others on this thread feel, I believe your idea has potential. And compared to the crazy twisting of original characters and original plotlines that is common in the fanfiction universe (even in an official work like the cursed child), I'm pretty sure your idea isn't that hard to believe.

Also, what actually drew me to your idea was the chance of Hedwig being actually Lily. I've always felt that the mother-son relationship of Lily and Harry has been grossly under-represented in both the original series and the world of fanfiction, other than Lily's protective force over Harry. I've found the deaths of parental characters like James, Lily and Sirius hard to digest, and I am thus always game for a fic where they return.

Best of luck! And count me in as at least one reader
