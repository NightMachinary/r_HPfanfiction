Uh. You can't use nukes "sparingly" unless you're a terrorist group with no base to retaliate against. If, as a country, you use nukes, everyone uses them against you. Also, to use nukes you need a huge industrial base. To develop technology that combines with magic, you need a huge industrial and magical base. To have a shot at conquering the world through warfare, you need both and a huge population base.

So, where does this army grow? Where does it spring up? And why didn't anyone realise what was happening before the magitech tanks rolled?

Also, dirty bombing Diagon Alley? That's dirty bombing London. As in the capital of the UK, who has a nuclear deterrent. Any country who does that just started a nuclear war.
