Well, first, what kind of powers do they have? If they're muggles, you're talking about ISIS - and if they somehow went after wizards, they would be toast in short order, having no defence against magic. If they're wizards, you basically have a reskinned Voldemort or Grindelwald.

So, you need to think of something that makes them a threat to the muggle world and the magical world. Something unique that doesn't look like magic, but can stand up to magic.

But... World War 3? Sorry, but if WW3 happens, it's game over. Whatever the third party does afterwards is piddly shit compared to wiping out most of humanity and wrecking technology, which means muggles just stopped being a factor. So, the best you can do is some limited brutal conflict, and hey - we have that going on in spades right now, and no one cares enough about it to unite. (If you do want WW3, you've got Mad Max 4.0 - now with magic!)
