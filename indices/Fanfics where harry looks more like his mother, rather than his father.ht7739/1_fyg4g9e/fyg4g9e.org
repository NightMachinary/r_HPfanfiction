I mean, most Fem!Harry stories I think would count.

Then there's linkffn(Harry and the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived) in which a Male Harry is cursed to be mistaken as a girl by the rest of the Wizarding world.

Also, TransFem!Harry stories like linkao3(Magical Metamorphosis) in which Harry/Holly actively makes herself look more like her mother.
