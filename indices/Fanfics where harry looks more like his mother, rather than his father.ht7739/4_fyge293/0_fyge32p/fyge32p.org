  Albus Dumbledore was sure he made the right choice when he sacrificed an innocent child. Too late he understood how terrible that mistake was. Harry Potter was not what he wanted him to be, he was not what the magical world expected him to be. He was not a replica of James. Instead, he inherited more of Lily... Far too much to be convenient.
