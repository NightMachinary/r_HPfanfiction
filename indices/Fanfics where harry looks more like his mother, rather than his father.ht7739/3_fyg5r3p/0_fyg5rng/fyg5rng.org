  Around the time most young children do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor. Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.
