Linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted)

The first fic of a complete re-write of the series. Involves Tonks being the same age as Harry, Harry being Dark but not evil (but struggling with it), and Harry being more studious. The story was quite good but I'm currently on a break from reading it because the OotP rewrite really fucked up in my opinion. It didn't completely ruin the story for me, though, and I plan on continuing it, I just needed a break. Goes completely off canon after the 5th book as well.

Later books (I think GoF) includes Harry getting a pet snake who teaches him some dark magic his old master created, as well as Occlumency. It's explained in story fairly well . Overall I'd reccomend even if I took issues with some of the writing choices made.
