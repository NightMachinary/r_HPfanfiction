Yeah, you do you, but I'd rather not read about every male character being gay. Snape, Remus, Serius, the OC "uncle" figure, all the boys in Harry's dorm....

​

Again, the writing is pretty good, but as it progresses, it starts to feel like an ode to man on man love. And I've a local club if I want to enjoy that. Again not a single m/f relationship save the Dursleys.

​

Maybe that doesn't break immersion for you, but it certainly does for me.
