Totally breaks it. I go in expecting magic, as it is, after all, Harry Potter. The fic isn't tagged as slash, so I don't go in expecting a world where every male is gay (worth noting that there aren't any f/f relationships either). Clearly, you are just looking to virtue signal here, so good job! Way to be inclusive! You've received your merit badge. Now go back to the SJW indoctrination camp from which you spawned,

For anyone who hasn't gotten the message, my issue is entirely that the story is incredibly, exclusively slash, and the author never tags it until you're 200k plus words in, which for most readers is a significant investment.
