Yeah, fair warning here, the author flat out admits they catfished you into the story by not tagging it as slash.

I started to become uneasy and suspicious during second year, and was certain of it by third, and then the author confessed.

So, if you are like me, and just don't want to read slash, best call this one a miss. Which is a shame, as minus the slash it's a pretty good story.
