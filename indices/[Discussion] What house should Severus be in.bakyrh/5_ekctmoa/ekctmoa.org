It all depends on how much is different with everything else. Is he still friends with Lily, despite being a year younger, did he still grow up in poverty and an abusive household?

He could potentially go to Gryffindor because he would have more time to think about it to be with Lily. However, Lily would not be friends with James in their first year.

All in all, I do not think he would go elsewhere. I think his heart was set on Slytherin, which is why he asked Lily to go to Slytherin with him.
