How would James and Sirius convince him into Gryffindor? And why would they want to do so, if he's a year younger than them?

The Snape as we see him during his childhood does not value any of the qualities of Gryffindor - he has next to no sense of justice, lacking in morals and is quite keen on deception. Those are virtually the opposite traits of Gryffindor.

Hufflepuff is just as improbable. While Snape does value hardwork, things like loyalty, camaraderie, team-play - these are qualities he's allergic to.

Ravenclaw is really the only real alternative to Slytherin as far as Snape's sorting choice goes, because he does prize knowledge and is considerably witty and creative.
