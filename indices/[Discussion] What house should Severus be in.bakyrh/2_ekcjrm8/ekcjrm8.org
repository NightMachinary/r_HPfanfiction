I think it would depend, first of all, how OOC he would be. Otherwise, I agree with [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] that Hufflepuff wouldn't work.

I could definitely see Snape in Ravenclaw. I think that outside of Slytherin, it's probably the best fit. I think a key difference would be how he seeks to use his knowledge. In my mind Ravenclaw Snape would be a little more innocent (maybe not the best description? ) and more interested in knowledge/potions just for the sake of knowing.
