This is how I'd rank his House placement before taking personal choices into account: Slytherin > Ravenclaw > Gryffindor > Hufflepuff

Severus isn't even remotely close to being a Hufflepuff. Also, even near the end of his life, he isn't noble (no matter what Dumbledore claims) -- he has bravery, but his other traits are more pronounced, and his view of "end justifies the means" as a spy is a Slytherin view more than anything. He doesn't have the ambition he had being 11 years old, but his traits still lean mostly towards Slytherin.

If he were to undergo a re-do, I think he'd end up in Ravenclaw -- he would reject Slytherin since he'd never want to undergo /that/ experience again, but he is neither a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff. But I can't see him outside Slytherin otherwise.

In fact, if he was born a year later, I think it'd /strengthen/ his will towards Slytherin -- it would mean a year's absence from the one positive influence on his life, whose compassion to some extent lessens his ambition to raise above his Muggle father and seeking revenge (I've always had the view that if he never met Lily, he'd ultimately become as amoral as Voldemort).
