The notion that Snape would /ever/ get into Hufflepuff is, frankly, preposterous. He is violently antisocial in temper, and cannot conceive of anything more loathsome to do with his time than help those less capable than him. He might have a certain ethics of his /own/ hard work, I'll grant you, and he can be staunchly loyal in his own way --- but even then, it is only ever to single individuals or single ideas, not to a community. Snape doesn't do teamwork, not even remotely, and for this reason he doesn't work as a Hufflepuff.

I could see plausibly him in Gryffindor or in Ravenclaw.
