Technically (and pedantically) speaking; venom could probably be considered a subset or type of poison.

The difference between poison and venom isn't about the chemical makeup or toxicology; as they're both considered different forms of toxins. It's strictly about the delivery method involved in its introduction to the body.

For a toxin to be classed as venom usually requires that it be introduced to the body in the form of a bite of some kind. Ex. spider bite, snake bite, etc.

Whereas poison is usually used to refer to a toxin that is introduced by ingestion or absorption of some form. Ex. rat poison being eaten, inhalation of a poisonous gas, skin absorption of a poisonous liquid, etc.
