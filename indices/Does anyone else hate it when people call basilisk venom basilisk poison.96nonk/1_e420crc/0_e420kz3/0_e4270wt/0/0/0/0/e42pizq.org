Poison is more widely used here, even if technically incorrect in this context. You can draw an analogy to poisoned arrows made with poison tree frog secretions, which are a contact poison. We also use poison daggers, which are often made with true poisons rather than venoms (since you'd have to milk a venomous animal otherwise).
