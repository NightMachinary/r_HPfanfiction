“Bitten/Stung/Whatever by a venomous [insert name].”

I'm not kidding, that's how you say it. Someone really dropped the ball. And that's why it's “you've been poisoned”: it sounds about 23 times less ridiculous.

Edit: Though there always is the word “envenomated”, but it's used only by biologists who study animals that interact with venomous stuff and the word sounds no less ridiculous.
