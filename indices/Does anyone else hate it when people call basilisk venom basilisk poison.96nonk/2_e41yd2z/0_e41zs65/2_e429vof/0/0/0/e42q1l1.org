But, for a non-technical discussion --- i.e. when you're not diagnosing/treating someone suffering from a specific toxic substance --- "poison" also means "a substance that through its chemical action usually kills, injures, or impairs an organism." In other words, once it's in the body, when specificity is not required by context, it is appropriate to say that "the poison is killing him" even if you're referring to a venom specifically.
