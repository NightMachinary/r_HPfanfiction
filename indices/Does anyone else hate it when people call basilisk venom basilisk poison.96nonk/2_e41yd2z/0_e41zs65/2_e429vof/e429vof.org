Envenomed was my first thought but it's actually used in context of (object) (has had poison added to it) (envenomed water); and is basically just an archaic synonym of poisoned.

Envenomated however, seems to specifically refer to the action of venom being injected into a creature directly by the bite or sting of a venomous creature. That is to say, if you extracted basilisk venom from a basilisk and then had the liquid and used it to kill someone, you poisoned them (albeit with venom). But if you are bitten by a basilisk, then you were envenomated.

The specifics (pedantics) of venom vs poison mostly has to do with how a toxin/poison is used by a creature. If they inject it (e.g. via bite or sting), then it's venom(ous). If they don't then it's poison(ous) (e.g. via touch or ingestion). But venom is a poisonous substance, just as poison is, the difference is purely in how the creature that makes it applies it.
