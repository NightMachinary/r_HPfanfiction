He was drawing close, sword in hand. Tom panicked - the sword was soaked in venom, one of the few things that could destroy him. So he did the only thing he could - awoke Ginny from the enchanted sleep, made her grab the diary lying next to her and hurl it into a nearby pipe.

Grinning victoriously at Potter's baffled face, he only had a moment to savor this victory before buckling over, the quickly increasing distance violently severing his connection to Ginny.

And then he was a book again. An indestructible book that would not be destroyed by the water that was currently carrying it to parts unknown, but still a book.

In a sense, he felt... sad, perhaps that was the right word, to never get to be Ginny again. He'd have chosen another name, perhaps, but that road was forever closed.

For the first time in his life, Tom felt like he could cry. It was an odd, odd feeling.

--------------

The water carried his diary along a network of pipes, and luckily, it was not the sewer kind. No, he was likely inside the rain water drainage pipe, which eventually fed into the great lake.

He would need to draw on the life force of nearby fish and sea animals in order to manifest a body. He hadn't wanted to before, it was unseemly to sully one's soul with animalistic parts, but in the absence of a human it was necessary.

And so, the following day, a small diary washed ashore on the far side of the Great Lake, just outside Hogwarts' wardline. And it wiggled. A fox came over to sniff at it, and instantly dropped dead when its nose touched the leather.

And then, Tom Riddle was existant once more. He shook himself, his original, male, body feeling... wrong, in some fundamental way, but picked up the book with clammy fingers, brow creasing in exertion. The only reason he could even lift the book because he and it were one and the same.

--------------

Having no wand and being not much more than a soul infused with the meagre life-force of several trees and a patch of grass, Tom did not risk an apparition. Who knew what would happen if he splinched a part of himself in this state?

However, being a soul, he also had no need to eat and could not feel the cold. His original theories proved to be correct, he could not fully manifest and anchor himself to the world without a human sacrifice. He did not even need a soul to override or a body to take over, but he did require the passage through the Veil that a human death would create. He now felt rather foolish for even attempting such a showy and ultimately unnecessary ritual, especially as it had cost him his first chance at resurrection.

No, he would simply find (or create) a death, and use it as passage. Muggles were fragile, weren't they? Maybe he'd go to one of their hospitals and look there.

--------------

The white, sterile walls unnerved Tom. He felt anachronistic, disconnected from the world - the muggle world had changed so much, in so many fundamental ways. There were no asylums you could hear from across town, no nuns praying over the sick. No, it was all very... white. White walls, white coats, though he did sneak through one room (the sign had said Surgery) that looked like a murder had happened inside.

Finally, he found his invisible self in the so-called Emergency Room, and had a target in his sights. An unconscious man who, by the looks of things, had broken every bone in his body. He could not feel any thoughts and the soul had just about departed (how odd, that a muggle could die without their body doing the same), so he used the opportunity to slip through the crack left by the man's halfway-death.

The feeling was... unpleasant, to say the least. He felt jagged, inflamed - like his deepest self had been flayed alive. All his senses became clearer, unmuted by the Veil, and the jarring noises and bright colors almost made him pass out just then. But he did not, because among the stinging pain, there was another emotion he had never felt.

He was... content. calm. How peculiar. His entire life had been dominated by anger, hatred at the world, cruelty to those that deserved it. but now...

He felt... different. Unlike before. More than the sensations, more than his new flesh and blood, he...

He looked into a nearby mirror, and was glad he'd been silenced to all but himself.

For he was no longer a "he".

--------------

It took some time to come to terms with his new body (her new body? Referring to himself as female made Tom feel things he was afraid of), but the first thing he (she?) did was sneak into Diagon, under an invisibility spell, and relieve a girl about his size of her shopping bag, which was emblazoned with the logo of one of the more popular robes shops.

She would undoubtedly be angry at the loss, but he had to admit she had good taste.

Tom shook himself. Where had that thought come from? He was Lord Voldemort (what a stupid name... what?), he did not compliment people. He did not appreciate people. He had no business feeling as euphoric as he did. He was the kind of man who felt coldly satisified, not giddy. What was wrong with him?

--------------

Tom grew ever more comfortable in her (HIS!) new body, doing things totally out of character for his previous self. He'd realized that nobody, not even Dumbledore himself, would realize just who he actually was, and so he decided to forego the invisibility spells and return to one of his old haunts, Borgin and Burkes, in order to make some money. she (he!) had an alter ego to locate, after all.

In a way, being seen both made his life better and worse. On the one hand, he was paranoid to no end about being recognized. On the other, he felt extremely, concerningly warm and glowing whenever he walked freely along the alley. He had actually /cracked a smile/ at a passerby! What was happening?

--------------

As it turned out, Borgin and Burkes was not what he remembered. It was filled with dusty, cursed antiques, the least of which was its owner.

How she'd ever stood to spend a day in his presence he did not know.

The man was constantly leering, and eventually got smart with his hands - but he was quicker. Watching a human being flayed alive by his entire shop had never felt so satisfying to her.

Given that he was not exactly a legal employee and all the documentation of the shop had mysteriously vanished, no Aurors came to question her involvement in the man's death.

--------------

Eventually, through the combination of a scrying spell, a divination in molten silver and one basil leaf, she discovered the location of her alter ego. It was roaming around a forest in Albania.

However, before she could hunt it down, she had to come to terms with what to do. It was no longer as simple as performing a resurrection, because over the last few months, she had discovered that with her new body, she felt... content, might be the correct word. She no longer felt anger at the world, anger at all the people who had what she had not.

Eventually, she'd grounded herself in an occlumentic exercise and examined her brain-state. It was a basic technique, but she'd never used it before - and now she knee why. It would reveal, objectively, what her brain was like, and she was forced to admit that her current mind state was much healthier than what had driven her before.

Oh, she still loved the Dark Arts, going against Ministry law, and she did not care much for minor, victimless crimes, but the senseless murder? The torture? She was forced to realize that that had been lashing out. The self-mutilation, the constant anger and hatred at everything, the emotions dulled to nothingness... all these had vanished.

--------------

Lord Voldemort was in a dark place. There were only two pinpricks of light, and he spurned the deer he was possessing on further. He'd been travelling like this for a year by now, jumping from animal to animal and fighting its will until it withered away. It was slow-going, but the part of his mind that was not dissecting the animals' minds was busy concocting a ritual.

A ritual which would finally restore his true form, this time without all the imperfections. He would be reborn as his true self, finally complete.

He could not risk possessing a human, no no. Humans were difficult, stronger than he remembered. A tiny part of himself feared that he'd been irreparably damaged, and a few other tiny parts agreed. He could feel that he was incomplete.

Tom stepped forth from the bushes, and slammed the black diary down on the deer's head. Immediately, it went slack, and the book took on an aura unlike before. It was still a vessel, though now empty - and as a vessel, it could still hold a soul. with her alter ego thus contained, she silently apparated away.

--------------

Voldemort found himself once more, and gone was the panicked mind of the animal he had inhabited. No, it felt like he was... back inside his Slytherin dorm? Hed almost forgotten what that had been like. One of the only places that had ever felt like home.

Suddenly, there was a great drawing from above, and his body was hurled into the darkness, only to slam down onto a carpet.

Looking at himself, he saw that his body was almost completely translucent, visible only by a slight contour. Looking around, his red gaze eventually found a woman sitting opposite him... a woman who looked strangely familiar. It couldn't be.

...

"Mother?" he rasped, the very idea of sound making his body waver as it tried to hold itself together.

"Goodness no. Our mother was a useless squib, and we're anything but." she said.

Voldemort was perplexed. This strange woman... she claimed to be him?

"Are you one of the Horcruxes, then?"

"Indeed. Or, I was. Now I am not."

"I congratulate you on attaining a body. Permanent possession takes some work."

"Oh, this isn't a possession. This is a real body, created when I passed through the Veil in reverse."

"But why... why is it female?"

"Oh, Tom, we have a lot to discuss."
