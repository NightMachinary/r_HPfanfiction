It started innocently enough. Tom was in his room going through his box of treasures when his eyes landed on a golden bracelet with charms he stole from another older girl and slipped it on as well as silently clasping together a necklace and slipped on a few rings and allowed a soft smile to grace his lips as his normally cold eyes shone with content and warmth.

When Tom was 9, he stole a jumperskirt and blouse from the laundry and after the orphans went to bed, he slipped it on and twirled slightly, watching the skirt fan out slowly then settle on his thin legs. When he slipped on the jewlery and caught himself in his cabinet mirror, he nearly teared up as he ran a hand reverently over the necklace and skirt and pledged to aquire more.

11 year old Tom sat sullenly as Dumbledore explained Hogwarts and how thefting wasn't tolerated, like it was his fault the other kids were idiots, and gripped onto his jewlery he had shoved into an inner pocket he sewed onto his shorts and nodded as Dumbledore left and let out a sigh as he made plans to get his things. +Timeskip to Golden Trio Era+

Diary Tom was bored. Day in and day out, he dealt with silence and muted monochrome memories floating past as he sat cross legged under a mockery of a tree beside the Lake and tugged awkwardly at the male Hogwarts uniform he was wearing, emotions warring as he resisted the urge to take it off and burn it. It didn't... feel right to him.

When Tom possessed Ginny(poor girl. What a horrid name), he laid off on releasing the Basilisk again after that muggleborn with the camera got petrified because he got distracted by the colorful Witch Weekly Ginny read and all of the outfits inside, imagining himself in each one.

In the Chamber, Tom squared off against the supposed ‘Boy-Who-Lived' and sneered at the waif of a boy sobbing over Ginny's body before another unfamiliar feeling welled up inside of him and with a deep sigh, picks up the diary and steps back before flinging the diary in one of the deep pools and with a cocky grin, disappears back inside the diary before it sinks and Ginny awakes with a gasp of air.

Tom moaned and heaved onto the grass as the gentle bobbing of the water his diary was in nauseated him. As his prison floated, it would eventually wash up on the banks of the Thames River remain there for another few days before a sharp pain went through Tom and he passed out. When he awoke again, the smell of sewage and fish filled his nostrils and he woke up with a gasp and looked around, unaware of where he was at first. ‘The Thames..? How did I..?' He looked down and poked at himself and felt solid flesh and a beating heart and the soggy diary. ‘I-I'm out. But.. how?'

Tom took the next few days reorienting himself with how much London has changed since the 20s and after a bit of mind magic and spellwork, he had himself a comfortable flat not that far from Diagon Alley working at a coffeeshop and was secretly overjoyed at the malls, which boasted an assortment of clothes. Within a month, Tom Marvolo Riddle was gone and in his place was Evelynn Merope Edwards.
