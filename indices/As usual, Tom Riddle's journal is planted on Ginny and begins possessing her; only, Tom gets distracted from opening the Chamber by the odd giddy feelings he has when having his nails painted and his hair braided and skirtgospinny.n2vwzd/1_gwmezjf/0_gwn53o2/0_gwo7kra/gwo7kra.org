One of my main thoughts with this was that Tom, being a 16-year-old from the 30's and 40's, probably would not be well-versed in gender theory and would therefore be less likely to connect the dots. I also figured that he (and I'll keep using male pronouns and the name Tom since in my fic he doesn't identify as female until after taking over Ginny) is still Voldemort. He's still the wizard that killed his parents as a teenager and willingly set a basilisk on a school full of children. It would be cracky and funny for him to go from "KILLL THE MUDBLOODS" to "hehe twirly skirt go brrr" but that seemed massively out of character. Which, yeah, crackfics do lean towards out of character characters, but I did want it somewhat realistic. The rest of it was trying to convey to the reader that Tom had some stuff to figure out without making it so obvious that you wonder why he hadn't yet.
