Tom couldn't really remember being a diary. He was one, he knew, but he didn't really remember it. He remembered being a 16-year-old boy. Then he remembered being inside this 11-year-old girl's head. There was no in-between, no knowledge of whatever strategy he'd used to get in there. That was fine. Even being so young was surely preferable to being an inanimate object.

Every time he slipped into Ginny's head (and wasn't that such a terrible name, Ginny? He would have chosen something nicer and more regal. Perhaps Elizabeth, like the princess) it got easier. Her mental defenses were weakening and every time he felt more at home. It wouldn't be long until Ginny was completely overwritten by Tom, and then he could steal her life to regain his own.

In early February, he decided not to let the basilisk free, just once. He needed a feel on how the school was handling the situation, and to see how the students were reacting. No plan could succeed without intelligence, after all. Plus it was a Saturday. Ginny had come to the Chamber wearing a long skirt, and he had to admit there was something oddly satisfying in seeing the end of it fly away as he turned a corner sharply. Checking to make sure the corridor was clear in both directions, he tried a quick twirl. Yes, extremely satisfying indeed.

He knew Ginny suspected something was wrong. He still didn't remember existing as a diary, but he somehow knew what she'd written to him and what he'd said in return. Someday, when he was free, he might have to research the sapience of souls that were removed from their bodies. That day was coming soon, and--

HE WAS A BOY! Why was he a boy again?! How had she slipped his control? She shouldn't have been able to resist him at all by this point, much less oust him and dispose of the diary. He had to stay calm. She would seek him out again, and if she didn't he could just start over. Odd how being in a boy's body after being a girl for so long felt wrong now. Show him the memory anyway. Begin to get him on side.

Ah, this was better. A mind that was prepared for him, that didn't fight when he entered. Today was about making sure Ginny wouldn't try to shake off his control again. He could read her memories, flip through them like files in a cabinet. She wasn't particularly close with the girls in her year (that was probably his fault; he couldn't really expect someone who kept running off to let loose a murderous monster to have a full social calendar), but not so distant that he couldn't mend things.

His nails were painted. Well, not really his; Ginny's, to be precise. But he was Ginny right now and therefore her nails were his, so his nails were painted. They were a soft pink that sparkled now and then, and occasionally the light shimmered across even if he held his hand still. It was magical, and magic was wonderful in all its forms. He did always love discovering new magics, and how would he have known about this? Painting nails wasn't the sort of thing boys did. But maybe it should have been.

It was odd to see Ginny from the outside. He'd generally avoided mirrors when he possessed her. He could never see Ginny's face in the mirror without wondering what he would have looked like if he'd been born a girl. He knew girls thought he was a handsome boy (learning legilimancy when no one expected you to have the skill was completely unfair. It had also turned out to be a bother; most students' thoughts weren't worth trying to read, and the few secrets he'd learned had turned out to be too salacious to be worth thinking on for any length of time), so perhaps he would have been a rather pretty girl? He would have worn his hair long, he thought, and--and this really wasn't the time, was it? There were footsteps just outside the Chamber. He knew he was the sole heir of Slytherin, but somehow someone had found their way in. No matter. They were too late.

He'd almost been wrong. If Harry Potter had come down 5 minutes sooner, if he'd been a hair faster grabbing the basilisk fang, Tom Riddle wouldn't exist now. In a way, maybe he didn't exist. It had occurred to him, at the last possible second, that perhaps Tom Riddle's death would serve a better purpose than Ginny's. The pathway into the girl's mind was still open--it was how he was extracting the last bit of her life, after all--and creating an illusion of Tom Riddle's destruction was simplicity itself, even done wandless and wordless. There were downsides to this, yes. He still would have preferred to be called Elizabeth and to have dark hair, but he was comfortable with Ginny and red hair could wear ribbons just as well. He could make the best of this situation.

Or perhaps it should be "she could." Yes, something about that felt right.
