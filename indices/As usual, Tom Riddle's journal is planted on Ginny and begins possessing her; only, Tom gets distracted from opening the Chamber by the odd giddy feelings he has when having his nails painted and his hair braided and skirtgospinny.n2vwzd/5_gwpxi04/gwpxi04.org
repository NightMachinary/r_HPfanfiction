Tom Morvolo Riddle sat on a bed in a room he only knew about from description curled up. He had messed up, instead of sacrificing Ginervra "Ginny" Weaslys body to build a new one for himself he wound up possessing it. Thankfully nothing was left of the girls soul or he'd have problems. When he was just possessing her the feelings were muted but now that this was his body he was overwhelmed by the sensations. It might have been the absence of such feelings for fifty years but everything just felt right.

He quickly found how comfortable he felt in the roll. Over the years he came to realize why. At the end of her third year she found herself at war with her original, with plans to act as spy.

The realization that the feelings she felt were more than mere hormones was a hard pill to swallow, but soon enough she found herself firmly against her original self.

In her sixth year she wound up actively fighting & witnessed the destruction of another horcruxe & her original. Never would she reveal this secret, not to her husband, her children, or her friends but it didn't matter because she was happy, even on her worst days she was happier as Ginervra Molly Potter ne Weasly than she ever was as Tom Morvolo Riddle.
