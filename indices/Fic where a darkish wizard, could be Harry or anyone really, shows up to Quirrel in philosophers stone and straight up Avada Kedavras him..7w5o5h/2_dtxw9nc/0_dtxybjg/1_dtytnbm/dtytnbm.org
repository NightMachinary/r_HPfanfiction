I'm pretty sure Voldemort isn't forced to stay with his possessed victim until they die. At the very least we see him flee Harry's body after he possesses him in OotP. You could argue that Harry forced him out, but I always interpreted it as Him just running away after experiencing the unfamiliarity with Harry's emotions.

But, please, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm going with memory in this and I've read so much fanon...
