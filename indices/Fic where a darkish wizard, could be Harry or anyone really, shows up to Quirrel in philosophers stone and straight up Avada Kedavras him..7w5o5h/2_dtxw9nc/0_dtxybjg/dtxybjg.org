I have yet to see a story involving using potions in a smart way, and just using canon potions to stop any people from commenting on made up stuff.

Also, every author always tries to kill Voldemort, but what about just trapping the guy forever? Would be a more Evil way to just let him be immortal in a coffin.

As for the lameness that is the Horcrux, present them to a Dementor. They just suck out the soul without doing stupid things to destroy them. Never understood why not a single story uses it.
