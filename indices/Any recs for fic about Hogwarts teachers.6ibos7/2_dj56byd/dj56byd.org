On LiveJournal, there was a Minerva McGonagall-specific fest that ran for several years: [[http://minerva-fest.livejournal.com][Minerva Fest]]

You might also check out [[http://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/][Hoggywartyxmas]], a holiday-themed fest that focuses specifically on the Hogwarts staff and older characters in general.

I would also recommend browsing through [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/][HP Beholder]] on InsaneJournal, an exchange fest created to celebrate HP's unconventionally attractive characters. The Hogwarts staff are often featured, although since the focus is on pairings, you won't find gen fics here. It built up a stellar reputation during the seven years it ran.
