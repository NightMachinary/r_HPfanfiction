I like this idea. Historically, the institution of knighthood - which purports to uphold the Gryffindor values of bravery and chivalry - was a classist, corrupt, and highly exclusive club with a high buy-in. The Knights of Godric could make a suitably Gryffindor counterpoint to the Death Eaters.

Meanwhile, ambition and cunning have always been the way for the determined to climb up society. Your skills and your willingness to play the game, to improve yourself and society, would be an awesome mirror to canonical Slytherin. Slytherin being all about purity, inheritance and entitlement never made much sense to me; surely Slytherin would be meritocratic as fuck? Hmm. Might write something now.
