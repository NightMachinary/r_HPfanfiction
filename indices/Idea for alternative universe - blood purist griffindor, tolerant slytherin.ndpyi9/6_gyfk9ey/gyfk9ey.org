I'm honestly not sure if much would change, the traits are largely irrelevant (you can do the mental gymnastics to explain any behaviour for any house). The Death Eaters might be a tad more blunt force and less hiding in the shadows, but given the overall plot the impact of that change would be minor. Voldemort might just use a different scapegoat. And if you change everyone and everything, you've basically just changed some colour schemes and nametags.
