In the next-gen James Potter series (by G. Norman Lippert) the Slytherins are more aligned with a progressive muggleborn activist movement focusing on empowering Muggles and Muggleborns, whereas the Gryffindors continue the canon HP message of tolerance and inclusion, which is criticized by the Slytherins as systemically blood-purist.

Unfortunately, the handling of this gets pretty heavy-handed and it's never really used as a big plot point; it's one of many wasted opportunities in that series. But I really liked the idea.
