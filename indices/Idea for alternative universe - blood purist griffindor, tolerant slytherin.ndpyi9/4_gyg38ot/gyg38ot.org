Oh my God yes I've been thinking this for years, ambition for centuries was considered against the natural order exactly because it goes against aristocracy and the kind of upper class snootery that is associated with the slytherins in canon anyway, after all ambition implies a desire to improve your own social standing and class, something that was literally illegal under feudal law, you were born a serf you died a serf, and later with the advent of early capitalism and the growth of a middle class bourgeoisie those who had earned their money through work were looked down upon as nouveau-riche. It makes much more sense in a historical perspective to have muggleborns going to slytherin as after all they literally /have/ to be ambitious to get anywhere in their new society.
