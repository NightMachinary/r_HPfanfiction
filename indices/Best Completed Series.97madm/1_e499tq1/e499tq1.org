3m words and all of it manages to tie together into something incredible. The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave, beginning with Saving Connor. It is 10 years old and was written before DH and manages to do some truly unique things. The characterization is well done and the plot is superbly outlined. I can't recommend it enough.

This is slash (it isn't graphic and only appears late Book 5), and I don't read slash and yet I devoured it in a week and regularly reread it. This speak volumes to my opinion of this series; one of the must reads in the fandom
