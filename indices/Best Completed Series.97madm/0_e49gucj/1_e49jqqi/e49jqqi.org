I've read some Sorcerer's Muse! I read the beginning of their Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter series. I lost interest halfway through CoS though. Their AU Harry and his clique in this series are self-righteous and disrespectful to other people, which I never noticed when I was really into the series but became so obvious as I got older I couldn't manage to read more.

Do you find the Children of the Flame to have the same issue? I may give it a shot. I think I have read the first one before but I can't remember much.
