  I adored the first two; after that it gets pretty AU, which I don't always love, but I still enjoyed it.

I didn't mind the AU, but there was a *bit* of a tonal and thematic shift. As you said, I still enjoyed it, but it became very much about fighting a war and people dying left and right, which probably wouldn't have drawn me into the series in the first place. The first two stories had a very different appeal.
