Same. I probably could have worded that better, but I didn't want to spoil anything. To be vague, once Diricawl comes into play, it gets into some trope territory. I've read a lot of stories with that kind of arc, and sometimes I like them. Other times, it's a little weird.

EDIT: Ugh! I tried to put in a spoiler and it just showed up as a hyperlink with the words I was trying to hide. Does anyone know the format for a black bar spoiler? Does it show up differently for me since I am the author?
