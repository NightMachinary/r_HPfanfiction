  EDIT: Ugh! I tried to put in a spoiler and it just showed up as a hyperlink with the words I was trying to hide. Does anyone know the format for a black bar spoiler? Does it show up differently for me since I am the author?

It depends on which spoiler format you were trying to use and how you view Reddit. AFAIK some spoilers like the formatting in the side bar depend on the subreddit CSS.

It should look like this: =[hidden text](/spoiler)=

[[/spoiler][hidden text]] (sometimes doesn't work for me either)

But without the CSS it won't show up correctly as you said.

The newest Reddit side-wide spoiler tag looks like this: =>!Spoiler here!<=and appears this way:

Spoiler here

This method should be most compatible.
