Meh, it is yet another one of Cannon's not fully thought out ideas. The Harry Potter series is many things, but it does not exemplify "Author did the research".

In cannon, it is just another plot-convenient device with some glaring holes. Artifacts that can entice you into a magically binding contest? Why not enter problematic dark lord #3 and hold the contest over a weekend under the school. A lot of things seem like they are broken / could be munchkined if you tried. (/cough Fidelius cough/)

This one is just as bad: If you really had a way to monitor magic, how in the world does anyone commit a magical crime?

Anyway, filling in such holes in fanfiction can be fun! Go with whatever works for the story you are trying to tell. For this one, the popular ones are: 1) No-one in the magical world ever really thought about the other uses. This is usually used in a "Harry Potter or Hermione Granger use out of the box muggle thinking to take over the world" fics 2) The spell is on the wands. (Violated pretty hard by cannon, but you still see it around). 3) Muggle Areas are warded, detecting magic. Thus allowing the memory erasing wizards to arrive and such 4) Wizarding Areas (such as Hogwarts or old houses) are shielded so the monitoring charms can't get through.

I have seen a few fics use the idea you are playing with: Magical children can practice magic in their houses because the charm can't see through the wards, giving them a leg up on studying magic. No-one cares that muggle-born children are excluded. Usually it is another way to show discrimination or unfairness. And it usually doesn't really have intent attached, just 'the way things are'.
