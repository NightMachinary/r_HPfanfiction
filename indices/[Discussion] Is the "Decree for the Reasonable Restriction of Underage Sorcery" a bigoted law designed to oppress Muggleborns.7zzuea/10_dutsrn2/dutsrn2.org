At this point I have to pull back and remember Rowlings intent rather than what seems to be in cannon. I can pretty much assume the Restriction was intended by Rowling to be a fair or protective law, but she didn't really think it out all the way.

Because if I actually go by cannon and how purebloods who make the laws feel about muggleborn, it would be obviously be a deliberate loophole filled law that is only enforceable against muggleborn. Since any pureblood or wizarding raised would have standard wards up on their property that would most likely protect against any sort of detection.
