  Is the "Decree for the REasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery" a bigoted law designed to oppress Muggleborns?

  Is this a symptom of an oppressive or tyrannical regime?
#+end_quote

No.

1. Magic is difficult. Magic is dangerous.

2. The single most important rule in the Wizarding World is the Statute of Secrecy. So yes, I'd imagine that the authorities would probably be more harsh on Muggleborns who violate the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery not because they are Muggleborns /but because if a Muggleborn is doing magic outside of school, they are likely near/around Muggles and thus are potentially breaking or risking the integrity of the Statute/.

3. From all the evidence present, in the /time in which the Harry Potter books take place/ (don't even fucking try to bring up Voldemort killing the Riddles, we are not fucking going to discuss that here), the Trace only keeps track of magic used when the underaged witch/wizard are present. And no matter what people say, Lucius Malfoy is an intelligent person, so I highly fucking doubt he would torture a prisoner or use dark magic around his son.

4. Tying back to point 1, magic is difficult and with magic as powerful as the Trace it must be even more difficult to bamboozle. Therefore, for

to be true, you'd have to have a skilled enough witch or wizard present to do so. And that list would be Dumbledore (see him with Harry during the beginning of /HBP/), Grindlewald (the evil, only a hair less skillful Dumbledore) and Voldemort. End of fucking story.

And finally, 5. Correct me if I'm wrong (paging [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]), but isn't

straight up canon?

EDIT: For formatting and below conclusion.

No, the Decree isn't being used to oppress Muggleborn. It is to protect those who have yet to complete their magical education from potentially harming themselves or others with magic (1) and it is to protect the Statute (2). As for the other concerns: most dark witches and wizards with children don't need to worry about the Trace catching them using dark magic because they aren't as dumb as most people in the fandom think (3); unless you are a part of a very, very, very small magical elite there is no way to magically bamboozle the Trace (4) and finally, of course the fucking Ministry expects parents to keep their children from doing illegal shit in the house the same way governments in the real fuckling world expect parents to keep their children from doing illegal shit in the house (5).

Let's be fucking real: Blood prejudice as a political movement is fucking dying from before the time the books take place, which is why they had to stage fucking coups to try and reverse that.
