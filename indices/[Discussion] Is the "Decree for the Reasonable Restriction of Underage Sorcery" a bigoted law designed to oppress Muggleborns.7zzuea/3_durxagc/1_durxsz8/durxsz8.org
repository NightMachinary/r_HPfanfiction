  Lucius Malfoy is an intelligent person, so I highly fucking doubt he would torture a prisoner or use dark magic around his son.

That's a strange line to draw, considering he is fine housing the Dark Lord in his mansion. I have zero doubt that he would torture prisoners while Draco is present... Lucius might even consider it educational. Edit: Also they seem to really enjoy torturing house-elves. I imagine they are pretty laid back about suffering and pain in general.

You made some good points otherwise, though it seems to me that the law is still not fit for purpose if they can't even tell who performed the magic.

If they were actually worried about safety, why not collect the wands of all underage children at the end of term and return them in the Hogwarts Express (or wherever?). This actually works and is enforceable.
