  If they were actually worried about safety, why not collect the wands of all underage children at the end of term and return them in the Hogwarts Express (or wherever?). This actually works and is enforceable

thats how its done in America, but the British allow underage wizards to use magic in emergencies. And confiscating the wands wouldnt stop people from wizarding families to use magic with someone else wand, and they wouldn't have to worry about muggleborns anyway because they can detect their magic.
