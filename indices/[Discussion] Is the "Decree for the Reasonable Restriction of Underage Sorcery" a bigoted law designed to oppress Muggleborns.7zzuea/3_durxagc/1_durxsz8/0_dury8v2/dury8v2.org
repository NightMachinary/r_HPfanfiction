  That's a strange line to draw, considering he is fine housing the Dark Lord in his mansion

Re-read point 4. He's "fine" with Voldemort being in his mansion (he isn't during 6th and 7th year, but that has more to do with the fact that he is low on the totem pole now, though I assume that's where Voldemort was during /OotP/) because with Voldemort around, you don't need to worry about the Ministry learning shit Voldemort doesn't want them to know.

  I have zero doubt that he would torture prisoners while Draco is present... Lucius might even consider it educational.

He would /as long as there were a way to do it without bringing trouble down on himself/. Hell, re-read /CoS/. He brings Draco along on his shady dealings to get rid of the stuff that could bring trouble down on himself.

  If they were actually worried about safety, why not collect the wands of all underage children at the end of term and return them in the Hogwarts Express (or wherever?). This actually works and is enforceable

1. Clause Seven of the Decree.

2. It is also about a certain measure of trust. Having magic is the ability to warp reality as you please, as long as you are skilled enough. That means, to a point, you have to trust them with responsibility. And you do that by giving them just enough leeway to see if they are trustworthy enough and responsible enough.
