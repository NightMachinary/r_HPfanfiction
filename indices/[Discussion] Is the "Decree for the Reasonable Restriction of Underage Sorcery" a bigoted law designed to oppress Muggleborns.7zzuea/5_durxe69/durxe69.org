magic isnt safe. it would be dangerous to allow people without an adult wizard living nearby to use magic in case something goes wrong.it would also be much harder for the ministry to keep the statute of secrecy. Its also dangerous for the child in case someone sees them use magic and becomes violent (like it happened with Arianna)

Tracking muggleborns use of magic is better for everyone.
