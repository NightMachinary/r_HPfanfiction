  This gives pure-blood children an unfair advantage and puts further hurdles for successful integration in front of already disadvantaged Muggleborn.

This is a common thing claimed about the Decree by fanon which. while making sense, doesn't explain how no pure-blood in canon is ever shown to have an unfair advantage over a muggleborn.

People always say that pure-bloods have an unfair advantage by being able to do underaged magic. If that was the case, it doesn't explain how Hermione (a muggleborn) was the most skilled and intelligent student of the student in her year, outclassing pure-bloods of the same age as her. If muggle-borns are actually disadvantaged, then how could Hermione be the best student out of those in her year? The very fact that a muggle-born can ever be considered the best in her year is all the canonical proof needed to show that the Decree doesn't disadvantage muggleborns nor give either pure-bloods or half-bloods an 'unfair advantage'.

Moreover, I'll be the first in this topic to mention *half-blood witches and wizards*. I don't know why people mention pure-blood wizards like they are special or have advantages, given that half-blood wizards live in wizarding families too. All the term "half-blood" means is that a wizard has traceable muggle/muggle-born ancestry back to either their parents or grandparents. Despite the lives lived by Harry and Voldemort, most half-bloods would be born to two wizarding parents, such as the children of Harry and Ginny, or the children of Ron and Hermione.

In the case of Harry and Ginny's children, they are genetically-speaking the closest that a half-blood can get to being pure-blood. Some wizards might unofficially consider Harry's children to be pure-blood even if they would be legally deemed half-bloods (due to having a muggle-born maternal grandmother). I'd argue that Harry's children get more advantages by being the children of Harry Potter than they would from being raised in what is basically a pure-blood family.

The Decree was obviously not made to screw over muggleborns, and it certainly wasn't made to give pure-bloods an advantage. Its a peeve of mine when people have Harry or Hermione rant about the Decree (typically bashing the Ministry, Dumbledore, all the Weasleys except the Twins, and the wizarding world), then find a loophole around it to show how SUPAH SPESHAEL they are. Ironically, the Decree in fanon is used to bash wizards using faulty logic and to have Harry and/or Hermione be a generically overpowered self-insert.

It's just interesting that so many people think that the Decree handicaps muggleborns and/or gives unfair benefits to pure-bloods and half-bloods... while being unable to provide any canonical examples of pure-bloods or half-bloods getting actual unfair advantages. Ron never got to learn any magic from Molly or Arthur prior to starting Hogwarts. Draco never got any tutoring from Lucius or Narcissa prior to Hogwarts. The fact that Neville is so comically bad in Potions despite being raised by his grandmother already shows that she obviously didn't teach him any magic.

The fact that Hermione was the best in her year is enough to prove both that muggle-borns aren't disadvantages and that pure-bloods/half-bloods don't get advantages at all. Otherwise, it raises another question: why did Lucius and Narcissa not actually teach Draco anything about magic? Why did Molly and Arthur not teach Ron a few basic spells (i.e. Wingardium Leviosa, Lumos, etc) before he entered Hogwarts. Why did Augusta Longbottom not teach Neville anything at Potions? Neither Ron, Draco or Neville learnt anything prior to Hogwarts, meaning they entered with as little knowledge as anyone else their age. I could understand Molly and Arthur wanting to follow the law, but Lucius and Narcissa would have given Draco a head-start if it were possible. The fact that Draco comes in to Hogwarts as ignorant as Harry proves his parents taught him nothing. Same goes for Ron and Neville too.

*TL;DR: Muggle-borns are never disadvantaged by any laws in canon. Pure-bloods or half-bloods don't get any advantages from being raised in a magical home.*
