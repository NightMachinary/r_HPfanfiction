  The very fact that a muggle-born can ever be considered the best in her year is all the canonical proof needed to show that the Decree doesn't disadvantage muggleborns nor give either pure-bloods or half-bloods an 'unfair advantage'.

Muggleborns overcoming their systemic disadvantage doesn't make the systemic disadvantage disappear. Considering they are about equal to pure-bloods now, then if they had the same opportunities as the pure-bloods they'd probably surpass them.

  If muggle-borns are actually disadvantaged, then how could Hermione be the best student out of those in her year
#+end_quote

Is that a real question? Hermione is a genius, duh. She managed to successfully cast a few spells before even attending Hogwarts, while Ron believes "Sunshine, daisies..." could be a real spell (what's going on in that household? He has multiple brothers who went to Hogwarts and two Magical parents?!). Wizards are retarded... there's probably some kind of inbreeding going on (which also explains why Muggleborns can keep up).

Furthermore: Pure-blood Wizards don't appear to have any formal schooling before the age of 11. Muggleborn have been going to school for years, with modern teaching methods that aren't rooted in the previous century. I doubt Muggleborn children would stand a chance at school if pure/half-blood wizards were smart enough to send their children to Muggle schooling before Hogwarts. Frankly I'm surprised that there aren't any an-alphabets in Hogwarts considering how spotty Homeschooling can be.

  it raises another question: why did Lucius and Narcissa not actually teach Draco anything about magic? Why did Molly and Arthur not teach Ron a few basic spells (i.e. Wingardium Leviosa, Lumos, etc) before he entered Hogwarts. Why did Augusta Longbottom not teach Neville anything at Potions?

Accidental Magic. The common theory is that magic is too unstable before the age of 11 or even dangerous to teach at a younger age.

  The fact that Draco comes in to Hogwarts as ignorant as Harry proves his parents taught him nothing.
#+end_quote

Well, he knows how to read and write at least?! I would also assume that basic Maths are a requirement for Hogwarts.

In any case, you can bet your ass that if my child went to Hogwarts and I heard what kind of education was on offer in DADA with Umbridge I'd hire a tutor over the summer. The only reason pure/half-blooded households don't do this is because they are stupid, lazy or poor (and surprise surprise, the Weasleys have all 3).
