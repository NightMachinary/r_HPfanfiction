Arguably, but you could also argue that it makes more sense to monitor muggle places more strictly, because risk of breach is higher there.

There /is/ honestly no reason for the decree to exists for places like the burrow or Malfoy manor. Any muggle close enough to see would already be a breach.

It's still unfair though. It would make more sense for the decree to only apply to magic-less places only, if you were to try and make it fair.
