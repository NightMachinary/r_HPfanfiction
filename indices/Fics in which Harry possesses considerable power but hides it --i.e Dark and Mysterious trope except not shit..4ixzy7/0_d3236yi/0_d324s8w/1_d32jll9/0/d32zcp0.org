Sadly there is, i remember reading a WBWL story where he was trained by Merlin himself. The story was so bad i can tell you all of it in 2 sentences. Imagine canon Harry Potter, now everything happens exactly the same, only thing that changes is Harry does nothing and some invisible guy does it for him. No i'm not using invisible as in he is doing it secretly, he is like right there, invisible near his brother and Voldemort and does the magic for things to go like canon. Voldemort burned because of Lily's sacrifice? Nuh-uh, super secret ancient magic Harry used super secret ancient spell while invisible to burn him. That was not even exaggration, that example was actually from the fic itself.
