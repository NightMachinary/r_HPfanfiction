What do you mean? I love fics where Harry can shoot laser beams, cast any spell wandless and without moving, turn into any animal, fly, command every animal, is master of death, has every seat in wizengamot, owns Hogwarts, has more money than all of the others combined, knows 23 martial arts, master swordsman, trained in navy, gym master, the very best like no one ever was, owner of 7 dragon balls, member of both avengers and justice league, has sharingan, shinigami powers and devil fruit, and lo and behold when the first charms class hits he's like; "i shouldn't levitate this feather before Hermione to not give away my advantage".
