I'd like to see some well done revenge fanfiction. I mean really channeling their inner Count of Monte Christo by tearing their life apart at the seams one piece at a time. Not the retarded "I'mma yell at you until you suddenly feel bad for the shit you've shown no remorse for until this very moment" thing. I vaguely remember one Ranma story that did it relatively well, but I can't remember the name for the life of me.
