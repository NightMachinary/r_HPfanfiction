There's the guy who wrote the 1,000,000 word got crossover and is now working on a RWBY crossover. He's the best author in that community, and he's still going strong. (I can't be fucked to go look up his name) Also, the one who wrote the Oh My Goddess! crossover, but he hasn't been active in a year. Oooh, and there's a hilarious SI on Sufficient Velocity. I think it's called Amazon Mischief Maker? (Can't be fucked to look that up either) Those are the only three though. Everything else that I've seen recently sucks cock, so you're mostly right.
