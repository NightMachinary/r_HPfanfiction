  Summary: JK Rowling said: "If Merope had lived and raised Voldemort, he would have turned out to be much different, probably a better person." But just how much different?

What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it? Harry/Riddle.

  Summary: COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment. Harry/Riddle.
