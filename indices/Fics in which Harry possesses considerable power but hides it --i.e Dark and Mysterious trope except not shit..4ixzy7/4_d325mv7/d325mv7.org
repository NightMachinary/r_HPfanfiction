Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse

Harry is Death, the Pale Rider of the Apocalypse. Can't tell anyone about it, obviously. He isn't actually that powerful given he is literally Death. He gets stronger as it goes on.

I was a bit hesitant going in, but it isn't terrible. Nothing comes to mind that made me roll my eyes.
