It's always seemed quite possible to me that /that/ is the real reason the Dementors always seemed to focus on Harry so much (the "great suffering in his life making him an easy prey" idea in canon is just an educated guess, not a certainty). After all, the Dementors have it pretty swell under Voldemort, and much less so under the Ministry.
