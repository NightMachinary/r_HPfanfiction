Well if Harrymort joins with the original Voldemort, it's pretty much curtains for the Order. Maybe if Harrymort decides that the original Voldemort isn't all that and decides to oppose him too, kinda like what diarymort did in [[/u/Slightly_Too_Heavy][u/Slightly_Too_Heavy]]'s fantastic work The Imposter Complex linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/]]) then there would be a chance for the Order to make progress by pitting the two Dark Lords against each other.

That said, it could be an interesting horror/mystery if the readers are only given the perspective of the Order members and the readers are unaware of Harry being Harrymort for a long while.
