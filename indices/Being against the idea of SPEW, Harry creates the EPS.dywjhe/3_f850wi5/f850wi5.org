One of the elves, a particularly undersized elf named Tiny, goes missing after the Gringotts heist. Dobby, Winky, and the others search high and low, but given that there aren't any arrest reports, they're reluctantly forced to conclude that Tiny had tripped one of Gringott's anti-theft devices and perished.

They're elated but chastened when it turns out he was accidentally scooped into one of the bags, and he patiently informs them that EPS Tiny would never kill himself like that.
