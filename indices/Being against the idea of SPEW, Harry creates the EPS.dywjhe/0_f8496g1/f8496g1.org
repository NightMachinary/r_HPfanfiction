This sounds like a start of a revolution. A good place to start off a spin off fanfic.

I can see it as SPEW veiwing it as exploitation group while Harry believes in the culture of elves Spew promotes liberation and equal rights but goes against the 'culture' that Elfs know.

Somehow EPS can cause further restrictions on Elfs due to elf based crimes. Or possibly an elf vs. goblin war. Can you imagine the chaos it does. Heck this can be set after Voldemort's death. A fanfic where wizards aren't the main players but we get to see a different world building.

That Elfs never had to worry about bonds since instead of being bonded to a family, they are bonded to serve a government and follow the charter.
