Honestly yeah, it could work well. Mainly I was just arguing against the points given by OP.

  Hermione would be against using Elves to commit Heists. Plus SPEW is a ridiculous acronym.

While I personally would rather see Harry and Hermione work together to improve the rights of/free the elves, having the two trying to go about it in two separate ways could make for a interesting fic. It's just that I prefer them working together in some sort of /Harmony/ or something.
