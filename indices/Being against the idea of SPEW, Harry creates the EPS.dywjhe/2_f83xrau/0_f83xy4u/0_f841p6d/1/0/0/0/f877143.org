Agreed for the most part. Cutting away from that for a sec though; I only know of two fics where they /do/ work together to achieve that result, mostly it is just Hermione doing it. So them working together is already a bit unique.

Yeah, Hermione's stated goals and actual behavior are vastly different in that situation. Honestly I agree with what you are saying, it's just that them working together on this is also really rare from what I have seen.
