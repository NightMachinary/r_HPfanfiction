I get why you'd like it, but still.

SPEW actually had decent goals and great timelines before Hermione decided to ignore that.

Frankly I think it would have a been a great character arc for her if she was to look at why her activism and sneaking was ineffective.

But really, the fact is that a competing organization would be unique. I always enjoy fresh ideas in fanfics.
