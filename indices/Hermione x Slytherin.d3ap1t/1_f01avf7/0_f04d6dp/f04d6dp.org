Okay so I started reading this fic and was really enjoying it but I got to the Year 5 Summer chapter and I'm really confused. It's like something huge happened off-screen and we're only seeing the effects without knowing what actually happened. I kept reading into Year 6 and there's still no explanation... and Hermione is marking people now??? Does this ever get explained?
