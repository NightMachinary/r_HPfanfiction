I didn't notice a whole bunch of Dumbledore-bashing, though it has been awhile since I read the work, so I'll take your word for it that it was there. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of bashing at all. In a partial defense of his inactions though, I will say though that given that the fic ends in December, there wasn't exactly a whole lot of time for him to do stuff, especially given that he runs a school, and (iirc) he only had Snape saying that 'she hadn't the best home life' to go off of. I feel like many people who have suspicions on something would rather not act too early on them for fear that they would be seen as behaving too rashly.

Oh certainly I would have preferred that angle to have been taken, with Hermione dealing with a bunch of anti-muggleborn discrimination through her own house, though my own personal headcanon says that that Gryffindors also bullied other students because this is a school and people do that. But yeah Draco and Pansy seemed like much nicer versions of themselves compared to canon. It'd have been more interesting if Hermione had directly faced anti-muggleborn prejudice from the outset.

  Meanwhile, Hermione, initially set up as a brilliant, powerful, and ambitious young witch with emotional scars she is trying to hide is quickly reduced to an unrecognizable woobie, who doesn't actually do anything interesting with said brilliance, power, or ambition

She's 11/12 in the fic. She's at Hogwarts for all of three and a half months. That's not a lot of time to do brilliant stuff especially if she's still learning the ropes.
