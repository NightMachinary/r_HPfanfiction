/Mudsnake/... is a fic I really, really want to like. It's well written, and it has one of my favourite premises (Hermione Sorted into Slytherin), but it's also an exemplar of how bashing and bad fanon being spread around ruins otherwise good fic.

As with a lot of bad Hermione-in-Slytherin fic, there's constant Dumbledore-bashing (complete with his still being into "Greater Good"), and Gryffindor-bashing (because there apparently aren't enough bullies and other sources of conflict for a Muggleborn in Slytherin during Voldemort's second rise, so instead there's a gang of Gryffindor bullies out to get the protagonist).

At the start, Hermione's character seems designed to remind Dumbledore of young Tom Riddle: brilliant, powerful (whatever that means), ambitious, and deeply, deeply troubled. What would he do? Would he try to preemptively cripple this prodigy, to prevent another Voldemort? Would he try to instill in her the caution about imposing his will on others---that he himself has had to learn the hard way? Or, perhaps, teach her to fear of her own power, like he fears his own? Would he try to recruit her as an ally---perhaps an eventual successor, since Voldemort would be a common enemy? Or, would that be risking replacing one tyrant with another?

What he actually does is stick lemon drops in his ears and dance around singing La-La-La. Because that's the kind of fic this is.

Meanwhile, Hermione, initially set up as a brilliant, powerful, and ambitious young witch with emotional scars she is trying to hide is quickly reduced to an unrecognizable woobie, who doesn't actually do anything interesting with said brilliance, power, or ambition; and that's probably the saddest cut of all.
