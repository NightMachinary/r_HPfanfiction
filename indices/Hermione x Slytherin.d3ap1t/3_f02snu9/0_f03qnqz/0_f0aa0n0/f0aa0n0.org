I've had similar thoughts. Hermione in this fic has Dumbledore-grade talent (or greater) and can often power right through her problems, but all her ambitions are so /small/. I mean, she's destined to create a new "House", whatever it means. Not, say, reshape the system so that "Houses" no longer matter, just join it.

Also, I'm still waiting for her betrayal of Harry to catch up with her: her getting away with things is bordering on Suedom.

The recent turn into Dumbledore-bashing doesn't help either.
