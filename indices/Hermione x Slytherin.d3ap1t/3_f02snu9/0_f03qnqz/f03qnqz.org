I checked that out once, but it seemed to me more like "new blood" was a real thing, and Hermione's just a new-blood supremacist, rather than her making it up to turn pure-blood bigotry against them. These quotes from chapter one establish it as an actual thing:

"New Blood? the hat queried. ...why, look at that. You are New Blood. But your journey will not be an easy one. "

"Even though she'd been called the term before, it was still a jolt to hear it confirmed. She'd almost wondered if she'd made the whole thing up after all."
