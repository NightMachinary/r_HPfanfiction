linkffn(13051824) New Blood is a newer one I've enjoyed so far. It's a Hermione in Slytherin one where she's using the term "new blood" to describe herself rather than muggleborn, because she's more ambitious and willing to stretch the truth/rules than she was as a first year in canon. Because she basically made up the term, she's defining it so that she can infiltrate pureblood society and reform it from within.

I am worried it will end up as Hermione/Draco, but so far it's only in 2nd year and can also just be read as a friendship so far.
