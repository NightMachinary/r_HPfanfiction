Just cut that chunk out of his forehead with a repurposed magical ice-cream scoop. Then, since the soul-sliver wants/needs a better thing than 'cast-off chunk of forehead' it'll fight back, try to control whatever nearest it can. So you feed that lump to a toad, it becomes a Volde!Toad, and you can just carry that around in a fishbowl or something. Maybe it'll have extra-evil toad poisons, or a double-extra-long tongue.
