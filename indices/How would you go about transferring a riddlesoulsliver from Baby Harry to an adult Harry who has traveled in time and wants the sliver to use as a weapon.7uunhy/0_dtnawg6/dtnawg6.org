Questions--this is an Adult Harry that has already been through this situation and had the bit of Voldemort in him killed? So he wants to restore the piece of soul? Is the intention to remove entirely the soul sliver from Baby Harry?

I think blood would need to be involved and one of Voldemort's already-existing Horcruxes. The shared blood between the Harrys and the soul fragment in the existing Horcrux would create sympathetic links. The Horcrux would draw the soul sliver to it, but the Adult Harry's blood would absorb it. Sorta.

That's an interesting question.
