Imperius the baby into committing murder.

Feed the main part of the baby to a dementor.

Go back in time with the baby. Use the attraction between soul shards to dislodge them from the main soul. This would not result in a paradox if you use the new method of time travel which can create duplicate bodies and can avoid paradoxes. Alternatively, blah blah blah, souls are timeless, so combining soul magic and time turners grants infinite power.
