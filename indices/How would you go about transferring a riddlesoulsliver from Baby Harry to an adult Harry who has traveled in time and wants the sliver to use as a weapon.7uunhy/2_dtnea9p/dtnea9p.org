You don't need to transfer the soul. Old Harry just legilimizes young Harry and can see into Voldemorts mind.

Or you can do it the way everyone else does it in time travel fics and have old Harry imperius young Harry and make him kill some innocent person (such as Dudley) and create a horcrux (Out of old Harry, for instance).

Or you could ignore the horcrux altogether and avoid rehashing that annoying concept.
