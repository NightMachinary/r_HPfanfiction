It was somewhat realistic and kept me interested, though the writing was a little off. I can't remember exactly what it was, but I believe it was a little too much "telling" instead of "showing". Some unnatural sounding dialogue/narration as well I think. 7/10 on a writing quality scale I think, something I would have stopped reading if the premise wasn't interesting to me.
