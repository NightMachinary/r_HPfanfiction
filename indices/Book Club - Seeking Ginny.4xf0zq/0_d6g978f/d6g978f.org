I guess I'll get the actual discussion of this fic started.

Overall, I enjoyed the story. I'm very big on post-Battle, Harry/Ginny stories yet also find myself liking when the two of them get together and an extended time apart. Usually I like to see the struggles to keep it together, before it comes apart, and then comes back together. This fic wasn't quite that but still hits on a lot of what I like.

Obviously, it being written well before the series ended affects the canon and characterization. But I still felt like the Ginny I was reading was the Ginny from the books, just grown up.

The writing was very well done. It was a page-turner and for that reason alone it is a fic I'd recommend. I really enjoyed the ending as I felt it all came together realistically and dramatically.

My main issue with this story, and similar stories, is that it often felt too disconnected to the world we grew up reading. It almost felt like it was our world and not the wizarding world. In canon, there really isn't such a thing as a university, yet here Ginny essentially goes to a university like most teens do after high school. The story could have just as easily been about two completely original characters and still come off the same way. This is a problem for me. I want to feel the weight of the original series in any fic I read and it just didn't happen for me with this one.

Also, and this gripe is purely personal, while I like when Harry and Ginny go through troubles and even break up for a time, for some reason, I just hate when they pair off with other characters and especially when they sleep with others. Honestly, it makes little sense. It's fully realistic and acceptable for either character to date and sleep with other people when they are not together. But for some reason, I just hate when that happens. My guess is that after reading the series from Harry's POV, we essentially assume his role as ourselves. I doubt any of us would want to read about an ex or love interest sleeping with and dating someone else. So when Ginny dates someone else, it kind of cuts a bit deeper.

To conclude, I think this is a well-written fic that people should give a read. But as far as the Harry/Ginny genre and the specific trope of them taking time to come together for good, I think there are other fics I'd prefer that hew closer to canon and the world we grew up loving.
