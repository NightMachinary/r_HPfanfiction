I enjoyed reading this story, and at the end I almost didn't want Ginny to go back to Britain and be with Harry. My favorite parts where all the world-building that the author showed in France and the academy and I was kind of sad to see that go.

Overall, I really liked it. I did feel that the side plot of her best friend with the soap/lotion business was kind of odd and I wasn't that interested in it. Saying that though, the OC's felt very real and I connected with Brian and Christian so well, Christian in particular made me sad :/, I guess it was there to see what Ginny would have ended up being like if she never had time away from Harry? I'm also a everyone-thinks-they-dating-but-they're-just-friends trope whore so I especially loved and laughed so much at the Weasley's treatment of Brian. I wish there were more of those interactions, they were great.
