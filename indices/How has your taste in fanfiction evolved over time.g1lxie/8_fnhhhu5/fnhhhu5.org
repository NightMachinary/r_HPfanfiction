I spent a long time not really reading fanfics beyond the first few I read and then read way too many in a very short span of time.

In that binge period, I started off reading Harmony and now I basically can't stand anything that isn't Hinny.

An interesting question is whether I could read something [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14454174/chapters/33390198][like this again]]... which is Dramione, but Harry and Ginny were together during the war (until they both died). Given I read lots of next gen stuff with canon pairs in the background, maybe?
