What types of tomarry fics do you like? I know a few good ones, otherwise there's [[/r/tomarry][r/tomarry]] or [[/r/harrymort][r/harrymort]]. Also would you mind linking any animagus!Harry fics? I like a good animagus Harry in a fic but I've never actively sought one out. Indie!op! Harry's are good but you rarely get any unique ones nowadays
