Ah sht, it's been a long year of fanfiction reading and developing my tastes, I don't think I have any maguc system in mind but I do have a looooooooong list of fic ideas that spans two big notebooks, though they are very detailed

I first got into this from those youtube videos that are basically little girls making dream weddings that are separated into episodes and have way too much drama, like ”oh remus died, you've sobbed for a day and now you have to get attacked by death eaters”, I somehow got addicted to those and in one stroke of genius I searched google for more hp fan stories, and that's how I found fanfiction, I then looked at Reddit because there was probably a sub here, and there was.

Now, my first fic was a rather shameful harem fic with a sex curse linkffn(the curse's cure by dragonraptor) the ending was such a cliffhanger that I'm still annoyed at it, but whatever

From there I got into Haphne, partly because she was blonde and I had a crush on a blonde back then, I read a lot of them, probably all the ones over 80k words that are on ffn

Then I went into pure HP stories like animagus!harry, op!harry, MoD!harry and indy!harry, I'm still drawn to those powerful animagus harry stories, but I rarely find any good ones anymore

After this I got into some SG-1 xovers and all that space warfare stuff for a while. Was good read a few fics

At this point I'd found out about Ao3 and the wonders that the search engine there provided, along with reddit those are even now my fanfic searching methods, I went to search for purely well written fics and occasionally looked at all the posts in some tropes (you can just put something like slytherin or snake familiar after [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and it'll show you all the posts that contain that word)

Here I again got into spaceships + magic crossover fics and read a few more of those

I just forgot that I got into Ravenclaw!Harry almost immediately and after that it has been mostly Slytherin!Harry and then some Gryffindor and Hufflepuff stuff, then I somehow found a Snily fic, which somehow became my favourite fic to this day because of the amazing writing, references and plot, it still barely holds my #1 spot almost being beaten by an elemental harry fic that was written so frikin well it's amazing

After the tropey stuff I got into Harry/Luna and Harry/Hermione and loved those, then I thought, what the heck why not both and got into lunar harmony. There are actually very few of those sadly, same can be said for Harry/Luna, but I read a few and am still looking.

After that I just read whatever caught my eye and went with it, but after reading a single fic where there was a fleet of old enchanted ships that attacked Hogwarts, I decided to look into magical naval warfare, but sadly I have only found a single fic and an abandoned sequel, (contain smut and bondage stuff) I don't think I'd like any cross overs with PoC but I think I'm desperate enough soon.

My current pairing to read is Harmony and a rare Harry/Susan fic if I find a good one, if there's a reasonable Tomarry fic then I might read it

Tropes or stuff that i still like: powerful harry, animagus harry and magical naval warfare with old galleons, and shamefully sometimes I do like to read a good Lord HJ Potter-Peverell-Gryffinfor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Emrys-Gaunt-Greengrass-Bones-Black-Weasley-Lovegood-Granger-Evans-Snape-Prince or whatever but it's very rare

Please link some fics that fit any of those, I like my fics.

Edit: omg how could I forget my small venture into writing on a HP minecraft server, where I made very short stories that were pretty good according to my friends, but I'm pretty sure they embellished the goodness of them (I did get an O on all of them)
