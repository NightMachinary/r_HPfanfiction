Oh dear I can't remember the exact path of what I started reading. I do remember that on the early days for me I read a lot of harem/ lord Potter fics, with a good side of dumbledore/ Weasley bashing.

After a while I realized all those fics are exactly the same. Started reading some crossover works which were either “Harry gets adopted by X then goes to hogwarts” or “Harry goes missing they use the goblet of fire to compel him to return”

Now it's just turned into seeing if there are any interesting romance stories done well. Or if there are stories that subvert the tropes we've seen done to death.
