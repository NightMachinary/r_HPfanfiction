Wow my taste in fanfiction changed drastically! A small thing was a I changed from fanfiction.net to Ao3 because their formatting is cleaner and easier. For starters i remember when I first started reading I would read some drarry and some Hinny stuff. Mostly stuff canon without any tropes or anything. It was all very sweet and calm( still a sh*t ton of angst cause we love our authors) Now I read a lot of dark!harry I don't even know why it changed. Some people can't get into that stuff which I get but there really interesting to read. Another thing is that I usually stick to Harry as the mc instead of others like Hermione, Ginny etc. I also don't read marauders anymore. So my taste went dark and sort of near sighted. Ofc I read other stuff but it's more rare now.
