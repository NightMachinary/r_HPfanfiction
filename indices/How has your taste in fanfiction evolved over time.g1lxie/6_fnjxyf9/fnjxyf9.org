I've been reading for about 13 years & I still have my main interests that cut across all fandoms. Lots of hurt/comfort, family-oriented stories. I have gotten more comfortable with very AU things as time has gone on & appreciate OCs waaay more than I used to. I think I've just gotten more comfortable with creative license overall & don't worry as much about canin-fidelity.
