My overall preferences haven't changed much. I started reading fanfic as a young teenager, around the time Half-Blood Prince came out, and most of what I read was Draco-centered with various ships. I was drawn to redemption arcs, enemies-to-friends-to-lovers, and complex family dynamics. Those all still apply to my current taste. However, I was far less picky at that age, so there was a prevalence of fanon!Draco, hate sex, and so on.

Nowadays, I still primarily read Draco-focused work. I'm just fussier about it. I love character growth and grey areas, but I need the character to resemble their canon selves and grow from those existing flaws - instead of having them replaced with more romantic or acceptable ones. I have less patience for generic good girl/bad guy style tropes and bashing. It's also difficult (though not impossible) for me to read fic written prior to the last 2/3 books being released, as the characterization is understandably quite different.

I also can no longer read Drarry for the life of me, which is a bit frustrating as changes go. I'd have so much more to read if that wasn't the case.
