That is a very good question.

Well, I have been - with some breaks - reading HP FF in the last 15 years (I feel positively ancient now). My favorite pairings never changed - I love Harry/Ginny and Hermione/Krum and I love Sirius/OC and AUs with Sirius alive.

First, I read mostly romance with happy endings, often total Mary Sue or fluff. Through the years, I started to pay attention to other, more ... shall we say... psychological interesting characters like Draco Malfoy. I went through a Dramione phase. After my son was born, I started to question Dumbledore's motives to let Harry live with the Dursleys - I mean, HOW can he left a toddler with abusive family? I really do not like Dumbledore now.

But my one and only love is Sirius Black and I love good fanfiction with him but no slash.
