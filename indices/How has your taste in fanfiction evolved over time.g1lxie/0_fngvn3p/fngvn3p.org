Let's see:

*Summer 2006*

Harry/Ginny 6th and 7th year fics. My entry into the fandom was via the HPANA forums, where I happened across a link to SIYE. So initially the only fics available to me were Harry/Ginny fics. First fic I ever read was Power of Emotion by Melindaleo (you never forget your first).

Then I stumbled across FF.Net and everything changed.

*Autumn 2006 - 2008*

My teenage edgy phase. Dark Harry, evil Harry, indy!Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, etc.

Probably my gateway fic into these stories was The Scorpion Sorcerer by Volorn666. One of his author's notes contained a rant about DLP, who had just placed his fic in second place in their annual fanfic awards. He was pretty angry about not getting 1st place. My curiosity was engaged and I headed over to DLP, where I found my natural fanfic home.

This was around the time that I first started trying my hand at writing. The first thing I ever wrote (no copy of which survives, having disappeared at some point when I switched from one computer to the next) was a truly awful story about a Russian half-vampire OC who was related to the Black family, attended Hogwarts with Tom Riddle and became a Death Eater.

*2009 - 2013*

This point marks the time where I got tired of bashing, tired of endless summers of training, tired of manipulative Dumbledore and thinking dark magic was cool. This was also the period in which my views on magic solidified and grew in sophistication.

I was (and am) still drawn to powerful Harry stories, but my preference grew for a more emotionally mature Harry within fics with unique premises, often telling self-contained stories rather than indefinite epics.

This period was also the time in which I did some proper writing, paying attention to what I was doing and how to do it better, lots of critical evaluation of my own work, and starting and abandoning a number of stories as my preferences and writing evolved. The culmination of my writing in this period was The One He Feared (originally called Fawkes' Gift).

*2014 - 2017*

Dormancy. I didn't leave the fandom completely, but was much less involved. Barely read anything, just updates to the fics I was already following (which were few and far between). Still made some attempts at writing now and then, but got very little done.

*Autumn 2017 - Present*

Re-emergence and writing-focus. In this present period my focus is on writing rather than reading. It marks the period since I started Victoria Potter (a complete re-imagining of an earlier fem!Harry fic I had written).

I still occasionally open Scryer and look through the latest fics published on FF.Net, or check out fics recommended by others. But I can't remember the last time I read a fic that genuinely gripped me enough to keep me reading to the end. I open fics, I skim through them, I look for interesting ideas which engage my imagination, but I don't really consider myself a reader of fanfic anymore. My focus is entirely on writing.
