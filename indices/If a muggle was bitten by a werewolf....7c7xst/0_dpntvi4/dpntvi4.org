yes muggles can become werewolves, but they are less likely to survive a werwolf attack than wizards because they are more likely to bleed to death. And the ministry doesent kill people because they are werewolves. The ministry only wants werewolves to lock themself up during nights of the full moon. Werwolves are also only classified as magical creature when they are in wolf form. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/werewolves]]
