  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Certain actions can be considered dangerous in the aftermath of Voldemort's supposed defeat. Luckily, opening a tailor shop is not one of them. (SI!OC)
