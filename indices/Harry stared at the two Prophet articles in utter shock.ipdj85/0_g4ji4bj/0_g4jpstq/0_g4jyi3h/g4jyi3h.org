Now that's an interesting prompt: Harry Potter and the Ides of March

Harry uses his post-war fame and influence to start reforming the Ministry but the seniors who prefer the pre-Voldemort status quo assassinate him. Ron and Hermione hold an "evil that men do" sort of speech to incite the population and thus the trio ends up on the chocolate frog cards as having reformed the Ministry.
