Linkao3(C'est la vie by cwycross) has Harry time-traveling to an alternate dimension, where he is so proficient in Ancient Runes that he passes his NEWT in 4th year and becomes the Babbling's assistant/whipping boy. The author somehow makes all the cliches still utterly entertaining. /Incomplete/.

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) has Harry as a mad genius/savant who created his own runic language to explain his history to an outsider. /Complete/.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) has some interesting scenes with Harry attempting to create new spells and magics and the methods involved therein. /Complete/.

Linkffn(Blindness) has Harry as a blind scientist who gains some wildly OP magic insight and abilities that he experiments on to the hilt. /Complete/.
