At a first glance it's the classic Harry is op, has harem, dumbles evil, ron stupid fanfiction. But I think it handles the tropes really well.

And this is honestly the only fic I've ever read (and I've read a lot of Harry/Harem fics) where he is in an actual healthy polyamorous relationship where everyone is an equal and is in love with each other, instead of Harry getting 50 marriage contracts and then binding all of them with his big fat magical core so they love him unconditionally or something.
