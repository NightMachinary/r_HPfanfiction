linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; The Wolf Lord; My Brother; Chrysochlorous; The Beast Within; To Fight the Coming Darkness; 9893407; 12681634)

Eclipse is in my top 3 fav fics all time (which is funny considering I dropped halfway the first time I read, then I picked it up again during a drought and fell in love with it) and goes a bit into various magical creatures, but mostly the one that the author created, called Reach, sort of a energy vampire.

Wolf Lord has some things that you might like, a bit of pack-mind and stuff like that.

My Brother, after and during 3rd year has a lot of political and social discussions about werewolves.

Chrysoclorous, I know its a x-over with Twilight, but it's IMO the best xover and source Twilight fic there is. So there's that.

TBW has different things from usual and its quite cute. Its this fic that made me fall in love with Imagine Dragons, curiously.

To Fight the Coming Darkness has a bunch of info about Vamps and is mostly about Dementors. Not a fan of the fic, got bored halfway, but you might like it.

TF has A LOT of vampire sociaty info, there's also slaves and Dementors and other creatures. You might like it, I'd rate a 4/10.

The Unexpected, can't say cuz otherwise I'll spoil, but I've haven't found a fic where this creature is a MC.
