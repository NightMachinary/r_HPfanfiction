I feel like this kind of friendship is forged through danger only- sure, Ron and Hermione are great people, but surviving life-or-death situations also ties them closer and closer together, starting with the troll. And, the older they grow, the more war-like their camaraderie becomes. So, while "normal" friends would probably not fight monsters along your side, those who have been your brothers and sisters in arms very well might (pls forgive the awkwardness of the sentence; not my first language).

I think the au would have to start pretty early on in Harry's life for the trio to include different people, and it's absolutely annoying when he gets resorted and it doesn't ruin every aspect of his social life.
