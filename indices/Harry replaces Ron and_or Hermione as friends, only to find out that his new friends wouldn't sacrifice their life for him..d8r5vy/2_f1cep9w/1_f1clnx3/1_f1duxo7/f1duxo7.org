Ron /did/ know that Harry hadn't put his name in the cup in truth. It was more about Ron feeling devalued as a person as Hermione indicates. Further, pride and Harry being rude himself prevented them from fixing their friendship sooner.

And both Hermione and Ron made mistakes in Prisoner of Azkaban. Hermione should have been more sympathetic to Ron over Scabbers, whilst Ron should have noticed the stress she was under.
