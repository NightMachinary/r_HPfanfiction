Well, Ron is a 14 year old boy, who isn't privy to all of Harry's feelings, and isn't able to judge someone's feelings. He simply lacks the life experience and maturity to do that. So, he sees everyone talking about joining, and even if Harry never said outright "I'd like to join!", he also never said "I disagree, Ron, I wouldn't want to join."

It's therefore extremely reasonable to assume Harry wanted to enter.

Anyway, the reason I think it is an example of Ron's loyalty, is that he attempts to squash down his anger, and congratulates Harry at first. He's clearly hurt Harry didn't include him, but he's prepared to try let it go. It's only when Harry apparently lies to him that Ron gets mad. There are certainly lots of logical reasons why Ron should have believed him, but he's a teenager, whose nature is more passionate than logical. People think it's jealousy, but it wasn't. Ron is typically very supportive of special things Harry gets - Quidditch team, Nimbus, Cloak, Firebolt, Snape's potion book, the Map, etc etc.
