Ron is by no means a terrible person, and we can understand and see why he reacts that way. But it's still his choice to let his jealousy (and anger) overtake him instead of believing his friend. That's particularly true after the first day or two of their little spat.

Strictly speaking it's obviously ridiculous to define him by one moment like that - a short period of time during 4th year as a young man. But I think there's a reason that such moments stick out.

In terms of the squashing anger, I think you're misreading his words. They're not congratulatory, they read far more sarcastic and angry to me. It's particularly clear since he didn't stick down for the party - so he's been hearing a bunch of people having a good time, stewing on his own while it's going on, and finally sees Harry come up with the Gryffindor cape put on...

Yes, I can understand why he's angry. But IMO the things they went through (and how Harry never pushed his fame) should have taken precedence, and Ron seems clearly jealous to me - jealous, and angry that Harry hadn't included him. But that last part only makes sense if he's already disbelieving Harry...
