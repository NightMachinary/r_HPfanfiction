  Not really, what People always forget is that Harry actually wanted to enter the Tournament, but simply didn't know how.

Not really. Your snippets are missing context - for example, the very first one is right after the tournament is announced. There's immediately discussion about how every student seems interested in it - George and Fred immediately pronounce that they're joining, there's a whole bunch of people gazing raptly/picturing themselves as champions... and fairly explicitly, that /doesn't/ include Harry, who's watching everyone else. There's Ron dreaming about it as well. The excerpt you used is Harry drifting off to sleep - which I wouldn't consider proof of him wanting to join the tournament compared to the whole section earlier where that's pretty clearly absent (in contrast to everyone else).

(Side note, there's a fun exchange I noticed while paging through the book here. A few predictions they make up for Trelawney are a nice little prediction it seems - Harry predicting burns and getting backstabbed by a friend, for example, and Ron predicting that he'd drowned).

There's another similar daydream that happens after he's prompted by George when the Goblet is revealed, but again - to me, it being prompted by someone else + just being an idle daydream doesn't mean that he is actually interested in it. Eg, everyone's daydreamed about being in some sort of dangerous situation and coming out a hero. Does that mean that we actually want to be in danger? No.

  when hearing about the danger, he even thinks that he doesn't care about deaths that happened hundreds of years ago.

Right, because he's got no interest in joining and he's excited by all the pageantry. The most telling bit is his reaction right after it happens - yes, he didn't put his name in. But if he'd /actually/ wanted to enter the Tournament like you claim, he should be /ecstatic/.

It's also explicitly addressed after he's selected.

#+begin_quote
  Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he'd put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who'd had three years' more magical education - when he was now facing tasks that */not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he'd thought about it... he'd fantasized about it... but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream... he'd never really, *seriously/ considered entering...

Does it make sense for Ron to be jealous? Sure. But does it mean that he should be /justified/ in not believing his best friend? We can see how much it hurts Harry when he isn't believed by Ron - and after 3 years of friendship, it should have been obvious to Ron that Harry wouldn't do that. (Eg - if he'd wanted more celebrity, what better thing to brag about than re-opening the Chamber of Secrets and slaying a basilisk?).

In the end, it's something that sticks with the reader - similar to how Ron is the likeliest to be casually offensive/mean of the three (eg - book 1 comments on Hermione that make her run off and cry). Does it make him a bad or terrible friend? No. But it does stand out, particularly when one of his often stated strengths is loyalty.
