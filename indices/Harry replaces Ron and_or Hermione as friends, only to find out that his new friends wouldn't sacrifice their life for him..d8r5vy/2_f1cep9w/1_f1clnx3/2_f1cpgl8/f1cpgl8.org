  The book 4 thing was honestly pretty bad. It took about 12 hours for it to be clear that Harry was getting more grief than glory, Harry was emphatic he didn't do it, and Ron should've known Harry wouldn't do it.

Not really, what People always forget is that Harry actually wanted to enter the Tournament, but simply didn't know how.

  "I might go in for it, you know," Ron said sleepily through the darkness, "if Fred and George find out how to. . . the tournament. . . you never know, do you?"

  "S'pose not. .. ."

  Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind's eye. . . . *He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen. . . he had become Hogwarts champion. . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming. . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. Cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration.... Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn't see what he could.*

  "Death toll?" Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and *Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago*

  "Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed," said Harry. "I would've if it had been me. . . wouldn't have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?"

Ron was entirely justified in thinking Harry did it, when everyone including Harry wanted to do it.

Ron was also justified to be upset with Harry for insulting him, just for suggesting it.
