I'm not debating that, rather I'm pointing out that using Ron's age as an excuse isn't really valid if he is that age for most of the books and the fics. Meaning that if an author portrays him in such a light then you can't go around saying "Ron only did that because he was 14", because guess what he still is that age in the story.
