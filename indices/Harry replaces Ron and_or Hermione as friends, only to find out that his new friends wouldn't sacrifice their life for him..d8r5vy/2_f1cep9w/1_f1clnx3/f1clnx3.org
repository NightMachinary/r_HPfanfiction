The book 4 thing was honestly pretty bad. It took about 12 hours for it to be clear that Harry was getting more grief than glory, Harry was emphatic he didn't do it, and Ron should've known Harry wouldn't do it. It was a dangerous, scary time and Harry really did need all the support he could get and Ron abandoned him.

Ron's treatment of Hermione in general (constantly belittling her for trying to do well in school) is not good friend, and his treatment of her wrt the firebolt and scabbers in book 3 were pretty shitty, especially when you consider there were signs he had noticed she was running herself ragged with her schedule already. (She was unambiguously correct about the firebolt, and who tf thinks cat owners have any control over their cats?)

I think people do exaggerate these things to bash Ron but when the pendulum swings the other way it seems like people just gloss over some seriously shitty behavior on Ron's part.
