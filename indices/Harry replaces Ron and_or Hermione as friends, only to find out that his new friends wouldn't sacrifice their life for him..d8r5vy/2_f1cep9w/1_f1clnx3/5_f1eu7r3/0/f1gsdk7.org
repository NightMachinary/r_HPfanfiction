I'm not saying Ron's the world's worst person, but

1) Harry had given Ron no reason to mistrust him here

2) HARRY WAS THE CHAMPION OF A FOURTH SCHOOL WHICH SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

3) Harry was limited to Hermione as his only friend for weeks while a huge fraction of the school had turned on him

Actually listening to Harry and TRYING to trust him at the beginning, noticing that Harry apparently did something he couldn't possibly have done, talking to Hermione about Harry's feelings on the subject, or noticing that Harry desperately needed his best friend are all easy ways Ron could've not made this fairly huge bad-friend move.

Interesting about the problem not being jealousy though, I hadn't really thought about it.
