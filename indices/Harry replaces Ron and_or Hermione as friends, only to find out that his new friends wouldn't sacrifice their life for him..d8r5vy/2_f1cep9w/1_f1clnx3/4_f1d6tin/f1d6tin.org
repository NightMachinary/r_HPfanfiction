Hermione was not in the right in book 3. She dismissed her pet repeatedly attacking Ron's pet.

The firebolt, at least her heart was in the right place, but I dislike that because she doesn't explain it to Harry and Ron. Seriously, it would have had no conflict if she right out and said "I think Sirius Black sent it Harry, Ron. Let's take the broom to the teachers to check over so you don't die."

She also attacked Ron with birds in book 6 for having fun with Lavender.

Ron at least never resorted to violence.
