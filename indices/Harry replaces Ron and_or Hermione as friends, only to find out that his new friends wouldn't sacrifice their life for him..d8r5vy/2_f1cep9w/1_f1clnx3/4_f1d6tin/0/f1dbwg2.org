Controlling cats is impossible. Just telling her not to get a cat isn't fair. Rats should be kept in cages for their own protection.

She told them exactly what she was doing with the firebolt and Harry's life was at stake, they were not listening. Just calling the makers of firebolt and asking for a substitute while they verify it seems like a pretty obvious solution though.

I can't really defend the actions of any characters in the gas leak year. She shouldn't have done that, and I firmly believe the Hermione from books 1-5 would not have done that.
