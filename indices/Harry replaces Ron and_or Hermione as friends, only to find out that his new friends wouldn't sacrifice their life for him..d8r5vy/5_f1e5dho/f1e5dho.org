One similar idea that I've not seen fully explored is the idea that Ron FAKES being jealous of Harry in book 4 to try to lure out whoever is plotting against him.

The idea being that after their very public split someone might approach him for information and then that is something Harry can use to find out more about the latest attempt on his life.
