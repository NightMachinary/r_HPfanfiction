/Anyone/ as History of Magic prof, please, somebody exorcise Binns. Those poor children.

I have a fondness for Regulus as Potions Master (or HoM!) and Harry as Defence prof, of course. Oh, or Remus getting his old job back post-War! Newt flitting in to give special Creatures classes would be lovely, maybe he comes by once a year to surprise the NEWT (ha) students.
