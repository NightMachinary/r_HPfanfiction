Batman teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts:

He's got experience taking down magic users and monsters without a wand. Anyone (who can cast spells) can learn defense spells. Learning how to defend yourself if you don't have a wand- now that's a rare skill.

He's paranoid enough to win even Moody's approval.

He'll teach non-lethal defenses only.

He's got experience turning orphaned children into child soldiers (not a good thing, obviously, but this is Hogwarts).

He's rich enough that he could fund Hogwarts indefinitely.

Can fill some other positions with Bat Family members or rogues/former rogues:

Muggle Studies/Librarian: Barbara Gordon/Batgirl/Oracle.

Herbology: Poison Ivy.

School Councilor (because they really need one): Harley Quinn.

Caretaker: Alfred.
