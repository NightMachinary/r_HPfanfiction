You can always do what I do and go back and change it and not mention it. If my readers are confused 🤷🏼‍♀️ oh well 😂. But seriously, it's your story, and you really don't owe anyone anything. Go back and change it so that you love it, and if you feel it has really made a huge difference to the next chapter and/or the rest of the story, start with an author's note at the top and address the issue. Good luck!
