Professional authors often will have several revision passes for the entire story before publishing. I've heard of authors rearranging chapters, splitting the actions from one character into two, removing characters entirely (killing off your darlings), editing every line of dialogue, and much, much more.

If they, who have possibly spent more time writing than you've spent being alive, have to revise their stuff, what makes you think you're exempt? Writing makes a story. Editing and revision make a story good.
