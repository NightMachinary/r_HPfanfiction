probably depends on your writing goals. if it's supposed to be fun I'd change it. if you're trying to put in the hours of learning by doing, maybe this is a challenge.

​

you're writing for free (I assume) and if people don't like the fact that you changed something, they can read somethign different. at most I would keep a record of the thing that was changed in an AN or in my profile or in a separate story.

​

but then, I've never written a story, soo... make up your own mind ;-)
