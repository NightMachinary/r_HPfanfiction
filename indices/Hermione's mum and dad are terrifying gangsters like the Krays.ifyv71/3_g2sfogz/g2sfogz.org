I love the premise---and had it as a plot bunny for years---but you can't change important aspects of a character while making only tiny changes to the storyline. (Or, you can, but it makes for a crappy story.) There isn't even a particular reason for her to have Harry and Ron as friends. The only reason she would have for aligning against the canon bad guys is that she is Muggleborn.

  She wouldn't be afraid to use violence to achieve her goals as long as she didn't get caught (bullies beware).

Why would she fight against bullies? Sure, she might help you with a bullying problem, but some day, and that day may never come, she will call upon you to do a service for her. Or, she would charge a recurring fee. Luna might be able to get a good deal: Hermione might like the idea of "owning" a newspaper.

For that matter, she'd be just as likely to organise the bullies to run extortion and protection rackets.

  She wouldn't have ratted out the broomstick that Sirius sent to Harry.

How much is it worth to Harry to keep the broomstick?

That said, you are part right. If Harry were in her gang, she wouldn't go behind his back: she'd confiscate the broom and hand it over for testing.

  She would have totally disregarded Dumbledore's no-contact order during the summer before Order of the Phoenix.

Firstly, that never happened in canon either: they wrote to Harry, and Harry wrote back. They didn't put anything confidential in there, and that was a /good/ thing, even if it annoyed Harry.

Now, if you think that a Hermione raised by competent gangsters would put incriminating information into something that a house-elf can intercept without anyone noticing, then you have another think coming. (That's even assuming a canon rehash.)

  When they were on the run in book Seven, they wouldn't have starved because Hermione would have knocked over a convenience store or otherwise nicked food from a grocery. Stuff like that as an example.

If it got that far, she'd either flee the country or [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go_to_the_mattresses][go to the mattresses]]. There would probably be many more casualties on both sides.
