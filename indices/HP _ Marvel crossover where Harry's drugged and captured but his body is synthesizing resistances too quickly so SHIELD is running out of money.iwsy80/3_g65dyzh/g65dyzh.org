Found it! It was linkffn(8275548)

I don't really read slash so I ended up skipping over this in search results a couple of times. I'm rereading it now and I don't remember it being a romance story at all...

EDIT: I just reread it and this story never got to any romance before it got abandoned. I'd say it's pretty much 9 fun chapters of SHIELD trying to capture Harry at all costs
