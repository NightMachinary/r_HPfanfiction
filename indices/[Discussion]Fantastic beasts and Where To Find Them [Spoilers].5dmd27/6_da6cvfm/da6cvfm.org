Theory List:

1) We already know that Grindelwald is going to escape from prison somehow; could his arrest be somehow part of his own plot? (in a Trojan horse concept, sort of thing...)

2) Newt has been to Africa... Grindelwald does wandless magic which is also common in Africa... coincidence?

3) Who were Credence original family? I'm sooo thinking that somehow he will come back!

4) I still believe that we will see some Isolt's Gaunt's decendent from her squib daughter Martha making an appearance later on
