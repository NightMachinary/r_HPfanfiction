I enjoyed it but I was disappointed with the writing. Plot, pacing, and character development were let downs for me.

The creatures were creative, it was nice seeing magic be so prominent in the magical society, almost the entire cast was good, effects were pretty neat.

But the film felt like it was conflicted about what tone to go for. The two storylines didn't really connect in a meaningful way, and because of the misbalance of stakes in the storylines Newt's felt like a bunch of side missions.

The film had a whole lot of setup for future films and it distracted from what they were dealing with in the moment.

I suppose ultimately it's Rowling first screenplay so she deserves some leeway. I just hope she improves for the next one, or gets some help from someone more experienced.
