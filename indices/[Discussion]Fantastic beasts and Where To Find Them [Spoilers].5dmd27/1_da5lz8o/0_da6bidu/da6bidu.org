Leda Lestranger, - the taker - 'You need a giver, not a taker', said Queenie. After that, I already made stories on my mind where Leda is engaged to someone else who she doesn't love, but will never give up while carry on a secretive love affair with Newt; she uses him when she needs, gives him hope, but at the last minute shuts down and tell him that they can't be together... ooooh, I need a fanfic like this NOW!
