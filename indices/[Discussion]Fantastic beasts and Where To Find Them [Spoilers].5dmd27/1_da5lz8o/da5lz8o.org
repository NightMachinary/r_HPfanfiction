I loved it! I am SUPER interested in Leda Lestrange and if it's another Andromeda Tonks situation or another Bellatrix situation. I was so excited to see some PoC! This movie was way darker than like any of the HP movies. There was some horrible child abuse in there. And some really heavy political tones. Loved it. The CGI was a bit much but you know, minor complaint.
