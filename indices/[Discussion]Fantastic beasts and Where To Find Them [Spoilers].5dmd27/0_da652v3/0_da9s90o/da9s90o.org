Oddly enough when I left the theater I had a few thoughts but the first one was "I bet Taure hated the magical combat." What with it just being them shooting waves of magic at each other. I probably thought that because I often find myself agreeing with almost everything you say about magic in Harry Potter.

Besides combat though, the magic was stunning. I really got the sense that wizards are tiny super humans among us, bending reality to their will. It just felt very.... magical.
