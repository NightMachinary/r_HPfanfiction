First of all, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5cq70f/spoilerpiecing_together_information_from_reviews/][I nailed]] my prediction.

Unfortunately I don't take too much satisfaction in my prediction because that was the one part of the movie I disliked. I admit there was a certain visceral joy is seeing Grindelwald advancing on 20-30 adult wizards and witches and laughing off their spells. However, there are two things I really dislike about it:

1. Graves was an interesting character and it would have been great seeing him working alongside Grindelwald as his lieutenant. The decision to make Graves = Grindelwald just shrinks the cast of interesting characters.

2. Even though we only saw him briefly, all my fears about Depp playing Grindelwald are feeling rather immediate. Firstly I really don't like the look of the character. Secondly it seems clear to me that Depp is going to play him as Jack "Grindelwald" Sparrow with his trademark craziness. That's a real disappointment given that Grindelwald had always seemed to be the thinking man's villain to Voldemort's crazy. He had an ideology that was coherent and arguable, he wasn't obsessed with immortality, and he was able to convince Dumbledore that he was right (for a time). Making him nuts just destroys all that and gives us another shallow villain.

However, other than that (which is more of a worry for the future of the franchise as it was only a small part of this movie) I loved it. I felt like all the characters were reasonably fleshed out and distinct, and none of my fears about magic were realised. I was mainly concerned that magic would be nerfed against Muggles but this did not occur, and indeed all the depictions of magic were more or less in line with my headcanon. Wonderful.

I particularly loved the way the movie expanded on magic as being much more than just spells, which the fandom is generally too focused on. Magic is a much more varied thing than the neat, ordered idea many have. The Obscurus is an example of this, as is Queenie's legilimency. Her being hyper-specialised in legilimency is exactly the kind of thing that I talk about in my headcanon document, where a person's "magicalness" doesn't just vary in power but also in specialisation.

The worldbuilding was great in general. I particularly loved the look we got at a meeting of the International Confederation of Wizards (though I thought for a moment we might get a Dumbledore cameo there, but I guess he isn't on it yet). The speakeasy was also cool, as was the US magical death penalty.

I didn't even mind the hints towards a Tina/Newt romance, which lots of people complained about as coming out of nowhere. I don't think it came out of nowhere at all.

TL;DR enjoyed it a lot, liked the additions to canon, only disliked one element. 9/10
