I loved the Political tones in the film. The workings of MACUSA, the harsher muggle interaction laws, the brutally dark death penalty they have over there, I think I'd prefer being tossed into the veil honestly. The meeting of the ICW was great, it was nice to see ambassadors from asia and the Ottomans there (the dude with the fez) though I'm a bit bias as i love the ICW and Grindelwald. I've had ideas bouncing around ever since Newt mentioned working with Ukrainian IronBellys on the Eastern Front in WW1, that's mental i mean on what side was he on, what was to doing with Dragons, i can imagine they could be one hell of a Trench buster. Is it because of what he saw there that he became so protective of Animals? He mentions that Humans are the worse and most deadly animals of all so it stands that he saw some fucked up shit during the war.

The fact Newt has a Brother, Theseus, who's some hot-shot Auror for the MoM, and is important enough that ICW members get excited to see him, and he keeps in contact with Graves who himself is the HEAD of magical law in America.\\
On top of all that he's a war hero in WW1, which is interesting due the British Ministry not officially getting involved, was he on the Eastern Front too? or on the Western? Is he ashamed of Newt for being expelled?

But yeah sorry, I'm hyped for the increase of size of the WW and for all the new History and World Building brought by the Film.
