Absolutely loved it!

I feel like I need to watch it a few hundred more times to pick up on everything that I missed.

It was so detailed and I loved all the characters. Also excited to learn more about Leta (sp) Lestrange and the American wizarding community. Well, actually anything about it. I love the added layers of depth that this film added as well. The New Salem Philanthropic Society creeped me out hardcore.

Also wanting to learn more about the American wizarding currency and hoping we see more of Jacob! â™¥

Anyway, just loved it.
