Phew! Glad to hear it. When I first watched the film and read the reviews, I felt like a lot of viewers wanted a new Harry. I was so relieved it wasn't the case!

I will agree with you on the sentiment of Depp, I LOVED Farrell. (Maybe it was the robes? Or the hair? But DAMN.) Here's hoping it works out well...
