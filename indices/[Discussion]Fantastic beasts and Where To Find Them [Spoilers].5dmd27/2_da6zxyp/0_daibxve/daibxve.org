  I might get a lot of flack for this, but as someone who grew up with Harry Potter and is now an adult, I found that I enjoyed having adult protagonists more than our favourite trio... I found Newt to be more endearing than Harry, and it seemed more relatable to me.

I doubt that's a controversial opinion, especially looking at the recent demographics survey. I totally agree with you. I've had a hard time caring about yet another Harry-Hits-The-Stations-of-Canon fic for quite some time now, so I'm really excited about what a fresh breath of canon opens up in terms of fanfic.

RIP Farrell. I am NOT excited about Depp, but maybe I'll be surprised.
