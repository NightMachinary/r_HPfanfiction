Honestly, I loved it. I might get a lot of flack for this, but as someone who grew up with Harry Potter and is now an adult, I found that I enjoyed having adult protagonists more than our favourite trio... I found Newt to be more endearing than Harry, and it seemed more relatable to me.

I was surprised with how dark it was, but it definitely was a plus in my books. New York felt dark and gritty, which is totally different from when we are first introduced to Harry Potter. Honestly, when I got out of the movie last night, I could not stop raving about it.

My only complaint is that I loved Colin Farrell and the character of Percival Graves, and I would have loved to have seen more of him as a separate unit from Grindelwald. As someone mentioned previously, it would have been nice to see him in a role as lieutenant.

That being said, I didn't really disagree with what he (Grindelwald/Graves) was saying when he was arrested. I can see how and why he would be angry after the aurors blatantly went against his orders and killed Credence.

So yeah. Overall fantastic cast in all spectrums, the music was lovely, and the costumes were stunning!! I think it was a solid introduction to this new arc of films, and I am thoroughly excited for more. :)
