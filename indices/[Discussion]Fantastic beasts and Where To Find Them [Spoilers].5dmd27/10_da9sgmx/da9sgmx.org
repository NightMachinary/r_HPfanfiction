Hmmmm, I really feel bad about all of the Harry dropping Care of Magical Creature fics that exist now. They are so damn cool. Also, I would love to read a fic about Mrs. Weasley finding a job, or just what she does after Ginny goes to school, because Queenie showed us that magical cooking happens like, instantly. Cleaning is probably pretty easy too, what is she doing with her days?
