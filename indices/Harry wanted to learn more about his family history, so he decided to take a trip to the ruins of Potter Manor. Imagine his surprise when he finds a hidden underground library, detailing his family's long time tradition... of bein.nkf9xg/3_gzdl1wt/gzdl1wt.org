It would explain why 1: a Black was willing to marry a Potter and 2: why the Blacks didn't try to get Sirius back from them when he ran away.

I would imagine they would also follow the Sith/Dark Lord tradition of using a fake name (I doubt Voldemort was the first to ever do such a thing). It would certainly explain why people aren't more wary of Harry and his family, if the Light/Neutral families don't associate all those Dark Lords with the Potter family (the Dark families would either know better, or a select few would be better informed and the uninformed follow their examples) and that would be further supported by the more recent generations preferring puppet master/monopoly methods over doom and gloom and curses.

Plus, compared to a family/clan of Vikings, I can see why Tom would more consider a family of Dark Lords to produce his Equal. Obviously it but him on the ass, but it would be good logic.
