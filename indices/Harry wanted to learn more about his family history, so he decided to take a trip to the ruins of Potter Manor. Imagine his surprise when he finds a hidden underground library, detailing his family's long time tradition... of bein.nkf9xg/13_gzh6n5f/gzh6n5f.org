Everyone in the know assumed the Cloak was harmless. The Elder Wand was called the Death Stick for good reason, and while no one knew exactly why, the Resurrection Stone had similarly developed an eerie reputation. Certainly, if anyone could have traced its history, they would have blamed the stone for the decline of the Gaunts.

But the Cloak--oh, that was harmless. A good protection, as it truly hid (and thus protected) the wearer from death. And Potters were known to be sensible folk, generally accepting death when it came, not trying to avoid it or cling to life through...questionable...methods.

(Dumbledore, not liking the thought of a student in his school being able to hide so absolutely--he had had enough of /that/ with James--had added charmed threads to the cloak that allowed him to track it before giving it to Harry. Coincidentally, that also permitted Mad-Eye Moody to do so as well, letting the retired Auror believe it was a regular invisibility cloak and not the one of legend.)

But like the rest of Death's gifts, it came with a sting in the tail. More subtle, as befit the subtlest of the brothers.

It worked on the mind.

Nothing obvious, no insanity, no early dementia, not even a disorder like OCD.

No, it stoked the flames of ambition and self-worth. Not for nothing had Snape called James Potter "arrogant."

Potters always rose to the top of their chosen field and then invariably would work to change and improve it, to make it fit their own ideas of how it should be. To rework it in their own image, as it were.

And now, Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived, the Man who Conquered, the Savior, the one poised to change the world, owns the Cloak...

[This went in directions I wasn't expecting, but I was thinking about the whys rather than the whats.]
