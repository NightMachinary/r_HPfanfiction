Having the old potter family actually creating (or experimenting with) magical pottery is on its own a great prompt. A fan fiction which is just Harry rediscovering an old magical craft and utilising it in his adventures is pretty fascinating, especially since it would be very much opposite to his usual active and offence oriented style.
