You just gave me /Rick and Morty/ flashbacks of when Car kept Summer safe with the ‘melting ghost baby'.

Just imagine- You are the ardent foe of Dark Lord Potter, preparing for the most decisive battle yet. Your young daughter who disappeared without a trace the week before stumbles into your camp looking bedraggled and grimy but mostly unharmed.

As you embrace her, overcome with joy and relief at her safe return, she gives you an odd, distracted look. “Why did you not submit daddy? All you had to do was submit.”

After speaking your daughter suddenly collapses and melts into a pile of reddish brown clay.
