actually bone ash is a great ingredient for ceramic glazes :D the phosphorus in the bone ash creates beautiful subtle speckles. it's one of my favourite glaze effects. I can see the Potter family having their own set or ridiculously good looking glazes that are so enchanting and them selling cursed pottery to people :D lol
