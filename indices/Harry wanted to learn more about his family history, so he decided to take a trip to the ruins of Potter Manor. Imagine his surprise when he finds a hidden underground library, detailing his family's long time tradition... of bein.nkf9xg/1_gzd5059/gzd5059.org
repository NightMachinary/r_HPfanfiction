Blackadder the Seventh was /livid/.

‘You had /one job/!' he shrieked. ‘/One. Job!/'

Baldrick wrung his hands. ‘I know! I am /sorry/, Master!'

Blackadder sighed. ‘It's ‘My Lord' Baldrick. You're not a House-elf.'

‘Perhaps I can think of a cunning plan, m'lord!'

‘No, I'll leave that to Pogo. Pogo?'

The monkey shrieked. At that moment the prince entered. ‘Pottery? Yes, you're right, I should take it up some time,' he said absentmindedly to the monkey. ‘Ah, Blackadder, there you are. There are some lovely men in the kitchen who want to admire our house. Naturally, I let them.'

‘And let me guess,' Blackadder said through gritted teeth. ‘They want to admire /every corner/ of it?'

‘Yes, how did you know?'

‘Because it's typical Darling, that's why!'

‘While I /am/ flattered, as a prince I really can't accept such nicknames.'

Blackadder blinked. ‘Oh, I didn't mean /you/,' he spat out. ‘Me and Auror Darling go back a /long/ way.'

Baldrick pulled on his sleeve and Blackadder sighed dramatically. ‘Yes, Baldrick?'

‘M'Lord, I've gotten a most cunning plan,' the chubby man said.

‘Baldrick, remember your last ‘cunning plan'?'

‘Yes, m'Lord. To infiltrate the palace disguised as potatoes.' Blackadder nodded. ‘And that, Baldrick, is why you're servant/cheerleader and I'm the brains.'

‘But this is a /good/ plan,' Baldrick said earnestly.

‘Alright, /fine/, what's the plan?'

‘We disguise ourselves - Blackadder groaned inwardly - as potters!'

‘You mean potterers?'

Baldrick nodded. Far away, Blackadder heard the low voices of approached Aurors. ‘Alright,' he bit out. ‘Grab your stuff. Now!'

They all scrambled to the hidden cupboard to grab a disguise. Over the noise, Blackadder said: ‘Oh, and Baldrick?'

‘Yes, m'Lord?'

‘You're never gonna get our money from Gringots again!'

Hm... potterers, potter... there was a idea in that...

--------------

Several thousand of years later, in a castle far away from here, Harry Potter had History of Magic. ‘... so the 50th Goblin Rebellion started because a S. Pettigrew tried to rob Gringots. This also marks the beginning of the Potter family,' Binns droned. Harry perked up, wondering if his ancestors had fought the goblins. No such luck. ‘The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer', became corrupted in time to ‘Potter'. Linfred was a vague and absent-minded fellow whose Muggle neighbours often called upon his medicinal services. None of them realised that Linfred's wonderful cures for pox and ague were magical; they all thought him a harmless and lovable old chap, pottering about in his garden with all his funny plants.*'

Harry slumped down again. Figured. Still... perhaps family, even if it was such a boring family as his, with no centuries of experience fighting Dark Lords, /would/ be interesting to learn about... he raised his hand.

‘Yes, Peters?'

‘Are there any books about the early Potters, sir?'

Binns stared at him and blinked slowly, as if waking up from a deep sleep. ‘Ye-es,' he said. ‘They're all in the Potter Manor, of course. The Potters were /very/ interested in archiving their lives.'

‘When can we expect /your/ biography, Potter?' Malfoy called out, lifting his head from where it had been lying on his elbow.

‘Thank you, sir,' Harry said, ignoring Malfoy. ‘Where is Potter Manor?'

‘Nobody really knows, only that it's somewhere in the mountains of Wales,' Binns said, with something that would be almost curiosity if it was anyone else. ‘Now Ragnok the Brave...'

As if on cue, everyone dozed off.

Harry had never been in the library so much as in the days after that lesson, and he resolved never to do so again. The table creaked under the amount of books that Hermione brought him, and by now he was flipping page after page looking for the words ‘mountains', ‘Wales' and ‘Manor'.

‘Harry! I've got it!'

Harry navigated the labyrinth until he found Ron, pointing excitedly to a footnote.

/1. Potter Manor was last seen in the North of Wales/, it read, but as Harry watched all the numbers and letters rearranged themselves to form... something. Harry rubbed his head against the headache and read again.
