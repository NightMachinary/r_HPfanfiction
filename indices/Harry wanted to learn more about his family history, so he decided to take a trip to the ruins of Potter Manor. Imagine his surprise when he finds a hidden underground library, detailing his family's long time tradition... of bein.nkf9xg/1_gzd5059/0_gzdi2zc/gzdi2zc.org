Pt 2

Harry looked up at the hill. On top of it stood several crumbling walls. He reminded himself how unlikely it was that there was anything left, but ploughed onwards regardless, in the direction of two rocks with a electric-blue field between them, crackling like lighting.In front of it was a plaque. /Enter, blood of my blood./ Harry examined the rocks. Several knifes with what he hoped was just spots of rust stuck out of them. The meaning was obvious. Slowly, carefully, he scraped his hand past the cleanest knife.

The field fell away, with a rumbling sound.

Behind it, a divot had fallen away to reveal a dark and imposing stone staircase.

/'Lumos,'/ Harry muttered, as he stepped on the first stairstep. The white walls glittered, reflecting the light back at him. The stairs seemed to descend slowly, it's bannisters carved with a spirally S. Harry imitated the gesture with his wand and suddenly the walls came alive with stories; a tall man with black hair berating someone who looked suspiciously like Peter Pettigrew, accompied by someone looking like a Malfoy and a monkey. Then later, the same people in disguise as potterers, fleeing London, chased by goblins. The same prince from earlier, now a harmless gardener, with the darkhaired man watching from the window.
