I'd find it more amusing, I think, if you went with the route that James's father had decided to reform the family name (for whatever reason, maybe he was just a good person^{tm}) so when Harry visits Potter manor he's exploring when he finds a locked room. Eventually he gets inside to find literally hundreds of portraits of Potter ancestors, one of whom explains that Harry's grandfather dumped them all there when he inherited the manor and decided to clean up the families act.

Harry's father never knew, except for some vague historical stories about things his ancestors in the middle ages got up to, because as you said - the family went subtle, for hundreds of years they've wielded power for their own benefit from the background so they've never made the history books.

And now Harry is presented with an opportunity to pick up the crown that his grandfather cast aside.
