Pottery really is a fascinating subject. For thousands of years it was the height of technology, so much that archaeologists track ancient migrations by the style of pottery people used. There's evidence that the potter's wheel was invented before the wheel was used for transportation. Potters dedicated their lives to their craft, with secrets being held by exclusive masters, and some of their masterpieces are priceless treasures even today. It really makes sense that there would be a magical discipline in ceramics.

There are many myths and legends about containers that provide endless amounts of food, confer immortality or other blessings when drunk from, or contain some kind of spirit entity (like a genie). Pandora's "box" was really a jar, and another name for a Horcrux is a soul jar. Someone had to make all those things!

Maybe turning the wheel a certain number of times in each direction has some significance, like stirring potions, along with the measurements of the pot, mixing things into the clay or glaze, symbolic decorations, fuel, and temperature of the firing. When it comes to the classical elements, pottery would be considered earth magic, with some water and fire mixed in.
