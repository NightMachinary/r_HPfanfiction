Have a minor "Legend of Zelda" crossover idea.

In the distant past, the land was known as Hyrule. In it, the Potter family did their life's work of making pots. One day, a stranger in green entered their shop shouting "HYAH!" and smashed every pot they had for sale. Later, they learn this "Link" person was sent by the king on a mission to locate the Triforce (Deathly Hallows). Their shop being destroyed incidentally by someone sent by the king drives the Potters mad and turns them Dark. Ever since, they've been attempting to gain control of the Triforce.

Starring:

- Merlin as the Hyrule King
- King Arthur as Link (the pot-breaker)
- The Dealthy Hallows as the Triforce
- Salazar Slytherin as the Gerudo chief
- Helga Hufflepuff as the Zora queen
- Godric Gryffindor as the Goron chief
- Rowena Ravenclaw as the Rito chief
- The Potter family as Ganondorf
