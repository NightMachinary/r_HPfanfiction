I'll be honest here. This wasn't really the reaction I was expecting to my post. I knew it was old and all, but a downvote (thank god it was just one) may or may not have bruised my already hurt ego because of real life issues. So when 2 am me saw your comment, it, er, made me sad to say the least. So my apologies for the passive-aggressive shit I left here.

By the way, thanks for the links, I love them all.
