The name slips my mind rn, but the only good one I know is a SnapexHermione fanfic that I didn't read on ff.net. There's something to do with a potions accident, and the loop ends everytime with Hermione dying. As they loop through, reality starts to unravel. Riveting story, complete, excellent technical writing.
