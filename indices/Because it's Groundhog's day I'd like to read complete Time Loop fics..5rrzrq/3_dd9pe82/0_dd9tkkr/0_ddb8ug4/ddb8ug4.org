That story was evil. I hate you now.

Edit: Gah? Gah! I don't even know what to say. The ending that ended with everything ending? The lack of answers and the year and a half spent dawdling? An entire castle! And Voldemort! Voldemort! >Insert Angry Random Letters<

Thank you, for the story, thank you for the recommendation. If you have anything else up your sleeve that can make me /feel/ like that, please share. I may have to rescind my denouncement of hatred.
