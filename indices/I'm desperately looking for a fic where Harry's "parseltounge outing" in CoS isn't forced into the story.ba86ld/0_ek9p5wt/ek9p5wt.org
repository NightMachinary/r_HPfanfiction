Seventh Horcrux in case you haven't read it yet. I mean its a not a serious, but its the only fic I know of that covers all seven years and has a satisfying ending. linkffn(10677106)

This is the dueling scene in it

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy's summoned snake launched itself onto one of the students. Oh, sure, I could have stopped it, but I didn't really care. Besides, our medicine is pretty good; he would probably be fine.

  The real question is why no one else did anything. There were plenty of people around -- Severus, Lockhart, the other students -- and, as far as they were concerned, I was just a stupid second year who most certainly couldn't speak to snakes.

  Taking advantage of my opponent's distraction, I disarmed him and hopped off the stage. I do so love winning.

  "Hey, Hermione," I asked, "Who's the kid with the snake on his face?"

  "Justin Finch-Flechley," she murmured. My minions flinched at the boy's screams.

  "Everything burns!" my...erm, Malfoy's victim cried.

  "Who?"

  "He's a Hufflepuff."

  "Oh, that's alright then."

there is also Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux linkffn(11762850)

Its well written but has quite a few tropes and while the sequel is still occasionally updated I doubt its going to finish.
