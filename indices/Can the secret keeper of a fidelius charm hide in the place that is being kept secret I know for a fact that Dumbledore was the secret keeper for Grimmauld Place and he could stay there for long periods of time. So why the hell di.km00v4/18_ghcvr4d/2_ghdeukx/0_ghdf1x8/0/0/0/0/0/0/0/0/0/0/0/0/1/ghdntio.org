Totally get it, bud. Life is just a very long, embarrassing, trial of errors. Eventually you start figuring out when things are silly.

I'd recommend reading some other stories, branch out a bit.

There's a hell of a lot cooler fanfic shit out there than bashing fics. I like me some lovecraftian horror myself, when I'm not drowning myself in sappy femslash.
