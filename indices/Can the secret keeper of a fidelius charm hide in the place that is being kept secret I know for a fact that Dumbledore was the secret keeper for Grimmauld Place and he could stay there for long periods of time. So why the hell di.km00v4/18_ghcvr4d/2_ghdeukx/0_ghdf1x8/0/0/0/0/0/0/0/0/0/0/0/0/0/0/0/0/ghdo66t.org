I still can't hold a normal conversation with people. Though I'm 13. There's a fairly high chance I have autism. Especially with one of my cousins having it and it other cousins displaying obvious symptoms. Though my "family" isn't very welcoming towards anything different. They think that autistic people are messed up in the head. And maybe we are, but it's nothing to be ashamed of.
