No. There's nothing wrong with autistic people, and if anyone says otherwise they're an ass.

We just think a touch differently, and can pick some things up faster, and others slower than non-autistic folks.

Again, don't beat yourself up! Socializing is /hard,/ and pretty much everyone your age is stressing out about the same shit, and just as confused and curious about how the hell this whole 'being a human being' thing works as you are.
