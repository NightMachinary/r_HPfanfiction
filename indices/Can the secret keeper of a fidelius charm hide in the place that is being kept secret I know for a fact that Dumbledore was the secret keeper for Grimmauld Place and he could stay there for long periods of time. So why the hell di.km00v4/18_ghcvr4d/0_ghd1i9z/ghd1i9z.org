Dumbledick? Lol is this ironic? It reads like a bad fanfiction.

  So, really, I blame Dumbledore being a manipulative arse for the Potters's incident.

Why?

#+begin_quote
  The most damning piece of evidence of Dumbledore's manipulations is that he didn't order a trial for Sirius. He was the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot at that time

What evidence is there that the Chief Warlock can even do that? And what evidence would he have presented?
