It's not a matter of reasoning out plot holes really. The traditional "fanon" utilizes a variety of concepts from substandard writers; these concepts weren't very good examples of plot, and world building to begin with. Unfortunately after a game of telephone going back half a decade, these; already very flawed, concepts have become caricatures of themselves.

I have fairy high standards when it comes to what I read, and in my experience 99% of what is written in this fandom is utter trash. Fanon in this regard can be used as a major signifier of very amateur writing, this is because Fanon concepts are typically implemented by writers who lack the creativity to reason out their own solutions, or from writers who lack the world building skills(and self awareness) to realize their changes are just making things worse.
