Dumbledore has James's invisibility cloak... /Why?!/ None of the reasons for that paint a pretty picture. Especially since it's such a useful item. And a prized family heirloom at that. Also, really, Dumbledore was knowledgeable enough to know that the Potters could be their own secret keeper.

And surely he of all people knew that the maruaders were animagi? He should have recognized Pettigrew if he ever saw him.

Also, Dumbledore still has tons of influence. People follow his every whim. Nearly. And about the evidence...

There is this thing called Veritaserum, just saying. And multiple people were attesting to seeing Peter Pettigrew, too. The-boy-who-lived being one of them.

Also, being Chief Warlock of the /judicial and legislative body/ of the government is still a pretty important position. And don't you forget that.
