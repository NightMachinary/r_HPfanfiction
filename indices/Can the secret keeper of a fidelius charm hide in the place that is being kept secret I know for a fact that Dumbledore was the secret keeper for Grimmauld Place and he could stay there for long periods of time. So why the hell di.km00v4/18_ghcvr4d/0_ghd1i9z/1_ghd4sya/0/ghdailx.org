This is just blind Dumbledore bashing. You're seriously suggesting that Dumbledore planned for the Potters to die? And deliberately kept Sirius a criminal, if not kept him in Azkaban?

You've painted him as absurdly evil. You're one step away from accusing Ginny and Ron of love-potioning Harry and Hermione.

  Dumbledore has James's invisibility cloak... Why?!
#+end_quote

It's explained directly in the books. It's a Deathly Hallow and Dumbledore knows it. The Cloak wouldn't have stopped Voldemort from killing them anyway. It didn't fool Moody and Dumbledore and it wouldn't have fooled Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Also, really, Dumbledore was knowledgeable enough to know that the Potters could be their own secret keeper.
#+end_quote

You probably just couldn't be your own Secret Keeper in the Potters' time. The charm was probably just improved upon later, or there's another explanation.

  And surely he of all people knew that the maruaders were animagi?
#+end_quote

It is canon that he did not know. The Marauders only transformed once a month and well away from the castle, to our knowledge. And even if he did know (which he didn't), why would he recognize Pettigrew? He'd have to be very familiar with Pettigrew's rat form, as Sirius was, and even then he'd have to get a close look at Scabbers.

What a ridiculous argument.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Dumbledore still has tons of influence. People follow his every whim.
#+end_quote

No they do not.

- He was ousted from the school in the second book.

- He couldn't stop the dementors from being around in the third book.

- Entirety of the 5th book.

- Scrimgeour.

  There is this thing called Veritaserum, just saying.
#+end_quote

Which is unreliable and not used in court for that reason. We don't ever even see it used in court. Occlumency and potions can block it.

#+begin_quote
  And multiple people were attesting to seeing Peter Pettigrew, too.
#+end_quote

Yeah, 3 kids and a werewolf. It isn't going to go over well.

#+begin_quote
  Also, being Chief Warlock of the judicial and legislative body of the government is still a pretty important position.
#+end_quote

Go ahead and provide canon evidence for that. Because we're never told what the Chief Warlock really does. There is precisely zero evidence that Dumbledore could call a trial.

Your whole comment is just baseless conjecture.
