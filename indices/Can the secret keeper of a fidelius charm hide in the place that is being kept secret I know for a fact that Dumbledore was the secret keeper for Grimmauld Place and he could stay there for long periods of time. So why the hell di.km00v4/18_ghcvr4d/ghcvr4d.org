Well, pretty much every single plot hole in the Harry Potter books can be explained by Dumbledore being a manipulative old coot, since I really don't believe Harry figured out everything Dumbledick did or was a part of. But, well, yes it is possible. Bill was the secret keeper of Shell Cottage, actually. So, really, I blame Dumbledore being a manipulative arse for the Potters's incident.

The most damning piece of evidence of Dumbledore's manipulations is that he didn't order a trial for Sirius. He was the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot at that time, he would have been able to do so instead of doing the /highly/ irresponsible thing of giving two teenagers a time-turner and pressuring them to save a man they just met. I could go on and on, really. But I won't.
