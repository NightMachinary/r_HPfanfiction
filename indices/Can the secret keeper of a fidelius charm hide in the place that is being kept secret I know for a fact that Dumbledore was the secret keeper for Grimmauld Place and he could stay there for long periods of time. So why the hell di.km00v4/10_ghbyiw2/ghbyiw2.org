First Fundamental Rule of People - we're all emotional morons who evolved for stubborn grit over sense and logic. We'll make idiot decisions we feel good about instead of the common sense decisions every time. :D

Sure, it's a stupid decision, but people make stupid decisions all the time. I have no idea why it was canonically Sirius/Peter instead of James/Lily/Dumbledore, but I'd rationalise it one of two ways.

First, emotion. I can see the four idiots getting together and talking about it, then having a big huggy moment of "Oh, we're Marauders, we do all these hijinks together. No way Sirius/Peter is gonna let us down or not get involved somehow." in that "I, like, totally love you bro, wanna be the Godfather of my kid?" sort of way. Especially since the secret can't actually be tortured out of the secret keeper (apparently canon?) and thus the keeper would basically be fine and at very little risk because torturing/killing them would be pointless and less helpful than leaving them alive.

Second, bait. If the Secret Keeper is locked up behind the Fidelius, then there's no way to draw Voldemort out by getting them. Whether that's Dumbledore's master plan or the Potters' is up to your discretion. :)
