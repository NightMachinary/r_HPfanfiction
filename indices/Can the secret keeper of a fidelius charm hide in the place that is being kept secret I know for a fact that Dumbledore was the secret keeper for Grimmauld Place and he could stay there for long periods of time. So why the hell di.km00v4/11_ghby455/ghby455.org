I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore specifically wasn't around Grimauld place very much. Didn't Harry notice that Dumbledore seemed to be avoiding him and was never around? He was obviously there for Order meetings, but those were a few hours a week at the absolute most.

I don't think it was ever explicitly stated in canon that the secret keeper can't live under the Fidelius, but it is an explanation that fits the information we have. Of course, there are other plausible explanations you could come up with that fit the given evidence, including plain old poor decision making.
