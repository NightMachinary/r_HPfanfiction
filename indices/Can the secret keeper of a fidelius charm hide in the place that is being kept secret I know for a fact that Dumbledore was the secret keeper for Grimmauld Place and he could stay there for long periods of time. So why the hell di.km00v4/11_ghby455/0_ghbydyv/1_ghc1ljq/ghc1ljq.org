Okay, I forgot that Shell Cottage was under a Fidelius.

Also, there was no indication that the Longbottoms were ever under the Fidelius or that they were friends with or even knew the Potters as anything more than fellow Order members. So it makes a lot more sense for them to choose someone who has been a close friend for a decade.
