Bill put up a Fidelius at Shell Cottage as I recall, and he lived there.

It's just another Rowling-ism. She's got a major tendency to have stuff happen for Plot.

Even if one couldn't live under their own Fidelius, the smart thing to do would be for Lily to be Alice's Secret Keeper and vice versa.
