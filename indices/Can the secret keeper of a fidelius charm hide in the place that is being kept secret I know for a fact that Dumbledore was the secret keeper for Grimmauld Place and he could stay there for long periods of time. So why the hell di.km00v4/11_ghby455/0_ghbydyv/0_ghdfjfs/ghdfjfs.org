Right What is Wrong has pointed out several plot holes just from this scene in Deathly Hallows in the Force Interrupt series of short-shorts (longer than drabbles, but not always by much):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/3/][Chapter 3, Mutual Fidelius]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/6/][Chapter 6, Shell Cottage Again]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/9/][Chapter 9, Shell Cottage YET Again]]

One of my favorite stories that involves problems with a fidelius is In the Hollow of the White Hazel by OlegGunnarsson, which explores the vulnerability of the secret being worded in a specific way. linkffn(13193093)
