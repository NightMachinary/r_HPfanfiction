They have to stay hidden. They can't get out of the house. It's too risky.

So if they can't get out and tell anyone the secret once the charm is cast. No one could find them after that.

They likely didn't want to take the risk to write it to Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore and Peter, in case the owl get intercepted or something.

So if they do this, they are all alone until they die. Even if somehow Voldemort dies and everything is back to normal, no one would be able to tell them that they can come out of hiding.

So the smart choice is someone that can get out and tell the secret to people needed.

It's eitheir Dumbledore, Sirius, Peter or Remus.

They were already suspicious of Remus. Or at least Sirius was, and I can believe he conviced the Potter that Remus wasn't a good choice.

Don't forget that if the secret keeper dies, everyone who have been told become the secret keeper. That is too many potentials leak.

Dumbledore is old and too many people want him dead. So he is also too risky.

So, they choose Sirius. But Sirius was too obvious (this was a good point). Everyone would focus on him and try to get it out of him, somehow. Well let them try. They can't success since Surprise Surprise, he actually isn't the secret keeper.

Peter being overlooked is crucial to the plan. If he hadn't been a traitor, it would have been likely that DE and Voldemort would waste weeks on Sirius then Dumbledore then likely Remus and every other Order members before thinking about Peter.

It was a good plan, when you consider their unique situation.

Bill could get out, Dumbledore wasn't living at Grimmauld and could talk to other people. So it isn't exactly the same situation
