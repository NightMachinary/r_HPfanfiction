I'm afraid the only real answer there is the meta one. Rowling is known for pulling whatever she wants at the time to make local plot fit, with very little if any regard for overall setting consistency. Consistency simply isn't a feature of her writing, deal with it, it's fun anyway.

If you want meticulously designed settings that follow consistent rules, other authors are good at that. No author is good at everything and books require a mix of a great many different things, so there will always be a mix of weak points and strong points depending on the individual author's strengths.
