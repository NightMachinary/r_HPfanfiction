In the situation that the secret is the Home you are hiding in, with your wife and don't plan on leaving, how much Faith would you actually need? Faith inherently implies an objective uncertainty vs subjective Faith. James would be absolutely certain his wife whois stuck hiding with him, and taking care of their newborn son, can't betray the Secret. But he has Faith in his brothers in all but blood that they'll never betray the Faith he has placed in them. It's a kind of magic that is inherently unquantifiable as anything but Yes (Fidelius holds due to no betryal) No (Fidelius fails due to betrayal) and you will never be certain untill/if it fails. It's a balance of uncertainty vs blind Faith that can't be quantified except as a vague feeling. James does not know whether his friend will betray him, but will believe in him non-the less.
