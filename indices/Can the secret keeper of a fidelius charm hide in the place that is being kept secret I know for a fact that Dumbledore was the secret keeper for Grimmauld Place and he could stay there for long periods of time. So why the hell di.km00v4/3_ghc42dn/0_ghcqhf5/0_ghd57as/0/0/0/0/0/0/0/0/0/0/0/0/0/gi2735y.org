This doesn't really track with the idea that /betrayal/ is necessary for the Fidelius to fail, because betrayal always has to be conscious.

On the other hand, IIRC in OotP the Order was careful to apparate/disapparate from/to the top of the steps that was still in the Fidelius so that Death Eater watchers wouldn't see them and figure out the location, and the Secret Keeper was Dumbledore who was both highly trusted and spent lots of time outside the house.

Anyways, when you live inside a Fidelius to protect yourself then it most likely doesn't actually matter if the secret is broken when your enemy sees you enter or leave the location. If they ever see you /at all/ they will just attack you immediately, so it's irrelevant that the Fidelius might fail if they observe you entering/leaving*. Therefore, the benefit of using the person who is hiding inside the Fidelius vastly outweighs the benefit of using someone else.

* At least in the situation the Potters were in, and arguably most situations where the goal is to protect one or multiple people for a long duration instead of just having a secret meeting place and occasional hideout.
