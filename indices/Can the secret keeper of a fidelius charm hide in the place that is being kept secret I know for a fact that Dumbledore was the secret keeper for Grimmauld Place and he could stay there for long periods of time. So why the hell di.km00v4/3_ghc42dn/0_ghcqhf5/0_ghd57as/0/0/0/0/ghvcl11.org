Extreme Faith that is valid could mean that those that knew the secret before hand would never notice nor draw their attention to the oddity caused by the secret being protected. Those that would wish to find the secret could nuke the country to bedrock and still not touch/harm the secret. Weak Faith could mean that the secret keeper can indirectly and unintentionally reveal the secret. While the Fidelius only allows the Secret Keeper to reveal the secret and prevent all methods of bypassing the Keeper to access the secret, the absoluteness of the protection is proportional to the absoluteness of the Faith given which can only be checked by being tested resulting in pass/fail. A secret is a concept and thus the Magic of the Fidelius is fundamentally conceptual and can't be munchkined to work around it, but Faith is subjective so the spell functions slightly differently for each Keeper and Secret pair.
