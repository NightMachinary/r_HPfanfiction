I meant harder for the Secret to be exposed. Sufficiently strong Faith would mean that the Secret Keeper has to freely, willingly, and directly divulge the Secret with the intention of doing so, without even non-magical coercion. Weak Faith would mean the Secret could be exposed by the Secret Keeper accidentally. Not only does the non-keeper need to have Strong Faith, the Keeper must be equally worthy of that Faith.
