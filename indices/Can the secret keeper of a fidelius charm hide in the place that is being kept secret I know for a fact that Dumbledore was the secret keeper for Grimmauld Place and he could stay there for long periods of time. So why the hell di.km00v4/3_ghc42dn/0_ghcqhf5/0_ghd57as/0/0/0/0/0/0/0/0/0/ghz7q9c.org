So if you use someone else as the secret keeper it's less effort (or "magical energy" or requires less skill or whatever) to cast than if you use someone who lives inside it? But once it is cast there is no difference between those two? Unless it fails which is easy to recognize and I suppose you can just try again.

Which would mean that Bill's Fidelius was much harder to cast than the Potters' (but equally strong), which I suppose is possible but I'd think if Bill manages it then either the Potters or Dumbledore would have managed it too...
