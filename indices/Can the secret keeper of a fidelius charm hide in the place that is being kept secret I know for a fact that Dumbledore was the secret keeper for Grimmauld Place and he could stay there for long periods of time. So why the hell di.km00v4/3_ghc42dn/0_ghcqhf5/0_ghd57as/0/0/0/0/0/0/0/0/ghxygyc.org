Without getting into other languages, you can spell 'Fidelius' correctly or incorrectly, that is the end result. How difficulty in doing so is the 'strength of Faith'. Strong Faith (difficult), weak Faith (less difficult). The end result is the same, but the task of reaching that result is proportionate to Faith, which can't be measured, but tested. Once tested, strong or weak Faith no longer matters. It was either enough, or not.
