Other than the "Shell Cottage" example, I believe I've seen a theory that the subject of the secret can't be the secret keeper. So, the secret " The Potters live in Godric's Hollow" can't be held by a Potter... the secret for Grimauld Place is a more grey area since it talks about where the OotP meets, so maybe Dumbledore can be keeper since it doesn't concern living there and he doesn't dwell there longer than needed?
