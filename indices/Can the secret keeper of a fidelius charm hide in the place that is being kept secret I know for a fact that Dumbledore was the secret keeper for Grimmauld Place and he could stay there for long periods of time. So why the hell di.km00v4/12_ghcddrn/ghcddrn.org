My 'in universe' explanation was that since the Potters knew the prophesy, they 'subconsciously' didn't believe in their ability to keep themselves safe. With that internal doubt (or another way to say doubt, lack of trust), the charm fails. Bill and Dumbledore believed in themselves and had no reason not to have any internal doubt, so their charms worked fine.
