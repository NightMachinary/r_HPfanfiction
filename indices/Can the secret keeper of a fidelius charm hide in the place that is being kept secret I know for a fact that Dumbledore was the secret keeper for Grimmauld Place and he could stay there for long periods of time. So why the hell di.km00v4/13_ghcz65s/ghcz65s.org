Rowling totally didn't think about this. But I guess my head canon explanation is that you can only hold one secret and the Potters both held secrets. Maybe James held a secret for someone else in the order, and Lily held the secret hiding her muggle parents? And then when they needed protecting they had to bring in a third party to hold a secret for their own hiding place.
