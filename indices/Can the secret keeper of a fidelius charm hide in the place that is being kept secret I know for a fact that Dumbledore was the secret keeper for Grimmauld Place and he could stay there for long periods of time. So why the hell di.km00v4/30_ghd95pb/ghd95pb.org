Jk wrote a beautiful story but with plot holes everywhere, for example 1.as you mentioned yourself of the secret keepers why can't potters cast felidius one explanation could be given that is only exceptionally powerful wizards can cast those or with gobline runes which only few can afford, 2.wizards population so dumb they don't even know how to perform a protego spell, but can run an economy of wizards I mean wtf, 3. School kids fighting death eaters and defeating them, so either they are too strong for their own good or it's just a big plot hole Rowling left, and where are the adults except for the order and Weasley did we even see a normal citizen adding their contribution to the war, 4. Hermione how the hell can she be so smart and do every spell, author should have created Hermione with super memory and average power, that would have fit the plot so well, 5. Why wasn't luna introduce before order of the phoenix ,when ginny was possessed by Tom riddle she should have been there for her , for God sake they are childhood friends, 6. Rowling should have made decision with whom Harry or Ron or other characters would end up at the start of the story , then atleast their would have been progress for those ships from start of the story like Harry and Ginny , Rowling should have started making them close after chamber incident, then that way Harry suddenly out of nowhere didn't have to fall in love with her, and please Hermione should have ended with Malfoy not Ron , 7. And my most major problem is the power level and specially variety of spell which was clearly lacking , I mean ordinary wizards are so dumb thay can be killed by muggles easily, their should have been a amount of level of power among wizards like ranks A - S rank with Voldemort S++ and Dumbledore S+++ , this or some kind of scale which can measure someone magical core at the time of birth , A author must always focus on the world more than the story because without a realistic world even the most beautiful sory will fell Barren.
