I don't know. It's in the same vein as why didn't the Potter's say Peter was the secret keeper to Dumbledore or write it in their wills or something. My thoughts is that James was still a active member of the Order. He choice Peter because it could have been public knowledge Sirius was Harry's godfather. He could have assumed or persuaded to not be the secret keeper because Voldemort doesn't trust people and would assume James would only trust himself to protect his family and with Sirius as a obvious second made James question putting his eggs in one basket. Also my head cannon always considered Peter as the overlooked Marauder. He might not be as academic as James or Remus. Sirius could have been well liked. Peter could have been seen as a hanger on. Maybe equal to early Neville with the Golden trio. Peter could have been the perfect secret keeper because no one would have thought he would know anything important.
