Did you read the 5th book? Hagrid is essentially a 10 foot tall person, who's many times stronger than a man, and way smarter than a giant. The dude has some serious magic resistance aswell.

Overall, while hes junk at magic theres nothing 99% of wizards could do if he just decided to run at them; and crush their skulls.
