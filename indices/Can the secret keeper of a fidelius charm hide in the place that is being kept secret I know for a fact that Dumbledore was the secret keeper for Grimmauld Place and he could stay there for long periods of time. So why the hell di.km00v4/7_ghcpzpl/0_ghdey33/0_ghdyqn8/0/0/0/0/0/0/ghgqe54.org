Voldemort I think took him as a fool in the second book didn't he? Most of the Death Eaters probably saw him as somebody dumbledore took pity on. Hagrid being expelled probably was well known. I'm assuming Dumbledore was using their preconceived notions about Hagrid to his advantage hence why they put the real Harry with Hagrid during the seven Potter thing. During the first war all they saw was the Hogwarts groundskeeper. It wasn't until fifth year he was shown to shrug off stunners.
