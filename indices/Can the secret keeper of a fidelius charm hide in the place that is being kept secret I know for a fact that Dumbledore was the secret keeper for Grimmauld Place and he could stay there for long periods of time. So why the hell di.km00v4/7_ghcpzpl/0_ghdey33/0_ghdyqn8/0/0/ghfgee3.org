Doesn't Dumbledore have things tracking Harry or at least his health? I don't know if it cannon or purely fannon. Dumbledore could do the same with his parents and knew something happened when the trackers stopped working.

My biggest thing was didn't Sirius give his motorbike to Hagrid to get Harry out of there? That should have gave Albus at least some sort of red flag for him to question the outcome with Peter. If he wanted Harry dead Hagrid wouldn't been much of a challenge magical wise. Hagrid at most was only dangerous as a half giant with what 3-4 years of magical schooling?
