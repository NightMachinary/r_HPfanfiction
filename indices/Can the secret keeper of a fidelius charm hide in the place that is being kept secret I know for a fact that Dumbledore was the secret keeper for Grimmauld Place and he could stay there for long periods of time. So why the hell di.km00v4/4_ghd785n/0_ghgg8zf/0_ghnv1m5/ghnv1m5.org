I am wondering where the author of that admittedly hilarious bit of fan fiction got his/her definition of the Fidelius Charm. According to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (written by J.K. Rowling and published on Pottermore on 8/10/15):

"The Fidelius Charm is extremely ancient and still used to this day. It involves the concealment of information inside a living person. The chosen person, or Secret Keeper, is the only person who is thenceforth capable of revealing the protected information to others, however many previously knew it. If the Secret Keeper shares the hidden information, the person to whom he or she has confided it will be bound by the Fidelius Charm and find it impossible to pass the information on."

The wording here suggests that, once the Fidelius Charm takes effect, the Secret Keeper is the only one who is able to share the "secret information" with those who do not already know it. Meanwhile, rather than forgetting the "secret information", those who know it already but are not the Secret Keeper simply lose the ability to share the "secret information".
