The actual description of the fidelius charm in canon is that you hide "a secret" in the soul of a person, called the secret keeper.

JKR then proceeds to ONLY use this to hide specific houses. What a waste.

There is a crack fic out there where Harry and Hermione find out how easy it is to cast and go to town, using each other as the repository for secrets such as "the incantation for the killing curse is Avada Kedavra," and devolving to ones like "Death Eaters have functioning legs." I don't think I bookmarked it, so if you know what it is please let me know because now I want to read it again.
