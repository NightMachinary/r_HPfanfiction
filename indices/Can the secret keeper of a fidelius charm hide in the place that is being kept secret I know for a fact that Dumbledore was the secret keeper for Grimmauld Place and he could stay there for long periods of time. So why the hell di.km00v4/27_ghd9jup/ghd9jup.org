This is my theory, I have no idea if it's right.

1. The secret about Shell Cottage is “where is Shell Cottage?” So Bill, the owner, could hide it within himself and share it as needed.

2. The secret about James and Lily was “where are James and Lily hiding?” The answer happened to be “at their house,” but the secret was fundamentally different: What's Bill's address vs. Does anyone know where these people are

3. Lily and James probably could have hidden the secret within themselves, but if everything went to plan, how would they be found after the war? We aren't given any clues as to how the charm is lifted (other than conflicting information about if it lifts after you die). So there's the chance that the war ends, and they leave, and they go to find Remus, Peter, and Sirius, and find them, go up to them and say “hey we are right here, at this table with you” and what would happen? Would J and L appear and scare the crap out of their friends? Probably. Humorous, but impractical.
