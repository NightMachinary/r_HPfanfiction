As far as I know, there's no true in depth explanation for that, so the way I like to think of it is that the caster cannot allow themselves to be the secret keeper, though the secret keeper the self can live within the Fidelius Ward. However, that creates issues itself with how the charm itself is performed - if that's the case, how was dumbledore the secret keeper of Grimmauld Place? Maybe Moody cast the Fidelius for Grimmauld? It seems like the type of 'paranoid' idea he would come up with and Dumbledore would agree with.

As for the Potters I don't have an explanation in my head that fully makes sense. If it wasn't Dumbledore who cast the charm (though I'm pretty sure I read somewhere he was) then Lily would have made James the Secret Keeper or vice versa. The only reason I can think of for not secreting the Charm within either of the other would be further misdirection, which was somehow revealed or seen through. However if Dumbledore did cast their charm, then surely he would have known that Peter was the secret keeper and not Sirius?

Honestly the Fidelius is such a wacky unexplained charm that can really just do whatever it wants to fit the plot according to JKR, which is fair enough. I'd say if you're writing your own fanfiction and want to include it though, come up with a concrete way if how it works and stick to those rules. A good way to keep it in mind would be to put those rules in a planning document under their own header :)
