Well, I know Harry said he'd pull strings to keep Abby's memory safe if she doesn't succeed in her audition. But I'm kind of hoping he takes the simpler option and just gives her a ring. Ideally making the offer before she auditions, so that she knows it's not dependent on the outcome, it's not just to protect her or anything, he means it regardless. At this point she'd be very surprised by moving that fast, but I think it's clear she'd accept it. The kids might be more upset though.

It's curious that she's already more comfortable with Harry than any previous boyfriend when one of them was her best friend for years, but I guess there's different types of comfortable. She could be comfortable being around Sam without being comfortable letting him into every part of her life.

(Amusingly, Abby's worst case scenarios for babysitting are actually much more manageable in a Wizarding household. Falling down the stairs? Bones and nerves are fixable within days with the right potions. House on fire? Harry could extinguish it singlehandedly. Heimlich? /Anapneo/.)
