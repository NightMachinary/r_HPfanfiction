I strongly recommend that you skip the blurb and just try reading chapter 1. If you like Abby, you'll like the fic.

My own summary would be something like: Harry is raising his three children alone after losing Ginny in an accident, but is struggling to cope without her, until he finds a quirky muggle waitress who starts to draw him out of his shell and help him heal.
