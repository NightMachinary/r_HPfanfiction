It doesn't happen early on in Lokison, but it's quite gay and he's OP anyway :P This is a good author to follow if you want some OP!Harry with a pretty much fully gay cast and liberal doses of smut.

A non-gay one is Punching Gods. Again, doesn't happen early on.

And finally, in October he starts out as one. This Harry is asexual though.
