  Sequel to "Souls Touch, and the Future Changes", authored by now-deleted account sunmoonandstars, which used to be me. Harry continues to struggle with adapting to and understanding the wizarding world, which increasingly seems to have backed itself into a corner by allowing rampant anti-Muggle belief to coexist with rampant ignorance of the Muggle world. Of course, there is also the problem of being a "Light" icon in Slytherin, not to mention the fact that someone seems determined to hamstring Harry's independence.
