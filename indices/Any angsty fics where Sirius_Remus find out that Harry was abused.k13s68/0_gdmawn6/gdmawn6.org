A great one is A Second Chance by breanie - it's a pretty long one and still being updated. Chapter 6 is where Sirius find out if you want to read a bit and see if it's a good fit.

It's my absolute favorite The character development is incredible and I've become so attached. It also has quite a bit of smut and is for mature audiences.
