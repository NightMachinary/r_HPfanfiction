Sirius has Harry, he has a way to make Remus listen. He has to...

  His aunt and uncle, by virtue of necessity, had let it be known that Harry was disabled (it was hard to hide an ambulance showing up in the middle of the night, and Harry's teachers had needed to know anyway) but they had made it very clear: Harry's condition was disgusting and shameful. Harry was disgusting and shameful.  Or, the one where Harry learns that he doesn't have to go it alone.

  As far as the wizarding world knows, the entire Potter Family was killed on Halloween, 1981. Dumbledore defeated Voldemort mere hours later. The world forgets about the infant buried in Godric Hallow's cemetary. That is, until Lupin finds a young boy living on the streets. A young boy, with James's dark skin, wild hair, and Lily's green eyes...

He knew how it felt to be ignored, so he gave special care to pay attention to his students---not only in regards to their studies, but to their mental health, too.Remus Lupin was the first person to notice what Harry was hiding, and he was the first adult to care enough to do something about it.
