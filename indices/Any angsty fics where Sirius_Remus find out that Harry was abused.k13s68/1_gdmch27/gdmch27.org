linkao3(23168287) Disguised as Something Else. One of my absolute favorites.

linkao3(11656536) Listen

linkao3(20403091) Bruised Hearts and Painted Skin

linkao3(16606907) Bottle It Up. Part 1 doesn't involve Sirius/Remus, but part 2 is about Sirius and Harry's disability. Part 1 deserves an award for a Snape characterization that makes some iota of sense on the dislikeable/functional teacher spectrum.

linkao3(22581145) Boy

linkao3(24086086) Seven Plus One. Stations of canony, but decent.

linkao3(25680613) Pinky Promise

linkao3(20468282) Harry Potter And The Summer At Grimmauld Place

linkao3(22591447) Fac Mihi Viam
