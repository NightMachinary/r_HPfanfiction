  Post Prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius chooses to hide in plain sight in order to have Harry with him for the summer instead forcing him to go back to the Dursleys. Of course Sirius loved Harry as well. Had from the moment Lily and James had told him they were expecting and hundred times more still when Lily had placed a small, snuffling bundle into his arms. The problem was that he'd never expected to really do anything else except love the kid. Maybe teach him some broom tricks and spoil him rotten. But whilst those things were still in the offing, there was now also so much more.
