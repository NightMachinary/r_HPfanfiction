For Lack of a Bezoar by BolshevikMuppet99 on ffn (I'm using the ffn app and you can't copy the link sorry).

Shorter 35k words, explores what might have happened if Ron had died. Meant as a sort of prequel to the next work, but can definitely be read on its own. Harry and Hermione kill a lot of people and have to struggle with the effects of dark magic.

Echoes in the Fog by the same author.

canon Harry and bezoar Harry and their friends are accidentally sent into a world where Voldemort has won and has Harry on his side. So it's basically grey Harry and canon Harry vs evil Harry. This fic is a bit over the top (Voldemort rules the world) and sometimes the torture seems like it's there for shock value (a la game of thrones) but the premise is interesting and it seems to fit what you've asked for.
