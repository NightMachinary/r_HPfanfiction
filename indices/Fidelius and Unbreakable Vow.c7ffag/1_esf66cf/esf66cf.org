My theory is that the core principle behind the fidelius is indeed the trust you have in the person you confide the secret to.

â€‹

- Which means that it is impossible to demand an unbreakable vow since that would prove you don't really trust that person unconditionally anyway.
- You can always add other magic on top of it later, sure. Just as long as the trust is never broken or compromised in any way. So the secret keeper must have unconditional access to the house at all times, because any attempt to stop him from entering or leaving as he pleases would violate the trust needed for the fidelius to keep working.

Nothing I said is confirmed to be canon, but it fits and it makes sense to me.
