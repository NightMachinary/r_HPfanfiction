I like this theory, and to be fair we only know 2 things from Fidelius in Canon :

- The person who don't know the Secret can't even see what is hidden, and only the secret keeper /can/ reveal the Secret (can be by writting or by voice).
- At the Death of the Secret Keeper, every person who previously knew the Secret become a Secret Keeper (making the Secret a lot less defended).

â€‹

On another note, I wonder what happen to people who knew about the place before the Fidelius. For example, did the Black Sisters forgot about Grimault, forgot it's location, or where just unable to make the link between the place and the Order of the Phoenix?

And also, can a Fidelius be taken down and recast right after (forget about Snape, I surprised the Order even though about trusting Mundigus Fetcher)?
