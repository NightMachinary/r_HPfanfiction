The Fidelius Charm works just as plot requires it to work. Bill Weasley was Secret Keeper for Shell Cottage in the 7th book and he lived there, so there wasn't any reason for the Potters to choose anyone other than themselves as the Secret Keepers. But they did because the plot required them to so that they could be betrayed.
