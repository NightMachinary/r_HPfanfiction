I don't think the Fidelius charm means you can't add other wards on top of it (as long as they don't prevent the Secret Keeper from entering). However, it's not really going to do much to stop someone like Voldemort -- at best, it will delay him.

Making someone take an Unbreakable Vow kind of implies that you don't trust the person otherwise -- would the Fidelius really take hold then?
