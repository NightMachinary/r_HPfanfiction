That depends by what you mean by "based on" the trust in the Secret Keeper; I definitely think that you couldn't cast it with someone you didn't trust as the Secret Keeper, but I don't see how that would preclude adding other protections on top of the Fidelius anyway, in case the Secret Keeper died. (There's no reason to think the Potters had no other protections, it's just that any other protections that you could realistically cast on a house without the neighborhood noticing are trivial for Voldemort to power through once the Fidelius is down.)

I don't think you could cast a Fidelius with the intention of securing the trustworthiness of the Secret Keeper through an Unbreakable Vow; I think the trust has to be more /sincere/ than that for the spell to work. But if you thought of it /afterwards/, sure, I see no reason why that wouldn't work. Mind you, it wouldn't necessarily be a very good idea, since breaking the Vow would mean killing the Secret Keeper would mean endangering your Fidelius.
