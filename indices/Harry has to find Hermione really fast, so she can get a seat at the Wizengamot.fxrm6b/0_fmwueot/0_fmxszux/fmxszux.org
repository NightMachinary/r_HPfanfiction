Right that's it. Again, I am not very enamoured with old-crow and bashing gets really old really fast (here, he declared that starving of Ron Weasley to death by The Death Eaters is his own fault), but this scene (and the following one in the Wizengamot) is really great. And I am really lost about Harry/Susan pairing: I don't see why there should be any problem with it, but it almost never works well.
