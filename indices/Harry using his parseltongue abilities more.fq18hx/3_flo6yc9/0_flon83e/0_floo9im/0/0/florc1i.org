I'm also an empathic reader! I tend to put myself in the place of the character, so while dark/evil Harry is fine (I tend to empathize with the side characters then, I think) I can't stand gaslighting or other mind-altering things... I recently read a fic where Stockholm syndrome played a big part and while it was really interesting, I wouldn't re-read it for the world. My county has implemented a stay-at-home order, so my family is trying not to go out too much except for the occasional walk. Talking is fun! Maybe I should go out more, if I'm so willing to strike up a conversation with a stranger... (no offense, you've been a very nice stranger)
