Exact same problem-- I've been one of those obsessive readers since childhood (only now its reformed into a strange fanfic addiction. What am I supposed to say when someone asks me what I'm reading currently?!) I sometimes read Dark!Harry fics out of a morbid intrest and they make me feel disturbed for days. I too, am supposed to be staying at home other than buying food, etc, but for some reason my mom keeps needing to stock up- I don't really approve but there's not much I can do against her authority unfortunately.

Talking is very fun (sometimes)! I can appreciate that ahahaha, I often get caught up in taking with everyone (especially if it's something that I'm passionate about) and it seems you've been dragged into the bubble. Fun fact: I was in the delicate process of being maybe-diagnosed with Aspergers before this pandemic blew out. And no one I know reads Harry Potter fanfiction (probably a good thing)
