Ikr! If anyone knows how on Earth they manage to write so much I'd love to know. I love some of their fics tho, like Practising Liars, Brother to A Basalisk, and a few others I can't remember the name of lmao.

But I am hands down terrified of Dark!Harry. I'm a very emotional/empathetic reader and so it definitely isn't good for my mental health or the people around me if I'm constantly reading from the viewpoint of a racist, lethal and mindless killer/torture ðŸ˜… Also yay! I wish I had the privilege but my mom keeps dragging me to the grocery store ahhaa. Sorry for the long paragraph :/
