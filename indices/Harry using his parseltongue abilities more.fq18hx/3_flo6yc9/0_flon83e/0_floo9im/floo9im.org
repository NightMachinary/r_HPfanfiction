You know, that's a very valid opinion. That author has, what, 300 fics? Honestly crazy. Dark!harry is an acquired taste, I think. Deconversion does get pretty weird (as far as I can remember), but I haven't read it in years. I haven't been out of the house in a week! It's great! I hope you're doing ok too!
