Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man has all that and oh so much more. It's a bit long-winded at times, but in my opinion, it's one if the best wrong-boy-who-lived, mystery stories out there.

It's fun and heartbreaking, at times vindicating and frustrating. And nobody is stupid, or makes inexplicable choices simply for the sake of plot progression. And parseltongue plays a considerable role in the story.
