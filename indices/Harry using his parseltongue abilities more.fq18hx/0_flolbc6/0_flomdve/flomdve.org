Ah, the famous Prince of Slytherin. Truthfully I only got through about 3/4 of it or less when i read it. Not because it was lacking, in fact it contained all my favourite tropes, (and Reglus's backstory was fabulous) but because I have a very short attention span LMAO.

Thanks for the rec, tho, and I might even revisit it if I'm particularly feeling The Vibe. Hope you're staying safe!
