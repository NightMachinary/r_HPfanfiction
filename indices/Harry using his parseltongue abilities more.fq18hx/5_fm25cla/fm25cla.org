Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady

A really intricate Slytherin Harry AU, with lots of divergence from canon. This Harry is neutral magically (Dark religiously), and seems more 'Claw than Snake most of the time. Quite a unique characterization, nice magical world detail, many characters to appreciate who are three-dimensional and complex. Love the pagan religion practice.

WIP series, Part 6 completed in 2018.
