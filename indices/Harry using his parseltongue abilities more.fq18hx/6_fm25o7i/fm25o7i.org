Grounding Magic series by NotVampireJasper

I love the deeply characterized Harry in this 'verse, and how his past and religious beliefs affect the way he lives and how he treats others. He could be angry or bitter, but he's content and peaceful, while still purposeful and driven to learn and create. This is a Harry that I would love to be friends with.
