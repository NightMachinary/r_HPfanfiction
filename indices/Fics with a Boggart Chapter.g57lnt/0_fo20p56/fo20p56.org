I make no claims as to it being particularly soul-searching, but perhaps you'd enjoy linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13170534/chapters/54122758]])

It's a one-shot set it a HPxNaruto verse, but the chapter (I think) should stand on it's own if you get the basic premise of Harry, Ron, and Hermione living dual lives, (the other being Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura respectively.)

I too am quite the sucker for boggart fics. (:
