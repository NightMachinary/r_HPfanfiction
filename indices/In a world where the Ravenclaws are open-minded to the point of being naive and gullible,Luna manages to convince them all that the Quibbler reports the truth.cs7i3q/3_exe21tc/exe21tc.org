A low murmur was heard at breakfast from the Ravenclaw table. As one, all the Ravenclaws stood up and in one sweeping move, removed their outer robes. The inner robes had Sirius Black's wanted poster printed across the front. Luna nodded at Roger Davies as he cast a Sonorus spell on himself - "Free Stubby Boardman!", he screamed. The Ravenclaws brought up Hobgoblin banners as "Remember the name" blared from a loud Wizarding Wireless machine.

Dumbledore looked positively giddy as other teachers and students stared dazedly at the Ravenclaws. Ron calmly picked up a slice of toast and started buttering it shaking his head and muttering about 'Dark Lady Luna'.
