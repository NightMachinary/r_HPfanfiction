Not /quite/ what you're looking for, but close. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has Harry viscerally disliking Muggles (for believable reasons), but no issue with Muggleborns and no belief in blood purity. He's also close friends with Hermione :\

Edit: Switched "understandable" to "believable" because I can't really agree with his views, but I can understand why he has them.
