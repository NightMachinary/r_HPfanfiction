I'm not sure what you mean by dark, as in dark!Harry included or not - but I'll give it a shot anyways.

The one that I immediately though of was moshpit's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3322666/1/Echoes-of-Power-Part-I-Anger][Echoes of Power]] - it's supposed to be part of a bigger series, but at this point, I'd sadly say it's abandoned. Really good for what it is, though. Enough plot and fluff to buff the dark :P

I remember reading [[http://siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11821][Normalcy]] a while back, and that was kind of dark from what I remember. I can't really remember any other ones off the top of my head though.

Hope your holidays pass quickly!

edit: ooh, and I don't know if you're familiar with the Dresden Files or not, but there's this crossover I highly recommend (and I don't like crossovers much. Or fanfiction unless it's, y'know, edited to be something that could be published) called the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Renegade]]. It's a whole trilogy. Awesome stuff.
