I mean more within the tropes of the usual Indy!Harry, but if an 11 yo or even the usual teenager acts as Harry does in those fics they get called out, and fast. And if he doubles down on it, as he usually does when he doesn't get his way, it gets progressively worse, or it jumps straight into bashing. Sadly, these things happen enough in real life that it isn't even a stretch or SoD breaking.

As for the BWL thing, it rarely, if ever, actually helps him in anything. Remember, it is incredibly easy to be hated if someone can create a reason at Hogwarts, take the second book for example. And countrywide it was easier still, with almost everyone believing he was a liar thanks to the media.

And all of that was rumors and baseless accusations! If it was true it would have been a lot worse for him.
