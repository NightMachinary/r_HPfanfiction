The fandom as a whole forgets what this means. People were bowing to him before he turned ten, weeping at his return, and Scrimgeour damn rolled out the red carpet for him in HBP. If Harry Potter wanted to use his fame not too many would deny him anything.

The only way indy Harry could be humbled would be magically by a talented adult. I would say the political arena, but the idea of a well written Indy Harry I have is a Slytherin one who allows himself to be used so as to get what he wants.
