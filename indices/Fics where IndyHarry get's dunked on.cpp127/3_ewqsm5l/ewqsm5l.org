Interesting. But I would not call it realistic. I mean, the usual trope isn't realistic in any way, sure. But neither is what you describe, like at all. He is "The Boy Who Lived" after all. How exactly would it be realistic if the things you describe happened? Like why would anybody find him creepy without him doing a 180 in behaviour?

Anyway, I think there was a similar request a few weeks ago that was a lot more realistic than yours, you might want to search for it. It went for Harry being inexperienced in politics and getting outplayed by the old guard that have been at the game for decades.
