I prefer chapter titles, it's much easier to orient in a story. As a writer I often have a problem choosing a title for each chapter that's descriptive enough, but I feel it's necessary. Makes a chapter feel less like a block of text to go through, gives it an individual 'oomph'.

But if not that, the least one can do is name them by arcs. Much easier to remember "third chapter of X arc" than "n. 126".
