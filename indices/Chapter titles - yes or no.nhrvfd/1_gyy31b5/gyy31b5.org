Chapter titles are a must for me. Not a "won't read if they don't have," but the feeling of finishing a 75-chapter beauty and wanting to go back and re-read that first kiss and realizing you have no idea which generic "chapter 36" or "chapter 29" holds that scene itching in your brain is just heartbreaking. Even the slightest crap title that gives some indication of what happened in that chapter can help.

E.G. You name a chapter "Moony barks" and I can go "oh yeah, Moony spent that moon barking at a rabbit and the kiss happened AFTER that."
