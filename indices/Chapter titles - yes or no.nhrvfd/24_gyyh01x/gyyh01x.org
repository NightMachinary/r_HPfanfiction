I always spend too much time trying to think of a good chapter title for the first chapter and then I just give up and call it "Chapter 1." And it would be weird to have chapter titles for some chapters but not all of them so I usually leave them all like that. Makes me feel kind of uncreative but I try to compensate for it by coming up with a really inventive title for the overall fic.
