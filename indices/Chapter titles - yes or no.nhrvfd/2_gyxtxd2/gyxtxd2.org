I normally name my chapters just for the fun of it tbh. I also include the number e.g â€˜Chapter 2: Summer Holidays' but I don't always use the numbers. Sometimes if there's a massive plot point in the chapter I'll name it something more inconspicuous, but overall I think they're great for being able to give a bit of info before reading or letting you find a specific chapter
