Often times, if I find that trying to name a chapter around the events that happen in it is too much of a spoiler, I'll use a metaphor or a song lyric/title or some reference that seems arbitrary but makes more sense once you read the chapter through. If I'm jammin to a specific song while writing and I feel like it's fitting, I might swipe a line for the chapter title :D
