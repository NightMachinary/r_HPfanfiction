As an author and a reader, I prefer fairly descriptive chapter titles because it helps you navigate the story.

In particular as a reader, if I open up an AU starting from first year, the first thing I'm doing is opening up the chapter index and using it to judge whether the fic goes anywhere.

If I open up the chapter index of a 100k word story and it's like "Chapter 45 - Halloween" then I immediately know the story is paced terribly and going nowhere and I nope the fuck out.
