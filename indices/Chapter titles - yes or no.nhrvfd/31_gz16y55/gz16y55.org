Originally, I just had them with numbers, but one night I got bored and didn't have the motivation to do some actual writing, so I made *possible* chapter names for each one of my chapters. I actually really liked this idea and the names I managed to come up with, so I kept the chapter names :)

In terms of reading, I really don't mind if an author has chapter names or just the numbers. But (for me) when it comes to writing, I just like the sound of it and I think it kind of sets the main point for the chapter :)
