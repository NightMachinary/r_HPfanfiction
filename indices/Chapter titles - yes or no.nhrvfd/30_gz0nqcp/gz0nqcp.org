As a reader, I do slightly prefer chapter titles, but it's not a big deal if the author skips them. The content of the story is way more important, and I've never once quit a story because the chapter titles were just numbers.

As a writer, I /hate/ chapter titles, because I always spend way too long thinking about them.
