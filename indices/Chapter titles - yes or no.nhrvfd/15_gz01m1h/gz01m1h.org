I didn't always care, and it's still not terribly important, but now I prefer a story to have chapter titles. As a reader, it makes it easier to go back and find what you're looking for, and in general, the titles can just really be lovely and/or funny. It's a nice bonus.

Also, I'm very bad about spoiling the story for myself but I have no desire to stop this bad habit, so I kind of like when the titles are a bit specific, oftentimes I will open a new story and the first thing I'll do is read the chapter titles to have an indication of what will happen. And then it's kind of fun to end up being totally wrong about what I thought might happen from the title.

For the story I'm working on now, the story title is one word and the chapter titles are synonyms of that word. I doubt any of my readers have taken notice of it, but. I felt quite clever when I came up with the idea, anyway lol.
