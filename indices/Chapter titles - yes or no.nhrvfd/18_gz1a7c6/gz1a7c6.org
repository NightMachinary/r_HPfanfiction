As a reader, I don't care one way or another. It helps if I want to look something up, I guess, but they can be kind of spoiler-y, so I try not to look at the title unless I don't mind being spoiled. If you can come up with chapter titles that aren't spoiler-y but still managed to describe the chapter, that would probably be best, but I know that's hard to do.

As a writer, I don't name my chapters, but some of my readers have demanded it.
