I agree with the others, chapter titles are a must especially for longer stories. They can also act as a fun tool for foreshadowing if you‘ve planned ahead enough. Some chapter titles are just so amusing that I leave kudos right away:

e.g. from Resurrection by Spork_in_the_Road:

SMALL, ABUSED CHILD GRATEFUL TO BE KIDNAPPED

WISE OLD MAN NUDGES PROTAGONIST TOWARDS A SIDE QUEST, GETS A FIRM "NO THANKS" (personal favorite of mine)
