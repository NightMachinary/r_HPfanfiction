I never name my chapters. I have enough trouble naming my books, let alone thinking of names for each chapter! It doesn't bother me one way or the other if an author does name chapters. Sometimes it's really cool, like when they use poems or quotes for each chapter and name the chapter based off them but that's really the only time I ever notice chapter titles.
