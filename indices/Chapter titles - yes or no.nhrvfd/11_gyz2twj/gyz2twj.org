Yes, absolutely, nothing more annoying than trying to find a certain scene then wondering whether it was Chapter 12 or Chapter 28 or what not. Titles allow for easier reread.

I personally do my Chapters a POV (Character Name) (POV Chapter Number). In writing Harry Potter currently, so if I change POV to Harry, it be titled POV Harry One. I find the easier to do as probably my readers as they can sort of n pick which story line they want to follow.
