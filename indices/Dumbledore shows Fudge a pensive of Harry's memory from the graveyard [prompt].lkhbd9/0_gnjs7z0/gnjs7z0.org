He will probably claim memories cant be tampered with, and that Harry's wouldn't count since he is a minor who could have been confused or something. Honestly Fudge would have refused the truth even if he SAW Voldemort. The only reason he seemed to accept it in the end of Ootp is because it literally was in the middle of the ministry with so many witnesses. I doubt the public would have sided with Harry either, since they all feared Voldemort they'd rather believe him dead.
