Probably makes up some rationalisation as to why Harry is lying/mistaken.

What forced Fudge to accept it at the end of OOTP wasn't that he saw Voldemort with his own eyes, it was that Voldemort was seen in public by multiple trustworthy ministry officials. If OOTP had ended with just Fudge witnessing Voldemort and Dumbledore's fight then Fudge would be right back to calling Dumbledore and Harry liars when he'd calmed down the next morning.
