Basically, the question is what would the rest of the story look like if Fudge has been persuaded that Voldemort truly returned (by whatever means available).

There is “The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14078862), where it happens, but it doesn't turn that well.

Also, I like “A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool (Rachel500)” linkao3(1085412), where Fudge is coerced into collaboration, and then helps (together with Dumbledore) as expert politicians in the team which tears down Voldemort.

Another alternative would be the functional equivalent of all those Harmony stories, where Madam Bones becomes the Minister of Magic and fights Voldemort. It could very well be Fudge himself instead.
