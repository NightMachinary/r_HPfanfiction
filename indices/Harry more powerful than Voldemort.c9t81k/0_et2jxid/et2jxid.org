Hmm. Linkffn(gods amongst men) voldy realizes that Harry is quickly becoming equal to him and Dumbledore and will surpass them soon. Linkffn(Learning to breath) has a powerful Harry that's already beat him and faces something a little worse. Linkffn(The Sun source) is a crossover with something I don't recognize but he's pretty OP and more powerful than voldy. Linkffn(The mind arts) he's on his way to being on par with voldy.
