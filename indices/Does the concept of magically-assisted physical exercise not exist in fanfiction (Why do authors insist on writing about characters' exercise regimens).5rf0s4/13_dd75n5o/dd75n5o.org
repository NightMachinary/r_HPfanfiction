i always imagine there are spells and potions to wipe away exhaustion, make excercies more productive. reduce the need to do it often. presumably wizards don't suffer from ill affects of bad health. so average is fine. dumbledore being fit is cannon though, right. something about moving much quicker than could be expected. i don't really like equivilent exchange type magic you see in ritual heavy fics.
