  Especially because the main character is a skilled potioneer that could easily make a potion to increase her physical ability.

Is that actually so? I can't think of any potions or spells which are a combination of easy, safe, cheap, permanent, and positive. You can create temporary increases in ability, but they're usually unsafe or indirect (engorgement charm can make you explode, for instance), prohibitively difficult or expensive to create (Felix Felicis), or harmful (any poison ever). You can /fix/ physical issues permanently, but I can't think of anything like a healing spell which /improves/ physical ability, rather than restoring it.

In fact, magic is often roundabout in how it accomplishes its goals. Yes, sometimes you can simply levitate an object with a spell. Sometimes though, you make something follow you by giving it feet. A spell to increase your strength might very well give you an extra set of arms and legs rather than increasing your raw strength.

Look at it another way. You could, potentially, use a charm or potion which may be difficult and dangerous in order to improve your cardiovascular health. Or, you could have a running regimen. It's not difficult to run regularly, especially not in a place like Hogwarts with how large and open the castle grounds are. It's basically permanent, at least as long as you do it to some regularity. It also doesn't rely on anything but your body. No potions, no spells, no magic of any sort. As long as you have your body, you have the results of your exercise. It's simple, reliable, and effective.

Besides that, it's good for you, and potentially improves your magical ability. If it's just mental, it helps. I don't know why, but physical exercise does make you just a little bit sharper. If it's physical, obviously I don't have to go into that. Hell, even if it's spiritual, many spiritual beliefs tie the body to the soul and believe a strong body helps in whatever purpose their beliefs hold. Monks don't just exercise because they've got nothing better to do (though I suspect it's a contributing factor).

Of course, there are interesting things you could do with it. You could ritualize your exercise regimen to tack on some kind of magical effect, even if it's not related, for instance. You could use potions to make exercise less difficult. That's a separate issue though. That's about what does and does not have any magical influence, or how often magic needs to be brought up.

So, the question is then /why/ is this character doing it? Well, if they're required to fight or compete in some way, it helps, for obvious reasons. They could be the sort of person who just can't sit still and needs to burn off that energy somehow. It could be a body-image issue. They could be health-conscientious. They could be the kind that need more structure in their life and will go out of the way to create it if none exists. They could very well just be driven to self-improvement.

Then, why is it actually written down rather than given a passing mention? Obviously it establishes or reinforces some character traits above. Or, perhaps, it runs counter to them and the character's struggle with it is the point. It establishes the character's routine so we know what they're doing and when. It gives that character an excuse for being physically capable at a time when it's more relevant (for instance, if the character can outrun an auror).

I haven't read the fic so I can't say for sure what's going on, but I suspect that if there is a problem, it's not necessarily the exercise. There's lots of potential reasons for it to exist. I'm not gonna read the entire fic to find out what they are, but they could very well be there and you just missed it. Or you've read so many fics that the trope has just gotten old for you. Either way, it's not the exercise.
