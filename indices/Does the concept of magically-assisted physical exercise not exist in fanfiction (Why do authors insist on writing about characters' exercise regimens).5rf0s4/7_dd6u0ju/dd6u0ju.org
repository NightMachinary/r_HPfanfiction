If there was a portion for it, or a magical way to "enhance" your features, wouldn't every adult in Harry Potter magically look like a model or an athlete?

I feel the fact that a major number of adult individuals (in all ranges of magical ability) we are introduced to are very average is telling that such a potion or magical means isn't possible. I feel like certain things, such as make-up, nail colour, hair styling etc. can be performed via spell or potion or whatnot, but if someone wants to physically improve their fitness, the muggle way is the only way?

It's never really bothered me before, and I feel like if I read a piece where a potion fixed it all, I'd find it odd unless it was properly explained. (I could see a daily potion or "beauty elixar" or whatnot for vitamins/minerals or to help with skin/hair/teeth health.)
