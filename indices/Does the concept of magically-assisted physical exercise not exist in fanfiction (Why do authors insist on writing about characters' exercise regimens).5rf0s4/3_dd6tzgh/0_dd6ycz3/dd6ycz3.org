Yep, this is what it cones down to. If there is a magical option you have to answer the question of why all magical people don't take that option.

That said, I would totally read a book where all the purebloods with the money for ingredients come to school looking like Greek gods because they all go through the magical rituals/potions to be ideal versions of themselves, while the poor and muggleborn are just normal kids.
