People like the idea that muggles are superior and wizards are ignorant for relying wholly on magic. These writers tend to underestimate the sheer versatility of magic which is a shame as I love when characters explore new spells and things.

People do tend to use nutrition potions to heal but rarely more than that. I figure they should at least take some effort to brew/ learn the specific spell for spells that strengthen a person. I'm pretty sure Hermione briefly points out a few to Harry in GoF, before the dragon but they're advanced newt spells so they don't try them; I'd have to check though.
