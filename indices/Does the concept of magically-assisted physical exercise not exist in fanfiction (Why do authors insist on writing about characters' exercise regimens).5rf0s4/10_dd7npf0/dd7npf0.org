I always assumed that it was similar to the whole "mind and body" school of thought. For example, warrior monks have to take care of both honing the body and focusing the mind.

And, though it's not as sophisticated as how adult wizards sometimes cast magic, the vast majority of magic in HP has specific physical movements and such involved.

I think a lot of this is tied to the fact that many of the characters are either muggleborn or grew up in muggle society.

Also, most potions (other than the ones that kill you) aren't permanent. Just like how you can't create something out of nothing, you can't use magic to permanently change anything. Even transfiguration has its limits and that is the most physical class of magic, requiring very precise wand movements to cast the spell.

I think that many people also write exercise who have never actually had to do a long exercise program. They just do an inspirational montage of before and after.

So yeah. It's pretty silly, but it does make some sense. Magic may not inherently be tied to your body strength but it may depend on how you use magic in the first place.
