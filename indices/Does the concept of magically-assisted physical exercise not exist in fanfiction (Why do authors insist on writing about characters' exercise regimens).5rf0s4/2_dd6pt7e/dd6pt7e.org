First, for example linkffn(11574569) (one example) has body improvement through rituals, if you get over the mild case of pedophilia in the fic. [1] In general, Gray!Harry or Dark!Harry fics tend to give magic more power, especially in terms of self-improvement. Light!Harry fics tend to give muggles more power.

Second, there are some reasons for this:

- People often get drilled how important sports are. They do sports themselves, and they invest quite a lot of time in them (or have people they like that do). When you invest something into something, your first instinct is always to defend it. You bought an iPhone? Apple is superior. You have a PC, and no console? [[/r/pcmasterrace]]. You play tennis? Football is for wankers. It's basically [[http://extrafabulouscomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sports.png][this]] effect.

- "The Wizarding world is bad, we need to fix all aspects of it" - a very common sentiment in FF. Muggleborns need to get more training for the wizarding world, students don't exercise enough, they disregard all the superior muggle stuff and are incredibly backwards (See: "How can you not have cellphones? Best invention evaaar" - Someone to Harry, when he has a video-mirror in 1994), ... - so we completely need to fix the system. Start with sport.

- Self-Improvement must come at a cost (at least the author thinks so), so letting your character run for a bit is easy, and something the author as well as the reader can easily relate to. You can only train Harry so much with spells.

- You want to give Harry an advantage over trained magic-users, and any ritual he does they'd done as well if it was easy. So you need to either give Harry an aptitude for these things (like for flying) /or/ give him access to a resource no one else has (Horcrux in head, black library)

[1] (I say mild case, since Harry had been in prison without any human contact since he was twelve, so I'd think he never grew up emotionally from that. Also, his body is also young, and hormones exist.) Anyways, the relevant stuff is in chapter 14:

  [[/spoiler][A few years ago, she'd done a ritual to give herself the strength of the male she could have been at the cost of her ability to taste sweetness. That the house hadn't affected that ritual was a minor miracle. She shuddered to think of what could have happened to her if it hadn't gone well, given what happened to the doxy in the ritual she'd just failed to complete.]]
