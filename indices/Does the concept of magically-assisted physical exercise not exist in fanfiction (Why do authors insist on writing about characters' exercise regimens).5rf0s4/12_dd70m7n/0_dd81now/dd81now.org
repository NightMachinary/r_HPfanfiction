If achieving fitness is the point of the story, the potion-assisted exercise is a potentially interesting aspect.

If achieving fitness /isn't/ the point of the story, then instant-fitness-in-a-bottle could work well.

I think the OP's point is that there are a bunch of stories in which many paragraphs are spent on exercise routines when it's not important to the story. Harry starts exercising in the Room of Requirement on time dilation, gets out at the end of term, his fitness routine is documented throughout summer, Ginny notices appreciatively, and that's the end of it. But Ginny already had the hots for him, and the story could have skipped summer at the Dursleys if it weren't for the exercise routine.
