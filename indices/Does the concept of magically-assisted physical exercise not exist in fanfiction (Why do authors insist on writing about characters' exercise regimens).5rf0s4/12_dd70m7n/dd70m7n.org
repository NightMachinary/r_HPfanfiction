Would it be any different from current chemically-assisted (protein powders, etc.) physical fitness practices? Or would it be, "drink a potion, when you wake up you're "10/10 definitely would'"?

Either way's boring but the first is less intrusive in the story. Unless the point of the story is drinking a bangability potion.
