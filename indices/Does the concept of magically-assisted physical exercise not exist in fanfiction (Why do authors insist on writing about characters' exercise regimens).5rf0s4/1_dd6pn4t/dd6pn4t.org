You haven't read any stories where Harry grows a foot taller and acquires an Adonis-like body over the summer through a regimen potions that "undo" the malnutrition the Dursleys supposedly subjected him to? I think that's a pretty popular trope. My main problem with it is that Harry doesn't have to work for it.
