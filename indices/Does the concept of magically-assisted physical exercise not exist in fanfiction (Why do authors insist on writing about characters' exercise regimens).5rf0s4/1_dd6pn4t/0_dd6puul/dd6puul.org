Not really, but that doesn't sound well balanced either.

Regardless, in stories like The Slytherin Subterfuge, where the character should be beyond capable of helping their physical selves magically, it's frustrating to see the author resort to exercise.

I, personally, would like to see something more along the lines of a character discovering or implementing a magical method to improve themselves physically.
