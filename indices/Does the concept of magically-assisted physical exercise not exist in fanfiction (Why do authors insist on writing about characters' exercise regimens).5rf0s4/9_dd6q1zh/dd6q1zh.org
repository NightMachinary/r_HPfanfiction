Eh, my head cannon is that there are physical enhancement rituals but they're extremely difficult to do because of the ingredients required in the ritual e.g.

- Fur of a transformed werewolf on a full moon.
- Blood of a vampire willingly given.
- Muscle/bone of a goblin that's seen a 100 battles.
- Heart of a centaur eaten when Mars is bright etc etc.

Otherwise you would have every character and his owl doing these kinds of physical enhancement rituals. The characters would then go from being wizards to being super heroes.
