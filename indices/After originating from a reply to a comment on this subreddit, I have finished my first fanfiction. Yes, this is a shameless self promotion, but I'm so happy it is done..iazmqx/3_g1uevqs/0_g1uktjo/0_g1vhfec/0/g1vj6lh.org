I agreeâ„¢. To both. But once while reading:

- I was convinced Dumbledore attacked Harry at Wizengamot and then realized it was Voldemort all along

- I got heart arrhythmia when I through chapter 5 is a ship of Umbridge x Dumbledore

- I through that Dumbledore wants Grindelward to duel Harry and I was very confused where the f did he came from (spoiler: it was also Voldemort)

Everyone of those is great in it's own right and I got really into them but it lead to many disappointments :'D
