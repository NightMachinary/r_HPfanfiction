OP, I have to say, I think the only thing that could possibly make your fic any better is if Draco (and possibly Crabbe and Goyle) used some mixture of potions and rituals to become girls so they too could bask in Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell's affections. Because I seriously think that's the only trope you didn't use.
