That was pretty good, I especially liked the constant breaking of the fourth wall. Even though it's a parody but I do find it a little bit excessive that 3388 of those words are "Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell" (and yes I saw the note about padding the wordcount, I actually really liked that note)
