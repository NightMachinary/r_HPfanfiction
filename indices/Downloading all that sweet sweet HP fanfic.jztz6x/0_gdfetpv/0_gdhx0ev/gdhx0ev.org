fanficfare is great, but requires you to individually input the url's of the fics you wanna read, this app shows you whole fandom (pages? communities?) so that you can browse and pick what to read when you're offline.

also this app works extremely well on iphones (and ipad) and fanficfare is awesome if you read on android/ tablet.
