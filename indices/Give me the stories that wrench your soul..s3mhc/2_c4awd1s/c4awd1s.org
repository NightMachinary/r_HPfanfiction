[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]] Oneshot. I posted this here awhile back. It's my headcanon for what happened at Malfoy Manor with Luna, and probably my all-time favorite oneshot.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]] Drarry Real World/Dreamworld AU, but very accessible to people who do not normally read this ship (I do not). It offers a really fresh view of canon Post-Hogwarts and an amazingly fitting AU Post-Hogwarts as well as being quite hilarious and gut-wrenching at once.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] One of my favorite next-gens that takes an all-encompassing look at the next-gen Potter-Weasley clan through Rose's eyes as she grows up. Not too sad, but definitely one where I fell in love with the whole cast of characters, so I have to put in here.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] Victoire/Teddy/Molly. This one's very strictly a romance drama, which I don't often read, but it's done so so well. Beautiful language, definitely emotionally charged.
