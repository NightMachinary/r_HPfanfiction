[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The_First_Day][The First Day]] - Some of these chapters will absolutely destroy you. The tale starts immediately where the last book ends and stops exactly one year later. It took my soul to bits. One of the best FanFics I've ever read, and goes really well with canon.
