[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7400212/1/Speak_Softly_Love][Speak Softly, Love]] - The terribly tragic story of Dolohov, courtesy of the ever brilliant [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1613119/Silens_Cursor][Silens Cursor]] (of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade_Cause][Renegade Cause]] fame). Lengthy, but insanely well-done.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7069833/1/Geminio][Geminio]] - Another exquisitely well-written one-shot, this time written by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1400384/Portus][Portus]] and centering around Moody. Also quite lengthy, but definitely worth your time and onions.
