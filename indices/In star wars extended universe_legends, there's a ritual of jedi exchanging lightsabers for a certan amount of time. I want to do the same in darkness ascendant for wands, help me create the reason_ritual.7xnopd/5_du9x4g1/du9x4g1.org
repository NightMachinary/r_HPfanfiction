It would be interesting if a person's wand acted as an extension of themself, and the ritual was for "corrupting" the person they gave it to. Think movie Crouch Jr, that muscle tic of his would show up on whoever he gave his wand to. Could originally have been created as a teamwork exercise that got out of hand.
