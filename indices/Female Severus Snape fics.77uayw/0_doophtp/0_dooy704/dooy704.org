  But. One thing strikes me. I still don't think she would join the Death Eaters. And so, there is nobody to overhear the prophecy told to Dumbledore, at least no-one that will tell it to Voldemort. Since the prophecy actually hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines... in this universe Trelawney does not make the prophecy. And so she isn't hired as Divination teacher, the subject is discontinued at Hogwarts, and Voldemort does not fall.

Er, I think I missed something. Why would Trelawney not make the prophecy in the first place?
