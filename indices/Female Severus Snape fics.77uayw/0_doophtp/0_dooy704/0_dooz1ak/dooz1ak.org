That's my reading of things....

Trelawney's prophecy only came true because Snape overheard it and told it to Voldemort. It's the classic "Greek Tragedy" setup, where Voldemort himself in trying to stop the prophecy from coming true made sure that it did.

If Snape isn't there to overhear, then there's no chance of Voldemort finding out and making the prophecy happen... hence the prophecy has no chance of happening.

In which case I don't think Trelawney would even make it, because even if not all prophecies have to come true, they need to at least have the POSSIBILITY to come true.
