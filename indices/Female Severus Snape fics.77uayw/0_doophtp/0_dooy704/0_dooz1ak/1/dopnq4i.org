There is also the possibility that in a world where most of the initial Universe is still the same, the prophecy remains too, like a fixed point, and another person is here to overhear it. After all, Sevanna being in Ravenclaw must have an influence on Voldemort's Slytherin sympathizers, however small, which could lead to one of them finding themselves in the same situation as canon!Snape.

If the consequences of an alternate premise can be determined in terms of the effort it takes to shift events and circumstances from the initial setup (which is a big assumption, I know), I would say that having another person overhear the beginning of the Prophecy and then telling Voldemort is "easier" (less costly for a closer result to the initial outcome) than erasing the whole Prophecy altogether.
