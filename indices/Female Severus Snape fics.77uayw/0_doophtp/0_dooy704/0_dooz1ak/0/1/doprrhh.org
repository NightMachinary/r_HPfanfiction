I can't find the scene now, but I think there is a part in the book where Dumbledore says that prophecies don't have to come true and that severall of the prophecies in the Hall didn't... so you're not wrong.

Problem with this particular prophecy is that the entire thing hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines, which won't happen without Snape eavesdropping. And it doesn't seem in character for Dumbledore to assure that it happens either, especially not with the "prophecies don't have to come true" speech....

I'm fairly sure that while prophecies don't HAVE to come true, there has to be at least a good CHANCE for them to come true. So I still say that the only reason Trelawney made that prophecy to begin with was because Snape overheard the first part of it.

That waid... I'll admit that I hate the prophecy and would very much like to have a world where it never happened, so I might be biased.
