Well there is the chance that she says it, and Dumbledore, knowing the self-fulfilling nature of prophecies, somehow allows Riddle to learn about it, thus allowing the prophesy to be valid... he probably isn't that mean tho (to endanger the potters and Longbottoms) Also there is no evidence prophecies can't happen without them coming true, aside from the 2 we see coming true. Probably most of the ones in the hall of prophecy never came true
