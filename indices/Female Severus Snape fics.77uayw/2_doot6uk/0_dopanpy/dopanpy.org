I've always thought trans HP fics were stupid. Human transfiguration exists. So do potions. If there were any trans wizards they'd just get a sex change.

Hell it's probably something they already do to make sure that the first child is whatever sex they need their heir to be. I can guarantee that if sex change magic actually existed IRL that every monarchy in history would have coincidentally had a son as a first child.
