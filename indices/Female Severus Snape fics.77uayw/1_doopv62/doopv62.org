It's incomplete, hasn't been updated in years, but I recall it being decent, "Blair" linkffn(5495350), then there's "Courting" linkffn(12397308), which, again, is marked incomplete and is really only okay for a read. Finally, there's an interesting and complete fic called, "Sugar, spice and everything nice" linkffn(11826673).
