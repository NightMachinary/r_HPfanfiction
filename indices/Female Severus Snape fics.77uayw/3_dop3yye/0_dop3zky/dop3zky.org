  "It is the burning in her arm that tells her something has gone wrong. It's not painful, not like it is when the Dark Lord calls for her and she ignores it for too long, but it isn't pleasant, either.

  "Lily and James," Her attention snaps to the old man, though she keeps her eyes trained on her trembling hands; she wouldn't be able to see much if she did look- he's hunched in front of the window, and the moonlight streams around him in a way that blurs any discerning features. "Lily and James chose to trust the wrong person, Severa. Not unlike-"

                  "Dont. Don't go there, Albus."
