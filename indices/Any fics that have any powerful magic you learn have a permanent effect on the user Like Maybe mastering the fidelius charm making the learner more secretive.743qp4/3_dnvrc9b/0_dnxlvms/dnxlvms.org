I like the Idea of including Potions i this though I would have it be both the creator and the one who ingests the potion who is affected but in two different ways.

It would also be interesting if it was all the more powerful spells that had an effect on you, though only a slight effect, but it would increase in effect each time it was cast. This could be used to explain the aversion to the dark arts, they slowly changes the caster, making them steeped in the negative emotions and the bloodlust required to cast the spells.

Perhaps this could also be why Wands have become the dominant way of casting spells, because the Wand acts as a buffer between the caster and the magic preventing most spells from affecting the caster. Rituals and wandless casting having a much larger impact on the caster.
