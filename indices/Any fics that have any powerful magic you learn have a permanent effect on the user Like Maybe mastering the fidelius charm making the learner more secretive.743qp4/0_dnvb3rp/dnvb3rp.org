Unfortunately, I don't know of any such a story, but the concept is really intriguing. Following your thought process, if Apparition is the first powerful spell learnt by most magicals, that would explain their wackiness. Maybe Dumbledore's was a massive contemporaneous animation of transfigured animals? That would give the many aspects of his personality that we see in the books a new spin.

A protective charm for Lily, who wanted to make sure to be shielded from the pranks and shield Snape from the marauders...
