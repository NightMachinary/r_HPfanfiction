If you want to branch out beyond the classic favorites, try Wolf, Wolf, by sebastianL (felix_atticus), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862/chapters/37676804]]). It is heavy going and hard to read at times, but just so brilliant in writing, characterization, depth, originality... really stellar (and the ending is good!). The author is truly on another level.

(Actually, going beyond Remus/Sirius, I also highly recommend by sebastianL: The Man Who Lived, which is Drarry, but not like any Drarry I've ever read, and I've read a lot! And also Let Go, which is Albus Severus/Scorpius. Both brilliant.)
