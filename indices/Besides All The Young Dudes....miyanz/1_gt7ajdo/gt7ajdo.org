Very explicit but linkao3(Remain in Light by Veeagainst) is very good at showing then during the war. The ending was more tense than canon.

linkao3(Dress up in you by MsKingBean89), linkao3(Text Talk by Merlywhirls) are two fantastic muggle AUs that are genuinely adorable.

linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) is a darker story showing the 12 in between years brilliantly.

linkao3(Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) is an angsty story at the height of the war where Sirius doesn't trust Remus.

I havent read it but a lot of people are talking about Blends? No idea what it's about. We have a large ATYD discord of you want to join? Im more of an angst person but the Library there is full of fluffy Wolfstar recs?
