  Adding concept that doesn't exist into officially published stuff and you get sued for copyright.

There are some examples of things that were changed in translations around the world to reflect other countries' cultural norms: for example, [[https://medium.com/the-curious-storyteller/lost-in-translation-harry-potter-in-arabic-6ebd2e4f65de][the Arabic translations]] removed references to non-married characters kissing and to characters getting drunk (with the exception of the Death Eaters, since they're the villains). I wondered if maybe someone translating the books into, say, Arabic or Hindi had added in a similar reference to a marriage contract somewhere - perhaps in HBP, where Bill and Fleur are engaged? I'll admit I may be off base here, but it might be more plausible than you think. But I'll agree that an author not knowing how to write a relationship progression is equally (and probably more) plausible.
