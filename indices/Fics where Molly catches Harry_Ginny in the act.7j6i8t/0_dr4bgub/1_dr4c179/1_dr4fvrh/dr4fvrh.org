Ehh... No? Adding concept that doesn't exist into officially published stuff and you get sued for copyright.

How about a more simple reason like "this is fanfiction and the author writes what he likes"? :D. Like, someone needed a quick way to pair up two people but didn't want to (or didn't have the skill to, this is fanfiction) flesh out their relationship, so 'Bam!', marriage contract.

Another person saw that, then thought 'How about a story where two MCs struggled because of a contract?'. He wrote that. People liked that, so the concept caught on.

I mean, even if it doesn't exist in canon doesn't mean that it's impossible to think of. Just like "Ice Queen" Daphne, Hermione bashing, overly helpful goblins, Lordships, Dark!Powerful!Independant!A whole host of other qualities that Harry doesn't have!But in the end he still turns out to be an edge lord! Harry.
