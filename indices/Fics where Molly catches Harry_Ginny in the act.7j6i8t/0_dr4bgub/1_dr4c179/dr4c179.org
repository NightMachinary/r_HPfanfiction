Totally. I don't even know where the whole "marriage contract" concept in fics came from, since marriage contracts are never mentioned in canon even once as something that exists in the Wizarding world.

I dunno; maybe it's something that was added into the books for translations in countries where marriage contracts are more common, and then people from those countries wrote fics with that theme, and it took off from there. That's the best explanation I can think of.
