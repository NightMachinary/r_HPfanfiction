They have a very different style to POS or AOC with a greater focus on characters and introspection than worldbuilding or plotting. CDT follows Canon too closely but compensates with its atmosphere and consistent but canon-non-compliant characterization. Firestarter has excellent plot and some original ideas but I find it to a bit too dry. HP and the Bucket list has excellent pacing with little to no repetition of canon scenes and tons of original ideas , Four years covered in half a year of real time, most likely will be completed first.
