Besides Sarcasm and Slytherin and Ashes Of Chaos?

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Firestarter) WBWL where James and Lily are dead and Harry is cordial with his twin. More Plausible premise. Ongoing.

Linkao3(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze) Gets rather dark but complete.

Linkffn(Three Black Birds) Age difference between Harry and WBWL. Abandoned/ Outline released.

Linkffn(Certain Dark Things) Neville is the WBWL. Fem!Slytherin!Harry. AU where Horcrux Riddle is Minister. Ongoing.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and The Bucket List) Harry's twin is an SI!OC who convinces Sirius to take them in. Not really a usual WBWL but OC!Twin is in Slytherin and cordial with Gryffindor!Harry. Recommended and Ongoing.
