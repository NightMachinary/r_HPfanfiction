I almost hate to tell you to read this fic, because it's also a work in progress and the author updates as rarely as Miss Jewel does. Still, it's just as riveting, and a thoroughly delightful read. Although it's Remus/OC-centered, the James and Lily story is there and there's lots of Marauder action so it doesn't really feel like a Remus-fic, it just feels like a Marauder fic told from Remus' perspective. Both it and Life and Times are my two current obsessions.

At the very least, she's got over 60 chapters up, so that should tide you over for awhile until Miss Jewel updates again. It's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2598097/1/Moments-of-Bliss][Moments of Bliss]] on fanfiction.net, and [[http://www.fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=24240][here's the story on mugglenet]].
