Well, to be fair canon Slytherin is a shithole and pretty much all Death Eaters come from there (besides Pettigrew, but he joined out of selfish reasons and not due to the ideology). The ambition to purge or subjugate a race excludes them from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff while the belief in pureblood supremacy makes Ravenclaw impossible.
