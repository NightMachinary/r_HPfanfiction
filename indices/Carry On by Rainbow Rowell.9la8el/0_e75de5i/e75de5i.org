/Carry On/ was a fun read, but the fanfic inspiration was so obvious that it also ended up having some of the exact same problems that I tend to have with Drarry fanfic (and most Slytherin-centric fanfic, tbh).

I think JKR made some unfortunate choices on a meta-narrative level with the Slytherins by implying that the entire house of 11-18 year old children was evil, but a fair number of Slytherin fans and shippers try to fix JKR's flaws but instead end up accidentally implying that the Slytherin emphasis on blood purity was somehow justified and correct. I don't want to say too much and spoil people who haven't read it, but I thought /Carry On/ had the same problem with its meta-narrative as a lot of Slytherin-centric fanfic. If the fanfic inspiration was less obvious, it might have bothered me less, but as it was, there were too many parallels for me to overlook it.

On the other hand, I did heartily approve of the canon slash, and 100% understand the impulse to just say fuck it and publish a thinly disguised fanfic to make my favorite ship canon forever. If somebody of Rowell's talent took on, say, Wolfstar, I'd be thrilled. :D

There were also some differences I really liked. The magic system was pretty cool, for example.
