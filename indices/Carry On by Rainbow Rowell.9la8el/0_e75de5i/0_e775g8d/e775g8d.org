JKR had a lot of plot holes, that's why in fanon, Slytherins are almost always stressed to be /ambitious/, not evil. Heck, that's why fanon /exists./

  but a fair number of Slytherin fans and shippers try to fix JKR's flaws but instead end up accidentally implying that the Slytherin emphasis on blood purity was somehow justified and correct

Completely agree. I rather like Muggle-Hating-Harry fanfics, it's true humans will shun anyone who is different from them. But blood purity is just dumb, there is no evidence whatsoever. I don't see where this popped up in Carry On though?
