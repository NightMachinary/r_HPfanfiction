Oh gosh the sequel... I'm so excited! Yah, the first ~180 pages were just Simon going "Where is Baz? Is he plotting?" And then Baz comes in and BAM all the action starts.

Yeah there are totally better fanfics. Funny, comparing fanfiction to published works. They could've made millions by publishing their work with different names (eg. Fifty Shades) but they didn't. They just got thousands of reads online instead.

I quite liked the little niche elements that made Carry On different from Harry Potter. The existence of Numpties, the floor of that one building that echoes what happens on the floor above, the use of a belt buckle to channel magic, that was just so refreshing to see!
