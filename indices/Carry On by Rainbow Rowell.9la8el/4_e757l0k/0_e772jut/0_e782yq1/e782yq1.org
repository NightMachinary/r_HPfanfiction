I exclusively get my fics on AO3.

My favourite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14087187][I Believe this is Yours]] , but everything that author writes is great. Most of the fics in the fandom are on the shorter side and she's got a few long ones which are excellent. There's this [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/235212][series]] which was written in 2015 before Carry On actually came out, based on Fangirl interpretations which I love because of the author's interpretation of Baz.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5033758][This]] is like the most popular one because it's good and it was one of the first, but it's great. There's a few other "True Love's Kiss" fics on AO3 that I like because I'm a sucker for that trope.

I dont actually follow anyone but dancingwdinosaurs on insta because I like to keep my real life and fandom life separate. I write in the fandom and wouldn't want anyone I know IRL to be able to find me somehow through things I like or people I follow. I have an aesthetic tumblr I used to follow everyone on there. I've considered making a writing specific tumblr to be more active but I'm kind of old and not sure I have the time/energy to keep it up.
