I saw fangirl lying around at my local library and got it out cause of the title. Somehow found myself liking the snippets of Cath's fanfics more than the actual book Fangirl :D so i searched up Carry On to see if anyone had written a fanfic or something... Turns out that Rainbow had written and published Carry On!
