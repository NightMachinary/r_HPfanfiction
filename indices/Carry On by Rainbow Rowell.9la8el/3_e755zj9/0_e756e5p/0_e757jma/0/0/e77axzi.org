I almost hate to say it, but it was AMAZING. Absolutely bloody brilliant, on stage. I loved it!

That's not to say that I consider it canon or anything, heh, and the time turning plot is still awful, but it's not as... noticeable on stage? The production was SO good, just reading the script doesn't make Cursed Child justice at all. I would've gone again if it wasn't so hard to get tickets.

If they'd told another story, free from time turners and Cedric turning into a Death Eater, I would've been a huge fan of CC.
