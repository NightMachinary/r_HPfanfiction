*Summary:* Sirius Black has Moonlighted as an actual Grim for years. Then, that fateful Halloween, he calls in a favour from Death. Now It's been ten years since anyone has seen or heard from Harry Potter, And when he fails to appear at the sorting in 1991, Chaos ensues. Hermione Granger was always different, but between magic and her new friend Harry, just how much will her life change? As years go by, and they grow closer to Harry's return to the Wizarding World, the question becomes: How will the Wizarding World react to a Harry Potter raised by his favourite â€˜uncle': The Grim Reaper himself.
