  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.

  In Alio Mundo - In Another World. When Sirius arrives at Godric's Hollow something stops him from running off after Peter and suffering for twelve years in Azkaban. This is the story of how Sirius and Remus come to raise Harry. Rated M for swearing and violence and possible future smut.. who knows?*As of Jan 2021, I'm going through and editing the story for grammar, spelling, and cohesiveness etc.*

Together, with the family she chose, they decide to raise him as their own. This is the story of how the avengers raise a young wizard, and how they teach him and each other how they all deserve the love and comfort having a family can offer.
