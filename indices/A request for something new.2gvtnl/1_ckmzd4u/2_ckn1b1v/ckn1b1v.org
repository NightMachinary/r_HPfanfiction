First thanks for the recommendations I'll be sure to check them out

All I mean by "new" is something I haven't read before... which I am now realizing is difficult because I never mentioned what I have read before.

For the sake of future recs in this thread if its one of the more well known fics in the Harry/Fluer/Daphne or/Tonks sections there is a good chance I've read it.
