Oh god there's so many, and its too easy to be really vague in a response to that question. The obvious one would just be more details on magic itself and how it works.

But if I had to choose the 1 thing that ALWAYS stuck out to me was the interplay between life and death in the Wizarding world as that plays such a huge part of the story. Of course perhaps that couldn't be explained for obvious reasons.

A close second would be more details on the department of mysteries and all contained within.
