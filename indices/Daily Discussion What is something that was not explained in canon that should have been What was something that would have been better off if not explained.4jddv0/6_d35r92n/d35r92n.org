  What is something that was not explained in canon that should have been?
#+end_quote

- Harry's maternal grandparents.
- Contents of the 'Love Room' at the Department of Mysteries. What was in it that could help magic users better understand an emotion?
- Exposition on owls' ability to find specific wizards/witches.
- What were Hermione's parents like?
- What did Ron's uncle Bilius really die from? (Obviously it wasn't really from seeing a Grim)
- Why do Muggles know about Merlin and why did JKR think it was okay to borrow from another author's work without citing it?

  What was something that would have been better off if not explained?
#+end_quote

- Origin of Harry's cloak. It was an ordinary invisibility cloak for the first several books: rare, but not one-of-a-kind. Then JKR needed a last-minute deus ex machina to help Harry win so it became something else.
- The Deathstick. I prefer to think of Dumbledore's skill coming from decades of hard work instead of a powerful wand that flies in the face of established lore.

Edit: clarified a point
