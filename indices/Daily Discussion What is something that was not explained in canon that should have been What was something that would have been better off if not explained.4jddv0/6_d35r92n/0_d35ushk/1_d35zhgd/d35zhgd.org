Probably because Grindelwald didn't really want to kill his former lover (makes sense, if the wand really is as "unbeatable" as it's advertised...I mean people who wanted it, as far as I know, got it by killing the ones using it when they were unaware (poisoning, while they were sleeping etc.) and not in duels!)
