The first writing featuring the "standard" Merlin was around 1100 CE, written by Geoffrey, but it was not as fleshed out until a while later when you get the whole Lancelot-Grail thing going.

But Merlin has changed so much over the centuries by other writers adding to him. And this dude was using other authors' works as well with /his/ creation.

I think it's hardly fair to rag on Rowling not citing Geoffrey for a thousand year old legendary character that's gone through so many iterations and authors.
