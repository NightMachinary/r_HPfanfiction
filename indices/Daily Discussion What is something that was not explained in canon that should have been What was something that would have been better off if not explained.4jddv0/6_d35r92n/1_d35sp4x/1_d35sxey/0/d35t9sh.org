I'm...confused. Either way, he's a public domain character. I thought that public domain characters are, by definition, okay to appropriate? Like sticking Robin Hood in your story - he's part of the fabric of our culture, so you don't have to credit anyone. Same with Merlin.

I don't want to argue, I'm just genuinely confused. I don't have a great grasp of intellectual property laws, so I just wondered why you thought this instance of using Merlin was bad?
