The Horcrux and the wandlore were this really awkward last-minute exposition, I always felt. I never liked the MMO-quest given to Harry "destroy 7 soul-anchors; 2/7 destroyed". The wandlore was just there for the Hallows (which I found to be completely redundant extra quest-objects).

I would have preferred if Voldemorts survival as a wraith was kept mystical. And I would have preferred, as I keep on saying, a seventh book with a civil war plot instead of the horcrux chase.

What would have deserved more explanation was the magical society as a whole and magic in particular. I know Rowling sai something along the lines of "magic is magic", but we know it follows rules.
