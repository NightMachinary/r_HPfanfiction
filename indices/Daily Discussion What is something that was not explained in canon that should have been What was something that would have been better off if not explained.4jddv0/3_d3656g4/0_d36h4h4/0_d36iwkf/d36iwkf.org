i would disagree with the foreshadowing. The diary foreshadowed the penesive, not the horcrux. Dumbledore only mentioned that the diary was a horcrux or acted like one, in the six book after they were introduced. other than possession, the diary acted exactly as a penesive, where you can project memories or thoughts. Just a darker more sinister form. Nagini was Voldemort's familiar, of course he can control her better than any other parseltongue. the Locket felt like it was added just like every other trinket that is never mentioned again. (how did one of the blacks get an order of merlin first class anyway?). The hallows and Horcruxes were bullshit. Rowling didnt feel confident writing a legit war, so she made it a treasure hunt which she had been doing all along. (first, second, and portions of the fourth were Harry and Co. hunting things.)
