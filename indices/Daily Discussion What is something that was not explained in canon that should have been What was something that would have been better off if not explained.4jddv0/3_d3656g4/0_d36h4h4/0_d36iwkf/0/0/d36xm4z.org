The entire concept of a horcrux, as it was written, is garbage. The locket foreshadowed nothing, the snake again foreshadows nothing as Nagini was controlled by a Parseltongue, and for all we know Harry can do the same thing if he found a snake. Also for reference, explaining how "foreshadowing" is foreshadowing does not make it so. So Dumbledore saying that Voldemort controlling Nagini better due to the soul shard being inside her is not a fair point. Especially since the whole scene is dedicated to tell Harry what the horcruxes are.

I didnt pull that concept out of my ass. I actually thought of it while reading the 7th book. I read it and realized that Rowling didnt want to write a war. Considering how much she tackled with the Harry Potter series, it only leaves three options. One she didnt think it would work, which most fans could make a great argument against; two, she didnt feel confident enough about some form of the story to include a war, which is entirely possible. She may have felt that writing a war would not have worked for the characters in the story; or three she wanted to end on the seventh book and a war storyline would take to much effort which is again possible. Via that logic, two of them include that JK didnt feel confident about writing a war story.

To address your point about the diary setting the tone, you are right since Dumbledore defined what a Horcrux did using the diary as the example.

my biggest issue with the Horcruxes were that they existed for over 60 years for Voldemort and not a single person other than Dumbledore and Regulus ever figured out that he had them? HOW? The Death Eaters all use dark magic, and Im willing to bet they each have a library much like the Blacks did, so how is it that not a single person ever thought about it? "Wow my boss said he is immortal should probably look into that" never crossed their minds? what about the fact that Voldemort made the protections over his horcruxes so easy to pass that three kids who never finished school could do it? It screams to me that there was not any thought whatsoever into it from before book six. Its one of the MAJOR reasons book six sucks so much for me. It was in my opinion, JK's attempt to cover the major plot point of a Villian who had immortality, and make that person able to be killed. (for reference the other reasons book Six sucks for me is that I really dislike the childishness of Harry, the way Ginny is written, the monster in harry's chest, and I really really really dislike Slughorn for some reason. probably due to bad memories of a chem teacher.)

TL;DR Horcruxes arent really foreshadowed since dumbledore uses each of the examples you gave except for the locket which was just a trinket that no-one cared about. The apprehension towards writing about a war is logic based on my part, not pulled out of my ass. I would like to state however that I like that you responded to the Black comment however... it was a random tangent of mine and I wasnt expecting it to be mentioned ever again lol
