Please don't pull concepts out of your ass.

#+begin_quote
  The diary foreshadowed the penesive, not the horcrux.
#+end_quote

How, exactly? It set the tone for how other Horcruxes would act in the future, and it's connected to the other Horcruxes, so it could be considered a "sneak peek" of book 6, whereas the Pensieve isn't connected to the Horcruxes at all: it only reminds Harry of the diary because they both involve reliving a memory.

#+begin_quote
  Nagini was Voldemort's familiar
#+end_quote

Literally nowhere in the books does it say anything like this. Also, Dumbledore even says in book 6 that the reason Voldemort has far more control over her than over any other snake is that a part of his soul is inside her, and not that she is his "familiar". Such concepts, while appealing, aren't mentioned at all in canon.

#+begin_quote
  how did one of the blacks get an order of merlin first class anyway?
#+end_quote

They used to be a very prominent family, and we already know they were obscenely rich at one point, so perhaps they bribed somebody. I don't know.
