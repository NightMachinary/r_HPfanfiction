'cruxes and hollows - damned, get rid of the damned things (a half-deflected curse could have easily left him alive after all, I mean it did some damage to Harry, too after all, so not all of it came back - that would have been a decent enough explanation for keeping Tom around...same for the hollows...I'd have been more comfortable if Harry actually used his potential and became something of a leader and didn't bumble along hoping that chance and luck etc. would be on his side (all the while people around him died because he was a stupid little bugger)...sorry, but he's no hero and he doesn't - IMHO - really try (he always seems to try and forget Voldemort is after him, I mean in his shoes I'd have tried to apply myself to school after the end of first year...he was unprepared and nearly died, that should shock anybody into action IMHO!)...in the end it was Dumbledore's (IMHO) stupid and fucked up plan, the damned hollows and a whole lot of luck (like Narcissa Malfoy realizing which way the wind was blowing and acting accordingly!))
