Entire point of the books is that Harry alone would have gotten rekt, but his friendship and respect for others made a group that was much greater than the sum of its parts. Super!Harry is occasionally fun to read, and I assume that your 'study' ploy would also end up with H/Hr or H/F or H/Tonks or some other 'badass' ship, but canon works well on its own BECAUSE Harry's not some super badass. He's pretty good at Defense and he can lead when he needs to, but other than that, he's fairly normal. And that's the point.
