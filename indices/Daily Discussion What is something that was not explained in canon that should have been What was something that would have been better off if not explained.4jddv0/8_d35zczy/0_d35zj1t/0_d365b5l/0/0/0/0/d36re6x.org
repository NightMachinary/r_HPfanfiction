He learns Sectumsempra by accident. He stopped doing the DA in year 6. He tries to be just!Harry with the same skills as his peers who have had crappy DADA teachers for years. I'm not saying he should be super!Harry but it's weird that he doesn't try to be more than average Harry.

I'm not the best person in my line of work but I still go on courses and get more qualifications to try to be better, as do most of my peers, and that's just for our own benefit. If the whole world depended on me being the best at my job I don't think that it would be achievable but I'd get off my arse and give it a go. Maybe I'm the odd one.
