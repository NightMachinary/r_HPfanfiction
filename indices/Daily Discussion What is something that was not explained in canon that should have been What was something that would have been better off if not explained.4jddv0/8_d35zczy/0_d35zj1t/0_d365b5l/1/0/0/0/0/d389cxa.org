Indeed, that's exactly my problem with Harry, his obsession with being a nobody ("...but I am just Harry!" - as he tells Hagrid) stunts his growth (his true potential only shows itself while he's in danger and fighting for his life - otherwise he's a damned under-achiever) IMHO (and it's probably because of the Dursleys, they after all treated him like he wasn't worth shit, so he himself has very low self-esteem and no sense of self-worth to speak off (I mean most of us wouldn't dream of sacrificing ourselves - even for loved ones (parents, girlfriends, friends, children etc.) - until all other options are exhausted (and some might not even do it then - and IMHO that's nothing to be ashamed off either because our own life isn't worth less than the lives of loved ones etc.!)! Harry doesn't think like that, his first course of action is taking any threat head on by putting himself in the line of fire (he doesn't involve adults etc. because his trust in them has been ruined (Dursleys - but also McGonagall just dismissing him/telling him to keep his head down and because Dumbledore doesn't listen to him anyway!)))

There's of course also Hermione and Ron - both of them are part of the problem (there's enough fanfictions that present this point, so I am not the only one thinking this) as both would probably not like an accomplished Harry (Hermione thrives and prides herself on being the trio's brain and Ronald hates being in the shadow of his more accomplished siblings and in Harry's, too (there would probably be no living with him if Harry suddenly became interested in his grades etc. for example if he wanted to switch electives (runes and arithmancy instead of making up stupid death-predictions (divination) and being nice to Hagrid (care of magical creatures)) and if he didn't want to play chess and rather do homework etc.)
