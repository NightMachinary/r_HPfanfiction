Well, it's justifiable: Harry didn't know if Draco had backup (so - permanently - disabling him (a stunner can be countered by Enervate and a disarming charm can be countered by say having a second wand or hell, a knife or something)) and if someone points a gun at you (any wand is a LETHAL WEAPON after all) then shooting to disable and/or kill is ok in my book!
