Maybe I just don't get it. I wouldn't feel too terrible about hurting a person who was trying to torture me, at best.

This is the problem with being an adult and trying to reason with a book aimed at children. Harry sat through how many detentions because of his completely justifiable self defense? It's complete BS. So much of it is complete BS--to an adult. And I just can't relate to how a teenager would think about these things.
