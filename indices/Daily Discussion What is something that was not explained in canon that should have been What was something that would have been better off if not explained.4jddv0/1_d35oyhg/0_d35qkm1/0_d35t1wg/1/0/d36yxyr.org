I'd say it's pretty normal for him to ignore the horrors of Voldemort until the consequences are made personal to him i.e. Lily being targeted. People often ignore problems faced by others until they are made personal to them. Lily's death was the event that changed Snape's mind, but I doubt he still believed in Voldemort's message and wanted him dead solely to avenge Lily.

He was motivated by more than just Lily, but her death was the emotional touchstone for him that reminded him of why he was taking such great personal risk to oppose Voldemort.
