  Snape's memories, and his love (platonic or otherwise) for Lily. I think ending it the way Saving Private Ryan ended would have been so much better. Harry asking why he did what he did, and Snape telling him, "No, those memories are just for me", or something along those lines. Just like Dumbledore didn't explain every little detail, Snape shouldn't either. "Because it was right!" or "I did what I had to do..." is all the reasoning he needs.

This. I actually liked Snape - or perhaps I should say the /idea/ of Snape - before DH, but after I read that chapter, he was ruined for me. The fanon take only made it worse.

Before DH, I had two different ideas on his backstory and why he was on Dumbledore's team, both of which I liked, but the second was my favorite and much more likely.

One: Rumors of his Death Eater sympathies were as exaggerated as the rumors of his vampirism. He was definitely a jerk, which was why he got along so well with some of them, but he had never joined (edited: except for spying purposes, meaning he never joined in spirit). This was never a very likely theory, but I love that kind of storyline, partly because it's usually humorous.

Two: He joined as a teenager, then saw some things that made him grow up and realise that this was not just talk - it was people's lives. He then spent the rest of his life doing the right thing, just because it was right. He still wasn't a nice person at all, but he was a good person when people's lives were at stake. This was actually possible, before DH, and was my headcanon.

DH made that impossible - apparently, obsession with one particular person is way more admirable than doing the right thing for its own sake. :P
