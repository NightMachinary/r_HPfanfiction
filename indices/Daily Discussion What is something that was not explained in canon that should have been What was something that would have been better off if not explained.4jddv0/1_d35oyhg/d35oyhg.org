I think asking what should have been explained is too easy. Whether or not you abhor the nitpicking of the story's plot, you have to admit there are questions. Granted, answering most of those questions would simply result in a worse story, but that doesn't change the fact that many things were left unanswered. I'm sure you've seen it already, blandge, but for the others who haven't [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7EARedHair][ARedHair]] pretty much covers all of it.

The real interesting part is what shouldn't have been explained. And the answer to that in my opinion -- and this isn't just because I dislike what the fanon has done with the information -- is Snape's memories, and his love (platonic or otherwise) for Lily. I think ending it the way Saving Private Ryan ended would have been so much better. Harry asking why he did what he did, and Snape telling him, "No, those memories are just for me", or something along those lines. Just like Dumbledore didn't explain every little detail, Snape shouldn't either. "Because it was right!" or "I did what I had to do..." is all the reasoning he needs.

Just throwing that out there as an idea.
