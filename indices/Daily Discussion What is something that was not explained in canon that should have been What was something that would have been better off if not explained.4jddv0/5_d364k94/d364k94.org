I would like more explanation on Voldemort's past. The 11 year old Tom Riddle we'd got in HBP was already inexplicably cruel. I think it would have been better and more interesting to at least give Tom a reason for his actions, you know, facing hardships and making the wrong choice.

Also, just a little bit (ah, who am I kidding, I wish there was an entire series) more backstory on Tom's travels, his unique powers, and the history of his first insurrection.

The origin of Parseltongue, its global distribution, and connection with Dark Magic.
