You would think that a massive intelligence would actually prevent him from having so many bad decisions.

  How many of those were so disgusted by humanity that they resolved to rule over it?

Exactly - why was he so disgusted by humanity compared to the other orphaned children? I know a Jewish woman who was born in Poland as WWII started, her parents were murdered and she grew up in an orphanage, and she's the epitome of goodness and sanity. And you can argue that Harry's childhood was even worse than Tom's. So what happened to Tom that fucked him up so bad? the little we had got is not nearly enough an explanation for me.

And part of the reason I say it is that I really do want to see it as a story, a story that shows how Tom had became Voldemort, and you can't have an interesting story with character development if eleven year old Tom Riddle is pretty much the same 71 years old Voldemort mentally.
