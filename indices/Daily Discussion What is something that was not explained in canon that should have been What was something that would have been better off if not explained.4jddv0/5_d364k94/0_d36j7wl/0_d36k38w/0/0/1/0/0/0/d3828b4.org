I would still argue to some extent that by the time we came to WWII Riddle would have already done most of his growing up. Additionally, by the time the muggle half of the UK was embroiled in WII, Riddle spent the majority of the year at Hogwarts. Like the OP of this comment thread said, it would be interesting to read something that examined why Riddle turned out the way he did.
