  I would argue that growing up intentionally abused by known relatives is worse than what we can gather of Riddle's childhood of poverty.

From watching documentaries like the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdOkTeXREa8][1940's House]], and doing loads of research online to find out what life for orphans in the WWII era was like, Tom Riddle basically had it around the same - if not worse - than Harry had it.

Even then, Harry had at least some people who cared about him - including Dumbledore and Sirius - out there; a whole wizarding world who revered his name; riches in his family's Gringotts vault; and a later adoptive family, in the form of the Weasley clan. Tom Riddle had none of that.

Orphans were treated extremely poorly during the WWII time period by the general UK populace, mainly because families who already had children, and were struggling to survive on rationing, were asked or were forced by the UK government to take care of orphan children as well.

Additionally, medical care was all but non-existent for orphaned children during the time period, seeing as how most doctors and nurses went off to be field medics. Teaching, too, was in short supply, as the disastrous "Operation Pied Piper", which occurred on the same day (1 September 1939) that Tom Riddle went to King's Cross for his second year at Hogwarts, scattered both teachers and put children's education [for Muggles, at least] into chaos.

Even then, families put their /own/ children above the orphan "street rats" they took in, and in some cases, even neglected orphan children by refusing them care, food, or other necessities.

There was a very real hatred, prejudice, and discrimination against poor, orphaned, and destitute children in the WWII era.
