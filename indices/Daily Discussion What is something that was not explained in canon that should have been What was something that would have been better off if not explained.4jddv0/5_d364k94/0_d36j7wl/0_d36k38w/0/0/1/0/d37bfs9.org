From what we know Riddle grew up in GB during the late 1920s, before reaching the Great Depression and WWII during his later years. Theoretically, not a horrific childhood, poor, sure, perhaps abuse, and he somehow comes out incredibly cruel and "evil". OTOH, Harry Potter grows up with relatives, who tell him he's worthless, shout at him and he grows up in a cupboard. I've seen it discussed that Harry's childhood is pretty much a stereotypical case for abuse in the form of neglect.

I would argue that growing up intentionally abused by known relatives is worse than what we can gather of Riddle's childhood of poverty. It would be really interesting to see a story of how he grew up/why he turned out so different.
