I meant mostly grown up in the sense that he would have developed his personality/he's pretty well-developed in terms of personhood. Like OP said, it would be interesting to see an exposition on his childhood and he developed into such a twisted person. We're told that he was a cruel child when Dumbledore met him, but why? It's possible (highly likely IMHO) that JKR simply made him that way without much thought into it in order to juxtapose him with Harry (who had a similar upbringing), again emphasising the theme of "choices".

Also my original reply was re: Harry's childhood being (theoretically) on par with Riddle's. Like others have said there were plenty of people who grew up in orphanages during WWII who didn't turn out to be mass-murderers.
