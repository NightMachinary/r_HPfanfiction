  Even then, Harry had at least some people who cared about him - including Dumbledore and Sirius - out there; a whole wizarding world who revered his name; riches in his family's Gringotts vault; and a later adoptive family, in the form of the Weasley clan. Tom Riddle had none of that.

You're referring to Harry's Hogwarts years. I referred to pre-11 years old Tom and pre-11 years old Harry, simply because that's the earliest we see Tom, and because both their lives changed considerably after. And Tom had made quite a few allies and was idolized in his Hogwarts years.

I don't care what some documentray says about orphans in the 40's, for two reasons: 1. Other orphans (and generally people who suffered a horrible childhood) didn't reach his level of insanity and evil, and 2. (most importantly) none of that showed in the text. Cole's Orphanage wasn't a terrible place. They had vacations at the beach and pet rabbits, Tom had his own room (better than what Harry had) and the caretaker was generally well meaning. There is no evidence in-text that Tom was abused, certainly not the kind of abuse that creates someone like Voldemort. And Harry's personal abuse was much worse than any wide prejudice against orphans, because he had to suffer it alone, and it was aimed directly at him, unlike Tom, who was in "good company" (as well as in top of the pecking order).

I expected Tom to be given a backstory that truly shows why he turned so evil and mentally unbalanced. I got none of that. if you're going to create a villain that is so far beyond the limits of "normal evil", you can't give him a "normal backstory". You have to make it something specific, because otherwise you can't explain why all of his fellow orphans didn't come out the same way. Maybe it doesn't work like that in real life, but it has to work like that in fiction, where people expect reasonable cause and effect. It's bad storytelling and bad characterization, it's unsatisfying, and it's just not /interesting/. It's the most banal of Freudian excuses. And it's not even something we've /seen/. All we've seen is Tom acting like little Damien in a relatively good environment.
