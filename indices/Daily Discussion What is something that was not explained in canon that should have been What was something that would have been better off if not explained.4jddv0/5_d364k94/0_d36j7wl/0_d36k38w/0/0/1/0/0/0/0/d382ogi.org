  I would still argue to some extent that by the time we came to WWII Riddle would have already done most of his growing up

  the disastrous "Operation Pied Piper", which occurred on the same day (1 September 1939) that Tom Riddle went to King's Cross for his second year at Hogwarts

He was 12-13 years old at the time when the UK started to get really, truly embroiled in the war. I wouldn't call that "mostly grown up".

  Like the OP of this comment thread said, it would be interesting to read something that examined why Riddle turned out the way he did.

Agreed.
