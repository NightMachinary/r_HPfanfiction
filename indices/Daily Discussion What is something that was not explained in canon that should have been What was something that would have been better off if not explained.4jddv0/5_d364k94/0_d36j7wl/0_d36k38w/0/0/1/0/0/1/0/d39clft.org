If you meant to refer specifically to pre-11-years-old Tom and Harry, then I would suggest editing your post to clarify that. Until you clarified it in your reply, I assumed that you meant more than just the two's childhoods would be open to explaining why Tom chose the path of becoming Lord Voldemort.

However, as the UK was leading up to war even in Tom's childhood, I think my point(s) still should be considered in the explanation of "why Tom turned out the way he did". It took years of planning, for example, to implement something as large-scale as Operation Pied Piper, and plans for, or actual, drafting was already taking place by that point in time. The people were already expecting war, and to many, it was only a matter of time before war broke out.

Even in the magical world, we know that Grindelwald, despite never launching an assault on the UK, was also rising to power in continental Europe. It was a starkly different time, place, and mentality that the general UK populace and government had at the time, as compared to the time period where Harry grew up. Whereas Tom grew up during an era where a major war, a /world/ war, was looming on the horizon, Harry grew up in a time of peace.

This also reflects in the stark differences of their characters: while Lord Voldemort wants to wage war upon the Ministry of Magic, and take over magical Britain, Harry does /not/ want to go to war. In fact, throughout the books, Harry wants nothing more than to live a peaceful life, free of the threat of a next wizarding war and Dark Lord. However, due to Voldemort's actions that set the Prophecy in motion, Harry feels that he must defeat Voldemort nonetheless.

  I don't care what some documentray says about orphans in the 40's
#+end_quote

Well, I think that you should, especially since it's what actually happened during that time period. Also, the documentary isn't about orphans, it's what the Muggle UK (specifically, London, where Tom's orphanage was located) had to go through during the WWII era.

Although Rowling didn't write about it in the books, that doesn't make it completely irrelevant, especially since Rowling /did/ do some research for Ilvermorny for Pottermore and the /Fantastic Beasts/ film. If she does write about it, she will likely do the same or similar research, including watching the documentary, in order to make writing about Tom's youth realistic.

Likewise, even though Rowling did not write directly about Tom Riddle's development into the person he ultimately became (Lord Voldemort), it is still implied. "Offscreen" character development is often used by novelists and authors as a tool to save time, and in Rowling's case, this is especially true. Since Tom Riddle's entire character development was not directly relevant to the plot, save for the main characters learning about his Horcruxes, Riddle's development was not shown "on-screen".

Now, if the books had Tom Riddle as the protagonist, and not Harry, that would be a /very/ different story. However, the title of the books are "Harry Potter", so Rowling most likely chose to omit the majority of Riddle's character development. Likewise, there's also the fact that such omission would make Voldemort, as a villain, more "mysterious" to the reader(s) and audience, something that Rowling likely intended.

  Cole's Orphanage wasn't a terrible place.
#+end_quote

That's a pretty generalizing statement to make, especially since we don't know a lot about Cole's Orphanage to begin with. Also, it's called "Wool's Orphanage" in the /Half-Blood Prince/ film.

  They had vacations at the beach
#+end_quote

- That was only one known vacation, and it seemed to be more of a "field trip".

- Said beach was clearly dangerous in some regards, given the description of it in the books; what happened there with Tom terrorizing those two children, which is never fully explained; and due to the high cliffs depicted in the films.

  pet rabbits
#+end_quote

If you watched the 1940's House documentary, it explains that, at the time period, children and people in general were encouraged by the UK government to raise rabbits...with the intent of killing and eating them. While most treated them as pets, they were also distributed in order to wind up on the children's dinner plates.

So, while a rabbit hanging from the rafters is disturbing, killing the rabbit really wasn't that big of a deal for the time period. The rabbit would have probably been killed, skinned, and made into rabbit stew anyways.

  the caretaker was generally well meaning
#+end_quote

...and she was also implied to be a drunkard in the books, hence why Dumbledore used spells in order to subdue her.

#+begin_quote

  1. Other orphans (and generally people who suffered a horrible childhood) didn't reach his level of insanity and evil...There is no evidence in-text that Tom was abused, certainly not the kind of abuse that creates someone like Voldemort...I expected Tom to be given a backstory that truly shows why he turned so evil and mentally unbalanced
#+end_quote

Lumos, Rowling's anti-orphanage charity, actually used the official studies of this on their website, but raising children in an orphanage has been shown and proven, many times, to cause sociopathic and antisocial tendencies in many children, Tom Riddle included. Also included is a host of other mental illnesses and disabilities.

This is because children /are/ often neglected in orphanages, especially as infants and toddlers. Neglect is a form of abuse, one that runs rampant in orphanages, and one that is used by Rowling herself to spearhead efforts to completely abolish such institutions. [[http://wearelumos.org/problems/child-abuse-and-neglect][Lumos even has its own website dedicated to exposing child abuse and neglect in orphanages]], and also [[http://wearelumos.org/the-problem][as another webpage on it]].

  Across the globe 8 million children are living in institutions that deny them individual love and care. More than 80% are not orphans. They are separated from their families because they are poor, disabled or from an ethnic minority. As a result, many suffer lifelong physical and emotional harm...A small percentage are in institutions due to behavioural problems or due to being abused or neglected. This is a violation of their rights...Social services are insufficient to meet the needs of poor families or protect children from abuse.

  Decision makers resist closing institutions because they cannot imagine a system of family based care and lack the resources to fund and manage the change. Personnel resist for fear of losing their jobs. Stigma attached to children in care makes communities reluctant to accept them.

Rowling also reaffirmed this in a 2007 interview, where she stated, "Everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him." [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][(Source)]] This is also in line with Lumos's slogan, which is "[Loving families], not orphanages."

  if you're going to create a villain that is so far beyond the limits of "normal evil", you can't give him a "normal backstory"
#+end_quote

But that's the whole message of the Harry Potter books and films. Tom Riddle /did/ have "a normal backstory", albeit a tragic one. One of the main messages and themes of Rowling's books is, "it is not our abilities who make us who we are, but our choices". Especially since one of the major lines of dialogue from Dumbledore from the films is, "I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices".

Tom Riddle wasn't so evil because he was born that way, but because he /chose/ the path of becoming "the greatest Dark Lord who ever lived". This is a message also stated, and implied, many times in both the books and films.

#+begin_quote
  You have to make it something specific, because otherwise you can't explain why all of his fellow orphans didn't come out the same way.
#+end_quote

Who says that they didn't? After all, there's no evidence in the books as to how they turned out as adults, or even as teenagers.

#+begin_quote
  It's bad storytelling and bad characterization, it's unsatisfying, and it's just not interesting. It's the most banal of Freudian excuses. And it's not even something we've seen. All we've seen is Tom acting like little Damien in a relatively good environment.
#+end_quote

If you feel that way, then I think the true issue you have is with how J.K. Rowling wrote Lord Voldemort (and Tom Riddle) in the series. Unfortunately, all I can do is to try and explain Rowling's public stance(s).
