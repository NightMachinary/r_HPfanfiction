Oh god, you keep pasting blocks of texts while completely ignoring my point.

I could go and point out a couple of errors in your post, but it doesn't matter, just as real life orphanages don't matter, simply because they /weren't/ in the story, where orphanages /weren't/ shown as terrible places (the vacation was each year, Mrs. Cole liked to drink but wasn't abusive when she drank) and because there's nothing in it to suggest "this turned a child into an insane sadistic dark lord". You're completely ignoring any literary cause and effect and just saying "well it wasn't a very nice place, so that's an ok backstory", but no, it isn't. Millions of children suffered what Tom had and worse, and the world is not crawling with Voldemorts, even if it produced some sociopaths.

It's about choices, yes, but what experiences made Tom make those choices? nobody knows. Rowling included. But I think it's a story worth pursuing - at least if you don't handwave it away with "oh he was at an orphanage, so now he's a dark lord!". You might be satisfied with that, but I look for characters who actually have a reason for the way they act.
