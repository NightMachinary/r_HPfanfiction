how many of those were gifted with a massive intelligence, and magical ability equal to it? How many of those were so disgusted by humanity that they resolved to rule over it? I would say it would be an interesting read, but I would much rather learn of Dumbledore's life. His duel with Grindlewald, his rise to headmaster, his studies with Nicolas, his bonding with Fawkes... When did he reconnect with his brother? Because they sure as hell did, as Alberforth allowed Dumbledore to use the Hogs Head. Who taught Dumbledore to duel? Who was he friends with? These are all questions I had. Sure we know Doge was a "friend" but everyone who sided with Dumbledore would have called him a "friend". They were going to travel the world, but as a group of multiple people? or what? Did they ever travel? How did Dumbledore become head of the Wizengamot? All of this is more interesting to me than Voldemort's childhood.

However, the years from 1945 to 1970 where Tom Riddle disappeared, and Voldemort rose.. those could be interesting. I think there is a fan film about it too.
