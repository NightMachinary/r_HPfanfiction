I'm curious about the religious aspect/lack thereof in the wizarding world. In our own mundane reality it's easy to justify an agnostic or atheist perspective (which is my own belief), but in a world with actual, undeniable magic? There's more likely to be one or many divine beings, right? Especially when you consider that immortal souls are known to be real, and an afterlife of some kind seems generally accepted in the wizarding society.

Also: if you lived in a world where magic was clearly a real and normal part of life, and souls very definitely existed, why would anyone get so bent out of shape about death? They're just going on to "the next great adventure", right? What was Voldemort's problem?
