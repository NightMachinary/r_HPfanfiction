Voldemort went through the most torturous thing ever... he was in an orphanage during the great depression. No one seems to remember that. Tom Riddle grew up hungry, beaten, teased and for all intensive purposes tortured for 11 years. and what caused that? Death. Death of his mother put him in this orphanage unloved, and tortured. He most likely subconsciencely blamed death for every single thing that went wrong with him during his stay in that orphanage. thus his sentence of his mother couldnt have been a witch as she died. Magic was his way of protecting himself from all his enemies, INCLUDING death.
