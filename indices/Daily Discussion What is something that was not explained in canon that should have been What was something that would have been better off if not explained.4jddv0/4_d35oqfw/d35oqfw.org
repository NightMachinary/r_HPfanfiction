On the one hand, I would have loved more explanation on the physics and function of magic within the universe - why do some laws apply? Why is magic so able to do some things but not others? Why are some people better at magic than others, etc?

But on the other hand... I probably would have despised JKR's explanation of it, and I've written thousands of words on the subject in the form of meta, really enjoying getting into the subject on my own.
