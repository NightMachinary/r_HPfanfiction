I think that JKR's entire world is a bit twee and simple - and I'd argue that that's one of the reasons that it took off. Being able to wave away niggling details as 'magic' frees up time/space/etc. for exploring the actually interesting stuff. Not that the Discworld approach isn't equally valid - it's a series I really should get around to reading, but I don't feel that it fits the HP world.
