Magic in the HP books is a mix of Soft Magic (since we have very little, I'd almost say no, understanding about the rules of magic) and Hard Magic (Since the little we do know is "Say X --> Spell X happens). This basically gives magic a sense of wonder since you don't really get what's happening (like LotR), but you still understand what's going on when they start fighting or use a specific spell (like Mistborn).

So while it would have been cool to understand how everything about magic worked, it would have undermined the "magical" feeling the books have. Also as you mentioned this let's you come up with your own rules, as long as they fit with what little we know (which is always nice for FF).
