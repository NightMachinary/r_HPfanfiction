I would have liked a little more on Lily. To me it's improbable that Dumbledore, McGonagall and all the other teachers that taught her had not a thing to say about her to her orphaned and friendless son who came to the same school she did, for six years, just twenty years after she herself had been there. Similarly that every person who knew her in school is now dead. Surely friends of the dead mother of a celebrity should be falling over each other to befriend him or comfort him?

I also would have liked an explanation for why Remus didn't reach out to Harry sooner instead of coming across him by chance through his work. Sure, he was poor, but they literally live in a magic world where you can send magic silver messages for free. Or an explanation that he did reach out, but was blocked by Dumbledore/the Dursleys/the protective charms on the house, etc.
