Ooh I have a few requests too, can I get

- Harry x Quirrel's Turban
- Harry x Slytherin's Statue
- Harry x a Horcrux
- Harry x the Magical Tent he travels in

Bonus requests:

- Sybill Trelawney x Anyone (no crackfics)
- Ron who is a weeaboo
- Hermione who acts like the average poster of /r9k/

Edit: You guys aren't taking the Horcrux request literally enough, I want to see Harry defending Tom Riddle's diary from manipulative!evil!Dumbledore's plots to murder it and then writing homoerotic poems in it.
