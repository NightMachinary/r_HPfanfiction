Are you looking for just grand, worldchanging stuff or are smaller ideologies applicable as well? To explain:

For the first, I'd like to see someone who took the Statute down from a Humanitarian viewpoint. "It's cruel, watching them suffer like we do, with no aid at all! We should rejoin the two worlds and work together for the good of all!" Lawful Evil Altruists are some of my favourite characters - especially with the 'Knight Templar' self-image.

For the latter, you could have a villain who wants the 'elitist ivory-tower hoarding of the Unspeakables to end' and opens up experimentation and spellcrafting to all. Or that just wants to be left along to experiment and perhaps took over a small town with a protection racket - they provide subjects, he provides protection.

You could take the standard WBWL 'I want to prove myself better than someone else' and have that pursuit of superiority grow into beating everyone else and becoming the Wizarding World's version of a Tarrasque or finding some all-powerful status.
