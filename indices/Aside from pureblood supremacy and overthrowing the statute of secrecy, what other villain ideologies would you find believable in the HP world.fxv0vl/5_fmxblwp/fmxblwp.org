Power and money is a good enough motive for me. You don't need a graphic novel / cartoon style villain to do harm. A greedy bastard who casts the Imperius on beautiful young (muggle) women and forces them to prostitute themselves and pockets the cash can do plenty of damage. Add in magical drugs and an lucrative illegal potions trade and Goblins willing to look the other way and it is a perfect storm.
