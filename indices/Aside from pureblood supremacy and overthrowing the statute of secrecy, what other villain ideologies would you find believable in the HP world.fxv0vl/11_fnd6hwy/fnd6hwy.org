Magical supremacy rather than blood purity. Anything that's magical is inherently better than anything that isn't. It's not about blood. Magic doesn't truly care about blood, which is why squibs exist to begin with.

Magic is the tool of the worthy, the powerful. It can't be stolen or transferred anymore than a star can be contained by a clay vessel. A squib doesn't have magic because a squib is as worthless as a muggle. And a Muggleborn though from unworthy stock is as worthy as a pureblood.
