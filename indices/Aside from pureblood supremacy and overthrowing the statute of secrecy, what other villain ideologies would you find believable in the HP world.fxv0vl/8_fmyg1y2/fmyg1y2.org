In my mind technology works with magic. Dark Lords don't want muggle technology because the masses would be to hard to control. The ministry pushes the belief to stay in power and to stop the magical population to join the muggles. The goblins also propagate that technology doest work so they work as currency converters for the muggleborn and muggle raised half bloods. Also any services they provide purebloods can be handled by muggles thus losing out on fees. Basically a giant conspiracy that the top people know of but for varies reasons cover it up. The anti technology Ward could be set up to block areas from the muggles.
