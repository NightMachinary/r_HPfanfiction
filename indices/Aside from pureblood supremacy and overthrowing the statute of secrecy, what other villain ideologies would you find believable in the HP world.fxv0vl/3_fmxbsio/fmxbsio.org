Blood purity but not in the muggleborn way, but more of a genocidal crusade against any magical being that is sapient but not human. Veela, maybe giants, werewolves, goblins and so on, the leader believing that magic was gifted to humans and all these abominations stole it, and he is the prophet come to enlighten the chosen to their purpose.

A fight for the complete freedom of magic, no ministry of magic and no governmental bodies restricting magic. No matter the consequences, no matter the sacrifice needed, magic is to be allowed to be practiced freely with no oversight.

Instead of pushing to take over the world, realising how badly the muggles have poisoned the world and how they continue to do so. Researching a way to enter and alter dimensions that they could move to, but the governments don't want to because their power base would be disrupted so they decide to dominate the governments and form a single body under their control in the new world.
