The book thief - someone is raiding all the great libraries of esoteric works, and starts using spells no one has heard of for centuries.

Ekrizdis 2.0 - demon summoning is very out of vogue ever since Dementors were released into the world. Someone wants to bring them back into fashion, because just making hybrid creatures is boring (and also illegal, so why not go for the gold ring?)

Hagrid breeds them bigger and bigger, until... driders, xenomorphs, ... kaiju.

The only way to stop the curse that is lycanthropy is to isolate them in a quarantine and interrogate them to find out who else they've infected, until they all die off.
