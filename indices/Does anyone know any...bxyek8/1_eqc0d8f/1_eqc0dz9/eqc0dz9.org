  The first thing Luke Dursley did when he got his Hogwarts letter was dance a triumphant war dance around the sitting room. The second thing he did was write to his cousin Lily. The third thing he did was take the Smeltings stick his Grandad Dursley had given him for his birthday last week and plant it in the flowerbed with the Smeltings hat and coat hanging off it - for the crows, he explained to Mum. No, not to scare them off. For food. It was a symbolic gesture, Mum.
