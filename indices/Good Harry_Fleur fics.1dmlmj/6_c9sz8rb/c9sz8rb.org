I would have to recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble][Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2036266/DriftWood1965][DriftWood1965]]. It's a Harry/multi fic, but you might find what you're looking for. It's an excellent story with a well-written Fleur.
