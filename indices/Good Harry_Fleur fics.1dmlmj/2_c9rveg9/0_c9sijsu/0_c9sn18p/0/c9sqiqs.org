  Edit: If you're looking for the 'sexy older woman helps inexperienced young boy mature' trope, your best bet is Harry/Tonks. It's much more prominent in that ship.

When you put it like that it sounds wrong. And there is a difference between 3 and 7 years. Also there is the timing. A lot of fics with Fleur talk about a Veela bond and how she is actually a full Veela (which is ridiculous since it was pointed out that she is only 1/4 and it is more of a trap to force people together than to actually attempt to write a good backstory), and even though I detest the whole bond thing I like how they use the new influence to help solve some of Harry problems.

Book 3 introduced Sirius but Harry canÂ´t be with him because of politics and incompetence. Book 4 has Harry competing in a tournament meant for adults where he suddenly only has 1 friend to help him, and Voldemort looms in the distance. He needs guidance and he needs to shape up. This is the perfect timing to have him prepare for the war that is to come.

Equally we see Fleur dealing with reality instead of just taking things at face value. A lot of people seem to think her arrogant, but in the end she ends up humbled. She has, I think, though that she could do anything herself, but it the end she realices that without help you can sometimes do very little on your own.
