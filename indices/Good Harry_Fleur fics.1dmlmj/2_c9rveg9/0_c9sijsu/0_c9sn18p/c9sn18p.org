  She can help Harry mature and advance his skills, which is what I would really love to see.

Sadly, that's pretty rare. In Harry/Fleur, Harry is generally portrayed as a more mature/capable/assertive/powerful version of his canon self to balance their relationship. He is often Fleur's equal or her better. This almost always results in Fleur's realization that he is no longer 'a leetle boy.'

Edit: If you're looking for the 'sexy older woman helps inexperienced young boy mature' trope, your best bet is Harry/Tonks. It's much more prominent in that ship.
