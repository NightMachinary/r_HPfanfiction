Hard to believe there are not more...but I think the problem is "good" H/F or H/Gabby fics are hard to come by, moreso if you want them completed or on track to completion.

Most of the rest end up being very short one-shot types, or part of a harem. Nothing wrong with a Harem, but in most of them you lose the individual girls and it just becomes blond sex, brunette sex, asian sex, etc. I assume you are looking for relationship not just porn.

I am biased, but can only think of one really well done Harem, where each girl (for the most part) had her own character and interacted with Harry as an individual. Gabrielle was a huge character in that story, Fleur not so much

Maybe I should write one.... *edit: as I have been reminded...I probably AM writing one, so more like I should really get back to it and get Harry to Beauxbattons with Fleur and Gabby*
