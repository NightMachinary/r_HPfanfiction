One of the few fics with genuinely useful advice.

I have several younger, very annoying siblings. I also happen to be the only one of us with access to the router settings. If they annoy me too much, I enable a time rule limiting their phone and laptop to 1:01-1:02 AM, because the router doesn't have a proper way to temporarily block a specific device.

I have more power over them than our parents do. Muahahaha.
