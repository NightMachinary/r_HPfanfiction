Honestly I got into the Tomione ship (gross, I know) when I was like 11, because of this masterpiece of a fic that made me cry. It's sort of had the same outcome as the mortal instruments.

In those books, the main villain of the entire series repents at the end elements about the time he could've had with the main character.

It was Hermione going back in time to stop him from becoming Voldemort or killing him, and he was a dick the entire time. They ended up becoming friends or acquaintances at least because of a project and she never really fell in love with him, but never really made sense to me in that ship anyway.

However, he fell in love with her, and at the final battle sacrificed himself by committing suicide. So really, anything that will make my cold heart connect with the characters.
