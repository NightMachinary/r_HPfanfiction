No problem! I don't think you have to feel bad about enjoying a story even if the writer is an asshole. I mean, we're all doing that right now.

I feel you though. I lost my shit when I read about the Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness dude ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9n4vge/fanfic_community_popular_author_turns_out_to_be_a/]]) though by the time I got to the end of the story it made sense.

Everything that girl has submitted to that sub is pure gold. Definitely check out the one about the Snapewives.
