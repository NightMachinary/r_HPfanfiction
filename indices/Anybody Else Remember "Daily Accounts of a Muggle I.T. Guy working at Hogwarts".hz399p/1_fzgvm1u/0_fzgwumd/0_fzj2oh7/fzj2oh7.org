Thank you so much for linking this! I have heard something about this before but never in such detail. I kind of regret reading The Mortal Instruments in general because those were mediocre at best, but now I feel the weight of giving my support to a plagiarist.

On a side note, I really hate that reddit archives posts. I would have loved to give [[/u/iwasonceafangirl][u/iwasonceafangirl]] a like at least.
