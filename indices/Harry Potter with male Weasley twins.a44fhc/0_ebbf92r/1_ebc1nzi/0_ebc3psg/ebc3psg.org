Okay wow this took /a lot/ of searching to find again! I do want to warn you that the whole Weasley Twins/Harry aspect isn't the main plot or relationship, but it's there and it's pretty cute when it does come up. Also, please be careful to heed the trigger warnings, as the fic does deal with some pretty heavy themes. Anyway, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8612305/1/Secrets][here]] it is!
