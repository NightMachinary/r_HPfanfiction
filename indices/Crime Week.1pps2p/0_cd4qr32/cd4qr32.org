'The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.'

Harry Potter - Rated: K+ - English - Drama - Chapters: 1 - Words: 27,424 - Reviews: 85 - Published: 6-22-11 - Amelia B. - Complete

It's listed as Drama but it's very much about Crimes and Law-enforcement. A muggle is killed in the midst of a magical crime and the Aurors cover up the evidence, but the victim's sister seeks justice for his death from a society that regards her as little more than an unruly pet.
