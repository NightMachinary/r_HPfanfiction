Linkao3(C'est La Vie) It's not finished but it's pretty good, the Harry meets Lily and James is only a subplot, and they don't know he is their son.

Linkffn(Across the Universe) It's a one shot from James perspective

Linkao3(The Second String) Harry ends up in a different dimension thinking that he time travels, so he pretends to be a squib.

Linkao3(Dimension Hoppers) A good work based in C'est La Vie, alone is a simple work, but if you're a fan of C'est la vie is pretty good
