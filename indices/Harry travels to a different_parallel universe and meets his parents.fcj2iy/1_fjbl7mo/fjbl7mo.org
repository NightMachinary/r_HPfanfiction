There is a fanfic called Paralells - it is an OP harry fanfiction where Lily is alive (have no idea how to link). Think Stepping back and Delenda Est also feature alive Potters, but that might not count since it is time travel (In Stepping back he is friends with them, and in Delenda Est they are also featured quite a bit, not the major focus of either story tho)
