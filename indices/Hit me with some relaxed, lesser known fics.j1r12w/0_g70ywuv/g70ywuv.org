linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pranking of the Multiverse) - I recently read this and it's absolutely hilarious. And I'd recommend the writer's other fics too; you probably already know Albus and Harry's World Trip.

linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) - I know the writer is very well-known but I don't see this particular fic recced that often.

linkffn(Force Interrupt) - a oneshot collection with some really interesting ideas. The writer also has a lot of funny and/or thought-provoking short standalones that I would recommend.
