Azkaban seems like a horrible place and I could see Bella doing anything to get out. Voldemort broke her out which undoubtedly reinforced her loyalty, but I can see it working against him if someone else frees her.

And Bellatrix would still get to torture people, burn down houses and stuff like that, only with a little less madness and the racist motivation replaced by buisness. She wouldn't suddenly become an angel overnight. And I don't see Sirius as a suitable right hand of the Donna.
