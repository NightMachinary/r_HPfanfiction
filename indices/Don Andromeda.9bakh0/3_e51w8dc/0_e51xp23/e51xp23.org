How about:

- Voldemort was a criminal mastermind who threatened to take over the world, Dumbledore founds the Order of Phoenix in response because the government is failing.

- The Blacks are one of the associates of Voldemort and when he fails to kill Harry, his network disintegrates.

- Andromeda, the "black sheep" of her family, senses an opportunity to prove her mother wrong and begins to fill the power vacuum with her own Syndicate while Lucius scrambles to take over Voldemort's realm.

- Andromeda looks into Harry's situation and finds out that Lily has merely faked her own death due to the Prophecy and her desire to protect Harry. James duelled Voldemort while she struck him down from behind as her husband was mortally hit. Lily decides to stay in the shadows but becomes a family friend

- Voldemort returns and takes back his old network from his "faithful servant" Lucius, a lot of businesses in Andromeda's syndicate return to their old allegiances and she has to work hard to prevent a total collapse. Due to the threat of Voldemort, Lily starts to work with Andromeda under an Italian cover name (like Il Rossa)

- While the turf war between Andromeda and Voldemort escalates, Dumbledore reforms the Order. Tonks is in as spy for her mother

- Voldemort breaks his followers out of Azkaban but Bella runs to her sister for protection. Once she realises what her sister actually does for a living, she sees the perfect chance to get back at her "loving husband" and the man who played her like a fiddle (Voldemort used her crush to turn her into a dangerous tool and then gave her to Lestrange)

- Bellatrix had a daughter at the end of the war who disappeared from the face of the earth after an Order raid (hence her hate for the Longbottoms) and they search for her. After lots of "interrogations" and "conversations, they find out that it's none other than a Gryffindor Muggleborn orphan by the name of Demelza Robins, Harry's girlfriend.
