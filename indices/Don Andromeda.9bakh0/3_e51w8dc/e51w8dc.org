Interesting idea, got me thinking. How about something similar?

- Big AU. The first war wasn't a war. Voldemort was a mafia boss who was slowly taking over the wizarding world. Dumbledore saw that the authors couldn't handle it so he starts the order of the Phoenix
- Blood status isn't about who the better wizards are but is just a twisted mafia nationalism.
- The Blacks are a mafia family and don't actually support Voldemort. Bellatrix betrayed them to join the death eaters. Narcissa was actually forbidden from marrying Lucius but ended up running off with him (nice subversion of the marriage contract trope imo)
- Sirius likes his family's mafia style, but doesn't like the only purebloods part. He makes friends with the other marauders (all of a sudden Marauders makes sense as a nickname!). They are a group of cocky teenage boys with mafia connections. They start doing their own jobs on the side and start making some money.
- James and Remus join up with Dumbledore to avoid suspicion and hurt the other mafia families. Sirius and Peter join the death eaters to sabotage them from the inside.
- The Potters are very anti-crime and would be appalled at James. He hides it extremely well.
- Lily knows all about (or maybe suspects but has no proof? No-one believes her?) the Marauders activities and thinks they're scum. She joins the order for it's real purpose and spends all her time focusing on the Marauders and Snape, trying to catch them all.
- I don't know how we get from the above to this but eventually Voldemort finds out about who the Marauders actually are (maybe Peter flips) and goes after their leader, James and his family. Close to canon murder at Godric's hollow.
- With Voldemort gone the mafia has to go back into the shadows. The Marauders aren't competition anymore since 1 is dead, another in prison and a third assumed dead. Malfoy leads the mafia business and gets involved in government.
