I personally don't mind Charlus as Harry's grandfather even though it's not canonically correct. It just helps if you're doing a fic where Harry is the heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black and he needs a legitimate claim via blood relation. It's also because I find the names "Euphemia" and "Fleamont" stupid.
