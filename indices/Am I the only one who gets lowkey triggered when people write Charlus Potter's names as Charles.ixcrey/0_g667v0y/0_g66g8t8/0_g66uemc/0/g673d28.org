How so? Going by cannon only the extreme pureblood families do this. According to pottermore the potters are mainly descended from potters and peverells married into the family. And harry is basically the middle English form of Henry anyways, so there is no point in making it a short form of anything. And going by Hp fandom wiki, Harry is named after his great grand father, Henry potter irrc. And the potters were never a noble or titled family.

Besides in these Harry comes across as a bit of snob. Tbh my head cannon is that Harry grew in such away that he did not want to act in any way like dursleys, hence why he is so uncomfortable talking about any thing that goes down except for his friends, not taking the trauma associated with it. So I think in the whole inheritance trope he would feel really uncomfortable and not really tell anyone nevertheless changing his name to something like Harry James Potter-Black-Peverell-Griffindor.

And even that's unrealistic, as going by the rites of succession as Iolanthe Peverell married into the potter family so she had no right to gain any inheritance from her family except for her dowry (this was in like 1200 ad or something) including the name. Peverell family had no male heirs from Ignotius Peverell's line and Cadmus Peverell's line ended with the gaunt family which I assume was married into as well as they would have kept the Peverell name given how big bunch of bigot and snobs they were. It just turns me away from the fic if they do this sort of thing. Seems like a cheat code to get resources and a cheap way to start bashing characters.

TL;DR : Harry is already a pure blood name and the whole multiple inheritance thing is unrealistic.
