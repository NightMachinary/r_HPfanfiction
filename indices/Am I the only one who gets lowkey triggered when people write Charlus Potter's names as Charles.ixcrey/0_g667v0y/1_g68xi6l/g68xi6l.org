Such as Harrison or Hadrian? I don't mind in certain instances. Like, if you're going full pureblood politics in which you announce Name, Heir to House Surname, then I don't mind all too much. Because "Harrison, Heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter" sounds a little better than "Harry, Heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter." Just not Hadrian for Harry, though. I'll only accept that if it's Hadrian Peverell for a time travel/cross dimension fic. Harrison I don't mind all too much since Harry is a shortening of it and you could spin it so no one actually knew Harry's first name was actually Harrison. I read a fic where it did that and Harry's name was actually Harrison James Evans-Potter and Dumbledore only heard them refer to him as Harry James and he needed to put his name down. The fic was linkao3(Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet) if you wanted to check it out. I might be wrong on the name aspect but I think I got it correct.
