I recently had a similar problem with a character's nickname. It was a Slytherin! Harry fanfic where, during the first night, Blaise and Draco were talking to a "Teddy". I was really confused at first and thought of a OC until the character introduced himself as "Teddy Nott".

Also, while it's still a bit annoying, I am a lot less triggered by people who just forgot to translate a name from their mother's tongue compared to people who just write a name wrong (like in French, Draco is Drago, Blaise is Blaize and Kreacher is Kreature . . .).
