Without being a matter of preference,I'm not even sure you can actually do that. I know that English has some stranges rules when it comes to shortening names (William turns into Bill, Edward into Ted or Teddy . . .), but these rules exist and I never heard of Theodore being turned into anything else than Theo.

So, I may be wrong, but I think you can't shorten a Theodore into Teddy the same way you can't shorten Ronald into Bob.
