Throwing Away a Hero by GredandForgeRock linkffn(8608572)

When Voldie possesses Harry in the atrium, Harry's remorse at falling into the trap and causing Sirius's death is sufficient to trigger the clause for reabsorbing a horcrux. The other pieces return to him as beams of light, which are later traced to find and confirm the objects were but no longer are horcruxes.

Voldie is ejected from Harry but the shock is enough to kill him. Dumbledore then tries to claim the credit, citing an unspecified spell he'd allegedly created which drew Voldie out of Harry and caused the seizure/death.
