None that I'd take seriously that I've read. I've read one that was a crack fic that had him thinking, /I really shouldn't have made horcruxes/, and poof, no more horcruxes.

The other one I read seems to be super divisive due to all the bashing, and doesn't really involve him piecing his soul back together out of regret initially.
