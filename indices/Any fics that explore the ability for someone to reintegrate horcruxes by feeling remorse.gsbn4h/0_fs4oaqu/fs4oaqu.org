'Seven Devils' is a self-insert where the SI's plan for dealing with voldermort is to help tom (the soul fragment in the diary) repent and reintegrate all the other pieces of his soul.

tom is chosen because he's the largest soul piece (the story subscribes to the theory that horcruxes split the soul in half) and as the youngest and least mutilated version of voldermort's soul, he's the most capable of being able to repent and feel remorse for what he's done.
