I like the idea that transfiguration and conjuration doesn't actually change the fundamental nature of what it's changing, it just applies a magical mask (kinda like polyjuice or animagus. Regardless of what you look like, you're still you). So you couldn't make something radioactive that wasn't radioactive before, nor could you make antimatter unless you started with antimatter. Even chemical reactions using transfigured materials are just an extension of the mask with the energy coming from magic rather than breaking chemical bonds.

And that's what makes the philosophers stone so astounding - it actually does facilitate fundamental changes.

My half-assed idea is why curse damage is so hard to heal, it damages at a more fundamental level than most magic, making it difficult to heal since healing magics are about bringing the fundamental self back to the surface.
