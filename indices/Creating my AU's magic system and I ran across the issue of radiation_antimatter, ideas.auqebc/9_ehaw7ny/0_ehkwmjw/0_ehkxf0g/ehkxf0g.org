Barely fleshed out beyond "that would be neat"

Examples include It's Magic, It's Magic, and also It's Magic.

But really it's just curse damage is hard to heal, but why? Magical diseases exist but they can regrow bones overnight and reattach limbs like it's nothing, but why?

The limb thing could be specifically related to splinching, but even so.

I mostly like the idea because it gives a reasonable high level explanation that isn't really contradicted by the books and helps an author come up with magical interactions that are consistent.

Plus it would make sense that magic is more philosophical than naturalistic, so the idea of a "platonic object" as part of the very being of a physical object that is difficult, but not impossible, to magically manipulate is poetic to me.

It also helps explain why Remus, or any wizard, for that matter, has threadbare or tattered belongings. The platonic self has degraded and magic can only patch it up for so long and it's relatively easy to cause the platonic object to reassert itself in reality, possibly easy enough that merely being in a magic-rich environment causes it to happen spontaneously. So using charms to make knitting needles autonomously knit a sweater? Making a new platonic self. But using transfiguration to turn a pile of yarn into a sweater? I hope you like waking up to a pile of yard in your closet, because it /will/ happen, eventually.
