Bringing in the concept of magic working on a more philosophical instead of naturalistic level makes a /ton/ of sense, actually. In fact, if played just right, that could be used to explain a lot of 'rules' in-universe in non-nonsensical fashion. If I develop the wizarding philosophical schools of thought, I can use them to constrain and empower all kinds of things. Thanks for that brainstorm!
