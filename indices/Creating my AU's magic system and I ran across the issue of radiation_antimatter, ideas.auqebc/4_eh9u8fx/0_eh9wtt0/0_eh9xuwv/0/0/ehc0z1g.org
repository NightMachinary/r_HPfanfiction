  Isn't the bat-bogey hex basically transfiguring one's boogers into bats?

Pretty sure it's a Charm: the bats are still made out of snot, just made to behave like a bat. And secreted waste might not count as "part of the body".

  Moody transfigured Draco into a ferret. It doesn't seem entirely out of reach.

There, I'd say, first, Barty Crouch Jr. is a magical genius (as is Moody whom he's impersonating), not a random wizard. Second, I feel like transfiguring something you can't see (such as someone's bones alone) should be significantly harder than transfiguring a person in front of whom you're standing, and that transfiguring whole things is easier than transfiguring part of a thing.
