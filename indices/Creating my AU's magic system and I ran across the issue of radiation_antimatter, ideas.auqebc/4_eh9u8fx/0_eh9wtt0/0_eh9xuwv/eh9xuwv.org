  Though, did you mean SCP-682?

I did. No idea why I keep getting that poor thing (?)'s number wrong, but I have various named it as SCP-687, SCP-671 and SCP-645 over the last year, and I have no idea why.

...Someone should write a SCP about a SCP-creature whose number keeps changing.

Anyway, "transfiguring one's bones to Co-60" feels to me like it should be impossible to all but Merlin, or maybe Dumbledore on a /really/ good day. Transfiguring yourself is hard enough, but finely transfiguring the innards of your /enemy/ in the middle of a duel? /Please/.
