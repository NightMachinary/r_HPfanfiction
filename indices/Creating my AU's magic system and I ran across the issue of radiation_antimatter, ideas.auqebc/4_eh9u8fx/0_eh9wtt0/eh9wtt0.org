Hmm, that is a tempting perspective. (Though, did you mean SCP-682?) My wizards are reasonably impervious mostly due to magic symbiosis and personal wards, but handling larger attacks would drain them. Mundane assaults like bullets and hand grenades that aren't magically enhanced are orders of magnitude easier, but still dangerous on warhead-scales. Also, transfiguring one's bones to Co-60, even for a fraction of a second, would induce instant coma and certain death within minutes from my research. Even wizards would be hard pressed to manage that.

The villain in question is anarchist and wants to destroy the Statute, so blowing up cities is within character.
