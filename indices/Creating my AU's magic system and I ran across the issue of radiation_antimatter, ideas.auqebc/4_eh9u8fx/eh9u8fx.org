I think you're fine with it being possible.

It's already debatable in the canonical /HP/ universe, but frankly, I think the ability to Transfigure radioactive material or antimatter isn't really anything like "OP" if your story is a crossover with freaking /SCP and the Cthulhu Mythos all at once/. There are much,* much* more powerful things out there than fancy explosives. And that's really what both boil down to in a HP context: wizards (and SCP-613, and Cthulhu) can just shrug off radiation sickness, only the blast is of any use to them.

Even the use of a non-magical blast is extremely debatable. There are some understandings of how magic works in /HP/ that argue that you /can't/ penetrate a magical Shield with /anything/ Muggle, whether it's a thrown pebble or a supernova: brute strength simply will not do, you have to use a curse that actively tries to subvert and weaken the Shield. If you accept this, if you accept that a well-timed Shield Charm similar to what they used on Hogwarts in /DH/ could shrug off a nuclear blast or antimatter blast, it is no longer quite so brokenly OP at all.

And that's without going into the fact that explosives are a lousy tool for wizards, being hard to aim and cover up. The canonical Lord Voldemort really doesn't want to bring down the Statute of Secrecy, or at least, not before he's already in control of the entire worldwide Wizarding World. If yours is the same on this issue, he'll stay away from anything that might accidentally blow a Muggle city off the map, methinks. Especially with equally-destructive, but much more finely-controlled options at his disposal, like /Fiendfyre/.
