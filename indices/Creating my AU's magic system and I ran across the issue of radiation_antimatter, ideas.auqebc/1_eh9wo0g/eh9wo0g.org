I have this notion that spells are enacted by free-roaming spirits, so unless the spirit trying to implement the spell was the ghost of an advanced physicist, it'd be like asking an Aztec priest to build a Ferrari engine, which he can do if he would just patiently listen for the next three months. Duplicating something that exists is much easier.

Your concept may be fundamentally the opposite, so take from that what you will.

EDIT for radioactivity: duplicating things that are common is much easier than duplicating things that are rare, which may explain why precious metals tend to come out 'fragile' and are prone to dissolving like Leprechaun gold.
