Here is a thought experiment:

Given how close Muggles were at destroying each other during the Cold War, why wouldn't Voldemort pull a Skynet and make Muggles finish each other off? He had experienced Muggle destructive powers first hand, and he definitely should know nuclear weapons.

If he really wanted to imperius the American President and order him to fire all US nukes against their targets, I doubt those MACUSA could stop him. Then the Soviet counterattack would destroy the West, and the nuclear winter would wipe out 90% of Muggles within a few months. The whole world would be ready for his magical utopia. He and his minions could of course build well protected and self sufficient Wizarding enclaves deep underground, ride out the mayhem, and emerge as the total winner. If a single shield charm was able to protect them against nuclear blasts, like some wizard worshippers here postulate, then he would have even more incentives to induce such a scenario.

So, why didn't Voldemort do that? My thesis is that radiations are like the darkest form of magic and harm Magicals far more than Muggles. He had checked out Hiroshima and Nagasaki as soon as he heard the news. When he got there after a few days, he discovered that while 100000 out of 350000 Muggles had died at Hiroshima and 60000 out of 260000 Muggles had died at Nagasaki, the three Wizarding enclaves in the two cities had been completely killed off. Japanese Ministry of Magic was in utter panic, and decided to intervene in persuading the Emperor to surrender.

Later during the 1950s, Muggle powers conducted over 500 atmospheric nuclear tests, resulting in unprecedented level of radioactive fallout in human history. Coincidentally, squib births skyrocketed, and led to great panic and increased hostility against Muggleborns, whose numbers had actually grown because rapidly increasing Muggle population. These Muggleborns, many of them strongly influenced by equal rights thinking in the Muggle world, would no longer subject themselves to Pureblood dominance. In 1962, a Muggleborn named Nobby Leach was even elected to the British Minister of Magic. Voldemort, who originally wanted to wait out Dumbledore, decided that he could no longer put things off.
