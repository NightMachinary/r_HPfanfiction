Yeah, there is some research into underlying principles, but it's not really to 'discover' new spells directly. My magic is derived from the ghost-blood of ancient outer gods still pouring from their deathlessly sleeping corpses, spawning half-sentient entities (magical cores) in the blood of the descendants of ancient Atlantis (wizards). In SCP-terms, wizards are type black reality benders, with no practical limits to their abilities. The problem is that magic in this form is very hard to tame to one's will, and so basically you do the hard work once, tie it to a ritual, then link a verbal command and gesture to that ritual so that the magic will remember it and perform it on command later on. A wand acts like a passkey giving one access to the repository of spells created by generations of wizards, remembered by the sleeping super-intelligence of Magic. The problem was that too much power resulted in provoking war with the Outer Gods and creating aforesaid corpses along with the annihilation of Atlantis and Lemuria and nearly obliterating the entirety of time, space, and magic omni-dimensionally. Oops. So a ritual was formed to put restrictions on magic, Laws that prevent or hinder such things from happening again.

Does that help a bit? I'd love questions and feedback on this, so I can flesh it out more and fill in holes. :D
