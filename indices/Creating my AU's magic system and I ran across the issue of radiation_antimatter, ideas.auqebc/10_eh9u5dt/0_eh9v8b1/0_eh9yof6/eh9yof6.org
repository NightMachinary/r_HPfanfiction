Easiest way would be to up the ante: requires too much knowledge or power to pull off. Or is indeed in some way limited as they nullify magic or there is a law against it (law of magic style) that makes impossible.

Also you could argue that you would need a phd in like transfigurations and radiation physics to pull it off, at which point I am pretty sure said person would also realize it is a terrible idea to mess with it. Wizards could murder the planet in a multitude of other ways every single day. They don't, heck even voldemort doesn't, cause ya got to have a planet in order to rule it.
