As the guy that recommended it, it's just horrible.

They aren't cliches I have seen yet, but they are the worst ones I have come across. There are bashing where there need not be; the main characters show wit and wisdom far beyond (even my) their ages; the characterisations are bad -- really bad; the plot points are more or less taken from canon; kids the age of 12 or 13 sit on the Wizengamot and are /fluent/ in politics.

What!? Just... The last point alone was enough for me to stop reading the book. It sits unread on my Google Play Books app and I might delete it soon...
