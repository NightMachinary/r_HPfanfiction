I didn't mean from 100% to 75%, sorry, poor word choice. Let's just say 45%, including some of the duds like Polk and Buchanan.

I wasn't trying to be passive aggressive, I'm so sorry I came off that way. I was just angry at myself for coming up with an idea without realizing how stupid it was, and for liking the idea as it was and not registering the flaws. I didn't mean to be a bitch, I'm sorry!
