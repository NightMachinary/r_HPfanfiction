It's not stupidity as an idea in progress. You need /something/ to explain why so many presidents were wizards. (Switching from "all of them" to "a lot of them" doesn't change that.) It could be a sustained conspiracy of wizards -- but then we would expect relative consistency in policy. It could be several different conspiracies of wizards. Perhaps there is a magical ability that's more or less hypnosis, swaying people to support you if they just hear you speak -- so mages have a huge advantage in politics. Maybe there's a strong educational advantage.

It /is/ unrealistic if it's unexplained. If you explain it, you'll likely come up with elements that allow for more conflicts and more interesting conflict in your story.

A passive aggressive "fuck you" when someone points out a place where your story needs work won't improve your work or endear people to you.
