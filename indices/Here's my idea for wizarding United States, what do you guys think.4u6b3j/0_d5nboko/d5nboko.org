As always when you're talking about the Americas in this timeperiod: what happened to the mages among the 50-odd million people living there before colonization? I mean, sure, it might have been down to like five or ten million at that point with disease and genocide, but when the US gained independence, it had a population under three million.

How?

A political party that doesn't know about mages wouldn't opt to elect only mages. That couldn't be part of their selection criteria.

Presidential candidates are chosen from among people who have distinguished themselves to the public, typically through political service. Are mages using magic with wild abandon to rise through the ranks? Perhaps they're Confunding party leadership? If so, we would expect people to rise based on their ability to use mind-altering charms only, and not their ability to perform well in political office. In short, a strong tendency for incompetent presidents.

If it's party leadership legitimately believing that the nation is better off with a wizard at the helm -- why?

Or is it more of an old boy's club, how is it so reliable as to have a run of 28 presidents in a row?

Three or even five would make sense. You make your opportunities with magic and make the most of them with your own abilities.
