Y'know, I'm not big into politics at all. However, this is something I'd read. I like how you've put in the distinct differences in American vs English culture. In England, there's a great deal of attention and fawning paid to the aristocracy and the royal family. In the USA, it's not so much about your blood, but your wealth and upbringing. Also, I think it would be interesting to see if there's an interplay between the magics used by the European invaders, the Native Americans, and the Africans who were forcibly brought in. All three cultures would have differing attitudes and abilities when it came to magic, and all three would sort of give tension to the different wizarding societies.

Again, it would be back to the race vs caste issue that you have in the USA vs England. In the USA, racist ideals have been an integral part of how the country was formed. In England, one's birth lineage is intimately woven into the fabric of the country's culture. Both have their good and shitty parts, but both also have their own versions of those tensions between differing viewpoints.

This can be a highly interesting series to read, and I sincerely hope that you write it!
