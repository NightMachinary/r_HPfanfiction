opopanax has written some Stephen King crossovers/adaptations, although they haven't attempted anything involving "IT" yet. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10384704/1/Black-Serendipity][Black Serendipity]] is an adaptation of "Apt Pupil", and the latest oneshot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6641527/21/In-the-Realms-of-the-Opopanax][this collection]] features elements of "Pet Sematary".

Other than that, this fic from two weeks ago is the only crossover I've been able to find, although given the movie's popularity, I expect the floodgates will open to more crossovers soon:
