I'm throwing out several fics, in the hopes that at least one will catch your fancy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle][Puzzle]] linkffn(6622580) - has a neat premise I don't think I've seen anywhere else

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10529982][The Mystery Under the Trapdoor]] linkao3(10529982) - Hermione is the Girl Who Lived

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] linkffn(1260679) - both old and unfinished, but still worth a read imo

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] linkao3(6701647) - action/adventure with some angst, set when the Trio are in their 60s

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3721921][Weasley Girl]] linkao3(3721921) - canon rehash from the POV of fem!Ron
