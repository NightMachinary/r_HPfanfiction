yeah but theres this one harry/daphne story that's pretty up there in reviews/favorites/follows - but the fucker is named hadrian. I mean, there has to be something alright about it if so many people like it. Or maybe, everyone thats not retarded noped out the moment they saw hadrian, so the only people left to favorite/leave good reviews are the people that'll read anything
