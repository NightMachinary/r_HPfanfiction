Just because there is a Hadrian's wall doesn't make Hadrian make sense. Harry is not a short form of Hadrian. Hadrian isn't even a posh name, the two Hadrian's I've known were both from mining families. Harry is however a short form of Harold and Henry which do make sense but I still don't like them.
