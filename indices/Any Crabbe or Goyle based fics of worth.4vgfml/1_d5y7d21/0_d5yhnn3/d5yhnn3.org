Is it available somewhere else? I don't want to create an account on some random website I've never heard of just to read this. Looks like they require email verification...just to read a fic? So creating a throw-away account would even be a pain.

Edit: Oh...I can download it without an account. But not read it without an account. Uh, what? I'd think they'd do it exactly the other way around! Oh well. it works for me, even if it feels confusing and nonsensical.
