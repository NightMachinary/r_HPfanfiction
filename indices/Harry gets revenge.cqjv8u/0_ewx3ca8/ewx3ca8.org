Harry is the descendant of a Witchfinder General takes up the cause for Death Eaters. He tortures and kills several purebloods and is supported in his efforts by a gaggle of girls who have also been wronged. It seems to descend into literal insanity and that takes a lot away from the story, in my opinion. Incomplete.
