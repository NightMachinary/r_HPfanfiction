Are you only looking for a fic where everyone is portrayed as the best version of themselves, or are you also interested in fics where an oft-bashed character is treated sympathetically? If it's the former I've got nothing; indeed, I'm not sure something like that even exists - how would you sustain any kind of plot or conflict? But if it's the latter, I have a few suggestions (all oneshots):
