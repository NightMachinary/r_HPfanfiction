the pureblood pretense? it's a crossover w/the Alanna The Lioness series from tamora pierce, and it doesn't have vernon (because lily and james are still alive) and i mean the premise of it changes a lot of things but voldemort in this isn't a murderous egomaniac, he's a politician? figured you might like that [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

another might be “Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin” voldemort is a murderous egomaniac in this one, but for a pretty interesting reason imo it takes a lot of tropes and twists them to be more interesting and/or more logical (like vernon sucks, but there's a reason for it! amazing) although i guess you asked for the anti-bashing fic, and this one has a little bit of james-bashing? it's not over the top or anything, but still slightly there [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15828654/chapters/36853599]]
