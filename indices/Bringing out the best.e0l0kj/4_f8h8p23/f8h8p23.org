If I remember it correctly, (it's been a /while/ since I read it) in whydoyouneedtoknow's dangerverse series, all the characters are treated as 3 dimensional beings, both good and bad. Their motivations also feel very in line with canon, and those that are different have good reason to be. It doesn't try to redeem or turn all the bad guys into good guys, but none of them are portrayed as "death death kill kill I only have one emotion," and for the ones it does redeem it makes sense in context.

There is also a number of 'spin off' stories written by the same author, that are in effect alternate universes of her original alternate universe, that all link back or give clues to the final outcome of her original universe. I know at least one of those has an interesting take on Riddle, where he was never a death eater, and is more or less a "good guy", but the main character (Draco from 6th/7th year) is from Canon and knows him as Voldemort.

The first installment or so are a bit rocky because it was the authors first time writing a full fic, but each one is better than the last. (Plus, they contain a veritable /wealth/ of oc's that are more fleshed out than your average main character oc, and have their own individual running storylines.)
