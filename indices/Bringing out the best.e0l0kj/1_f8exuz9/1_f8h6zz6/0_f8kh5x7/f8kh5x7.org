I just have a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of Voldemort as a political activist... his desire to rid the world of muggles and muggleborns (hello - genocide) is a minor goal compared to his desire to prevent his eventual death. And in reality, the way he is written originally, he is so completely narcissistic that he isn't working toward making a better world for a select group of people (ie political activism) - he'd as soon off his own people as anyone else. He's really just in it for himself. He shows more affection for Nagini than for any human being.

I understand wanting to avoid fics that include bashing... it is as brutal as it sounds. The act of bashing robs the characters of their complexity. It is as dehumanizing as Mary Sues and Gary Stus.
