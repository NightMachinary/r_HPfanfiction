There are good ways to write Voldemort while maintaining his evilness.

I would classify fics where Voldemort is an idiot, easy-to-overcome over-monologuing villain as "bashing."

One where Voldemort is a political activist doesn't have to mean he's not evil, just that he goes about his evilness is an intelligent way.
