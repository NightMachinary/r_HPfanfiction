I've seen fics where Tom Riddle hasn't done the terrible things that he does in canon - in essence, he doesn't do the heinous deeds he does in canon to become Voldemort... fics where there are interventions that prevent the terrible outcome that form the entire premise of the Harry Potter series. Is that what you're looking for?
