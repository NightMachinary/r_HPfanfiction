A Long Journey Home fits your requirements:

- Best, most well written - It's sadly incomplete but the prose is of a very high quality
- At least 100k words - It's 203k words of bliss
- Harry centric - The Harry equivalent is definitely the main character who gets the most screentime, though other figures, both canonical & OC, are definitely present.
- Pairings (no slash) - The most prominent by far pairing (4 chapters of narrative) is het, though there are brief mentions of slash relationships in the past
