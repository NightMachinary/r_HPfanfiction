I saved this post with the intention of returning and posting my favorites and five months later remembered. I hope that you are still interested in building up your library! Most of the ones I read are slash as most of the fics written in this fandom are slash, but they are all clearly marked.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816][Away Childish Things]] is a Drarry fic. I saw it recommended here so frequently I finally read the damn thing and wish I had done so earlier. It is so touching and deals with going through trauma and isolation beautifully. (153,881 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911][Blood Magic]] is an old classic in the fandom. It was originally written pre-HBP, so there are no Horcruxes. It's a response to the Severitus challenge. I've returned to it again and again over the past decade and still love it. (334,522 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]] is another Drarry fic. Draco and Harry are professors at Hogwarts. Harry is popular and beloved. Draco is a recluse who lives in the dungeon. After a petty prank has consequences, Draco is forced to actually interact with the world. (114,741 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn]] is an extremely popular Drarry fic while also being a bit canon-compliant. Harry does a good deed and helps an old man and, as a "reward" gets a glimpse into another life he could have led. (306,708 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Boy with a Scar]] is a series of one-shots answering different "what-if's". For example, what if Dudley had been a wizard? what if Harry was a girl? what if Petunia actually properly took in Harry and saw him as her nephew instead of a burden? I love this series because each one oozes empathy. Just noticed that it was recommended by another person in this thread. (208,651 words; not technically complete but each stands alone)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][Blood Crest]] is a WIP. It is still regularly updated. In this, 9 year old Harry accidentally gets himself apprenticed to a not-so-nice necromancer. No pairings yet as Harry is still young (448,991 words and counting)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] was recommended by another so I won't belabor the point. Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. I really don't care for Ginny (just don't find her interesting), but this author writes her very well. True to character and compelling; one of my top three in the fandom. (182,592 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] is technically a series. This is another that oozes empathy. Harry and Ginny accompany McGonagall to bring Dudley's daughter his letter introducing him to the wizarding world. It is canon compliant. (140,315 words; complete)
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem with Potions]], Harry is fascinated with potions and perseveres in studying it, despite his terrible teacher and lack of talent. I don't remember the pairing in this one. (222,341 words; complete).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][Animagus-Verse]] is another WIP. You know how kids can apparate when they perform accidental magic? This one has Harry as an accidental animagus. He runs away from the Dursleys and lives as a street cat for a little while until he gets picked up by another family. This fic is well-regarded for its world-building. This was updated just one month ago. (865,030 words and counting)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my all-time favorite fic in the fandom. It's Drarry. Lupin steals Harry away from canon-level abuse with the help of Snape. I don't want to say too much more, but just know that it is written with love and care. It's absolutely gorgeous (373,077 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is truly one of the most unique fics I have ever read. It deals with what it means to be human, artificial intelligence, and the Absurdist philosophy. This was also updated just a month ago (425,194 words and counting)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]] is the first part of a series. Harry strikes a deal with the scarcrux. "Marvolo" gives him information and Harry reads books and performs rituals for him. The first part is 67,782 words, but the second part is 39,487 words and counting. It was updated two days ago.
- I don't remember the pairings in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12578866/1/Modern-Romance][Modern Romance]]. It has an unusual framing device. The concept is that each chapter is another entry in Witch Weekly. Each author anonymously submits tales from their love lives using code names for the people involved. There are overarching narratives. It's fun to try to parse out who is who. (293,493 words; complete)
- Harry Potter takes the "Boy Who Lived" title a bit seriously in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]]; he just. won't. die. Every time he does, he comes back in pain and back in the past. He gets smarter but faces down a more cunning enemy. (242,571 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is recommended frequently enough that I feel the need to include it here. I thought it was... fine. The trio are morally grey and you know they are because they tell us many times. I think it's better to show not tell, but this fic has a lot of fans. (143,267 words, complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit][Resurrexit]] is a murder mystery. Harry's wife dies under mysterious circumstances and he will do anything to find the perpetrator. (74,756 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] is the most polarizing fic I have seen on this fandom. People get lowkey flamed for recommending it. I love it and it's extremely popular, but the people who dislike it hate it (I suspect in part because it's recommended so frequently). If you don't like it by chapter 10, give it a miss. (661,619 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is the only crackfic I really and truly like. There is no Harry, only Scarcrux. Tom is just trying to live his best life (or, Harry's best life) in disguise as Harry going through Hogwarts. What could go wrong? Really and truly funny. Balances humor and plot well (104,212 words; complete)
- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]], Snape discovers canon-level abuse at the Dursleys when Harry gets his letter (he is intrigued by the letter being addressed to "the cupboard under the stairs"). I like this one because the fundamental characteristics of the characters aren't changed; they're just put into extremely different circumstances. (213,669 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] is another famous comedy. Harry goes through the veil and finds himself in an AU where he and Sirius died in the 1981 Godric's Hollow attack. They set out to live their best lives. (246,320 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] is another mystery. This one was the first Haphne I ever read so I thought her characterization was novel; I am prepared to admit that I was wrong. That said, it's still well-written and engaging. (99,099 words; complete)
