  Harry left Ginny to keep her safe, but Hogwarts during Voldemort's reign was anything but. Although they both survived, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance.... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night. Will they ever be whole again?The first of three fics covering the first year after the war; this one focuses on Harry and Ginny's summer as well as the Weasleys' recovery as seen through the eyes of Bill and Charlie.
