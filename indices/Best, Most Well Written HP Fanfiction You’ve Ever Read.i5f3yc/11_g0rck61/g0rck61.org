Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest Chance is set in the summer after the fall of Voldemort; completely canon and deals with Harry and Ginny overcoming trauma from the war, dealing with their relationship, and the entire Weasley family coming to terms with Fred's death.

At times hilarious, at times tragic, at times romantic, and times profound, this fic has completely believable and canon characters and is good enough to feel like a continuation of the books. Highly recommend.
