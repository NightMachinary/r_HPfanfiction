Ii'm still very find of jbern's 'the lie I've lived' and 'bungle in the jungle. Very well written. Disobediencewriter wrote two of my all time favorites: 'valley of the king's massacre'' and 'the house of Potter rebuilt'. 'Jamie Evans and fate's fools by the mad mad reviewer. 'The merging' unfinished, but here's hoping, by shaydrall.
