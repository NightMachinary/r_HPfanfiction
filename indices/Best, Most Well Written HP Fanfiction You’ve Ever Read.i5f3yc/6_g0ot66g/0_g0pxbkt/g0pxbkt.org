One thing I love about /Albus and Harry's World Trip/ is the way it subverts a /lot/ of fandom tropes. It's also a lot of fun to see an Albus as a sort of trickster mentor, manipulating Harry for his own good, rather than some nebulous greater good(Basically tricking Harry into doing impossible things by magic, by simply not telling him it's impossible).
