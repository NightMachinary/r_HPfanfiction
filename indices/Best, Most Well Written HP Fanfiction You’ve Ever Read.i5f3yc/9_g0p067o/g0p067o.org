Taking "Harry Centric" as Harry is a main character, not necessarily the main character.

And for what you didn't ask for:

- Best Non-Harry Centric: The Red Knight (WARNING: 200K words, incomplete) linkffn(12141684) - Harry is a plot device basically, kindof an antagonist. Certainly not the focus.

  - Runner Up Screwing with Timeline: A Little Child Shall Lead Them linkffn(10871795) - Harry is a love interest who doesn't show till the last two chapters. Has the best closing line of a fic though ;).
