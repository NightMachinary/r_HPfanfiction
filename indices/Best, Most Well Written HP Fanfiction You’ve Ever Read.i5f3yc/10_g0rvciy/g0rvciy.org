Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave. Seven books of pure mind-blowing, heart-wrenching, tragedy but also glimmer hope and well, it's just unbelievable. It's hard to believe that it was just a /fan fiction/. Like it should been nominated for awards. I call it the Harry Potter series for adults in my head, haha.
