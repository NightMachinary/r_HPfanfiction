This is a controversial one on here that people seem to either absolutely love or absolutely hate, but my personal favourite HP fic is linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin). The writing is brilliant. It does use a lot of tropes, but it subverts basically all of them in ways never seen before it.
