Linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin) in which the author turns all the fun tropes on their heads.

Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) a series of vignettes in which one thing is changed. My favorite is the kids who chose themselves, though that ones not harry centric.

Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) in which Voldemort won the first war and Harry becomes something of a protege, but not a dark harry fic like you'd expect. This ones a little dicier on the well written front, there are a lot of grammatical errors and homophone mix ups, but the writing in terms of plot and character is top notch.

Linkffn(the accidental animagus) in which Harry gets adopted by the grangers and can turn into a cat. Mostly love this one for the depth of the wizarding /world/ that they build in later books.
