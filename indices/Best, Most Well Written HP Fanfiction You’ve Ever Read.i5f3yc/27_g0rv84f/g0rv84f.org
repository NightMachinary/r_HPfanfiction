The most well-written and just generally my favourite fic of all time is Through The Fire by SongAngel on ao3. I have no idea how to get the bots to link the fics, sorry. It's absolutely incredible.

It is a work in progress, unfortunately, and we've been waiting a few months for the next chapter. I cannot recommend it highly enough :)
