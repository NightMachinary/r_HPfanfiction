Copy and paste. I have the flair for a reason.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.
