A couple notes: Grey Space is a fair bit shorter than you'd like, but you really oughta read it anyway. It's incredible.

The Changeling is Ginny centric, but top notch: put it on your list and get back to it one day.

Finally, I've included a few crossovers. Of Wizards and Heroes is slash, but it's more implied than demonstrated and it's quite possibly the best Avengers crossover that's also over 100k words. Say a Prayer is the start of a series, and it's rough until it gets going - the crackyness and over-the-top bashing fades away, but it remains a very fun read. Illusions of Grandeur more or less requires you to be knowledgeable of the original five season arc of Supernatural. The rest you can wing.
