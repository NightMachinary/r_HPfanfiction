In linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) there's a TON of pureblood traditions. It's pretty heavily AU though.

In linkffn(Divided and Entwined) there's a few scenes from Daphne's perspective, and she practices a lot of old traditions and complains that the Malfoys don't really understand tradition with their new "summer ball". The ball isn't exactly a great success, although less because it's wannabe tradition and more because almost everyone ends up dead after the muggleborns decide that they had enough.
