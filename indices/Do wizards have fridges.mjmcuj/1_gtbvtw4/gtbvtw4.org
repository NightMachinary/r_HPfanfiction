Obviously, they do not have electrical fridges lol.

However, historically, fridges evolved from large insulated boxes that were filled with ice, and those boxes evolved from deep holes in the ground that were filled with snow or ice. That works surprisingly well -- in moderate climates, you can easily keep the snow and ice of the winter past the summer. If you dig deep enough, 15 or so feet, the temperature is around 8Â°C year round. Snow and ice melts very slowly then.

So I suppose they could use that. Or ... they simply use magic to spell food not to spoil.
