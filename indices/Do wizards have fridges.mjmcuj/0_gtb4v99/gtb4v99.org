Ive read fics where they call it an icebox but to my understanding there's no ice or anything to make it cold, it's just preserves the food with a stasis charm.

But in most that make sense, and I think it's like this in canon too, they keep their food in a pantry and that also has stasis/preservation charms on it. If their pantries are charmed to keep everything in the right temp, I guess that means they can keep their milk and eggs and butter and stuff in there too and if they can do that then they'd never really need fridges.
