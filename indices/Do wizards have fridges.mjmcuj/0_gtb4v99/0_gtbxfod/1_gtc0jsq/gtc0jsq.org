I'd definitely believe that Hermine isn't up to date with household spells - why would she know them? She's 17, she doesn't seem to care that much about food, she has a lot of other things on her plate. She also grew up in a muggle house; her parents wouldn't have taught her, and at Hogwarts, the Burrow or Grimmauld Place those things are already cared for by others (so even if she's seen where the food is kept she wasn't the one to set them up)
