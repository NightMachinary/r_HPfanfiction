preservation charms is something that is often used in fanon. No need to slow down chemical reactions when you can stop them completely with magic.

I prefer to imagine that Wizarding cuisine is more 18th century in form. Lots of saltings and preserving in clarified butter, that sort of thing. What you're likely to see on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN9AnOxpA0U][Townsends]] for instance.

Maybe the existance of vanishing charms and magically aided cooking means that every meal is cooked from fresh ingrediants and the idea of storing stuff isn't really culturally engrained. After all, the market is only ever an apparation away.

Thanks for the interesting question.
