  Harry checked his watch for a third time. Pansy was actively tapping her foot, looking annoyed, and when she saw him do it, she downed the rest of her drink.“I'm calling it,” she said. “Either something came up at work or they're shagging in some utterly inappropriate place and forgot about dinner.”

  set five years after the end of the war following a line where harry and ginny don't get married and instead harry and pansy build a relationship. told in alternating perspectives from pansy and hermione.

  Hermione can't... she can't work out their relationship. They seem comfortable with each other, their elbows are touching and Harry's hand is on Pansy's knee, and there's something when they look at each other. No, she doesn't get it at all. When Harry stands to get the next round Pansy touches his arm and asks him to "get her a Gillywater, darling" and Harry nods, his hand brushing across the top of her head, the term of supposed endearment going unnoticed, as though it's used regularly. Hermione wonders what he calls her in return.
