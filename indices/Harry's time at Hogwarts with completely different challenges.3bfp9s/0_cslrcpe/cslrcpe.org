linkffn(The Temporal Beacon)

It's a time travel fic that involves multiple trips through time in what is without a doubt the most original and well done time travel story i've ever read. The original tasks are different from Canon and change each trip. (Just realised that you didn't just refer to the TWT but i'm leaving this cause it's awesome).

linkffn(Death Before Dishonour by SuperNova26). Harry in Slytherin, only 30,000 words and starts in 6th year but involves Harry running an underground trading ring,

linkffn(The Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)

*If you only read one of these read this.* Slytherin has taken over and is immortal and it involves a warped canon with castes instead of houses, the caste mascot is tattooed on your arm like a dark mark, seriously this is stupidly good.
