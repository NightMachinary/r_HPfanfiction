- I also second Wookie's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3bfp9s/harrys_time_at_hogwarts_with_completely_different/cslrcpe][mentioned]] /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][HP & Temporal Beacon]]/.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] (W: 194,707; Complete) --- all the vanilla quests still happen, but mostly in the background because Harry (who isn't the prophecy-boy) has other things to worry about.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird Trilogy]] (W: 494,107; Complete) --- the magical and social systems, as well as many characters, are in complete overhaul in this story. Some parallels still exist, but the story fits your request.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HP & MoR]] (W: 661,619; Complete) --- similar to Firebird, the story goes on an original development almost from the beginning.
