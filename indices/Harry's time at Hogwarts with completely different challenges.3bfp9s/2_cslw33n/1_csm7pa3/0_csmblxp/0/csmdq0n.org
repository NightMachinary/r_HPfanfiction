The trope of Lily and James ignoring Harry and siblings and only focusing on the BWL!OC. It's jarring, unrealistic, lazy, and immature to write that way. It's bad enough in the fics where Lily and James forget about their other kids, it's even worse when they're actively hostile.

Sure, there are people in the real world that act this way towards their kids, but the characters of Lily and James Potter as presented canonically would never act this way. This trope is just a lazy way of putting some conflict and angst in the story in a manner that is neither successful nor original.
