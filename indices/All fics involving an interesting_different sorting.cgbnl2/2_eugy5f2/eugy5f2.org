Well, my fic (Scrambled Sorting) was already recommended, but there are plenty of other fics...

!linkffn(A Sorting Like No Other)

A one-shot. Manipulative Dumbledore is kind of boring, but whatever.

!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change)

Harry bribes the Sorting Hat to put Draco in Gryffindor, Crabbe and Goyle in Hufflepuff, and Hermione in Ravenclaw. Meanwhile, Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw along with a much younger Tonks.

!linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology)

Slytherin Hermione. This fic does a good job portraying her ruthless side, to the point where diary Riddle thinks that draining her soul would be a waste of potential.

!linkffn(The Best Revenge)

A fix fic. Harry is sorted into Hufflepuff, while Hermione goes to Ravenclaw.
