Yes, there are thousands of them, and my favorite one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). It's DH, but not Epilogue compliant.

If you insist on full canon compliance, then I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] massive postwar series, consisting of 80+ fics of various length. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days][Grave Days]], linkffn(5486257), is the one that shows what happened immediately after the Battle.
