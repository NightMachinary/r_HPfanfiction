I like the idea that there's only ever been one proprietor at Ollivander's for over 2300 years, either an immortal wizard or something pretending to be human, but either way mostly just doing it for the lulz. There's a wonderful little nod to such an idea in linkffn(The Trial of Dolores Jane Umbridge)...
