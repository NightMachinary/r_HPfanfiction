I've stuck with H/Hr since I got into HP fanfiction and I feel pretty set in my ways. I've tried to read other ships (Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur), but even if the main pairing is written really well I find myself wondering what's happening with the other person of my preferred pairing.

I've even tried looking into three-way pairings that preserve H/Hr like linkffn(4321881; 7718942; 5681042) but it just feels really strange. I'm certainly all for forgiveness in real life matters, but not in the HP universe so any story with Draco or Snape is right out. I've recently branched out into reading stories with no pairing, so I guess that could be considered a change in preference.

But I'd never presume to speak for anyone other than myself. The million different preferences on this subreddit is one of the things that makes it so great.
