That's a really hard question to answer and I probably couldn't narrow it down to just one because there are so many different subgenres.

Favourite crack!fic is probably either [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6133][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by serpentclone]] or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion). I can't enjoy Champion's Champion without calling it a crack!fic, thereby giving Driftwood a pass on the ridiculous amounts of Ron bashing.

For canon compliant I like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7460&chapterid=&agree=1][Love Lost, Love Found by Harry's Mistress]]. Most of the other canon compliant stories are focused on a clandestine relationship between Harry and Hermione and I'm not a fan of infidelity.

One of the best stories that also mixes in some interesting ideas on magic is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=4723&chapterid=&agree=1][Magic Never Dies by Lynney]]. It won the Felix Felicis competition on portkey, so it's probably one of the better quality stories on that site.

linkffn(Harry McGonagall by witowsmp) does a very young Harry quite well, although admittedly there aren't very many of those to choose from.

But if I had to choose only one H/Hr story based purely on its technical merits and the depth of thought the author gave to developing the romance, it would be linkffn(Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic). I probably rec it too often, but it's really an excellent story.

If you have any that aren't on my overly long list, please let me know. I'm always happy to read another story.
