I was quite late to fanfiction, I only started reading it three-four years ago, so I had already read all the books and seen all the films. First one I read after MoR(yes I know, it's not my cup of tea either) was a H/Hr and I went in coming from enjoying Hermione's characterisation in the books (she got irritating at times but didn't everyone apart from Luna?) and hating her Mary-Sue film version only to find her character felt based off the Mary-Sue version. I tried another H/Hr thinking it's just that one that was so OP surely this one can't be it has over 2000 favourites.

Stupid, stupid, WRONG, WRONG.

I tried another, it was just bad luck right, they can't all be bashy bashy super Hermione? Wrong again kidder.

I've read a couple H/Hr over the years but if I see H/Hr I tend to avoid a fic because I'm sure there could be non awful Hermione stories but there is so much shit that it's not worth wading through.
