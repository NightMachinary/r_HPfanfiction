I've never really been a shipper. I do go through phases to be certain (currently in SS/Hr mode), but said phases don't usually last terribly long. I'll read nearly any pairing, although I avoid femslash unless it's very highly recommended. Same for HP/DM, but that's mostly just because so much of it's dreck and badly mischaracterizes Draco.
