The only non-canon pairing I've ever been invested in is Remus/Sirius. I tend to be open to pretty much everything else but in the four or so years I've read fanfiction my dislike of Draco/Harry and any pairings with large age differences has never wavered. This is the only fandom where I continue to hate the pairings I hated going in, and I'm not sure why - maybe it's because I've been reading HP since I was a kid?
