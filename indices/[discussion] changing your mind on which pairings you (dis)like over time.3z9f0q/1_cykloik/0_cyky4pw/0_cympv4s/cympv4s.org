It's one thing to dislike canon, as most of us have numerous problems with it, but too many fics wind up trivializing the conflict with Voldemort while turning the Weasleys and/or Dumbledore into unforgivable and pureblood rhetoric spewing, potion/memory charm using bastards. I don't have anything against alternative interesting conflict, but some of it just gets so tiring.

It is one thing for characters to be willing to go to extreme lengths to accomplish their goals (and some of it can be rationalized as being in-character), but it is another thing entirely to make them amoral and /stupid/ when it is out of character. "Love makes us do crazy things" isn't quite good enough for me.
