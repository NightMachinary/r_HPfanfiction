Snape/Harry got me into fandom, and I'd still rank it as my OTP. But the thing about being around so many talented writers and artists is that they can be /very persuasive./ Although I suppose it's not so much that I changed my mind as that I enlarged my scope.

Adding Snape to a pairing helps (unless you turn him into a Byronic, sophisticated, misunderstood woobie or any version of Alan Rickman, because no), but it's not required. Some things just don't float my boat - most of the canon ships, for example, not from hostility but from lack of interest. And generally speaking, hetfic is low on my list, since het content is provided by the entire rest of the world and the cultural marketplace.

And some things haven't changed. I still have zero interest in Harry/Draco, despite the number of excellent writers who've written for ship. Remus/Sirius and Snape/Hermione ditto, although that's more "meh" than actual dislike. I still have trouble shipping Luna with anyone, although I like seeing her as a secondary character in fic.

For most other ships, I'm open to having a conversion experience at the hands of a good writer. I've become a "McGonagall/almost anyone" fan through the sheer force of talent exhibited by a small band of LJ authors. I used to adore the HP Beholder fest precisely because it focused on unconventionally attractive characters, including the older or unheroic or unsympathetic ones.

HP is a godsend of potentially interesting characters and ships, and I've enjoyed exploring them through other writers' eyes. In the end, though, and for whatever reason, I always come back to various Snape combinations.
