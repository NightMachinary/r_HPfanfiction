I was a H/Hr shipper up till I read OotP, where H/G just "clicked" on me for some reason, and since that point on, I just can't read anything non h/g, unless the character is Harry in name only.

Now, on the other hand I used to quite enjoy Hr/Sirius or Hr/Remus with a time travel twist, then I got tired of fics that even with that already universe altering factor, for some reason decided to stick to canon.

Also, I die a little every time I see Snape X Anyone. Snape is not the kind of person that gets a happy ending, or deserves one.
