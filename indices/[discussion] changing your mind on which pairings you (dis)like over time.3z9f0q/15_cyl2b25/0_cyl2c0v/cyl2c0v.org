  "Someday you won't care what they say. . . and you'll do it your own way, not theirs!" Slytherin!Hermione, in which the brilliant witch catches the attention of creative twin wizards. It isn't easy, though. Not all Gryffindors are vastly brave, nor are all Slytherins loyal to their own.- FW/HG/GW, starts in Hermione's 1st year. Rated for a triad relationship and future chapters.
