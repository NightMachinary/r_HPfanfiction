In answer to your question, I felt exactly as you do about Hermione x Snape, and then I read Pet Project. It's not my favorite SS/HG, but it eases you in so slowly that there never seems to be anything amiss. Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten is my favorite SS/HG and takes place ten years after the war, and at that point (especially if you consider the longer lifespans of witches and wizards) the age difference doesn't seem like such a big deal.

You mentioned you like triads so linkffn(Brilliant Magic) is a Fred x Hermione x George WIP that I've been following for a while and is absolutely amazing. It's a Slytherin!Hermione, that I think really stays true to all the characters.
