I've changed my mind on pretty much everything. Back when I started reading fanfiction, the only pairings I read were canon pairings, and the thought that people could actually read/write anything else horrified me.

These days, I'll still choose Harry/Ginny as my favorite pairing if pressed, but that's mostly because I like Ginny and Harry/Ginny stories are the only stories that generally have her in a prominent role.

I can read pretty much anything these days, though I still dislike Harmony. I don't think that is going to change any time soon, but we shall see.
