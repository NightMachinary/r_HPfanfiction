I just recently got into Tom Riddle/Hermione, and I thought for the longest time that it was such a crazy ship that could never make any sense. Then I stumbled onto a time travel fic with Hermione going back in time and being sorted into Slytherin in Tom's year. It wasn't quite a romance, but it led me to believe that this ship could actually make sense in the right context. I think I'm more into Hermione tricking Riddle type of romance, although I wouldn't be against a dark!Hermione/Tom story. /Edit/: Here is the story: linkffn(9400342)
