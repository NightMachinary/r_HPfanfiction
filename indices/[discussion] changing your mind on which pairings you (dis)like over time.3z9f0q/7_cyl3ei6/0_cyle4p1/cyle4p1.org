Hermione is Harry's Bellatrix. Devoted, Loyal, Protective. Just not crazy and way cleverer - which makes her even more dangerous I believe. I could totally see her falling for a young Tom Riddle, but I confess I never read them in any fics before. I might just go on a search. Though I also always find it more believable that hermione goes Gray and not Dark, as she IS a muggleborn after all.
