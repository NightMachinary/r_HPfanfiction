I used to think "if Snily then not Snarry", but I've mellowed out enough to consider other ways Snarry could happen. The more I think about Snape, the more I run away from all other Snape ships and towards Snarry.

I used to be okay with Tomione but ever since falling hard for Harrymort, Tomione doesn't make sense for me anymore, and has turned into my greatest NOTP. It's a terrible shame, considering how the ones I read before my converting were pretty good, and there were so many Tomione fics I had on my to-read list that I can't enjoy anymore. (Harrymort, on the other hand, used to be the-ship-which-must-be-mad, but the really good ones are responsible of converting me.)

To balance out the lack of tolerable ships including Hermione (and my worsening impression of Drarry), I'm gradually becoming more open towards Dramione. Not that I actively seek it, but I am fine with it happening in the sidelines.

Though I have likes and dislikes, most of the time, I'll probably end up nodding to whatever ship the author writes about if it's well written.
