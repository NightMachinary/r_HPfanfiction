In the beginning I was very much into Severus/Lily, but as I grew older I saw why that is a terrible pairing. Now I read a lot of Lily/James, particularly in their last Hogwarts years.

Also, while I don't have anything against Ginny at all (Book!Ginny is actually incredibly well written, I think), I usually pair Harry with Tonks, as my otp, or other lesser used canon girls like Fleur, Susan and sometimes Daphne. (Canon lesser used, as in fanfiction I've found them to be the main pairing for a LOT of fics).

I even came across a James/Hermoine timetravel fic that I really enjoyed, against all odds.
