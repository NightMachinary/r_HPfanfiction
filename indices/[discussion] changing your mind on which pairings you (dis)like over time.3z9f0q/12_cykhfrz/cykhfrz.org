I didn't care about shipping at all before, but I ship Sev/Lily now. Partially because of how entrenched shipping is in fandom culture and the discussion/justification surrounding pairings and characters.

I could never get invested in Hermione as part of a pairing at all, despite fandom shipping her with anything that moves. I'm chill w/ Ron/Hermione, but I have no thoughts about them /as a pairing/. Sevmione/any student/teacher pairing is bleargh.

Contrariwise, I ship Sev/Tonks. It only works for me in AUs where they were never teacher/student, though. It's psychologically easier to envision that, since we never see them interact as teacher/student, only as adults, so you can just pretend it never happened.

Tom Riddle/anyone was a no, is a no, will always be a no. He's a combination of Petyr Baelish and like, Christian Grey. No.

Wolfstar was always weird to me. It's always in the backdrop of the Marauder fandom. James/Sirius seems more intuitive to me. Jily is a no also.
