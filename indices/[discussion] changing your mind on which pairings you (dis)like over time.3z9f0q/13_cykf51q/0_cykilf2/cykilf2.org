Well the Hr at 12 and Snape at 31 is a bit over the top, but I see a lot of Hr being 15-16 when she falls for Snape. I guess I just prefer my fics to be set at year 5 to 7 and not way post-hogwarts so thats my own shortcoming. And the few post-hogwarts I enjoyed simply never had Hr/Snape. C'est la vie.

I get what you mean , sometimes a pair just snucks up on you and changes your opinion of them somehow. But finding that elusive fic that will is hard imho. So much fanfiction is too OOC its not even funny - except in crackfics of course. ;)
