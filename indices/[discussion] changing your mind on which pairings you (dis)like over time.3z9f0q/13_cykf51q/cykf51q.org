When I first came back to the HP fandom a few years ago as a fanfiction reader, I only really liked Snape/Lily. Personally I couldn't understand how people could like Draco/Harry or Snape/Hermione, but I thought that Draco/Hermione could be okay.

*But then, I read a fanfic based on the pairings I didn't get/understand and it changed my opinion*.

Draco/Harry is now my favorite pairing and I like and read Snape/Hermione and Draco/Hermione. I don't care for Snape/Harry because I'd rather see him with Lily or Hermione. But I came to that opinion AFTER I read a few SS/HP fics and determined that pairing wasn't for me.

So bottom line is, if you don't understand it, read a good rec fic to see if you can see what the appeal is. I did it and my favorites have changed because of this.

And OP, in the SS/HG stories I come across, Hermione is NOT 15 years old in a relationship with Snape. She is usually 17-19 if she is still in school (remember she is almost a year older than everyone else), but there are tons of fics featuring them that take place when she's in her 20s (Post Hogwarts). Snape/Hermione is not a 12 year old Hermione with a 31 year old Snape!
