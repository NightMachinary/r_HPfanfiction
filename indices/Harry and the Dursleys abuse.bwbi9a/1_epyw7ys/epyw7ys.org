People deal with abuse very differently, and it's dangerous and kind of offensive to abuse victims to say "you don't seem damaged enough for the type of abuse you've experienced" or even "you don't seem damaged enough, so your abuse must have been not that bad after all". Abuse doesn't mean you'll be broken forever, and many succeed (including socially) and thrive in spite of it.

Harry doesn't trust adults, doesn't value his life enough, his social skills are not the best (but not the worst, either). He is a bit emotionally stunted, like when he doesn't know how to comfort Hermione after Ron's left in DH. So we do see the effects of his upbringing on his personality.

I also hate it when people say that the Dursleys' abuse is cartoonish, that something like that could happen only in the books, and in the real life everybody would notice. It kind of proves the Dursleys' point, isn't it? If Vernon was a broke drunkard beating Harry black, everybody would believe it, but normal, middle-class family messing with a kid like that? No way! But in fact, Harry's situation actually very much reminds me of a friend back in school. Her mother and stepfather treated her like shit, made her do all the chores and never spent any money on her unless they had to. All her clothes were second-hand (although fit her properly) and she would get a bottle of cheap nail polish for her birthday, while her younger brother, who they doted on, would get a new computer. They didn't beat her and they didn't keep her in the closet, but they would sometimes do shit like roughly waking her up and throwing her out of the house for the day at 5 a.m., or lock her out until late at night because the family is out. But the family was middle-class and respected, and nobody even suspected that anything could be going on there. Her mother would get away with very passive agressive comments and demeaning jokes at the girl's expense, would always compare her unfavourably to her brother, and adults didn't bat an eye because it was said with a sweet smile. Still, my friend always remained optimistic, cheerful and empathetic, and wasn't half as angry at her home situation as I was on her behalf. She was pretty resigned to it, like "water is wet, my mom is a psycho bitch, what else is new?" Back then, I thought she was coping remarkably well, especially compared to what I would do in her situation, but now looking back at what was her quite severe eating disorder (which went undiagnosed, and which her mother in fact knowingly and gleefully encouraged), hidden anxieties and low self-esteem, she probably didn't.
