You might be overestimatind the significance of that frying pan. I'm pretty sure it was a rather ligh-weight one, so it's unlikely it'd cause severe brain trauma.

I'd say they didn't hesitate that much from decking him on a head or somthing from time to time if he did something wrong, or maybe use physical punishment of some other kind a few times for 'wrongdoing', but he couldn't've been abused too seriously (as fanon sometimes portrays). Anything more severe would be propably reserved for bouts of accidental magic - after all, magic is what causes Dursleys to resent Harry.

On a sidenote: wizards play sport with homing cannonballs for fun. I doubt a muggle woman with a frying pan is gonna do them in.
