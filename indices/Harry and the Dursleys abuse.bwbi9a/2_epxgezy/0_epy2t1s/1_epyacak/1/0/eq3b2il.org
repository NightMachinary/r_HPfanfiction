Well, i have 3 frying pans - one is light enough and with short enough handle that it would be pretty hard to do some damage with an offhand swing, and the other two i don't think i could actually employ for such tactics.

I think i should've stated more clearly that the point i tried to make was that the physical abuse wasn't on some insane levels as portrayed in some fanon, despite that incident - i.e. they could've been taking a swing at him and whatnot, but it's unlikely those were premeditaed attemps to do him in or cause physical damage. Mental abuse is whole 'nother matter.

And on the topic of pans again - sure you can severly damage or kill someoen with one. Same as with a fist to the face. But that scene you keep referencing definitely wasn't an 'attempted murder' or something of the sort.

And just in case - i do not encourage hitting people with frying pans or think that it is an okay and perfectly normal thing to do
