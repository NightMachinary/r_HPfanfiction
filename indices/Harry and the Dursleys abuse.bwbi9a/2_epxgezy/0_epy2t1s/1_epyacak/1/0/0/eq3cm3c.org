You'd be surprised how much damage something made of metal can do, even if it's only a couple pounds.

I agree that a little tiny frying pan probably couldn't do too much damage. But a regular sized frying pan can pack a wallop.

As for whether it was an attempted murder, I agree on that as well. I don't think Petunia was actually trying to kill him. I think she was mad and lashing out. I don't think she was even trying to hit him. Probably just scare him. That being said, I do think that depending on where the frying pan hit, I have no doubt it COULD have killed him. Or at least knocked him out.

Hmmm... that is actually giving me ideas for a look into what her reaction would be if she HAD hit him.
