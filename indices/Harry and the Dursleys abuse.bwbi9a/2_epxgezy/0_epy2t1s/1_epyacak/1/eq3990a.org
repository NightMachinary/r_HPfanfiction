Im going to guess that you don't do a lot of cooking with frying pans. Even a lightweight frying pan has some heft to it. And children, even 12 year old children, have fairly fragile skulls as their cranial pieces haven't completely finished fusing together. It doesn't take a lot of force to crack open a skull with a metal implement. Especially if it has a handle.

Think of a wrench. The longer the handle, the more force you can give it.

I have no doubt that if it was swung hard enough by even a a smaller sized woman like Petunia Dursley could do some nasty damage to even a full grown adult. Frying pans can and have killed people.

Like, regular frying pans. Not just ginormous one, cast iron ones or minus. Just normal frying pans.

I agree that the Dursley's probably didn't physically abuse him as seriously as fanon like to portray, but I think it was still fairly extreme neglect and emotional abuse. It is literally mentioned that Harry thought his name was 'boy' until he got to school.

As for quidditch the only arguement I have for that is that they presumably wear armor and helmets. I don't remember seeing helmets in the movie, but that could have been for aesthetic reasons. Not only that, but they have a healer on hand for injuries who can literally mend bones with a wave of her wand. Muggle doctors can't do that, and Petunia most certainly would not be equipped for it.
