To make it short, while being legaly considered as "abuse", Canon Harry was not abused the same way you can sometimes see in fanon, and his character is consistent with his uprising.

And there is some points I would like to clarify :

​

Petunia, in canon, only tried to hit him once. But the context of the scene show 2 things : 1) It was a "reflex" action in a moment of anger, not something that happened regulary in the household, and 2) Harry knew something was coming since it happens right after he did what was probably considered the worst thing in the family, talked about magic.

The Dursley are not child beating monster, both the parents may be arguably rough when they are angry, or stressed (like Vernon pushing Harry in the cupboard right after he did magic), but they are still a far cry from the monster breaking Harry's bones every week with him only surviving with magic.

The Dursley never "starved" Harry. During his childhood, Harry ate his meal as the same time as the rest of the family, and while he complained that Dudley always devoured his favourite meals, he still had his share of food on the table. The only time Harry was truly starved was the summer of GoF year where, because of Dudley's diet, the whole family starved (though all seemed to cheat on it by different methods).\\
I guess he also had less to eat when he was punished for doing magic, but people need to keep in mind that the 2 "punishments" we read about in the books (Summer of CoS and OotP) were by far the 2 worst punitions he had there (after being accused of ruining a very important deal for Vernon, and almost killing Dudley). Before Hogwarts, while he was punished for accidental magic, it was probably way milder.

​

In general, Harry had a pretty bad childhood, but while it can legaly count as "abuse", I always felt he was more "neglected" (still count as abuse) than being beaten up to an inch of his life. Harry doesn't fear his guardian, or even hate them, if anything he is even disdainfull of them (which can explain why he cas sometimes be a smart ass with them and never cower in their presence).

The only really violent part of Harry childhood was Dudley, who was violent with everyone. The Dursley are bad parents, but not bad enough to be child killers.
