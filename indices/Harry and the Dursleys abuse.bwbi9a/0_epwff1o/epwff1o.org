I have always thought a large part of Harry's attitude comes from knowing that he isn't their child, that he doesn't belong in that family. An abused child whose mother and father abused them would maybe internalize it more. Harry is very detached. Another aspect is, in the real world, you aren't going to find many abusive families as stupid and oblivious as Vernon and Dudley are, at least. Getting away with a large portion of smart remarks is perhaps a part of it.
