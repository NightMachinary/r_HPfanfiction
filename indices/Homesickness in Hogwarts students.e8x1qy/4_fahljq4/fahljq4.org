To be fair, I don't really remember the books saying anything about parents not being allowed to visit their children or students not being allowed to leave on weekends. Hogsmeade is different because it's more of an unsupervised thing. I don't know, maybe it happened and JKR just didn't think it was important to the plot since Harry wouldn't feel that way.
