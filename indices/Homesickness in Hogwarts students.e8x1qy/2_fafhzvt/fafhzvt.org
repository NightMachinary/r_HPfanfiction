Dumbledore probably expects kids to take this separation as as a lesson in independence or something. You seeming can't even meet your parents for a meal on the weekend till third year.

Why does Professor Dumbledore allow Professor Snape to be so nasty to the students (especially to Harry, Hermione, and Neville)? JKR: "Dumbledore believes there are all sorts of lessons in life ... horrible teachers like Snape are one of them!"
