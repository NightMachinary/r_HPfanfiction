You'll see this addressed in fics occasionally, but for the most part, I think authors tend to follow canon, which didn't really show this. I'm unsure if this is because JK didn't feel it was plot-relevant or if it's just something about British culture.

If you're looking for a good example, linkffn(Blackboards and Broomsticks) has a central storyline about a new Muggleborn student who gets homesick and feels out of place at Hogwarts.
