I don't think it's a British culture thing - even among sections of society where going to boarding school is the 'done' thing, you still get instances of children feeling incredibly homesick and out of place (though not all children, obviously). I think this was explored in The Crown, when Prince Charles is sent to Gordonstoun?

I can only imagine the culture shock a muggleborn child would have attending Hogwarts. But it would be immense for many pureblood children too - especially those who hadn't attended a school before, and had only had supervised interactions with other pureblood children. It must be incredibly disorientating to suddenly find yourself in an enormous castle full of other children with (apparently) minimal adult supervision.
