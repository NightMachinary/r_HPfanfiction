Thank you for saying this!! I'm currently writing my first ever fic, and the amount of feedback I've received has really disappointed me. I get so jealous of the people who have a one/two chapter log story and they already have dozens of reviews, whilst I'm there with my twenty-ish long WIP that has three or four reviews (one of which is loner than a sentence) and I'm just like; oh. It makes me wonder if it's all worth it. I mean, I'll still do it because I enjoy for myself, but still.
