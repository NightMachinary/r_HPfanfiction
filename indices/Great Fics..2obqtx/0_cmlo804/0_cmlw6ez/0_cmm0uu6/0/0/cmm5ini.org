Most author's write fanfiction to improve their writing. They're hoping for feedback, comments, reviews and what not. Really, anything that will help them with their writing.

Most stories become abandoned because writing a story takes a massive amount of time and effort and the writer receives no real help from the readers. So the writer decides that it's not worth the time and effort, and moves on to something else.

A refusal to read non-completed fics is an incredibly selfish attitude to have. It shows your interest is purely in your own entertainment. Fanfiction isn't about your entertainment. It's about people trying to improve their writing. And it's amazingly easy to help with that. It's also amazingly easy to keep writer's motivated by talking with them about their works in ways that make it seem like you actually read it. ((Note: update soon! cool story bro! More! are not helpful reviews. "I really like how X acted in the scene where X and Y were discussing their future plans. It threw a twist into the plot I didn't see coming and really hope to see it explored soon!" is a helpful review.))

Less than 0.5% of unique hits on my stories have left a review. Zero Point Five Percent. And I didn't do the math wrong. Don't be part of the 99.5%.

And yes, having a selfish attitude and refusing to attempt to provide feedback because 'you feel bad' if the story isn't complete is insulting. How do you think the author felt when they stopped writing it? Because I'll guarantee you they stopped writing it because they felt it was a waste of time. They crossed the point when it simply wasn't worth the effort.

It's right up there in the same boat with the people that complain constantly that there's no 'new' fanfiction, and then refuse to read in progress stories.
