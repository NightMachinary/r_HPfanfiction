You're using your view on fanfiction to justify an argument which may only apply to you.

I read fanfiction for entertainment - that's what a hobby is for. I write fanfiction for entertainment, as I find it interesting to explore avenues of my own imagination that haven't been pinned down.

Sure, a side affect is my writing gets better, but I write for me. Countless others no doubt write for themselves.

Some people quit because it isn't worth the effort, and some just get bored.
