I don't think it's insulting to authors so much as limiting with respect to what someone will read.

To the OP: Given your strong dislike for incomplete stories, I think you might be best served staying with one-shots. They're guaranteed to be complete and there are about half a million to choose from, meaning you're unlikely to run out of material. In particular, consider reading some of the various collections of one-shots out there by writers like Rorschach's Blot, nonjon, Perspicacity, etc.
