Meh. Too many constraints.

Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by [[/u/Taure]], which (in my opinion) doesn't get enough attention on the sub. 120k words, complete.

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
