The mannerisms part, yes. [[http://www.letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty Five Owls]] by Letterblade. This is part of a letter which Dumbledore writes to his old friend Grindelwald.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter started at Hogwarts five years ago. He was Sorted into Gryffindor House, which I doubt surprises you. His academics are on the upper side of average, his teacher relations generally neutral, and his friendships unbreakable as diamonds. He was raised by an abusive, neglectful Muggle family, utterly miserable until he came to Hogwarts, and that was my will, for it was necessary to protect him. Necessary to condemn him to a horrible childhood. His entire life is bound up in old magic, wild philomency, things Voldemort refuses to acknowledge and which even you and I barely plumbed the existence of. He is both ordinary and extraordinary at once, and it strains my wit to describe him.

  He has suffered so, so much for a boy so young. And so much of it at my hands, even if indirectly. And--he does not know. He has not even the faintest clue of the true weight of it.

  His fate is entwined with Voldemort's. Magic beyond logic or reason--

  Gellert, I must send him to his death.

  I had tried for so many years not to see it. A shred of Voldemort's soul, so torn from the creation of his Horcruxes, dislodged when the Killing Curse backfired and stuck in an innocent boy. There is a prophecy. Twin serpents in the smoke of the pathfinder. Old, old, antediluvian magic--

  I cannot tell him. How could I? He must realize it himself--

  He is a good boy, Gellert. He is tough and brave and mostly clever, and he deserves better. He deserves to grow up and grow old and fall in love and herd about children and write crochety letters. He deserves to bury Voldemort and move on to his own life, free of fates and scars and nonsense, and I would give /my/ life to make it so, but I cannot, not ever, because that is not how things are.
