This is really good!!! I would love to read more of this, except........... some inconsistancies with canon - unless it does that on purpose of course. (because at this point Dumbledore knew Harry would survive)

Also, and I know this is fan fiction, but I hate the idea of Dumbledore putting Harry at the Dursleys /in order/ for Harry to turn into the "right sort of person". A) realistically, it wouldn't have worked, Harry's personality is highly unusual to come from a home like the Dursleys, and I just have trouble believeing that someone as logical as Dumbledore would think that could possibly work. And B) Dumbledore didn't know yet what sort of role Harry would play when he placed him at the Dursleys. Dumbledore does not know everything right away, he is a complicated character who learned a lot throughout the series and changes his mind based on new information nearly ever year.

Anyway, I know this is fan fiction, so it doesn't have to be canon, but just some things I've noticed often enough in fan fiction that I think a lot of people think it's canon.
