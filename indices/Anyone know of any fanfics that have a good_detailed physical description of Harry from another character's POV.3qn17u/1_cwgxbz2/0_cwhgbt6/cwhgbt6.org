Yeah, actually, it does it sooo well, I would say! It's something I've noticed even more writing my own fan fiction. I'm trying to write it in a similar way as JKR, and I've actually realized how /little/ she actually says sometimes, but the words she uses still show us exactly what's going on and at the same time allowing us to place ourselves into the story and be mad or annoyed /for/ Harry and /feel it/ instead of read it. For example, the gossip article about Hermione breaking Harry's heart for Krum in GoF - we never get Harry's opinion on this. All we know about it is that he goes red when Snape reads the article in class, but JKR never has him say or think his actual opinion about the article. But... we still /know/ what he thinks about it anyway. We don't need to be /told/.

Anyway, yeah, I totally agree, it's the point, and I think one of the reasons the books became so popular, because the writing style allowed us to feel more and therefore relate more.
