I think that the context that the duel was issued in was used to great effect to demonstrate how young and naive the two characters were. I can imagine both children being taught the rituals of their respective pureblood lines and both of them being warned not to use it until they were older.

But in the heat of battle (which was a mock battle for school credit) the rush gets to both of them and they call upon ancient and serious magic, that has likely been the deciding factor in many great events of the past... to win a game.

What is more childish?

I would like to add that I mean only this one scene in a vacuum. Although entertaining, the characterisation in HPMOR is weird to say the least.
