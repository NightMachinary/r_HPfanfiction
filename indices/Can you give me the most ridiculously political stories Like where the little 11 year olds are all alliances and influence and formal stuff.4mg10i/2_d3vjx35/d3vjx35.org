I too like those so bad that they are good POLITICS FICS

linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven) - This one has some surprisingly neat ideas. And all of the cliches. Also being hit in the head makes you a master occlumens.

linkffn(Marauder's Plan) - Current epilogue is sort of slog to read through, but the main work is full of glorious bullshit. Like Harry being most powerful magical fetus of his generation or scar tissue on magical core.
