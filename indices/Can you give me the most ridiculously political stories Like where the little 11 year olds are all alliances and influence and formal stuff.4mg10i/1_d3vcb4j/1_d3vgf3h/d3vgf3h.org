I personally struggle to write children, no matter the subject or basing of the child. This is mostly due to the fact that my own childhood was less than pleasant and that I never really got to go outside and play like everyone else. A lot of children that I write tend to come off as adults or teenagers because I honestly have no idea what a child should be doing. From the ages of seven to eleven I was wishing myself to another place and aside from that, I didn't do much.

Every writer has flaws and faults in their writing, most of my own work (whether published or unpublished) attests to that because of the countless mistakes in the work I've done. A decent writer will be able hide the flaws they have and pull attention from them. One bad characterization doesn't really break a character.

I went off topic like six times trying to write this, so it may be all over the place... sigh. Lmao.

As for OP, try and Slytherin focused stories, they tend to follow the same protocol of all eleven year olds have mastered their emotions and are political prodigies.
