For the sake of sensitive censors, I'll just tell you to search for HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir on ficwad.com. It has over-the-top sex hijinks but also a healthy respect and involvement with Norse mythology, including the Huldr, Jormungandr and other related *dr's. And, of course, bicycle racing, because what else could be better for a hybrid godling who needs to unwind?
