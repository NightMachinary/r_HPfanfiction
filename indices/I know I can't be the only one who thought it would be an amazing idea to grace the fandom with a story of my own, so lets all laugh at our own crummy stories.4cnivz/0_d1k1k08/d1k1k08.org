I deleted this ages ago so I'll just explain my first masterpiece. It was an OFC story starring Lucy Potter, James' much younger sister. She went to school in the same year as Charlie Weasley for age reference. She had blue highlites in her hair, came across her parents' dead bodies at the age of 5, was hidden in a closet the night James and Lily died (they were her guardians at the time), gets sent to a magical orphanage since she's not family to the Dursleys and no one else wants her, the Weasleys quasi adopt her after she befriends Charlie (but never mention to Harry BTW you have an aunt until she shows up with Charlie for the World Cup for dramatic suspense), she's bullied by the other orphan kids (who all end up in slytherin) and she's Charlies love interest. The real /brilliant/ moment was in the sequel when he admits his feeling to her... not by asking her on a date but asking her to marry him. She says yes. Yes the sequel. It was abandoned halfway. Oh and I oh so cleverly used the mirror tactic to describe her appearance in the second chapter (cause I was avoiding describing her in detail the first chapter cause I read writing tips that said not to do that) she was supposed to die tragically saving Harry at the end of GOF. But let's be honest, I probably would have resurrected her cause I was 14 and hated the idea of my OC not having a happy ending.
