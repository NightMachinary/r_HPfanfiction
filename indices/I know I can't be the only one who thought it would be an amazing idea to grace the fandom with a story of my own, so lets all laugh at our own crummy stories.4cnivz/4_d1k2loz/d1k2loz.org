Oh, I'll just go ahead and link my horrible creation: linkffn(4852186)

I had this grand idea for a Harry Potter/Twilight crossover where Harry goes to Forks, Washington for a school project and the American Magical Government freaks the hell out about British Boy Wonder being on their turf. My execution on the romance and overall everything was so bad I eventually dropped the story, but somehow I /still/ get reviews and views on it. Like... Stop guys. Stop reading my crap.
