Never really written anything, but I have several "genius" plot bunnies drunkenly recorded on my phone. Gems such as:

- Does Dumbledore tell Hagrid secrets on purpose?

- Don't forget. write about unicorn horn harvesting

- Blacker than Black. One word to rule them

- Was Petunia really? Maybe not

This is sprinkled between medical notes (don't give articaine to pregnant women) and dessert recipes I need to create (like a grapefruit curd or mousse, whipped cream, grapefruit syrup, brown sugar graham cracker crumbles. Don't forget saalt)
