I get what you mean. I actually have a couple (what I believe to be anyways) unique ideas that I'd like to put to paper (or screen as it were).

Going back and reading the stories I wrote I just can't help but cringe at them. One for the subject matter, and two because I /know/ I can write so much better than that now.

They aren't terrible on a technical level (grammar, spelling etc), but they just don't flow very well, they don't have any life to them. It reads very awkwardly really.
