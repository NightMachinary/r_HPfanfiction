I think a lot of what most people consider crummy stories tend to be I'll thought out plot bunnies that people feel the need to write. I did one the other day. I don't generally write anything myself, but I wanted to get the idea of of my head.

I know that's not quite what you meant by share, but just thoughts on the situation. There are a lot of stories I love for the ideas, but loath for the execution.
