Oh, god I have a beauty. I started it in 2009 and am trying to rewrite it. Basically Harry is heavily abused by the Dursley's (over the top) including some pretty explicit sexual abuse. Snape picks him up, and seeing how he's treated becomes much nicer. Harry get sorted into Slytherin so of course he's best friends with Draco and hates Ron, though they become less hateful after CoS. Snape basically adopts him. They do an inheritance test with the Goblins and Harry is Heir of house Black and Potter and rich, he also has a couple manors.

I am currently trying to rewrite it because some of the stuff concerning the abuse is a good catharses for me, though I am trying to at least present some of the Lord Potter-Back stuff in a new way.
