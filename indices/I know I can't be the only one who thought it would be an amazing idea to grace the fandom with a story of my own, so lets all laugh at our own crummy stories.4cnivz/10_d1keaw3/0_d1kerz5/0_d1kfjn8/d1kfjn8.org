Both. I like to think I had some unusual explanations and consequences. Though I never got far enough into the story to explore them.

I had Sirius adopt Harry as a 'third' parent, and basically mix his Genetic info with Lily and Jame's. Also given that it was fannon that Jame's mother was Dorea Black, Harry then was more closely related to the Blacks and became the Heir by default.

Also Harry's magic combined with Lily's protection gave him special healing abilities because of the abuse, as a way to protect him.
