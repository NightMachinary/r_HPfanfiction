Everything from Balance: Unequal Shadows down (except Spring Break Seduction, Musings, and Tawny Hair which I think are not bad, likely due to being shorts) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/358482/]] are basically crap. I didn't understand story structure or the fact that a story is a knapsack and can't carry more than the story actually needs to happen.
