I never published it, but I wrote about 30k words in a post-OotP story where Vernon gets drunk, punches Harry, and he gets angry and runs away to train during the summer. Train in all sorts of stuff, like wandless magic and hand-to-hand combat from Japanese karate wizards. Then I realized I was trying to write a 2006-style indy!Harry fic in 2012, and dropped it.
