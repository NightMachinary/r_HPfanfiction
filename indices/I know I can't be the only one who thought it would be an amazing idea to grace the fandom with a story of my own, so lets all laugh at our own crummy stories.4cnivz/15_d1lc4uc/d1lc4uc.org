I wrote a couple of absolutely trashy Immortal!Harry fics in high school. Harry was reborn after every death- kinda like Wastelands of Time, but with a new universe after each death instead of a time jump- and proceeded to hang out/fuck things up/kinda just exist in a series of original and existing universes. It's been a fantasy of mine since I was probably nine or ten and I have some of an abandoned original novel written about the fantasy as well, and the seventeen thousands words up on my profile are an embarrassing tribute to that. They're littered with really obvious pop culture references, poor grammar, and shame.

The worst part is that they still get a handful of visits.
