I started writing because I was tired of all the dumb Ice Queen Daphne bullshit, so I said fuck it, I'll do it proper! So, I wrote it without using "Ice Queen" at all, but it still turned out to be a massive piece of shit. Portrait of Salazar Slytherin, secret library in the CoS, basilisk hide armor, nundu animagus, line of sight teleportation that you could use in Hogwarts... it's awful. All I ended up doing was ruining an already ruined pairing (and keep in mind, this was 2009 and things haven't gotten better since). But, somehow it's still my most popular fic, with 1.5 million views, so I decided I'd keep it up as a testament to where I started.
