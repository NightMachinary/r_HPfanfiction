Aw man, so sorry that the Goblet of Fire broke it up. SOmetimes it just doesn't work between human and magical spewing fire artifact of legend.

Anyway, sorry I don't really have any good romantic stuff to add. In fact, I'll probably lurk this thread and see if I can find something for myself as well, since that's a glaring lack of it in my résumé. I mean, I know fluffy stuff, but it's not necessarily romantic. Maybe linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince) and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]] qualify?
