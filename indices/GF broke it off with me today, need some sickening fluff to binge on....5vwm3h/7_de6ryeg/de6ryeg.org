There's a really popular Dramione fic if you sort by top with those two as featured characters. Ron cheats, they fuck at Malfoy Manor, etc. Really sappy. Very...Twilighty.

But. You wanna get over her? Don't fill the void. Let her departure hurt, embrace it, accept it, and get it over with. I medicated with fanfiction for around 6 months. H/G fics used to make me cry and feel and I loved it. It wasn't my best decision, but I was hurting and I wanted to feel strong and loved even if only by proxy.

You'll be fine in time.
