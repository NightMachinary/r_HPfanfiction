Frankly, I can't say I was invested into the actual plot enough to care much about it being incomplete. This story is great for the relationship and the smut and the fluffiness, but its plot isn't really that amazing - at least for me it wasn't. And he /does/ summarise the ending in the last chapter, so there's that, at least.
