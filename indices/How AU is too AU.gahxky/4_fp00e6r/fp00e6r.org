There is such an odd mix of acceptable AUs for me. I love "Grow Young With Me" which obviously keeps the canon of the books but divulges from the epilogue and CC. I also love well-written Professor Potter AUs because I can honestly see Harry being a professor. However, there still needs to be magic for me to read it because the characters lack a depth when the magical aspect is left out. Some aspects such as the trio being in Gryfindor, Dumbledore dying, and at least reference to the original pairings (you can diverge from those with good explanation) need to be present.
