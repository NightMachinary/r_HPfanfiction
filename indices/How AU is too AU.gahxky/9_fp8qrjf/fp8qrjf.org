I usually start to take issue when they leave Hogwarts. Nothing against the concept, I'm just attached to the setting. Also, the fics that push "wizards should do everything like muggles". I'm fine with muggle involvements, and solid writing can make me ignore leaving Hogwarts, but generally, fics that either have them destroy Hogwarts traditions, or leave Hogwarts altogether.
