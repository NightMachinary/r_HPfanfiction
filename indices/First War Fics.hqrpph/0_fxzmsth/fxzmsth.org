  Twenty-year-old Remus Lupin tries to keep the werewolves on the side of the light. He's accepted it might cost him his life, but that's easier to reconcile than the other costs. Even if they win, who will he be, after he's seen the depths in himself?

  It's 1981, and the walls are closing in. There is a spy in the Order. Lily, James, and infant Harry Potter are in hiding but not safe under Fidelius yet. Severus Snape is not a trusted enough Death Eater to pass on crucial information, and Dumbledore still doubts Snape's loyalty. Peter Pettigrew is chewing at the walls where no one can see. And poison persists in the blood.
