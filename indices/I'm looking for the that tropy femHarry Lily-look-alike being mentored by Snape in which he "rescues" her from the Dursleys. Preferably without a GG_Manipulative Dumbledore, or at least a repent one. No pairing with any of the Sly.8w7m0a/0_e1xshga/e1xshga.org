I enjoyed the Severus' Rose series by WrittenWord1 - it has 7 completed fics and 1 in progress following fem!Harry (named Elizabeth Rose) as she's raised by Snape. There's a romance that builds throughout the years with Fred Weasley.

Note: Snape is Elizabeth's biological dad in this series. There are lots of fluffy family moments that are pretty OOC for the canon Snape, but it makes sense with the story!
