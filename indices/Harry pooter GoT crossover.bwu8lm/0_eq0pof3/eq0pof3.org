Several, one abandoned but still worth reading, another still in progress, and another that is decent in both quality and length.

Bit of background for the last one. This is technically a sequel to a story called "lightning Dragons Roar" by the same author. The entire series is a massive "multiverse Crossover" it is utterly unique among Fanfiction as far as I am aware and is quite good. As an example of this, the method of initiating the GoT crossover is rooted in an immediately previous Devil May Cry crossover. The entire thing is worth reading and is quite interesting all around.
