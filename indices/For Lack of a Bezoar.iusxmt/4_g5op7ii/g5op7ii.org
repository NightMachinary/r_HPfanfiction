I particularly liked the dynamic between Harry and Hermione:

*Harry:* DIEDIEDIE! /Avada-/

*Hermione:* [after a nonverbal Disarming Charm to disarm Harry] No, not yet, Harry. This scum is more useful to us alive, for now.

It's also refreshing that the fic doesn't undersell Hermione's talents and abilities the way a lot of Ruthless!Harry fics do: notice how Hermione casually casts most of her non-Unforgivables nonverbally and is usually the one doing the more complex magic.
