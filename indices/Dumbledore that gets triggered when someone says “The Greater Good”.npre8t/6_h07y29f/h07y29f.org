Lol, I was just thinking to write a "days of a future past" kind of fic with Snape back to his 4th year in Hogwarts who casually says "all for the greater good" to Dumbledore (or not casually, I'm deciding about it, I REALLY want a scene where Snape goes crazy under horcrux influence or something else and challenges Dumbledore in the hall saying all kind of crazy - for every one else - things about the past-future and then trying to blow questions off when he wake up in infirmary, but I'm afraid it would be too much ridiculous and difficult to unravel).
