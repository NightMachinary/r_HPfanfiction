Harry saying something like "it's for the Greater Good" horrifying Dumbledore and causing him to try to intervene more in Harry's life (for the better) would be a great subversion of the typical tropes.

In Dumbledore's mind, if Harry and his closest friends were (the Ministry Six, for example) began buying into a philosophy much like the "Greater Good" that he and Gellart subscribed to decades ago, he'd understand that Harry could very well turn into /another/ Gellart figure after he dies.

Dumbledore going "hands on" more in response to the current situation than in canon, all to prevent a greater tragedy in the future after Voldemort's permanent downfall? It could be a great fic.
