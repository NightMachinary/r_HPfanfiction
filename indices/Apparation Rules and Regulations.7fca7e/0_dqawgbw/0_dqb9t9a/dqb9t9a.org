There is a certain amount of evidence that crossing bodies of water is a barrier to apparition, in addition to distance. Here's the reasoning:

In DH, Voldemort had to fly back to the UK after his visit to Nurmengard in continental Europe.

Voldemort was in a desperate hurry and had no reason to delay, meaning he would have taken the quickest mode of transport available.

The English channel is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point.

In HBP we see Harry apparate from the south of England to Hogsmeade, with Dumbledore in tow, a distance far exceeding 21 miles.

Voldemort can almost certainly apparate better than Harry. And yet he wasn't able to apparate across the 21 miles of the English channel.

Conclusion: there is something about the English Channel which blocks apparition, other than distance.

Two contenders seem to arise as to this "something". It is either something naturally occurring, or something man-made.

The latter seems less likely, because at this point Voldemort was in charge of the British Ministry and therefore would presumably have control over any man-made magical immigration controls.

When considering naturally occurring barriers to apparition over a body of water, the most obvious conclusion is the water itself. After all, the ability of bodies of water to block magic is a common theme in folklore and JKR often draws upon folklore for inspiration in building the world.
