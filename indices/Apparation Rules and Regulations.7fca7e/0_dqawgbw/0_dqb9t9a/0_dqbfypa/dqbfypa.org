Let's assume the theory of water-based defense. There might be some wards that can block wizards, but it is costly to use them for borders. This has a significant impact on the world.

At country level, I expect large countries with few borders. They may not even have the concept of counties but instead have continent-wide governments. Of course, local communities exist, but laws, taxes, etc are chosen by continent.

Islands are the exception to this rule. If you disagree with the government, it is the easiest to find an island and declare yourself independent. Minorities often 'flee' to islands, leading to a drastically higher percentage wizards and witches in these areas. (Evidence: 1. The large amount of folklore from Britain. 2. Central Europe has two large magical schools while Britain has one. This indicates that there are twice as many wizards on the main land as in Britain + Ireland.)

These are a lot of assumptions, but I loved the world-building I just did. Hopefully, it is useful for you. Thanks for the inspiration.
