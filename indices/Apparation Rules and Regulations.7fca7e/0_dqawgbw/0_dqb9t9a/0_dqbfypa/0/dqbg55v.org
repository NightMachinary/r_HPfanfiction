I feel like this perhaps treats wizards as a bit too much like Muggles.

There's a lot of evidence that the international wizarding community is much more integrated than the Muggle one. The "other" for wizards are not wizards of other nations, but rather Muggles, and the wizards of the world are collectively engaged in a grand conspiracy against said Muggles to conceal their existence. This has led to the creation of a strong international order oriented around secrecy and has lessened inter-governmental rivalries - especially as a magical war would be too risky with respect to breaking secrecy.

It also doesn't really consider wizarding incentives. Unlike Muggles, wizards don't really have much of a reason to covet territory and the natural resources it contains. I don't picture wizards as having much in the way of territorial ambitions, with there instead being a largely stable consensus over the composition of magical communities primarily based on nationality/ethnicity/language.
