Apparation is annoyingly thin on details in canon. Does it even require a wand or is it completely wandless? It's not clear at all. I would say start from the basics and make your own rules, but be consistent in your application of them.

In my AU world, I have Aurors having a skill of silent Apparation as it made no sense to me that an Auror would announce their arrival on the scene with a loud sound. Harry, having had bad experiences with Floo and Portkey travel, uses mostly Apparation and is very good at it, able to cover large distances safely, even while taking someone else along.

The other thing that gets me about how non-specific JKR is about magical travel--what are the rules for international travel? I can imagine that magical authorities don't want people moving about willy-nilly through their borders, so how is that regulated? This is where I have to make up my own rules and stick to them.
