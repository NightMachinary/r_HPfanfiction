The limits we do know are these:

There is an Anti-Disapparation Jinx, which keeps people from Apparating in Hogwarts.

International distances are dangerous.

Depending on skill level, Apparation causes a sound anywhere between a pop and a car backfiring.

Also, Apparation is a class unto itself, Shield Charms are covered under DADA, which we all know has a poor reputation when it comes to actually preparing people. (And Umbridge was specifically making it impossible for anyone to learn.)
