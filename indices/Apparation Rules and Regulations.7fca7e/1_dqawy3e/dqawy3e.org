Distance is a tricky thing. London - Inverness is a longer trip than London - Frankfurt or London - Paris. Does that mean you can apparate to other countries or are there magical borders. Do these borders even match our current ones? For all we know the magical borders were decreed in 1306 and half of France is part of magical Britain. After all, why should wizards care about muggle borders?

As for inland apparation this is a difficult question to answer because judging by the books most magicals are morons who cannot cast a simple shield spell, something a bunch of school kids learn pretty quickly. So, if they cannot cast easy spells, how can we expect them to teleport themselves across hundreds of miles? I don't remember reading about people making stops because they lacked the range to do their journey in one go.

As for taking people along it has to be rather difficult else everyone would do it and floo travel would only be useful if you are drunk, underage or travelling in a large group. There are no clear answers in the books but the common theories go with mass, magical powers of the moved persons or number of people as factors.

Like with most things, write what you need to use and not what is given. Canon seems to lack definite, consistent limitations so you better be making your own.
