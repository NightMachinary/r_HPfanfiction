The Pureblood Pretense -- crossover between Alanna the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce, and Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a girl, pretending to be a boy so she can study under Severus Snape, the best potioneer in Great Britain. Subterfuge, a well-thought-out universe, and general fun rethinking of many of our favorite characters.
