For me, it's always been nonjon's 'A Black Comedy'. It laughs at most of the other 'into another dimension' fanfics out there, it shows one of the best interactions between Harry and Sirius as friends (plus partners-in-crime), and the background for 'That Fucker' (won't spoil it for those who haven't read it) is unique for this story as far as I know.

Plus, it's funny as fuck. 10/10, will always laugh until I cry at the 'Midget Detention' scene.
