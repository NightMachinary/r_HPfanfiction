Seconding this. I've reread all of nonjon's stuff about every six months since I discovered it. A Black Comedy and Browncoat, Green Eyes are the only two stories that consistently come to mind when I think of my top fanfic list.

I still have yet to find another story that does any justice to the circumstances behind That Fucker. A well done [[/spoiler][Dark Lord Ginnymort]] would easily be my favorite character ever.
