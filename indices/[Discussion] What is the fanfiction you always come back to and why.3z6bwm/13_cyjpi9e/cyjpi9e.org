linkffn(The Thorny Rose) trilogy. It isn't the best written and there's some bashing in it, which I usually hate, but it's very lighthearted and cheerful overall, and while I do love me some really depressed and deep literature, that stuff just isn't what I'm looking for in HP fanfiction. Whenever I need a pick-me-up or just want to lose myself in very happy and sappy teenage romance, I just read that.
