I recommend a better sorting system with tags, pairings, characters, etc such as *slash*, *Harry*/*Hermione*, *manipuative!Dumbledore*.

Also, a way to download the fic in different formats such as ePub, Mobi, PDF, .txt, .html, .rtf and Markdown.

I also recommend a better forum layout such as DLP's forum and a way to curate fics into lists.

A wiki would also be nice, much like the TVTropes page, except less 2005ish.

And a good mobile layout.

And themes. Dark and light that can be configured by defaults in user preferences or on the fic itself.

And have featured authors, fics, etc.

And a good review system, one better than FF.net

Look at the bigger players such as FFnet and AO3, use them for a while and see what you would want and what you can approve on.

Also, fast loading screens that do not use lots of data. (will help mobile users with data gaps)
