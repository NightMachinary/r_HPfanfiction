Ideas for tags:

A) Slash/non-slash tag (referring to point of view characters)

B) An ability to distinguish "Primary pairing" and "secondary character pairings" and search for them separately.

C) Some kind of restriction on the number of tags you can put on a fic that prevents people from tagging their fics with everything under the sun such that it comes up in almost every search, regardless of relevance.

D) Character-centric tag.
