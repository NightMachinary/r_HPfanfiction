A few questions...

How will you manage to support this site if you're going to keep it ad-free? Servers aren't free and fanfic won't pay to get their work "published".

What is the difference between your platform and any of the existing sites?

Why would an author publish to your site instead of ff.net, dlp, ao3?

How will you manage to get users without the content?

p.s. You definitely should compress and squash your css/js files. Even with CDN:s browsers handle multiple small files badly
