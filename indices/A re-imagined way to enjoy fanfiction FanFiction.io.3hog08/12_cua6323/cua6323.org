I'd like to be able to tag chapters individually - I don't always want to give away which characters I intend to "pair" from the get go.

I think a direct download functionality would be fantastic.

I would also dearly love to able to post links within the author's notes to illustrations or a Playlist as a chapters soundtrack.
