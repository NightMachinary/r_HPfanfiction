I'd suggest to make your project /embed/ data from websites like FF.net and AO3 instead of trying competing with them.

And regarding the tags: have you ever visited any of the [[http://booru.org/]] projects or the [[http://ehwiki.org/wiki/Tags][http://ehwiki.org/]] (sorry for the NSFW links)? I think what the audience lacks at the moment is a well though-out system to filter through all available stories and find what they actually are looking for --- while also gradually building a /standardised/ and up-to-date tagging system.

As girlikecupcake've said, even AO3 with its seemingly advanced filtering and search capabilities is currently often unable to provide to reader what they are looking for /without/ involving a human agent --- simply because the advanced filtering isn't advanced enough. E.g. not enough flexibility to simultaneously filter multiple things both in and out, then sort the results by multiple criteria as well, etc.
