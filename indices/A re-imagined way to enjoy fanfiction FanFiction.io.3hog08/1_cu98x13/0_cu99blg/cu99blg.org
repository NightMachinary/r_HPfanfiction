Yeah, kind of hard to pay the server bills with no revenue stream (ads and/or premium memberships).

The only other source of income is charging authors to publish but, there are other platforms that don't charge so FF.io would have to be beyond brilliant to get someone to pay for a service they can get for free elsewhere.
