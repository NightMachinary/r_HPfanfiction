DLP donations work, I think, because it is a small niche community that basically is the only community that creates and curates the content it is looking for. There's nowhere else to go if you want the level of quality /and/ the specific genres/themes that DLP looks for, and people realize this, and donate.

On top of that, DLP is very small. However, if this new site gets enough users, the probability of getting a few donations increases. It still sounds like an unstable business model that won't scale very well at all.
