A little late, but some more info...

The people who do this are called tag wranglers (I think that name fits well.) basically, you can click a Harmony tag and all the fics tagged Harry/Hermione or any other ship name for that ship will show up.

Further, if you are looking for an Iron Man fic, it will not only show up when you are browsing the Iron Man tag, but also the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel (All media types) tag.
