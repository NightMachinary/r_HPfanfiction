I absolutely agree that a built-in download option would be a great asset. A lot of people read fanfiction on their e-reader or on their mobile phone on PDF.

And as for writers not wanting their work dowloaded, why? Either way there will always be way to work around and download it because it's just text.

I find it weird that fanfiction writers would not want their work downloaded when a good amount of the original writers do not want fanfictions of their own work. Like, they're already pretty much /not/ legit but they still want some protection or I don't know what on what they do. It goes against the spirit of fanfiction which is to share from fan to fan.
