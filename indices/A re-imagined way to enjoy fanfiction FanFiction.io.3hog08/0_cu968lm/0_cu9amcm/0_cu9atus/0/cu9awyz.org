Yeah but that's the Internet, everything you put in there will be archived somewhere somehow. You have to be sure of what you put there. And then, only really popular fanfictions will be likely to be saved by a lot of people so anyway if you're successful, there /will/ be copies everywhere, you just have to deal with it. That's the game when you publish anything online (be it writing or videos or anything else). :)
