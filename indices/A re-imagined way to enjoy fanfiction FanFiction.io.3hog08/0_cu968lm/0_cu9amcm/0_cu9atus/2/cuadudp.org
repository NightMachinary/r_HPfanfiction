  I think of Cassandra Clare and her trilogy about Draco, which she took down I think after her books started coming out, and she reused the "original" parts of her fanfiction in her novels.

She took it down after there was a huge scandal regarding extensive plagiarism in the Draco Trilogy. Her published work came several years later. Last I checked, there weren't any good sources on the issue that weren't personally involved, but the biased account that I read was very persuasive and very damning.
