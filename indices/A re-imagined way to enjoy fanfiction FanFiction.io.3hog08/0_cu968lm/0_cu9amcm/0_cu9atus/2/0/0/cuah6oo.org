  unfortunately most of the information was via what seemed like angrily written blog posts.

Same here. I /did/ read the draco trilogy, however, and I recall noticing several odd shifts in tone and style, which in retrospect were shifts in source material, which made me more inclined to believe the angry bloggers.

Feel free to read it, it's not so bad, but I don't think it holds up to modern standards of quality. It drags on a bit, and many parts feel pointless. Some of the dialogue is witty and amusing, but much of that is lifted from other sources (as I recall, the author was open about copping Blackadder banter in the ANs, especially in the early chapters).
