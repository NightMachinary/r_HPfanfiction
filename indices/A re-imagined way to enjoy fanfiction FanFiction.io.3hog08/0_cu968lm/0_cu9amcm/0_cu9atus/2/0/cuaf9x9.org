It was the first example I thought of concerning a fic writer who then started publishing 'original' stories, though there are plenty of others who started writing professionally after writing fic. There's also EL James, though a drastically different fandom, who did pretty much the same. Can't delete things from the internet, but you can make things harder to obtain, to an extent.

I don't think I ever did read the Draco trilogy, but I did read about the plagiarism, unfortunately most of the information was via what seemed like angrily written blog posts. But that's part of why I put 'original' in quotes, as what I did read said that the MI series is just so similar to the fan fiction. I'm actually tempted to reread the series but picturing Draco instead- seems like it could end up being a little hilarious this time around.
