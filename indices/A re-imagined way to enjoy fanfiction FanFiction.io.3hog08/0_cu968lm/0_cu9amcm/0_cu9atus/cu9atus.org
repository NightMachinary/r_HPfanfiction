I think part of it is that if an author decides to delete their work, then they want to be able to delete their work. Yes, copies will exist because it's the internet, but having a download option readily available will only increase the number out there still.

There was that website shared here that archived a bunch of deleted stories, and some of these same authors had to contact them to have their stuff unlisted. Their stories were archived and shared without consent or even any prior contact.

I think of Cassandra Clare and her trilogy about Draco, which she took down I think after her books started coming out, and she reused the "original" parts of her fanfiction in her novels.

I'm someone who wants to be able to save fan fiction on my kindle, because I don't always have internet access (or /want/ to use it), but to me what an author wants/doesn't want regarding their work is more important.
