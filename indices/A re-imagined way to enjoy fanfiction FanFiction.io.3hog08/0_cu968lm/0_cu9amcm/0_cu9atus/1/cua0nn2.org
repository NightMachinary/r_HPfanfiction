This is different than download options being available while a fic posted publically. It's like the difference between reprinting copies of a book without the author/publisher's consent and obtaining a copy from an authorized printing.

People seem to think that stuff posted online is a lot more transient than it really is. You wouldn't expect to be able to retract copies of your work if you published it in any other media. Why would you expect to be able to do that online? When you post fanfiction publically you are de facto authorizing people to make copies of it. The simple act of loading the page makes a copy.
