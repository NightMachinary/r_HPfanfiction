What in your opinion makes this a different or better option than AO3, which as far as I know doesn't censor or charge either? Ad-free is a plus, but I've never noticed ads on AO3 either (though I'm a mobile reader, so that may play a role).

How will the interface be better or more intuitive for readers to find works to read? One problem I have with AO3 is the lack of standardized tags- two different tags for the same thing because authors can choose their own.

Will there be a plain non-animated version? Because I notice that right now, the site as it is has at least a small loading animation.

One function I encourage if able is a high contrast setting- set the background to black with white text. And if there are accounts, then have this setting in user preferences so that it's set to one or the other by default after changing it.

If there will be a filtering option, which I encourage as well, will there be an option to filter by 'warnings' and if so, will we be able to filter out multiple warnings? For example, no "major character death" plus no "self harm" instead of one or the other (I think fanfiction.mugglenet only let us filter one, but it was /forever/ since I've used that site so it could've been another one).

Best of luck and I look forward to seeing how this turns out.

Edit: wanted to add, I love the ability to download a story as mobi or epub, however some authors I follow on Tumblr absolutely do not want their works downloaded (control of their own work). If a downloading system is implemented, will there be a way for authors to opt their stories out of being downloaded? Along with a way to prevent sites that download stories off of FFN from doing so from your site?
