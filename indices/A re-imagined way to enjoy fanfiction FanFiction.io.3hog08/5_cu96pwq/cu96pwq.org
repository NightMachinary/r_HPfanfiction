I think the best way around the inconsistent tag problem would be to allow for users to elect and vote on tags. A tag that wasn't actually adventure and was actually more romance will eventually be tagged correct after enough users properly up vote/down vote.

I've heard of fics that are badly categorized getting lost. Only eventual word of mouth saved the day.

Also a good algorithm for finding fics. I.E. X amount of people who like this fic also like Y fic.

And being able to store favorite stories in separate lists.

Got to sleep but I'll think of more suggestions. I haven't seen your site yet since I'm in a rush but looking forward to it.

Alternatively if you need any volunteers I'm up for it. I'm a full-time full-stack developer but I'm up for projects.
