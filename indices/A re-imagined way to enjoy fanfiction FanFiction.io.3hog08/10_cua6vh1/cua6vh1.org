You mentioned the interface and layout on the press kit page. Maybe you could do a mock-up prototype of what a submitted fanfiction would look like on your site?

I would like users to have a way to change the background colour. I personally prefer dark background when I'm reading a story on the internet, but different people have different preferences.

I like the fluid layout so far where the text would adjust to the browser size.
