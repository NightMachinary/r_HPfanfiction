I'm not sure what you mean. The two I listed are my best examples. Relationships develop, but it is part of a larger plot that had more to do with changes in the magical world (non canon). For example, in The Pretense, Yaxley takes over following Voldemort and is even worse. In the process of trying to overthrow him, Hermione and Draco need to work together and end up together. But it's about 50% of the story. Does that make sense?
