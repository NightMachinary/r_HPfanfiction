The thing is, a Harmony couple possessive of each other with some Ron bashing correspond to like 80% of the stories featuring this ship. The only "usefull" info is the date, but ever there, Harmony was already a very popular ship in the early 2010's and there are tens of fic that correspond these criterias.
