You seriously think there are that many pair of Harmony romance themed one-shots, one from Harry's perspective, one from Hermione's? Because I can think of exactly one such pair of one-shots I came accross in the 19 years I have read HP fanfiction. The one linked in this thread. This request is more specific than 99% of the other "Whats that fic?" requests on this sub.
