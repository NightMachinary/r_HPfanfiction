I'm rereading Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(3766574), and a lot of the Pagan "Old Magics" that are part of the world concept in this fit the bill. There's definitely a lot of wonder and appreciating magic for its own sake, even if it's not the main focus of the story. It does become a big part of Harry's life starting in book 4, though.
