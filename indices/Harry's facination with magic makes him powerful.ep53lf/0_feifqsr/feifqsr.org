Victoria Potter linkao3(13795605) has fem!Harry engrossed in magical theory and it helps snap the practical aspect of magic into place. Hermione's excellent rote memorization isn't nearly as effective in comparison.

Fair warning: at this point in the fic Victoria and Hermione are academic rivals as well as House rivals. They are by no means friends and while I think this makes sense from Victoria's perspective, it may still come across as quite harsh towards Hermione's character.
