Is this the WBWL fic where he transfers to Durmstrang for reasons?

Because there's one of those that always intrigues me with the concept and first few chapters but loses me when the unchosen one disappears from the canon setting and ends up surrounded by OC's.

It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not my cup of tea.
