  Everyone thinks of him as the next Dumbledore or Merlin but he thinks everyone already knows this stuff. After all, most grew in the Magical World so they must know this right?

I mean, unless the fic is a bit cracky or Harry is somehow never interacting with anybody, I don't know how this misunderstanding would continue for any significant length of time. Other people would comment on his ability/knowledge and he would notice their lack of it.

If we ignore that part, this fic is quite a bit like it imo: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) - Harry has been fascinated with magic and learning more about it basically his entire life. He pursues it for its own sake. But it's blatantly obvious to himself and everyone around him that he's ridiculous good at magic for his age.
