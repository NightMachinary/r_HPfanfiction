How many times does someone have to go “gee Harry it's a little ridiculous how you can duel as well as Dumbledore at ~14” before it gets really old that Harry's like “Hurr what anyone can do that”. I'm not saying this trope doesn't exist or work in some cases, but OP is asking for a super!Harry (or close to) that doesn't realize they're special? I defy you to find a well written example.
