I don't think you can reasonably do what OP is asking for and have it be good writing - what you COULD do is have Harry be extremely powerful, humble, and not understanding why other people AREN'T as powerful when all it took was hard work. He would reasonably have to, at some point, acknowledge that he's more powerful than the vast majority of wizards. Unless of course it's written as beating the dead horse of Harry “I'm nothing special” Potter
