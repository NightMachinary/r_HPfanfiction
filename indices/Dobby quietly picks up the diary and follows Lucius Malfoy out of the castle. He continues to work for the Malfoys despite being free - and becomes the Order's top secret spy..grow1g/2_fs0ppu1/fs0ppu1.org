That's a really interesting concept, although Dobby is not exactly a discreet character known for his subterfuge skills xD

I think what you suggested would be too powerful of an "all-knowing-spy", but perhaps if Dobby doesn't realise he's a free elf until later, but is too scared to act on it except until later in the fic when it really means something. He could come to harry with a lifesaving piece of information, or just plain old rescue harry with the classic "Dobby is a FREE elf!" and apparate away with Harry.
