Y'all. The prophecy could totally be about Dobby.

#+begin_quote
  /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.../

  /born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies.../
#+end_quote

Consider this: what if Trelawney didn't say "born?" What if she said "/borne/?"

Dobby came (or /was borne/) to Harry on his birthday, which is of course the end of July. By that point, Harry has defied Voldemort three times: once as a baby, once in the Forbidden Forest, and once with the philosopher's stone.

#+begin_quote
  /and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal,/
#+end_quote

The sock -- a symbol of freedom, of humanity -- was delivered to him in what? That's right. Riddle's diary, which is basically the body of one of Voldemort's soul pieces. So, in a way, Dobby was given a /mark/ of being /equal/ by /the Dark Lord/.

#+begin_quote
  /but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.../
#+end_quote

Obviously, it's house elf magic. Or love, I guess, if you want to be sentimental. I'd say Harry's love totally qualifies.

#+begin_quote
  /and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.../
#+end_quote

In this premise, Dobby is stuck as the Malfoys' slave until Voldemort is defeated. He's the only one keeping Voldemort's attacks from succeeding. They're at a stalemate of misery until one of them goes.

#+begin_quote
  /the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be borne as the seventh month dies..../"
#+end_quote

I started this as a joke, but I'm convinced now. Dobby is the chosen one.
