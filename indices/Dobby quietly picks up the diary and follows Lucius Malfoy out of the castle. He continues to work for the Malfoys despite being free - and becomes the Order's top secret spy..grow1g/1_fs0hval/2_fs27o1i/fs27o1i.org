I'd think Dobby would consider the act of Voldemort's defeat to be Harry's, as the Chosen One ^{TM}.

It'd be great if dobby just sowed dissension in the ranks left, right, and center. Stealing this and blaming them, accidentally making sure everyone encounters their allergens, borrows biohazard from local hospitals and gets every death eater infected with a plethora of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Causes them to have violent outbursts in public, sets them up to lose money and business and everything they could contribute to the war. Borrowing pranks and such from the twins, Sirius, and Remus. Just silently and discretely making an absolute nuisance of himself and redirecting the blame everywhere like shit hitting a fan.

And in the end Harry strolls up ready for the fight of his life, but a majority of the Death Eaters give up and tell the courts everything, so long as they don't have to share a cell with Lucious cause he destroyed their family business, or Nott cause he killed their kneazel or Bellatrix because she always leaves her creepy magazines all over the common areas and everyone is sick of each other. And after all the chaos Dobby has sown, Voldemort really isn't able to give it his all and is defeated quickly.
