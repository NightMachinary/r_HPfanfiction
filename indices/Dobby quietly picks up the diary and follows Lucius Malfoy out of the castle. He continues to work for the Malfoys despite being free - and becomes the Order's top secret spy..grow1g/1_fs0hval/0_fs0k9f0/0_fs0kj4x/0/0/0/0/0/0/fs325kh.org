If they're paranoid, make one thing look like a trap while preparing a strike elsewhere. And if possible, make the diversion as easy to keep up as possible - a fort with no supplies is an opportunity let the enemy take the fort then starve them out. A weak fort would be good bait and a decent trap all in one - putting the enemy through a psychological battle before confronting them can be hugely beneficial.
