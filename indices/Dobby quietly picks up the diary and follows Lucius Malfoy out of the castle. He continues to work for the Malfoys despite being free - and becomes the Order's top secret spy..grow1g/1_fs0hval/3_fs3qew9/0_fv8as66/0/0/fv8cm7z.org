Yes but Dobby as Harrys hand is right in the middle of Voldemorts territory. Bellatrix or Pettigrew probably would not be able to integrate themselves to the order. Ginny however, is already in the middle of the Order territory.

Maybe a small piece of Diary Horcrux is stuck on her and takes over her when she goes to sleep. Weasleys assume she has a sleepwalking disorder and do nothing about it while remnant of the diary horcrux gathers inside information about the order.

But unlike Malfoys, who loathe dobby and force him to be a servant, effectively making his spying carrier easier, Weasleys love their daughter and dont allow her into the order meetings because they fear she might die in the war. Thus power he knows not.
