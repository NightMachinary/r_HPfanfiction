Ah, for story balance.

Hmm, I look at the other way. Voldemort basically controls all of Wizarding Britain. Harry and gang are the underdogs with an inside man.

So Voldemort has them surrounded and attacks from all sides. Harry etc can't really act openly and so are forced to act from a single point, which happens to be inside Voldemort's headquarters, and is “the most unlikely creature imaginable”, completely disregarded by pretty much everyone :)
