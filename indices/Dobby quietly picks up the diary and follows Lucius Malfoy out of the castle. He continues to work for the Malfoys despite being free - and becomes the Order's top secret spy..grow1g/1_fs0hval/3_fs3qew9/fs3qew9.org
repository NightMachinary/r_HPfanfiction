“die by the hand of the other”

One could interpret this as not a literal hand of the body but a figurative hand such as an agent.

If Dobby gives himself over to Harry and Harry's mission, and Harry becomes the handler for Dobby in the spy work, then Dobby could be seen as Harry's “hand” which kills Voldemort.
