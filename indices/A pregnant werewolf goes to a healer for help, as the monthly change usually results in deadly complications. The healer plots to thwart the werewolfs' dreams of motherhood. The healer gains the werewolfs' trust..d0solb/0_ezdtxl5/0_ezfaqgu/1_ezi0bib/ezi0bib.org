It's pretty good, but not incredible.

/Much/ better than The Vampire Diaries imo. It's spinoff, Legacies, is also good.

I don't think you need to watch The Vampire Diaries for either of those, though you'd likely be less attached to the characters than someone who had. Definitely watch The Originals and /then/ Legacies, though.
