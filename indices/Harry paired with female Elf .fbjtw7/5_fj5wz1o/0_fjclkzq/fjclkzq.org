It is extraordinarily shitty. Why in god's name do authors have to consistently make things weird, if only just on the other side of non-jarring? The first chapter of this has concepts and things that occupy some sort of uncanny valley, they don't entirely break disbelief but I had to look up and reflect on what I just read more than once.

Like, the first chapter has

Magical stasis. Alright, yeah, I can get behind that, it's probably a pocket realm that-

"It required us to be intimate the entire time"

Fucks sake. Why? Why this? Why make it weirdly sexual?

Or the whole thing where he keeps calling a partner "a mate". The fuck? That's not exactly a word all too applicable to humans.

I want to like this premise, but the constant weird sexuality is incredibly jarring and distracting. I don't know why so many fics are like that.
