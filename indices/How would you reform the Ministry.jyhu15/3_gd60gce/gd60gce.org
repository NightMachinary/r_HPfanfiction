If I was to reform it, the first step I would take would be to get rid of it. Wizards should not be contained by a mugglelish concept such as a government. Might makes right after all. And in this new era the only type of 'governing' power would be the wizards council. A council of the most powerful and influential witches and wizards.

There might not be laws against mass murder, sacrificial rituals and the like, but I do understand that the vast majority would be averse to such things. So in this case the most powerful of this country, if they so chose may perhaps band together to deal with this threat to the lesser magical.

Perhaps this is not the best form of 'government' if you were wanting a safe, civilized society of magical. But as I said earlier, might makes right, and in this magical Britain you either strive to gain magical might or you are suffocated by the power and ambition of those around you.
