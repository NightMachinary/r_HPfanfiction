The reason I choose the American system is because of the separation of powers. It's hard for the executive to interfere with the legislature or the courts. The UK system is similar to what we already have in canon. The Wizengamot is a mixature of a court and parliament mixed together, the UK used to have that not long ago, when the House of Lords was the supreme court.

Also, the Prime Minister of the UK is also heavily involved in Parliament. Similar to how fudge was involved in the business of the Wizengamot.

Basing it on the American system would stop incompetent, authoritarian leaders like Fudge from destroying the wizarding world. Their powers would be checked.
