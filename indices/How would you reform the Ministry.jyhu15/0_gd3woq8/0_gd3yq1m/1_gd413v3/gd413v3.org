That's a good point but the reason I argued for a more muggle like system was because it gave more power to the citizens. I don't think the the minister for magic elections take place every 4/5 years like they are in the muggle world. So that would be better because they could be replaced quickly if needed. That and the establishment of the local councils which basically sort out local problems and take them to the ministry if needed.

I dunno if I answered your question right. Sorry if i seem a bit ignorant.
