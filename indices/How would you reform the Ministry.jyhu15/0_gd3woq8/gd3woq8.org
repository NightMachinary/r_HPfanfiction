I don't think it would be a good idea to base it off the American system. I agree with what you said about removing the discriminatory laws and banning love potions tho

I'd introduce political parties like the Tories or labour or lib dems (but you know more useful) cos it would be what the muggleborn/halfblood population are used to. Basically have a system that mirrors Parliament with the house of lords and the house of commons. Maybe introduce laws that have a stricter penalties for things like bribery. Also introduce welfare. Idk if magical Britain has the NHS but introduce a system similar to that paid out of peoples taxes as well as stuff like pensions or benefits for poorer families.
