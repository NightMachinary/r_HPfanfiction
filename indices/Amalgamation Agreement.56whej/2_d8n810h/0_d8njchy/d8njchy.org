Actually the author is just a slow writer. The first chapter was written over a year ago and then there was nothing for a year until it got updated fairly recently with several chapters.

I wouldn't count on it being dead. Reluctant Champion got finished and Scattered War gets at least semi regular updates so it should be fine; just don't expect an update every week.
