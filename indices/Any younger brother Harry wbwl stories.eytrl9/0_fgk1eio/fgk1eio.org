Would it make literally any difference if Harry was the older or younger sibling to the wbwl? Most fic's with WBWL have Harry not raised with his family anyway, so I can't see it changing much.

I'm sorry for not knowing any fics like you want, but if you're just looking for a fic that deviates from the standard WBWL tropes, Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi is a good, albeit abandoned, fic.
