Well !Indy harry needs to get strong enough to kill Voldemort in the next chapter; so the 30 chapters after that can be dedicated to building !Indy's harem, and making people like Dumbledore, or Ron, look dumb and wrong. So I would say !Indy harry fuses with !Genius harry using a spell they found in book laying about on the ground of their vault. This forms !Super Harry, and then they fuse with Riddles horcrux. Going even further beyond, and transforming into !Super Harry 3.
