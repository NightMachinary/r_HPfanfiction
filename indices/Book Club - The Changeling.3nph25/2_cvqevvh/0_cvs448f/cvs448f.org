I think this fic is the only one in which I've really read and enjoyed the Quidditch games. I loath reading about matches, but something about the way they were written here really made me enjoy them... I'd be curious about why you think they were pretty bleh and rushed.

Otherwise, I agree with many of your comments, especially about the characterizations. I loved this author's Fleur too! I also really liked the interactions we got with Ginny and Harry... They felt pretty believable, and kinda filled a niche for me that I feel like canon may have missed the mark on a little bit.
