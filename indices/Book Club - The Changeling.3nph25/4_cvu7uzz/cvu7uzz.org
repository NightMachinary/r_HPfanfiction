Beautifully written and engaging, though the prose was a bit purple at times.

I especially liked the OC's, Smita and Tobias were both believable and it's nice to see another Indian character aside from the Patil twins, since the end of the British Empire there have been *a lot* of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and statistically, quite a few would be magical.

To be honest, I expected to see a lot more doubt and self-hate, especially in the earlier chapters, if you grew up in a household that frequently told you that Slytherins were evil, and you were sorted into that house, as an impressionable 11 year old, wouldn't you think you were evil by proxy?

All in all, thoroughly enjoyed this story, and I'm looking forward to it's conclusion!
