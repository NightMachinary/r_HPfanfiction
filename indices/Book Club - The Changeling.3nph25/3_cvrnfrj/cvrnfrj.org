Finally read this fic as it's been recommended several times, but I haven't had the chance to get around to it. Going with the questions from [[/u/lurkielurker]]...

1) Really enjoyed the characterization of the several Weasleys in regards to Ginny's house. I think each of them react accordingly in a way that fits their canon personality. The only thing I would say is that all of them travel the same arc (aside from Billl) from weariness to grudging acceptance of Ginny-in-Slytherin. I would have liked to see more contrast between the different Weasley family members

2) I don't necessarily think the elder boys were running from anything. It's a nice line, but it's mostly a throw away as Bill, Charlie, and Percy's motivations are never explored

3) The most obvious parallel would be that Ginny and Sirius are, in a way, ostracized from their own family. Sirius, through his beliefs, and Ginny for being in Slytherin. Unfortunately, none of these contrasts are expanded upon in the short amount of time Ginny and Sirius share scenes

4) In terms of being "good", canon-Hermione and Annerb-Ginny both flirt the line with doing what is right. The difference between them is that Hermione would have never allowed for the Gregor situation to occur while Ginny feels much more vindictive in that regard. The blurriness between doing what is right and what is good never gets challenged, however. I hope to see an opportunity where Ginny has to decide between her friendships in Slytherin and what the Order demands. Then, we will see whether Ginny is capable of doing what is "right"

5) It's impossible to extrapolate if her adaptability is something canon-Ginny can do because we don't actually know a lot about canon-Ginny. In the same way that Anerb-Ginny doesn't know a lot about the background of the trio, we don't know a lot about the background of canon-Ginny. I will say that the fic does an excellent job of exploring and progressing her character though.

6) I don't think the title refers to any magical ability. The Changeling refers to Ginny's transformation from the typical Gryffindor-Weasley to the more grey Slytherin-Weasley. Going back to point 4, she has to straddle the line between the loyalty for her family and the loyalty to Slytherin.

7) I am unsure of the relationship between Antonia, Ginny, and the Parlor in general. Thus far, it has proven to be a niche little club, but I struggle to see the overall purpose it serves to the story besides world-building. Why does Antonia want Ginny as her mentee? Is there a larger purpose in regards to who belongs to the Parlor? While it serves to give character Antonia, Ginny, and Hogwarts, I'm still struggling to see how it will effect the overall story.

8) Again - it is hard to compare and contrast with canon-Ginny as canon-Ginny is painted with very large strokes. I can say that the same abrasiveness to authority, wittiness, and loyalty to her friends exists with both Ginny's.

The fic is very well polished and has great structure. It is very rare to find a fic that is so well built and as a result, it never feels bloated or wastes our time.

The flip side of that coin is that the fic often feels like a breezy autobiography. Annerb avoids going into detail about the larger events of canon, but even in events that involve Ginny (the chamber, the department of mysteries, the death eaters sneaking into hogwarts), we are left to assume the events play out the same the way they did in canon. While I appreciate not having to rehash events we already know, the resulting effect is that the fic lacks a certain depth. No one wants to see so many words invested in writing about the battles or events we already know, but I want to care about Ginny more than just her attachment to Quidditch.
