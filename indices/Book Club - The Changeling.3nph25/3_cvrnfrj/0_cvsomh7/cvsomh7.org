  The flip side of that coin is that the fic often feels like a breezy autobiography. Annerb avoids going into detail about the larger events of canon, but even in events that involve Ginny (the chamber, the department of mysteries, the death eaters sneaking into hogwarts), we are left to assume the events play out the same the way they did in canon. While I appreciate not having to rehash events we already know, the resulting effect is that the fic lacks a certain depth.

I actually thought the way the author handled this gave us a really good picture of how the rest of Hogwarts understood Harry's school days to be. Reading the books through Harry's narrative definitely lets readers in to almost every plot point... whereas all students besides Ron and Hermione are super in the dark about what's happening. The Changeling seemed to tell the story how students on the fringes of the action behaved and responded to things like Voldemort's return. I thought it was an interesting take. The fact that the fic was well written certainly helped.
