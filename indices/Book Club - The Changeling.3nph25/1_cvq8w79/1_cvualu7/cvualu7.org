On your trope dissection in point 7 - The Parlor looks like a Misfit Mobilization Moment waiting to happen too (albeit not in the traditional sense where it's a ragtag bunch of misfits but a collective of people with socially frowned upon interests and ambitions). Though like you said, it just goes to show that tropes aren't all bad when used well.
