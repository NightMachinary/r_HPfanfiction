I quite liked it. A shame it's incomplete, but the way the author developed Ginny felt different and authentically Slytherin while remaining true to her character. Also, it's rare that an X-in-Slytherin fic handles Harry well as a secondary character, but I think this one did.

Re the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3nph25/book_club_the_changeling/cvq6hir][discussion questions]]: 1 & 2 -- An author can do a lot with the Weasleys once you get outside canon Harry's rose-tinted view of the family. (JOdel over at redHen for instance takes [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/weasleys.html][a particularly dim view of them]].) I liked the characterization here. It wasn't unthinking bashing, but it does reveal the how parochial the family can sometimes be. We also shouldn't discount how much family Molly lost to the Death Eaters in the ‘70s, a group she presumably associates with Slytherin house. Slytherins killed her brothers and in the wizarding world where blood matters and rule of law is a recent and somewhat flimsy innovation family takes on added importance.

The discussion of the tattoo in chapter 3 is a deft bit of writing; it concisely communicates why Molly might react so harshly to Ginny's tattoo in particular and to her sorting in general. It's also a quiet allusion to issues of women's control over their bodies and the sort of shaming that happens in real life when people are taken advantage of in ways like Ginny was. Gender commentary that doesn't overshadow the story, just deepens it. Well done.

3 -- The parallel with Sirius is, in hindsight, obvious and I'm glad it gets developed a bit. Who better to empathize with someone in an unexpected house, at odds with her family? His inclusion and subsequent death is also a useful narrative device to pull Harry and Ginny together.

4 -- I think the idea of being “good” for Ginny gets at why she ended up in Slytherin in the first place. She wants to excel, to be her own person. For all that her first couple years in Slytherin are filled with confusion I think the underlying motivation was there. This whole fic is in many ways an account of Ginny coming into her own as a character, not as a member of the Weasley clan or as an annex to Harry but as her own self. Slytherin ends up making her harder than canon Ginny might have been (at least before book 7) but the independent streak and ferocity are straight from canon, just channeled slightly differently and tempered with a bit more Slytherin cunning.

5 -- I think Ginny adjusts in this story because she has to. I think this is true to canon but not explicitly written in since we see so little of her life during book 7. From context, though, she seems to adjust to being an opposition leader at Hogwarts fairly well, again out of necessity.

6 -- Surely the title is mostly an allusion to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling][folklore concept of a changeling]]. The good Gryffindor Ginny was somehow switched with an evil Slytherin one; this is something she mentally wrestles with especially in the first few chapters but really throughout the story. Her anxiety about whether it is possible for her to be a Weasley at all, much less a “good” one is rooted in her insecurity about what her sorting means.

7 -- The Parlor is an agglomeration of tropes ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolClubsAreSeriousBusiness][1]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse][2]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser][3]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkOrSwimMentor][4]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain][5]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander][6]]) that could have been plot-breakingly bad and cliché, but actually manages to work well here. Dumping Ginny into Slytherin without any help at all would be too cruel, and given that this fic robs her of some of the role models she had in canon she definitely needs some new ones. I also like fics that widen the Potterverse a bit beyond what we saw through the Harry-filter in canon, where I always found it strange that the Hogwarts upperclassmen play so little a role. We only ever even learn the names of a handful. Reasonable perhaps that the rather withdrawn harry doesn't venture outside of his circle of close friends much, but surely Hermione might have sought out some tutoring, or someone in Harry's year might have had an older sibling besides the Weasleys? Outside of Cedric, a quick mention in the DA in book five, and quidditch we barely meet any older students. A house as status-obsessed as Slytherin is also a natural fit for this sort of informal club, and the mention of the darker home life of many Slytherin students feels authentic and is another facet canon didn't explore much.

8 -- Her ferocity, her independent streak, her alternating love of and exasperation with family, her attraction to Potter (though spun a slightly different way in this fic), her strong leadership potential.
