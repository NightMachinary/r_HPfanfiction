The Changling aside, really intriguing read over at Red Hen. We as a sub should do a Weasley family discussion post. I don't know that I necessarily agree with everything written, but it was a fascinating delving into the workings of the Weasleys...

I have to say, I didn't realize the idea of "The Parlor" or some such club was such a pervasive thing in fiction. Looking back, I'm really glad that the idea of it does work well, because I felt that Ginny's interactions with the Parlor girls was a cool mysterious element of the story. I think one of my favorite scenes was Ginny realizing that Smita didn't /need/ the group the way the other girls did; I feel like it make Ginny stop taking her cool girl's club for granted... Almost a turning point of her relationship with the group, if you will.
