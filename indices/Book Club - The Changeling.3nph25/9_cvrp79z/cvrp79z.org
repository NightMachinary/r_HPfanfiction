I didn't like fic for the first few chapters but then I fell in love with it. I'm a sucker for cool oc personas. Antonia is definitely cool. But the best thing about this fic is the growth of Ginny as a character. Ginny's trials and obstacles are great. I usually hate Ginny centric fics but this one was fantastic. Here's hoping for a miracle finish.
