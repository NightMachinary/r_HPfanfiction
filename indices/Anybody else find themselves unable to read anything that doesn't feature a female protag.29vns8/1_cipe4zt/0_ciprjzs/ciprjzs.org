  Oh, but the author isn't sexist: they gave Hermione a magic sword. Not as nice as Harry's, of course, and she only really brings it out to help him and not for any of her own goals or objectives. Hell, she hardly talks in the story unless it is to talk about Harry, and they're attached by the hip and never leave one-another's side.

Assuming that we are both thinking about a fic with an avian title, the really sad thing is that the author, in all evidence, actually thinks very, very well of Hermione. With friends like that...
