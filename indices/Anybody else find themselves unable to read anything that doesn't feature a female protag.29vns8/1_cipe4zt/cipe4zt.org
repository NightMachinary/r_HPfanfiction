I think the fact that the worst fics out there have annoying, shallow, sexist male protagonists might help tilt my opinion in this direction. Likewise, some of the best stories I've ever read had a female Harry or OC. But I think it is far more critical to have well-written, plot important, and self-motivated female characters overall than have the protagonist be female.

Far too often, a story has a strong male Harry and wallpaper female characters. Oh, but the author isn't sexist: they gave Hermione a magic sword. Not as nice as Harry's, of course, and she only really brings it out to help him and not for any of her own goals or objectives. Hell, she hardly talks in the story unless it is to talk about Harry, and they're attached by the hip and never leave one-another's side.

Yeah. That's the shit I'm talking about.

Those sorts of characterizations for females get boring fast. As stories with strong female protagonists can't help but have more focus on well-explored motivations for female characters, I think that makes them more interesting. The author there has at least thought about what half of the population of the world has going on in their own heads and the objectives they have. In those stories, at least one person without a penis can have adventures and lead exciting lives of their own volition, without having to be dragged from place to place by Harry, or rescued by Harry, or magically bound to Harry's every whim, or...
