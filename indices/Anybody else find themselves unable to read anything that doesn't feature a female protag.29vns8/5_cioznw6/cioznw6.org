Not that I can tell, there's going to be good and bad stories regardless of who the protagonist is and I haven't noticed a quality difference of the good stories that feature a female protagonist vs good stories that feature a male protagonist. Maybe you can portray yourself as the main character in a female protagonist fic better?
