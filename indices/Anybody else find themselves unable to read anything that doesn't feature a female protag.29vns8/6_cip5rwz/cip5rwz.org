I don't have a problem with male protagonists. I have a problem with female supporting characters when there's a male protagonist. I understand that, when you're dating Harry Potter, his needs will rate rather highly in your priorities -- he has trouble surviving most years -- but there's a fair bit of downtime.

/The Lie I've Lived/ has a fair treatment of both Hermione (she's interested in helping Harry, but academics and the academic portions of the Tournament take up most of her time) and Fleur (she's interested in Harry but has the Tournament and her own broom racing career as priorities and is looking for someone who's willing to follow along during her career). I can't hold that up as a shining example for reasons obvious to anyone who's read it.
