I don't really; if the fic is well written then it doesn't matter who the protagonist is. However, I will be more inclined to find female protagonist-fics simply because I associate with them more (I'm female).

So it's not that they're better written, I just connect better to female characters. Especially Hermione, who is a lot like me. However, what matters most is how it's written.
