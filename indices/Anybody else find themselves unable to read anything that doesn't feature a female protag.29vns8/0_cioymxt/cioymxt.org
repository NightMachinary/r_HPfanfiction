I don't have that problem - I have a problem with the smugness the most common male protagonist exhibit in certain cases. Specifically, this is common with James Potter, Sirius Black, Draco and Lucius Malfoy, and most of all, super!Harry. Most writers have those characters so busy patting themselves on the back so much it makes me ill.

I'm not saying they're all badly written or that I can't read any of them... but it gets so annoying in 90% of those stories that I just won't pick up a random super!Harry story unless people give me ridiculous levels of assurance.
