I know a fic where Harry and Ron are in Slytherin and friends with Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini. They bully Hermione and her only friend is Neville. The endgame pairing is Dramione. I haven't read it yet so I have no idea if it's good or not but I think it's on my list. If this sounds like something you might like I can dig it up for you. Let me know :)
