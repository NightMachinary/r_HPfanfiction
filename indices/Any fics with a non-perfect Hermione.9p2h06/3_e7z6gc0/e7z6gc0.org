Many fics have her making cameo appearances, and she barely knew Harry in them. If you are interested in those types of stories, I have some for you:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), has a Hermione who was a fairly low level Ministry employee without many friends. She was not close to both Harry and Sirius, and went only with them on a couple adventures.

[[https://m.fan%20fiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is a dark war epic in which James and Lily survived Halloween 1981, and Harry never went to Hogwarts as the result. Hermione would make several appearances, but her role in this fic was far less important than Neville, Ginny, and Astoria Greengrass.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9885609/1/][Find a Place to Call Home]], linkffn(9885609), is a rare Harry/Astoria fic, In this fic, Hermione also abandoned Harry because of the TWT, and only Astoria took pity in him. Together, they ran away and had a much better time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116), is another â€˜Harry never gone to Hogwarts' and mostly deals with Harry and Ginny's postwar adventures. Hermione turned up once in a meeting with Ginny.
