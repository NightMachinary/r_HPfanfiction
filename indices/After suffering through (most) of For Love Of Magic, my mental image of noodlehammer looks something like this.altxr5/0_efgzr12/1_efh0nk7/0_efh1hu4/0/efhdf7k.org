Of course you are not intentionally providing them the funds for the act. However, there are still moral objections one might personally have. I don't go to Chick-fil-a because I know my money would go to anti-gay groups for example.

This reminds me of the mechanic thing. I don't care if mechanic cheats on his wife as long as he provides the service I bought, but that's because I don't particularly find lying to be in the same category as molestation or depriving someone of human rights. It's a grey area that I haven't full explored therefore I don't extend my mere provisional beliefs to the point of judgement of others.
