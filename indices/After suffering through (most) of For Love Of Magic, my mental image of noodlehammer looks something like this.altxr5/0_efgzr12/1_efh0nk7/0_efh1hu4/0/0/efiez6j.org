  But if the boss knows that this is a distinct possibility, or even a certainty, he has a right to no longer provide them funds or dire them in this case.

I think I see what you're saying better, though I'm not sure I agree. And regardless, I still think Lovecraft isn't a good example. 'far as I know he never actually went out and committed hate crimes or anything, he just got upset at foreigners in letters and newspaper articles. You may or may not find it morally reprehensible but I think just /writing/ about your arguably-wicked opinions (mostly to an audience of other people who share them) should be in the same category as "cheating on your wife", not "molesting children".
