I kinda disagree there. You're not giving them money /for/ molesting children/being a ranting xenophobe/whatever. You're giving them the money they earned by writing this book, or, in the Church's case, the money you think they earn by doing God's work. If the recipient of that money uses it to support their wicked activities rather than fuel those activities for which you commend them, the blame's on them, not you.

In the meantime, good work should be recompensed whatever the author's other crimes/objectionable values/etc., much like, to pick an utterly random example, a gardener who did 100 pounds' worth of gardening for you still deserves his 100 pounds even if you /know/ with 90 percent certainty he's going to be losing them because of his gambling problem.

Starting to decide not to pay people for their work because you object to the way they're likely to spend that pay is the slipperiest slope that ever slipped and gets you mentality of the sort Charles Dickens spent most of his career denouncing.
