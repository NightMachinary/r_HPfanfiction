It's been a decent amount of time since I've read it, but there are indeeds segments of the story that can be considered bigoted. Mein Kampf contains bigoted text. A history book on Nazi Germany will contain bigoted text as well. I do not speak for the author in any way, but I am against assuming that the views of the characters within the story represent the views of the author even ignoring my position against assumptions. If I recall, he even said as much in an author's note on the topic of Harry's views on religion. Could it be that was merely an excuse? Possibly, but I do not know this author personally.

As a side note, I definitely did not read the story with Harry as a good guy. He was the protagonist. He was morally grey and then he crept into morally dark areas. J.K. Rowling likelu doesn't support children going into war, but she had her characters do it for example.
