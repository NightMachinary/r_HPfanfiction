Regardless of that, the text is still a bigoted, hypocritical mess.

Even with "Death of the Author", the narrative seemingly condones cruel genocide by burning people alive, while morally judging the Weasleys for standing in Harry's way.

While their actions of course were not pure, it pales in comparison to Harry's abhorrent behavior. The Muggles that are killed are, by and large, innocent victims, and yet Harry is the good guy.

I didn't like it.
