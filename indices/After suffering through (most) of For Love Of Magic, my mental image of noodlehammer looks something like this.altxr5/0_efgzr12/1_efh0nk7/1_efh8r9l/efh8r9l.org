That's not what "Death of the Author" means, but whatever.

"Death of the Author" was a concept for literary analysis. At the time of its invention, the more or less usual way to analyze a text was heavily tied into analysing the state of mind of the author, and their intentions.

"Death of the Author" is the antithesis to that, stating that it doesn't matter what the author thought when writing something, as it matters what is received.

It is but a framework to look at the text, not a fucking way of life.
