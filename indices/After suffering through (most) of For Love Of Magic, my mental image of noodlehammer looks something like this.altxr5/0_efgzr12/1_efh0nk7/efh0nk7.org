Death of the Author. I don't care if Stalin and Mao had a sleepover to write my favorite book. If the book is good, then it's good.

Whether you think financially supporting those authors by buying the book is a different question. To get extremely political, I go with every Catholic who still gives the Catholic Church money is willingly supporting child molestation. I am forced to follow that same standard myself even if I really like the book, so I would say it is immoral.
