Because people love it. In my experience, reader's love a good power wank. I love one too. That doesn't make it a good story though. It's enjoyability and quality are independent. I think the reason it is constantly brought up is because they get upset with how the author basically says "It's my damn story, it'll be how I want it to be." And people don't like injustice. It's frustrates them that there is something wrong, and that they can't do anything about it.

My biggest issue with the author of "For the Love of Magic" was the way the author left author's notes. They are almost always useless regardless of the author. If you are explaining a detail of the story, then you should be able to explain it inside the story. If you are saying how grateful you are, then I hope it's two sentences max with it only occuring maybe twice. But hey, it's not my story.
