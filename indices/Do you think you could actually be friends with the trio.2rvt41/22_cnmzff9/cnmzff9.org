If I were in Gryffindor and the same year as the Trio, I think I'd be on friendly terms with them and would possibly spend time with Hermione one-on-one, but I don't think I'd be any closer to them than the other Gryffindors. The trio has a very "fire-forged" friendship that would be hard to get into without extreme events. I think I'd feel isolated if they were always hiding secrets from me and I hate feeling left out.

At 11 I was really smart (but didnt realize it, so I didnt have the cocky attitude I later developed), very nice and generally wanted to be friends with everyone. I always had plenty of friends, but no one "best friend". I was probably like a female Neville, only I didn't have the problems in class.
