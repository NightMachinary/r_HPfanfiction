I think I could be great friends with Hermione we both love reading, learning, and I was always a teachers pet growing up. I dont think Id get along with Ron that well. I think Id be to shy to even have a conversation with Harry, Id probably have a huge crush on him to. Ive always liked guys with glasses. If I could though I think we would be acquaintances who talk occasionally. In all honesty though Id probably hang out with Neville and Id probably have a crush on him (I also like nerdy sensitive guys.) Id probably be picked on a lot, and wouldnt stand up for myself until I got older around 16.
