I'm going to assume I'd go to Gryffindor since, honestly, that's probably where I would actually go. Gives me a much better start off, no matter what I'll at least be a casual acquaintance to them all.

Seeing a lot of Ron hate on here and I don't know why. Ron would probably be the easiest to become friends with for me. He's a very normal kid, likes Quidditch which I would probably play since I'm an athletic guy and there aren't exactly other choices, (but no getting on the House team until fourth or fifth year because the whole team is stacked to all hell unless I'm some Chaser prodigy), and is pretty laid back if you are a casual friend (basically unless you're Harry and Hermoine you don't really see him blow up or do the really stupid shit much).

Friend rating: Bro

Hermoine I'd probably just kind of coexist with. I'm pretty book smart but not nearly dedicated enough to really jive well with her or suffer through being her study buddy. Probably get along alright with being the only Gryffindor to understand some of what she's talking about, but nothing more than a class/housemate. I'd beat the shit out of her in History of Magic though which might tick her off.

Friend rating: Friendly Acquaintance - Friendly Rivalry

Harry: Unless some freak accident pushed us into becoming friends by circumstance early on I'd probably barely know him (which is exactly what happened with my actual best friend so it could happen). Probably would think he's just an alright quiet kid until he starts winning House Cups and speaking Parseltongue and shit. Might try to get to know him better once I realized that he was one of those people that shit revolved around.

Friend rating: Acquaintance - Sorta Friend

Now overall within I'd probably get along really well with Lee Jordan and the Weasely twins, probably not good friends until the later years though. I'd probably beg Wood relentlessly for a spot on the team and annoy the shit out of him. I'd get along best with the more fun Ravenclaws. I'd probably be on okay terms with most of the Puffs, Slytherins depend on if we're going canon or realistic, canon = ignoring some of them and fucking enemies to the death with a few, realistic = probably good friends with one or two, ignore the rest
