I'm an arrogant prick too but I'm not a complete asshole. If canon Malfoy is an accurate representation of what going to school with him would be like I doubt I could be even sorta friends with him unless I was either a pureblood or in Slytherin. And even then I'd probably be pretty put off by his dickisheness. If I was in Slytherin I'd probably be in his wider circle of friends though.
