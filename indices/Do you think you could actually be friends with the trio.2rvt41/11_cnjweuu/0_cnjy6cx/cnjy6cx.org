Hagrid, yes cos I reckon he's got some stories to tell and I love animals.

Sirius though...not a chance. There's so much about him that's off putting as an adult that as a kid I don't think I could stand it. Same with the twins, something about them instinctual turns me off.

Too me Arthur would be that guy that you start a conversation with and end up in his shed as he shows you something your really not all that interested in. Nice guy to have over for dinner but not exactly a friend.
