I probably wouldn't at first, but I'd definitely try /hard/. Being friends with the people that have made saving their classmates from unspeakable evil a routine just sounds like common sense to me. That and, well, let's be honest here, they kinda need more contact with people outside of their little clique.

Which I would be happy to provide. Especially if it means punching assholes in the nuts and getting the low-down on Death Eaters vs Artillery-who wins?

The only downside is that I wouldn't last long at all in the magical world. It's one of the things that plagues me when considering whether to write an SI or not.

I currently evaluate my lifespan in canon HP at roughly twelve to eighteen months with it devolving to roughly fifteen seconds should I find myself face to face with the threat of the week. The large gap in estimates is largely due to several factors; starting point (muggleborn? Pureblood? Half-blood? They all have different benefits & drawbacks that make them attractive), funding and date of entry into Hogwarts would all contribute towards the length of time that I have at my disposal and/or the degree of effort I'd need to exert to endear myself with the trio.

For example, given that I was born in the mid-eighties, my entry point into the HP world, changing neither canon nor my age, would put me as a first year when the triwiz swings around. If I am a muggleborn, that effectively means that I have two and a half years to live before Umbridge sends me to the prison-turned-concentration-camp at Azkaban.

If I am in Slytherin to boot, my survival largely depends on what benefactors I can con into keeping me safe during the school year, otherwise I'll either have to pull a Riddle very /very/ quickly or I won't live to see Halloween.

This is the current me. My teenage self wouldn't survive the week in Slytherin.

But the biggest problem, and the reason for which I'd do my best to try and endear myself with the Trio and their support staff ASAP, is the vast amount of stuff Rowling had to gloss over in canon.

For example, what actually happens to muggleborn during their initiation tour? How extensive is the Ministry's surveillance net? What intelligence organizations in the muggle world have a foothold in the magical one-and don't tell me they don't exist, given just how extensive the SigInt agencies' powers were even during the eighties. What types of magical crime are there and to what degree do they prey on students and/or the muggleraised?

If you're an SI in a world as volatile as the HP one, your primary and overarching concern is survival. Righting wrongs and derailing plot points are secondary to your ability to come through such adventures with a beating heart and an optimal number of attached limbs. The Trio's friendship goes a long way towards taking care of that problem. Gaining intelligence and support from others does the same too. But, above all else, you /have/ to leverage what you learned prior to becoming an SI. For me, it's how modern businesses and computer systems work, a literally invaluable tool for making money when combined with magic. For others, it may be soldiering, martial arts, chemistry, maths, physics-hell, an electrician or a plumber could, with some creative application, turn the magical world upside down.

All these are good ways for an SI to survive.

And well, let's be honest. The Golden Trio is a bunch of teenagers who end up out of their depth so often they need scuba diving equipment. The farther along the timeline the SI appears, the harder it will be for them to make friends. And their personalities aside, it's their history and mutual reliance on each other that makes them so damn hard to befriend. However, should your SI prove itself capable enough and stubborn enough, then he or she has a decent chance of not-dying, though surviving the experience as a fully functional human being until the end of it is still not a given.

Because the Trio /never/ gave up on their friends.
