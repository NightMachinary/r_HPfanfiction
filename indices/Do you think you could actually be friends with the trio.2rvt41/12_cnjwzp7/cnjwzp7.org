To be honest, I probably would get along with them...even if we weren't good friends. I'm a really easy going and cheerful person, and I rarely ever get into arguments. Probably the best part of my personality. I'm a Gryffindor with strong Hufflepuff characteristics.

Whether I would particularly ENJOY that friendship is another question. I make it a point to be nice and friendly to everyone, and because I'm a good listener (I work in the field of psychology), the relationships always tend to be a little one-sided against me. I can imagine that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would only hang out with me when they were mad at each other and needed to rant. And stupid me would just sit there and listen and smile until they were ready to go back to their real friends. If I had to pick someone from the trio to hang out with, it'd probably be Ron for his humor (closely followed by Harry's self-deprecating humor). I don't think I would like Hermione very much, but I would never say it to her face of course.

Unless I were to write a dramatic romance story (my husband is an obvious Slytherin), I don't think I would make a very interesting character to insert into the world of Harry Potter. Maybe a strong minor character.
