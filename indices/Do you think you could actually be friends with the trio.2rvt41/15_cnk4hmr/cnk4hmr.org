Even though I was pretty friendly and outgoing at that age despite also being an awkward bookworm. I probably would have gotten fine along with Hermione since we share some mutual interests. I think I would have gotten along with Ron too because he seemed so laidback. Harry seemed to be too introverted at that age and I would probably not have taken the time to get to know him.

Honestly I would have been sorted into Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw so I wouldn't have really interacted with him
