I think a lot of +who I am+ how I look at the world would lose a lot of meaning if I found myself in a world where magic was +real+ demonstrably and obviously real, so who's to say, but given my experiences in high school I'd probably be that Ravenclaw who is on friendly terms with /almost/ everyone but mostly keeps to a small group of people who all play... well whatever wizards do for fun when DnD becomes real life.

If I fall in knowing what I know now, I'd be super paranoid about ruining everything and may decide to avoid them. Not to mention being friends with 11 year-old kids at my age is mostly an exercise in exasperated patience. If it was me as an eleven year old, or knowing nothing of whats to come, I'd probably only vaguely be aware of the trio's existence in the "oh those guys that flew the car into the tree! I played chess with the red head a few times over hols" sort of way.

Hermione and I would either get along or not depending on how well she took to being wound up so I could watch the fireworks. I poke fun at everything.
