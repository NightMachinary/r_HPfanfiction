Well, there's the obvious point that at present I view 'magic' as applied misdirection and subterfuge. There is no real magic, and anything that appears to be such is simply something I haven't figured out yet or that I'm not seeing the whole of. This mentality breaks down rather rapidly when magic IS real and is in fact the simplest explanation for a lot of things. It's like being an atheist in DnD, taking the viewpoint that there is no God(s) makes far less sense when you can actually go talk to one and get tangible responses. Removing that foundation from my world at 11 would produce a very different me.

Also, HOLY &^{/%&/^{%!!!}} I CAN DO MAGIC!? I'm not sure that /people/ would register as relevant to me after that discovery. <edit> ...Though it occurs to me that I might bond with any of the muggleborn (which would include possibly Hermione) over trying to SCIENCE ALL THE MAGICS!
