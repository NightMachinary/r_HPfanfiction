I think I'd get along with Hermione, as long as we weren't best friends. More likely to be best friends with Neville, if I'm placed with the trio, or a complete loner, if I'm put in Slytherin like I want to be. I think it would be awesome to have Hermione spewing off random facts about magic all day, as long as I didn't have to be there when she told me I couldn't try to break Gamp's Law just because it's called a law and the book says. She'd be great for motivation to study, though. I really hated canon Harry, and I was never fond of Ron, either. Would totally idolise Draco for being pretty, though.
