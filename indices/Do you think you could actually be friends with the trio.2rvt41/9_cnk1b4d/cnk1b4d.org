I'd probably have been sorted into Ravenclaw or Slytherin, which would have given me little opportunity to befriend the trio.

Hermione and I would have butted heads terribly. I was very much a "quietly shatter the curve" student in the day, never feeling the need to rub other people's faces in my competence--right up until they pissed me off (as her antics would have, inevitably). I never had any patience for flashy, know-it-all personalities and probably would have made it my mission to crush her academically (which I would have, and which she wouldn't have been able to accept).

Ron and I would have been cool. We could have bonded over chess (a passion of mine in the day) and dislike for Hermione's overbearing nattering. He was generally pretty laid back, aside from a few teenage moments, which we could have overlooked. I think we would have gotten on fine. His twin brothers would have pissed me off though (I hate bullying).

Harry probably wouldn't have been more than an acquaintance. He seemed a classic introvert who didn't seek to connect with those outside a fairly narrow circle and I didn't have it in me then to befriend those who didn't care.

Incidentally, I dated someone as vain and vapid as Lavender for about three years (she even matched Lav's physical descriptions), showing that for teens there's no accounting for taste once the relationship progresses to a point where it's sufficiently physical.
