I think I would have been on friendly terms with Hermione. We'd be occasional study buddies, competent lab partners, but not much socialization outside of class - maybe grab coffee every once in awhile.

I had a thing for gingers in high school, so I might have had a brief crush on Ron. We wouldn't have been friends though. I would've hated his attitude towards academics.

Harry and I would probably just be acquaintances. I think that I'd have joined the DA, and that would probably be the greatest extent of our interaction.
