Hmm... I think not really.

Hermione... I think I'd appreciate her intellect. But her bossiness, pushiness, and authority worship I couldn't stand.I could deal with the last one, but the first too... not so much.

Ron... No. I don't think so. He's just too jealous, not smart, lazy, obsessed with a sport I strongly dislike, etc.

Harry... I'd like to say yes, but I'm pretty certain his self-sacrificing hero complex would get to me sooner or later. Probably by the end of first year.
