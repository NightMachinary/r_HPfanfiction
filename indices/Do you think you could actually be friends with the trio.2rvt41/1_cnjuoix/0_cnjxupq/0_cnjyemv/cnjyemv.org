I was pretty counterculture in high school, so I'd play at being totally unimpressed with their popularity, drama, and infamy. At best, I'd be some quiet person that got good grades nobody knew about. At worst, I'd probably be a swot like Zacharias Smith who was obnoxious for the sake of being obnoxious, just because everyone else was enthralled by their every move.
