That hit home a bit. Looking back on my highschool years I hung out with a lot of the awkward outcasts (like I wasnt one of them lol). However is was mostly because I could look at them knowing I wasn't as bad as they were (which is terrible really) but I got some awesome, kind and slightly crazy friends out of it. So yeah 11-15 year old me would probably gravitate towards Neville. Luna would probably be too much though. I would probably feast on the trio drama though and would be why I would end up befriend Ron (get that insider story).
