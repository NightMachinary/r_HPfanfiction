Probably not. I'd find Harry and Ron's athleticism and academic underachieving boring and uninteresting, and Hermione's straight-laced teacher's pet attitude obnoxious. At 11, I would have been friends with awkward loners and bully-magnets like Neville or Luna, because that's who I was too. By the time I graduated, I would have been with the most academic over-achievers in the most extracurriculars possible. Which is probably the only time I would have found myself in the same circles as Harry or Hermione, but not so much Ron. I'd still prefer to hang out with the nicest people possible, which means I'd probably be friends with people like Ginny or Neville, and stay away from the trio and their drama.
