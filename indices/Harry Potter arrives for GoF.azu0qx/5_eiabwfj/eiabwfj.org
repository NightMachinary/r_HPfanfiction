Harry potter: the chaotic wizard.

Harry Potter, age ten, made a wish...

He wished that he could go to a place where he could do all of his magic whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and the wish came true...

A few years later in Earth time, he has returned and found himself back in the hands of one Albus Dumbledore, who wanted to use him as a Weapon against Voldemort. But Harry is not happy, since his 2 thousand year life vacation was interrupted...

He is now Discord, The Spirit Of Chaos & Disharmony, and he is gonna have a FUN time with this...
