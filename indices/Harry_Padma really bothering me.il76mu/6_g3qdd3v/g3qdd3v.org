Might be linkffn(3933832) - Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage.

I think it is Harry/Padma, and it was nice but I remember it dying shortly after Padma cheats on Harry with random guy her dad invited to their home might have been a mind-whammie... but that story beat really annoyed me to the point of me ending up not liking the fic retroactively^{which is what really annoys me tbh}.

and now it's dead or dormant, and no resolution provided -.-'
