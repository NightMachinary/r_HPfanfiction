Please post if you do find it. It's now irritating at my mind as well. I know I've read it, because I remember the Padma scene exactly, but I can't find it either.

If you remember any specific phrases, try a google search for it. In case you don't know: Put your phrase in speech marks "Slytherin representative" and finish your search with 'site:fanfiction.net/s/' or 'site:archiveofourown.org/works/' sans quotation marks to get only links to actual stories on those sites with that exact phrasing. Anything outside the speech marks will be searched for too, but it won't look for that exact phrase.

So, you could write:

harry padma date bad muggle interesting "slytherin representative" site:fanfiction.net/s/

and get story pages on FFnet with the phrase 'slytherin representative' and as many of the other terms as possible. I haven't found much, but maybe you'll have better luck than I. :)
