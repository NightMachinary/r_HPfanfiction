Where I am, Communism is considered to be the extreme left of the spectrum, and Nazism the extreme right.

Whether that's academically accurate or not, I can't say.

But to answer you question, no - I'm not anywhere near agreeing with anything with 'Nazi' in it.

My other answer would be: Don't read too much into it - it was a joke about how political discussions turn out on the internet.
