Wait a second...given that the 'war communism' implemented in the USSR, and the fascism implemented by the Nazis, were both extremely authoritarian to the point of totalitarianism (that is to say, advocating complete control by the state), wouldn't that mean that if the Commies are on your left and the Nazis are on your right, that you yourself are way over to the far-right with the neo-Nazis?
