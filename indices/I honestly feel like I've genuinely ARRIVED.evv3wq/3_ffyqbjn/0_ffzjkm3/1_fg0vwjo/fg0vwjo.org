  wouldn't that mean that if the Commies are on your left and the Nazis are on your right, that you yourself are way over to the far-right with the neo-Nazis?

That's not the way it works.

Communists and Nazis are on opposite sides of the left / right political spectrum.

The political spectrum however isn't only made up of a left / right axis, there is also an upper and lower axis, which would be authoritarian / democratic.
