*Political spectrum*

A political spectrum is a system to characterize and classify different political positions in relation to one another upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensions. The expressions political compass and political map are used to refer to the political spectrum as well, especially to popular two-dimensional models of it.Most long-standing spectra include the left--right dimension, which originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789--1799), with radicals on the left and aristocrats on the right. While communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, conservatism and fascism are regarded internationally as being on the right. Liberalism can mean different things in different contexts: sometimes on the left (social liberalism), sometimes on the right (classical liberalism).
