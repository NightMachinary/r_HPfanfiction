This one was fully signed in and everything. (Profile is ... interesting. I shall say no more than that.) The only anon review I've had that hasn't been positive was a copy-pasted excerpt from the definition of a particular SM kink. Which, fine, but there are designated places for that sort of thing and the reviews column of an unrelated fanfic isn't one of them. Kooks gonna kook, though, I reckon.
