Harry cleared his throat.\\
"Inventory. Character. Menu. Options. Equipment. Statistics."\\
No heads-up-display popped up in front of his eyes. Gamer fic was out.\\
"As slayer of the dark lord Voldemort, I claim Right of Conquest over the line of Slytherin!"\\
He waited. No surge of magical power, no swarm of owls to tell him of his inheritances.\\
Harry wobbled his jaw and started to cry, "Woe is me, I'm so abused. I wish I had a family...~sniffle~"\\
No cars pulling up with foster parents, no accidental magic warping him to another dimension.

Harry frowned. This fic might be tricky to work out.
