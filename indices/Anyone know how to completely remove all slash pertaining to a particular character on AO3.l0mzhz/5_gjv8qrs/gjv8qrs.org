The problem is that as far as I know, AO3 has at least 3 "Voldemort as a character" entries, and it also counts AxB and BxA separately. That means you've got to block a lot of tags... And that is just for those that ARE tagged, because a fair few spring those on the reader 5 chapters in and with no warning.
