Yeah ik, that was just an example. The thing is that having six filters in my search is a lot less cluttered than twelve, and I could also use it with other characters. (It jut weirds me out, for example, when Snape is in a romantic relationship with /anyone/, and I could also use the opportunity to shut down all those "character x reader" stories.)

Tbh, if I had any hope for it, I'd ask for a way for Ron/Hermione to always be the case /if they just so happen to be in the story/. That's how ridiculously specific I am about my tags.

But seriously, there should be a button for "people you want to see in relationships" on AO3.
