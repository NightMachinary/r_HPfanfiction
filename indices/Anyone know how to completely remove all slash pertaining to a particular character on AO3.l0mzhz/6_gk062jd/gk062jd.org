This maybe pc only(not attempted mobile) but I believe using "ao3 savior" you can block by using voldemort/* to block out any fic with him in any relationship. Idk how, or if, you can do just slash.

It's been awhile since I configured mine, and I'm not near my pc, so I'm not 100% sure but I think I have somethings blocked out this way.
