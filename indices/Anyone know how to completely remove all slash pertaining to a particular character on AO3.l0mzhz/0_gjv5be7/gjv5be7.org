The best method is unfortunately just blocking the pairings or checking your pairings. Honestly you shouldn't really have that big a list. One you block all the big ones Drarry, snarry, tomarry, Wolfstar, the rest of the slash doesn't really pop up.

Also if you're looking for het slash shouldn't pop up unless it's Ginny/Harry, or Ron/Hermione simply cause those pairings get used as background or plot to the slash stories . Once you've checked the box no slash should pop up if you have Harry/Luna filtered
