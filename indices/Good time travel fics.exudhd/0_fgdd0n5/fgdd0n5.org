[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/][Altered Destinies]] Goes back in time during Tom's younger years, cannot recommend this one enough!!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]] Marauder era, tangled in with Bellatrix

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh god not again]] Back to Hogwarts years, crack fic but sooo funny. It's probably what you were talking about with the cliches, but it adds all of them and makes fun of it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12813755/1/][Disorder of the Phoenix]] Back to 5th year, but as an adult not to his past body

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11434139/1/][Brand New Start]] Goes back to raise himself

I have more (and even more non-Harry centric) but there was way too many to do, so if you liked any just let me know and I can do more!!

If anyone else in this thread wants the non-harry ones let me know too!
