  Looking for something different? Something compelling, with a plot that isn't cookie-cutter and predictable? This is the epic for you. 1981 didn't go as it was fated, leaving the world of 1994 a crumbling, fractured apocalypse. Between runes that promise the end of the world and the possibility of magic dying entirely, Harry has a difficult path ahead of him.
