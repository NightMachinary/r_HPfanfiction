Well, student-teacher relationships are already extremely problematic: the "ew" factor is valid since Hermione is a minor and way younger so it's weird too, he didn't exactly repudiate his anti-Muggle views (his assisting the Order and sacrificing himself was, according to JKR, to assuage his guilt for his one love and because Lily held those ideals which the DEs repudiated), and his was just generally unkind to even completely sympathetic and out-of-the-way characters like Neville. Hermione had plenty of faults, but her vast differences with Snape make it nearly impossible to seem realistic if they're anything like canon.

Also, Snape's not well liked here so it might just be a local thing. I personally don't care for Snape so that's my reason.
