1. The age difference. I'm not a big fan of couples with an age gap so big that person A could be person b's parent. However, I could still forgive them if they are both adults, Which is not the case of SS/HG, since he died when she was barely an adult, so she is a minor for most of their interactions.
2. Snape despise muggleborns and joined the death eaters, it's like shipping a Nazi and a Jew. For the very same reason I dislike Snily and Dramione.
3. He bullied her, even thought he was a teacher and she was a student. Which makes it even worse than Draco calling her names.
4. There are way too many fics about them for such a cringe worthy couple, so I kinda get tired of seeing so much of them.
