For me it's an age thing, and it's a teacher-student thing, and it's a Snape is a terrible person thing. I don't really like draco-hermione either, because they were both /so/ cruel to her, and they both hate who she is , hate who she is enough to become a death eater. Snape loved Lily, also a "mudblood" but hated who she was more than he loved her. There's no redeeming that, especially with the vivim of both Snape and draco's incessant bullying and cruelty. As someone who was bullied as a kid, you don't really look at that bully in a good light when you're older. That amount of cruelty does damage and it just doesn't seem plausible that someone like Hermione would ignore that history and get involved with either of them, especially when she can have pretty much anyone in the world, many of whom have been nothing but kind to her. I don't really "get" her with Ron, either, but that's more plausie than forgetting what Snape and/or Draco put her, and other muggleborns through and falling in love with them.

Honestly, any pairing with Snape is enough to make me nope out- he's a miserable bastard and I can't see him ever being happy with /anyone/.
