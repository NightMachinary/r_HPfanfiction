Probably because Snape's not exactly any kind of ideal love interest. Grumpy, greasy, snarky git. He's not well liked as a character on this subreddit.

More specifically to Hermione, he was a dick to her as a teacher, and not everyone thinks he really gave up his anti-Muggle attitudes, and others think he's too obsessed with Lily to ever fall for someone else.

I ship it myself, but I can see why people don't like it, and it's certainly a difficult pairing to make plausible, which IMO makes it all the more fun to ship.
