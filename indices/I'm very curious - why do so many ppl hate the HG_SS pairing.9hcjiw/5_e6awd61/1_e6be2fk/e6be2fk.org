I think Snape is a well liked character on this subreddit, but I also think there are a lot of us who are just tired of seeing stories that either whitewash his actions, ignore his actions, or even ignore his personality and replace it with one someone could actually fall for.

That's my issue with Snape, I've never seen a fix that has a romance that doesn't either take him or his love interest completely out of character to make the romance work. If you can't get your characters to fall for each other without breaking the character from who they were, then I don't find the ships unplausible, but completely unrealistic.

Of course we all have the built in defense that it's personal taste, so in reality this was all a waste of time to type.
