We only really get a couple of views of this though, right? Immediately after the battle (when I imagine he's totally drained of emotion and would find it hard to hate anyone) and the epilogue 10+ years later, where we know he named Albus after him.

There's a lot of space for complicated feelings about Snape in that time period. My headcanon has always been that he didn't forgive Snape, but came to understand who he was and why he was the way he was and made peace with the memory of Snape. But I imagine in between those times there was a lot of well deserved venting about how Snape was a dick, even if he sacrificed himself.
