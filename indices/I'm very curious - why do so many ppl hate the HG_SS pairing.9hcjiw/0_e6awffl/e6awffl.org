Going to list a few, but certainly not an exhaustive list of reasons:

- Student teacher relationships are almost never healthy, especially when the student is not an adult. The power dynamics at play make it hard for it to be a true partnership and when the formative years of the relationship were when the student was a minor, that's textbook grooming.

- Snape was a real dick in canon, but especially to the trio, among them Hermione. It takes a LOT of handwaving or straight up ignoring of canon to somehow twist that into a healthy relationship.

- From what I've heard, it used to be much more popular, especially in the 'oughts when the last few books were coming out. People may be sick of it because it's so overdone or all the new works featuring it are just pale imitations.

Personally, I just get frustrated by most stories that are focused around a specific pairing, so with the above reasons and that reason, I automatically filter out anything classified as SS/HG.
