Snape was never a good person and I don't understand why so many people are getting that wrong. Yes, he was trying to protect Harry, but only because he was obsessively in love with his mother. He joined the death eaters out of free will before the events of Halloween 1981 and was an abusive, cruel prick to a lot of his students. I would have semi-understood if he'd disliked Harry, considering he's the result of the love of his life marrying the guy who made his life at school hell, but he was cruel to Hermione, Ron, Neville and many, many others as well.
