There are so many reasons why I hate that pairing, but since I'm at work, here are just a few:

1) Snape was her teacher. There's rarely a situation where that relationship dynamic can be healthy (especially when her character was so young when he was a teacher).

2) Snape was a bully. He terrified Neville to the point where Neville's worst fear was Snape. Not Bellatrix who had tortured his parents. Not Voldemort. But Snape. I understand that this is about Snape/Hermione pairings, but it speaks to his character. While I have my own personal issues with a Hermione/Ron pairing, I find it to be unfathomable that Hermione would end up with Snape.

3) Snape was a Death Eater. While he may have repented later, he was, in fact, a Death Eater. Of his own will. And from what we're given, the only reason he wasn't still a Death Eater was because Voldemort went after Lily. Not because he realized it was a toxic and horrible ideology, but because it was going to impact the woman he loved. Hermione appears to be a forgiving person (look at her relationships with the other two Golden Trio over the years) but I find it difficult to believe that she would be able to get past that. This is also a big reason why I struggle with Hermione/Draco pairing fics.

I don't necessarily mind big age gaps. While I can't personally see myself in that type of relationship, I know that they can work and be good relationships. I just find Snape's character too toxic and the teacher/student dynamic too problematic to be able to read any of those fics.
