  Age difference

The issue is not the age difference, or even the imbalance of power due to the "teacher-student" thing. If you want to break it down to the simplest terms, Snape is someone who voluntarily joined Voldemort's Brownshirts. He had a dark arts boner even during his Hogwarts days. He had no issues with Death Eaters as friends. Shipping him with a muggleborn or Harry is on the same level of wrong as Heinrich Himmler/Anne Frank.

And before anyone objects with him changing his ways, there is no redemption for the countless war crimes any Death Eater commits by the virtue of being an illegal combatant who targets civilians. A good deed does not wash away a bad one.
