A few mentor Dumbledore stories come to mind (though they are different from this one):

Sib's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] is a replacement for year 6 that has a powerful Harry coming into his own under Dumbledore's mentoring. Features one of the best competitive duels between the two. 250k words, complete.

jbern's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][The Next Lord of Kobol]] has as a divergence point Dumbledore's taking Harry with him when confronted in his office by the Aurors in OOtP. This leads to Dumbledore's mentoring Harry. Battlestar Galactica crossover, 50k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land.

Taliath's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3123807/1/In-Light-of-Silver-Memories][In Light of Silver Memories]] takes a shortcut, having Harry absorb Dumbledore's knowledge and wisdom. 30k words, abandoned.

  Dumbledore's portrait wakes up at last to have one final chat with Harry. In order to aid the teen in his quest to destroy the Horcruxes, Dumbledore transfers his knowledge, wisdom, and experience. This chat will have unforeseen consequences in the war.

My own [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] begins with the premise that Dumbledore doesn't ignore the second prophecy at the end of PoA and takes Harry on as his apprentice. 85k words, Complete.
