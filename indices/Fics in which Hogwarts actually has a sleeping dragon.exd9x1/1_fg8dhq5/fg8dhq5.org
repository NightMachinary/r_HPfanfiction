Did no one tell you about Ignatius the sleeping dragon? Helga Hufflepuff Dosed him With a powerful sleeping draft while the castle was constructed. He sleeps under the Hufflepuff common room, His fire breath Is the source of Hogwarts' ever burning kitchen fires. When students go To tickle the pear On the painting of the bowl of fruit at the entrance to the kitchen, The pear is actually Ignatius' tickle spot Directly under the skills behind his left ear. Every time a student tickles the pear they are giving Ignatius ear scratch, making the dragon laugh And sneeze fire To keep the kitchen fires is burning.

On an added note: Helga Hufflepuff Ever the advocate for courtesy and kindness no matter the species, Design a comfortable chamber for the dragon to sleep, Ignatius comes and goes as he wishes, Returning to the chamber to sleep. He is perpetually being fed treats by the house elves As his presence keeps the fires burning. Dobby And Ignatius We are known as Wonderful friends During Dobby's time at Hogwarts, He was known to take extra care when preparing Ignatius' meals , Both Dobby and Ignatius We're quite fond of the hats Hermione Granger Sowed During her years at Hogwarts. Ignatius Found her hat particularly useful for cleaning behind his ears( with Dobby's help of course)
