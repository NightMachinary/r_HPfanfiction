  First of all, what the soggy fuck even is the point of those posts? Is it to annoy the people here into going and reading your favourite fanfic so that they can collaboratively nerd out with you?
#+end_quote

No, I found out about the update becauese I actually forgot to follow the story on ffn. I am very thankful that I found out, because I love it, and would hate to miss it. Also, at least one guy started reading it based on the recs in the thread, so we added on reader to the fic. Reason enough for me.

#+begin_quote
  You already know that most authors these days have gone full on brain dead mode and have started putting random artsy clickbaity quotes from their stories that don't summarize anything for shit.
#+end_quote

Have you actually ever /read/ the summary printed on books? They usually don't spoil much - a summary does. This should be called "teaser", not summary. And did you know, real books do that too?

#+begin_quote
  If you're going to show me a fic about cowfucking, then at least do me the courtesy of letting me get the lube and tissues. Give me an actually decent summary of what I'm clicking into so that I don't get jumped by ass porn, or worse, Dumbledore x McGonagall.
#+end_quote

That is a sign of bad fics. Usually a summary is relatively explicit. Let's look at the shit that's actually on the frontpage, right?

#+begin_quote
  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
#+end_quote

Right away, I know:

- Female Harry
- Proably time-travel
- Post-Hogwarts
- Powerful Harry

Which pretty much classifies the entire story. Yes, it tells some of these in an extremely explicit manner, but the description field on FFN is very limited. It tells you /exactly/ what kind of story you can expect. So why rant here about it? Look at fucking Sorcerer's Stone for comparision:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has no idea how famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who are terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, just as his parents were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned to attend an infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is +greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.+
#+end_quote

The stroked out part wouldn't fit in the summary field of FFN anymore.

- Harry is (probably) an orphan
- He's a wizard who will go to a magic school
- There is a giant
- He has a "noble destiny"

Is that so much more than the usual description on FFN?

And either you are very dumb, or illiterate, because the second sentence of Animagus Mishap is

#+begin_quote
  What happens when Harry gets a witch pregnant in their Animagus forms?
#+end_quote

Holy fuck, isn't it clear after that that it contains a "Bestiality porn fest"? I'm sorry, but if you can't actually read we can't help you here. Sure, you clicked on the story if the description appealed to you, but after that you can nope out as fast as you want and shove the lost 23 seconds in your ass, because if it takes you longer than that to figure out you don't like the fic after then 2nd sentence you have other problems.

Yes, the update posts could be extended with a summary. But the rant is unnecessary.
