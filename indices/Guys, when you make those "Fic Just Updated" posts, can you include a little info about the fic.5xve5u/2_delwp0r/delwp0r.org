Hello. I'm Bobblehead Schnapplestein, and I'm one of the many people here who agrees with your sentiments. And I want to take this occasion to respectfully and non-vulgarly comment on this topic.

First of all, what the soggy fuck even is the point of those posts? Is it to annoy the people here into going and reading your favourite fanfic so that they can collaboratively nerd out with you? And if so, why are you posting updates for stories as huge as Prince of the Dark Kingdom and pretending that everyone and their aunt's third illegitimate stepchild hasn't already read it? Its not as if any of us keen on spending hours reading that schnooplestein haven't already enabled email notifications so that we can read it the instant its updated.

And the summaries. Oh boy the summaries.

Why the fuck would you not put an actual summary in front of the fucking link. You already know that most authors these days have gone full on brain dead mode and have started putting random artsy clickbaity quotes from their stories that don't summarize anything for shit. These days you don't know if you are clicking into a nice Hermione Harry romance story or a fucking Bestiality porn fest ( Animagus Mishap) from the summary of a story. If you're going to show me a fic about cowfucking, then at least do me the courtesy of letting me get the lube and tissues. Give me an actually decent summary of what I'm clicking into so that I don't get jumped by ass porn, or worse, Dumbledore x McGonagall.

Anyways, this was a good post OP. I bounced on my boy's dick to this for seconds. Could have been hours, but the summary wasn't long enough.
