I was going to say that you could just click the given link and read the summary, but I changed my mind halfway through your post. You're right. The only real purpose "updated" posts have is to tell people you're excited enough about one fic to make a whole new thread for it. Given that, some info about your own thoughts and feelings regarding it would be well-appreciated.
