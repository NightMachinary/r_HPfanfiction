*Saying No* - linkffn(7274734)\\
It's more of a "Harry got pissed off at Dumbledore after Sirius' death, and how he just picks up Harry when he needs him and dumps him at the Dursleys when he doesn't." So he says no.

Tutored, and then year 6 where Harry, Hermione, and Ron say NO to everything. Hogwarts staff bashing? Adult bashing? Kreacher and Dobby Rivalry. This is crack by the way.

Also, beware the power of Origami!
