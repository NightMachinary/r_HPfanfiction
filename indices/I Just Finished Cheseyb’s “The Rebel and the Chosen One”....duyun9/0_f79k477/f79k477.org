From what I remember of the fic (and it has been a few years), it suffers from the same issues as most of the older fics. It's concepts, as original as they may have been when it was written, have become overused.

Also, it suffers from trying to tie up too many canon plotlines IMO. The author never stepped back and asked herself which stations of canon would change based on the changes they made and which would become completely irrelevant.

The relationship was written quite well, although some the drama at the start (eg Tonks capture and then later her recovery) felt a little too random for my tastes. I get what the author was going for, but the execution felt a little too much like "drama for the audience" rather than how people ought to act. Maybe this ties in with sticking too close to canon Harry when it comes to characterisation while he should have changed a little more. Events change people, as do relationships.

I won't deny that it has influenced my tastes in fanfic and what I write, I liked the fic after all. But I also won't deny that quite a bit of that influence was "That's not what I would want to see here". It remains one of top 10 fics for that pairing, but I won't deny that it has issues.
