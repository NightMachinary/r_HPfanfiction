Fanon dark arts/magic seems to have the same issue. Lots of them sound impressive, but they all boil down to “how to kill one individual in 101 painful ways”:

How about inventing spells or magical devices that:

- Improve the accuracy, ease, range and rate of fire of Avada Kedavra. In my version of magical world, American wizards managed to create a semiautomatic gun that fires Avada Kedavra bullets. It has more than double the range of the original killing curse, fires at 6 times the rate, and doesn't require any emotional component in casting.
- Improve the range and radius of area effective spells. Instead of only heat, the explosive effects can be cold, acid, and poison.
- Make more use of transfiguration and conjuration. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), does an excellent job showing the power of animation and transfiguration.
- Involve alchemy, and how does aerosolized basilisk venom sound?
- combine magic and technology. Do you like a machine gun that fires without recoil, has vastly expanded magazine, and is magically cooled? Do you like a flying invisible [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_tracked_armoured_vehicle][Warrior IFV]] with a vastly expanded interior and portkey capability? Do you want to mount super trunks on brooms so they can be turned into [[https://youtu.be/UxgiBJATe9M][strategic bombers]]?
- Track locations of individuals using blood magic; vice versa, block scrying attempts with blood magic. Or enchant items that let wearers communicate each other with their thoughts. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), goes into that.
- Build super wards with sacrificial blood magic. Executing prisoners to strengthen your defenses sounds like a perfectly reasonable dark magic idea.
- Directly destroy the weakened main soul of individuals with Horcruxes, of course involving horrible sacrifices as ritual components.
