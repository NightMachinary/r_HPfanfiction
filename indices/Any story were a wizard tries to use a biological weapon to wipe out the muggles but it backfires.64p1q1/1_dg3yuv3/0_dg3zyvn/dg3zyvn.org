I honestly don't remember I have read so many fanfics that they all sort of blend together like a gigantic interconnecting web.

Edit: found it is not even an actual fanfic it is in the notes of my many unwritten fanfiction idea that i have had but never written over the years

It starts out with a wizard drinking liquid luck with his goal being to wipe out muggle but it doesn't work as planned and then later dying from the poisonous effect that the potion causes when you drink tow much of it.

Owell if any one want the idea they can haven It because I will probably never get around to writing it.
