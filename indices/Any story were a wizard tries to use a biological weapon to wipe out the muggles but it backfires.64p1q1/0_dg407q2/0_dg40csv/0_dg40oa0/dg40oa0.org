Why stop at Sirius, though? We know that wizards have had several political movements that tried to reform their relationship to Muggles:

1. Muggle hunters: Muggles are beasts, and should be treated as such.
2. Grindelwald's Greater Good: Abolish Statute of Secrecy, and have wizards openly rule over Muggles for their own good.
3. Death Eaters: Purge Muggle influence by getting rid of Muggleborns and not allowing them into wizarding society; permit abuse of Muggles, as long as Statute of Secrecy is preserved.

I can see other reform proposals floating around, including:

4. Altruists: Abolish SoS, but the state should protect Muggles from abuse.

5. Negative Eugenicists: Kill or sterilize all Muggles.

6. Positive Eugenicists: Spread magical genes far and wide, eventually replacing Muggles with wizards.

The Positive Eugenicists might actually be pretty open about it --- they are out to impregnate as many Muggle women as they can without breaking SoS and wizarding laws against rape, Muggle-baiting, etc., claiming that they are "spreading the wealth".

It's a creepy idea, but it might actually be one that maximizes sum total sapient happiness and minimizes sum total sapient suffering in the long run.
