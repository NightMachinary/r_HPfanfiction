It's an interesting premise, but it's more of a setting element than a meaningful plot.

I think that it could be framed as a mystery that the protagonists are trying to solve. It could then transition to a political drama when they do find the cause (if not the culprit), as wizards debate whether they should let the contagion do its thing and eventually replace Muggles with wizards (since wizards generally have better lives than Muggles), or whether to release a cure and return to the status quo ante.

As an alternative, given how magical genetics work, I can imagine someone like Tom Riddle seeking a different kind of immortality: imagine if, one year, out of nowhere, fifty Muggleborns show up at Hogwarts, having similar physical features and increased propensities for Parselmouth, high intelligence, and high-functioning psychopathy. Further testing would reveal that they are half-siblings. Next year, another hundred do, and then another hundred, etc.. (It doesn't even have to be unethical: as far as sperm donors go, Riddle is brilliant, handsome, healthy, and his offspring have a high probability of having magical powers.)

Again, it could be framed as a mystery for characters to solve.
