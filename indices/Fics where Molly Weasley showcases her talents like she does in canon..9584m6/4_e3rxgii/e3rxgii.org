So far as I know, he's only posting to the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group, but Doghead Thirteen/Cal's wip story "The Scourge From the North" plays with this. If I recall correctly, Molly was an ex hit witch from the war with Grindelwald, but was rather broken after her brothers died.

Cal's juggling a ton of tropes in this one, but so far seems to be doing a bang up job of showing why those tropes were popular in the first place by writing them well.
