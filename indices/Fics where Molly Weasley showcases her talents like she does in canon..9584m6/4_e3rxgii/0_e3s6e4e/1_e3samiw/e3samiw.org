The passage in question:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny sighed and shook her head. “We don't talk about it much -- Mum doesn't like being reminded of it -- but she was part of the Auror team that went to France with Dumbledore during Grindlewald's War -- and she came back accompanied by a ghoul -- the same ghoul as we've got in the attic -- and being called things like 'Killer Prewitt' or, get this, Grindlewald's lot used to call my mum something that means 'The Devil's Handmaiden'... She doesn't know that I know, but she's got an Order of Merlin First Class with oak leaves and clusters, and a ton of what I'm pretty certain are human scalps, all in a trunk in the attic along with just an absolute shitload of trophies and stuff she got given by Partisans, most of it guns -- the year she was pregnant with me, my uncles, her brothers Fabian and Gideon, got killed by You-Know-Who's lot and Dad actually had to talk Mum out of coming out of retirement complete with me-as-bun in oven and Ron still nursing.”
