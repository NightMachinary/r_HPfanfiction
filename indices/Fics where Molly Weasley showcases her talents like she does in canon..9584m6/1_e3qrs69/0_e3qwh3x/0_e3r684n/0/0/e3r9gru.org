Yes, and if she indeed wasn't in the Slug Club, Dumbledore said that Slughorn collects charming people, too. You might be talented but not charming in the least and he might overlook you. Her brothers needed five Death Eaters to take them down and Hagrid described the Prewetts as some of the greatest witches and wizards of the age along with the Bones family. That says something about them. To be honest, I kind of understand Molly now. Her brothers died in the First War and she decided to settle down because she didn't want to endanger her family. Fear drives people to do anything. I personally headcanon Molly as the most talented witch the Order ever had after Dorcas Meadowes. I also like to think she was an Unspeakable before her brothers died.
