Ok Nevermind, I realise I'm wrong now. In HBP Molly mentions how Slughorn never paid much attention to Arthur, later you can see this similarity with Ron. I read it years ago and after finishing the series just assumed Molly was like Hermione, only with Arthur. I always thought it was cool that one of Slughorns 'collections' chose to raise a large family with the man she loved rather than be another of his 'success stories'. Bit traditional but whatever. Damn. I actually enjoyed thinking that was canon lol.
