Which talents?

How to be an overbearing helicopter mother who plays favourites (Ginny! While Ron is more of an afterthought than anything else! He's the least favourite son, she pines after Percy when he stood against his family but Ron? Nope, he's not special, he's got no special talents etc. and so he's seen as not important! (note: I don't even like Ron, I call him Mo-Ron, but even I can see that!))?

Seriously, what talents does Molly have? Blind, dumb luck? (Seriously, she should never have killed Bellatrix - that should have fallen to Neville IMHO!) Stupidity (having more kids than they can afford without hand downs - hell, they stump their kids magical growth with hand down wands!!!)?

Again: Show me one talent this lazy housewife (yes: Lazy! Because if normal people (muggles!) can do housework while holding down a job then a witch should be able to as well! Come on swish and flick and housework is DONE! What does she do the rest of the time?) has! (note: Stuff like cooking and cleaning doesn't count!)
