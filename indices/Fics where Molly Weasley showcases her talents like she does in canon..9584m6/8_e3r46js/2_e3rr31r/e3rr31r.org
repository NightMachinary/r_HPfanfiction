Okay, so. Yeah, she's a bit of a helicopter parent. But - she lived through a war. She fought in a war. She lost her brothers, her friends, her loved ones, to said war. Then, when she was finally healing from it, she saw her kids dragged into a continuation of said war. Yes, she's pretty stubborn and overbearing at times, and it's not okay - but, it makes sense.

Killing Bellatrix - why, why on Earth, should she have NOT? Sure, you can argue that Neville had more of a reason to do so, but...if we have a crazy mass-murderer who shot and killed your entire family, and many other families, and I have a chance to kill her, I'm taking that chance. It's for the good of everyone, the crazy bitch needs to be killed. I'm sure Neville doesn't begrudge Molly in the slightest for it, and is glad Bella is dead at last, even if he couldn't do it himself.

You make some (harsh, but still) good points though about it not being the best idea to have so many children in their financial situation, and it being odd that Molly refuses to work to get them out of said situation, though. Honestly, once Ginny started Hogwarts, there was no real reason for Molly to stay home during the school year.

Overall, you have a few good points, and a few that don't pan out well. As to how Ron is treated, I can't say - I think the appeal of Molly is that she loves all her children, even ones that aren't 'special' outwardly, but I do see how Ron seems to get the crap end of it all.
