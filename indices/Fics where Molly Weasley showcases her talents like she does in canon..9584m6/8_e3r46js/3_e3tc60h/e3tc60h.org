Neville isn't special, it's important to note, in terms of Bellatrix's victims. Firstly, there were many, many victims we just don't know personally. They deserved a piece of her just as much. Secondly, why fixate on her? There were three other equally devoted attackers that night, and two of them were also at that battle. Hell, Crouch tormented Neville by casting Crucio right in front of him, then pretended to show sympathy after. Yet we never see Neville even acknowledge that one of the four who destroyed his parents died.

I don't think Neville deserves to kill Bellatrix any more than anyone else. In fact, Neville grew up ok, and had family members he loved. Harry had only Sirius, and Bella killed him. He technically had more right, if you wanna actually judge shit like that.
