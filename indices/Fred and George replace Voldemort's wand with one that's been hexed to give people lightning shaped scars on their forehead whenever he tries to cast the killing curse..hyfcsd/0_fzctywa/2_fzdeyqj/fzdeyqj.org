I really can't see that, after all these trick wands probably aren't much like actual wands and if Voldemort could work such incredibly powerful magic wandlessly then the whole brother wands thing wouldn't matter.

I also just really don't like it when wandless magic is that strong, there should be a good reason people use wands beyond being a bit easier
