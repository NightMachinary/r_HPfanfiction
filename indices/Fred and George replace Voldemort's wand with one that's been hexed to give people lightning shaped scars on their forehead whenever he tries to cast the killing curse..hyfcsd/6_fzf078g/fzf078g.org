Taking this as a launching point - I would love to read a post-GoF where Forge learns about the graveyard scene, and they decide to investigate brother wands. Maybe they had 2nd hand wands, and with Triwizard money they decided to try pairs of Ollivander wands until they got a best-match.

Arming Harry with home-grown wand lore would be a really cool way to even the playing field, even though we already know that Voldemort is doing what he can to uneven it by getting the Elder wand.
