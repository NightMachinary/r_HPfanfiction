There is a new story in the Work By Author section of darklordpotter forums called Realignment with this exact premise.

Harry Potter is somehow in the past during the Grindelwald era, during Tom's fifth or sixth year in Hogwarts, and is intent on killing him. Dumbledore takes up the role of protecting Tom. It's pretty cool.
