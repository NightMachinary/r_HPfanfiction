I can imagine. Being told it is completed and then finding out otherwise is worse than a WIP never finishing. EDIT: And while it does say "Dead", I dont think that is clear the story was abandoned especially when it says completed. If i hadn't jumped into the reviews before starting, I would have been crushed
