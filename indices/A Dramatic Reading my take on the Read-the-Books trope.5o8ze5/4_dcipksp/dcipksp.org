In all honesty, I only saw this when looking around your author page on ffnet looking for a LA update, but now I'd actually be ok if you just wrote more of this for a while. I mean, I've never seen this type of fic ever have negative (or really any) consequences outside of the books, and already you have lots of things happening. The one thing that really got me about this was that, in prior forays into this type of fic, the (often quoted word for word) text of the books would invariably be more interesting than the actual fic, but here it's the other way around. Also, I think Kingsley's line made the whole story for me. Please keep this going, it's already really good and poised to become even better.
