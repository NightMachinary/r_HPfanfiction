Hey- I did not expect something this entertaining, even from you who I've read and liked the works of before. The biggest problem I had with stories like these is that for all the knowledge gained, nothing ever actually happens. This, already Dumbledore is gone like canon OotP, with similar remarks from those present. But it also looks like things will continue to happen; good work and keep at it!
