Read it last night and it was really great, well paced and as you promised, avoided all the pitfalls of the usual readthebook/wish fulfillment fic. I used to like these but always ended reading them in diagonal, skipping entire paragraph at a time and finishing a chapter in a minute or less. Yours is captivating, and the change from canon are immediate and not promised later as a reward like is usually done because 'mysterious author trapped everyone in the great hall thanks to the DOM and Umbridge'. Again well done, and I will get around to read Lady Archimedes someday, but exams await now so... :-D
