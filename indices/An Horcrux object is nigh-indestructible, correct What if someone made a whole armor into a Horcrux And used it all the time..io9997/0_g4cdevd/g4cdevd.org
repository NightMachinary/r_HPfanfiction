It's not the horcrux that actually grants an object indestructability. It's the enchantments that a dark wizard places on the object afterwards that grants it resistance.

The fact that they aren't used in canon suggest that their are limitations on their uses.

Even if you could protect an armor after the fashion of horcruxes, I'd assume that the killing curse would still work, it is said to be unblockable. You can still be stunned through clothes, so I'd assume spells that affect the person and not the armor would still work such as stunners or the body-bind. They just simply don't work on a horcrux because it is not alive.
