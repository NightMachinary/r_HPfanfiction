As Impossible-Poetry said, an Horcrux is not "night-indestructible" because it is an Horcrux, but because any wizard with at least some common sense would first enchant a receptacle to be sturdy before putting his soul inside.

Now, there is nothing stopping a wizard from enchanting an amor before using it all the time, but anything anything able to pass the protections made by a full grown wizard would probably make a quick work of some metal armor. So you might as well just enchant your daily robe and be done with it.
