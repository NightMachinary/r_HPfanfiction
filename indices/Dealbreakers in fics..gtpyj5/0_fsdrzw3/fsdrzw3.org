Any bashing whatsoever.

Characters acting like assholes/being straight up evil while everyone including the author acts like they're good, and those actions are good

Muggle Wank. Wizarding wank too, but not nearly to the same extent. Canon sure makes a strong case for arguing that wizards are just straight up better off in every way to muggles.

Real world politics.

Characters spilling their guts out as just exposition, instead of the author figuring out a way to show/ incorporate it naturally into the story.
