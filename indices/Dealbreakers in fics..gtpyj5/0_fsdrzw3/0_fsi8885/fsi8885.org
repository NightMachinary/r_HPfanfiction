  Canon sure makes a strong case for arguing that wizards are just straight up better off in every way to muggles.

This really is only true if you take as factual the contemptuous statements made about them by the characters, things like muggles ignoring magic even if it's staring them in the face, and the descriptions of the muggles of Privet Drive as the backdrop of Harry's miserable childhood. I don't imagine the muggles of Harry Potter as a dull, witless, and magicless variant of wizards. I imagine them as normal people, like we have in the real world. We can't teleport, or create or destroy things with a thought and a wave of a stick, and we have diseases that wizards can cure that we cannot, but we have art, and science, and music, and philosophy isn't mentioned at all in the books, but we have that. Wizards certainly aren't incapable of pursuing any of these things, but magical culture also doesn't encourage a study of science, or of philosophy.
