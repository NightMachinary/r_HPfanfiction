Contrived plot points or conspiracies that solely exist to prolong a conflict because the original bad guy wasn't enough or new abilities that do the same, at least when done poorly. I just can't stand it when an author has to make the MC have a much more horrible time than the original. This especially applies to time travel fics. A group in the shadows that is manipulating the wizarding world to purposely keep people as dumb as possible or Voldemort's faction pulling some new ability out of their ass when they should be defeated just rub me the wrong way.

IIRC linkffn(Passageways by jerrway69) is an example of this done right, however.
