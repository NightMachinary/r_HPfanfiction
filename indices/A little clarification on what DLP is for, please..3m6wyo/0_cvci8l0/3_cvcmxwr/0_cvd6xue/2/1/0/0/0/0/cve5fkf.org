"Works"

Lol, bro, I'm not butthurt. These comments are nothing new to me, I assure you. I thought we were having a discussion, I said nothing to insult you, but apparently you took it the wrong way.

I also have not hid that I'm a moderator at DLP. I made this account 2 days ago and have said at least two times who I am and where I'm from. I'm not remotely trying to hide who I am or why I made this account. You've obviously went through my history and started downvoting every post I made (which I find hilarious), but didn't look at when exactly I created the account. I made this account to address the concerns people were having over our Work by Author subforum, and everyone who's been reading on about this since it happened knows who I am.
