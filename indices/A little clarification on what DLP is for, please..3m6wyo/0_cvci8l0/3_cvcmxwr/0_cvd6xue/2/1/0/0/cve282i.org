You realize you just made the argument for me? People have different tastes. If you like poorly written fanfiction, I'm not going to stop you from reading it, but who are you to tell me that I'm supposed to suck it up and read it anyways? People at DLP aren't telling you what to read. They're giving their own opinion on the fic to people on the forum, and most of the reviewers aren't going to read/accept something that's badly done.

If you want to read shit, that's fine, but if you want to read fanfiction that tries to raise the bar instead of lowering it due to it "just being fanfiction" then you can come to DLP to find it.
