So I'm assuming you've seen 50 Shades of Gray? Read and watched all of Twilight? Watch all the television programming meant for little children?

Why have standards when it comes to movies? It's not fine art.

Why have standards when it comes to young adult literature? It's not fine art.

Why have standards about what you eat for dinner? If it's healthy and gives you the necessary nutrients, why not eat tasteless goop instead of a big, juicy steak? It's not fine art.

Why have standards about what you watch on TV? It's not fine art, go watch Honey Booboo instead of Breaking Bad.

Of course, if you had a choice, you'd pick Breaking Bad over Honey Booboo (I hope). You'd pick a steak over tasteless goop. You'd pick a Lamborghini instead of a 1990 Honda Civic. People have standards in every aspect of their life. Shall I call you elitist for having these standards?
