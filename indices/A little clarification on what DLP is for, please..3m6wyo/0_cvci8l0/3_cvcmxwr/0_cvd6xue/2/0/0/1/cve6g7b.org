You seem to somehow be of the opinion that "elitist" works as criticism. It doesn't, because it's a good thing. I am perfectly content to be "elitist". I have high standards and I like it.

And this includes recognising that yes, writing can be measured objectively in certain aspects, so that yes, there exist objectively bad stories. Which in turn means there's ways to improve one's writing, which is what DLP -- for a writer -- is all about.
