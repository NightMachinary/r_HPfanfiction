Not DLP as a whole of course. Its sometimes feedback that would hit even me on a personal level. I'm a professional in the Art Industry, to give some reference here. I get harsh feedback on a daily basis. But DLP users sometimes overstep the line between harsh criticism and just cruel bash.

When it comes to their standards, I meant to use elitist in both a good and a bad way. Didn't quite manage that, but yea...

What I meant was that while they do hold their fanfiction to higher standards, their way of looking at, in their eyes, sub-par fanfiction is like nobles looking at peasants.

And please, I am by no means an active member of DLP. I just lurk from time to time.
