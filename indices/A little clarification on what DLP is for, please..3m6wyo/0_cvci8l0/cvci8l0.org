Darklordpotter.net is a forum established for the sake of encouraging higher quality in fanfiction compared to other forums which seemed more focused on a particular 'ship. It has evolved into a kind of gentleman's club (though ladies with something to say are welcome, the tone still has that occasionally crass Ivy League fraternity aesthetic going on), with topics discussed now covering a much wider range than just fanfiction for Harry Potter.

The makers also host the fanfiction hosting site PatronusCharm, as an alternative to the vast sea of suck in fanfiction.net. Within the forum is a subsection exclusive to members called WorkByAuthor, specifically created to get critical (some would say vicious) review of stories as yet unpublished. Whether the authors of those works choose to take or not take the advice given, it remains in place forever after so that the author can reread the responses. The expectation is that they would post what they were satisfied with out onto other hosting sites like PatronusCharm, fanfiction.net, Ao3 or wherever.

Separate from that is the Review Board, a subforum dedicated to evaluating stories posted to hosting sites that have caught the attention of the membership and evaluating whether those stories are worth including in the DLP Library. The evaluation here has nothing to do with the author (they aren't even notified that their story is being scrutinized) as it is more a readers' critical view: like a rating site that collects product reviews. Stories that have gone through the WorkByAuthor process are more likely to be posted in the Review Board and evaluated positively, simply because those stories have already been considered for their merits and the author advised how to improve their writing. If they don't take the advice they'll still probably be run through the review board if the story gets posted anywhere, but the Review Board only considers stories that are publicly accessible.

Hope that clarifies things, and if I mis-spoke hopefully one of the other members will correct me.
