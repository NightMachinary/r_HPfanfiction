  but a couple of people have jumped down other peoples throats for just reading stories in *wba*, and not reviewing anything at all, and just gave off a vibe that *DLP* isn't for readers

Emphasis mine to point out what I had considered fairly clear: DLP is not WBA. WBA is a single part of DLP. The "purpose" of WBA is not the "purpose" of DLP as a whole.

The difference between DLP and FF.Net is also kinda obvious. DLP is a discussion forum, FF.Net is a hosting site.
