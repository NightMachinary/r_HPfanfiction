DLP is for everyone. The Work by Author section is meant as a subforum for authors to post their work to be critiqued by DLP as a whole before they publish them. It's become a place where people go to to read stories before they're posted to fanfic sites, and that's fine, but that's not the original purpose nor is it the purpose today. DLP /does/ have a lot of authors and we're quite proud of that, but the vast majority of our forum is made up of readers.

If you have any other questions regarding DLP, feel free to ask.
