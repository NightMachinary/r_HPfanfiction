You could always just visit the site and see.

There are many discussion boards on a variety of subjects: HP canon discussion, fanfic discussion, and various non-HP topics. There is the Library, which is a collection of links to stories where those stories are discussed and rated. There is a "Work By Author" private forum where authors post unfinished pieces of writing for critique.

DLP as a whole isn't really "for" anything. The question doesn't make much sense.
