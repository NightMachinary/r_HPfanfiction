Actually, a lot of members take multiple factors into account when judging. They're going to be a lot more lenient judgement wise if they know english isn't a persons first language, that doesn't mean they're gonna be insincere about what they think about a story.

The whole 'everyone is special and everything is good' attitude isn't tolerated at DLP.

If an author comes to DLP and posts something that's bad, we're gonna tell them that, and then we're going to tell them what to improve. Pretending that a bad story is good only hurts them in the end and stilts their progress as an author.

A lot of authors who come to DLP have aspirations of moving on from fanfiction and eventually turning to original writing. They aren't going to succeed if we coddle them.

If the author has brought their material to DLP they want our opinion. If they haven't and a member has posted a story for review, then whats the issue? The author isn't personally involved in the process and has no idea that they're being reviewed unless a) someone specifically points them to it or b) they go looking.

I always find it mind boggling that people seem to get personally offended that there exists a group of people who prefer to read high quality stories. Doesn't matter if it's fanfiction, original or other. You have a finite amount of time, why would you not what to spend it on reading stuff you know you'll enjoy?

That's what DLP exists both to find and create.
