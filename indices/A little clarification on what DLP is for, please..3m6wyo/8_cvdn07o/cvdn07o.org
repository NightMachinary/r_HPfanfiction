From my experience DLP is a little too elitist for my liking. They treat fanfics too seriously, reviewing them like they're being submitted as the final paper of someones disertation.

Anything not meeting to their high standards gets instantly mocked and abused, doesn't matter if the author is 12 or 22, nor do they take into account if the author might not be a native English speaker, to them, you either write like a professional writer, or you're garbage and not worth their time.
