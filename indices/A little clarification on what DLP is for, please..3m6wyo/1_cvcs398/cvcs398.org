For what it's worth, here are my thoughts on DLP, from the perspective of someone who's /very/ new in the grand scheme of things, but threw myself pretty hard into the community when I did start participating about a year ago.

I think the bad rep DLP gets is explained in two ways:

1) A holdover, momentum kind of thing from 8-9 years ago when it was (so I understand, not having actually been there) an explicit reaction to perceived failings in the fanfiction community and was more about being /against/ certain things (like Harry/Ginny) than it was particularly /for/ anything. These days, the scope is much, much wider and the voices are quite diverse, and mostly everyone who's active gets along.

2) A few "squeaky wheels" who have a bad first experience and then go cry about it elsewhere. See, there's this thing that happens, like clockwork, every few months or so. Someone who's either a complete newbie or a longtime lurker makes the plunge and starts posting a lot in a short amount of time, and it's pretty obvious that they haven't really read the forum enough to get a handle on the atmosphere. Like, they'll post something in the General forum with some asinine/cliche opinion that's been talked up to death elsewhere.

Which is fine! You're allowed to be loud and wrong, in moderation. But the problem is, a member will give them a little sass, and because they're accustomed to, say, Spacebattles or something with a very clear Code of Conduct and Zero Tolerance For Insults and a whole staff of mods going "EVERYTHING SUNNY ALL THE TIME ALWAYS," they get kind of rocked back on their heels when their first few posts aren't met with a) enthusiasm or even b) benign "agree to disagree!" fluff.

And then they start hitting back, in just really obvious defensive/flailing ways. "Why shouldn't I have the right to express my opinion?" they think.

Well, you do. But... so does everyone else. What I like about DLP is that the rules, the culture, the atmosphere, is actually very basic and very freeform at the same time. It's like:

1) Don't be a moron 2) Don't be an asshole 3) If you're going to be a moron, be entertaining (see: Syed, entire post history of) 4) If you're going to be an asshole, be funny.

Just super simple stuff. Common sense. Anyone who makes a good-faith effort to be a part of the community without suddenly deciding that the community should be something other than it is, is welcomed, or at least tolerated.

DLP is like that scene in /The Wire/ with Marlo and the security guard. The guard takes a stand after Marlo swipes a lollipop from the store. Common sense says let it go: Marlo's insanely dangerous, he has this huge rep, and some plastic badge security guard's going to do exactly nothing to curtail his criminal activities. But the guard feels a sense of duty. A sense that this world should be fair. That it should matter that he's got justice and law and truth on his side.

"You want it to be one way," says Marlo, giving him that /look./ "But it's the other way."

Anyway.

Personally, I think DLP is great. Getting to know some of the people there has been awesome, and I'm continually blown away by the diverse opinions and lifestyles of people who are brought together by nothing more than a love of quality fiction. The feedback I get on my story in WbA was so much better than anything else I got that I straight-up ditched my beta and now just post my raw stuff there, and it's better off for it.

It's not for everybody. It doesn't pretend to be. There's no single voice, single opinion, single way of thinking, except for that one maxim: /Don't be an idiot./ And if you immediately want to jump on me because "Don't be an idiot is subjective" - that's exactly the attitude that gets people in trouble. Because it's really not.
