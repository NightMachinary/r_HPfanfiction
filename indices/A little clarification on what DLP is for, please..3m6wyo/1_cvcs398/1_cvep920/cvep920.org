As someone who was around back in the day, I can say your first point is probably on the the dot. I haven't been on DLP for a few years now but it certainly used to be a very closed off and unwelcoming place. That is not that I dislike DLP (it has done some really fantastic work with many authors) and certainly cannot speak for it now, but you definetly needed to think and post a certain way or it was made quite apparent that you would not fit in (read: be welcome). It left me with a negative impression after watching some people get absolutely shredded and I just moved on to other places in the fandom. But from what I hear, the community has improved and made it to its intended goal (only high quality stories). If people think it is elitest or cruel today, they have no idea what they missed haha
