Snarky comments are only posted in response to stupidity or spam, or between members who have known each other for years and are comfortable joking around with each other.

As you can see, most posts aren't snarky, they aren't made by elitist assholes. It's just people talking to people. Why? Because the thread topics aren't stupid like [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=30175][this]] or [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=30160][this]]. Every forum on the internet has their own system of doing things that has come from years of evolution. DLP doesn't really accept stuff like that -- just like reddit is unaccepting of posts that simply say "^ this", OPs who lie, stories that are a bit to fantastical ([[/r/thathappened]]), etc.
