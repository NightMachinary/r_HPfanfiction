It's not for everyone, especially those without thick skin. It sort of has a habit of turning against users as a group since the regular members know each other very well. However I doubt that happens now or that they'd admit it. When DLP used to be popular I remember some drama going on... I wouldn't say it's got everyone but it's a place you can lurk around for some new stories.

However due to the lack of fan fiction stories in general and also lack of publish worthy fan fiction, there isn't much activity there... Maybe that's one of the reasons as to why their discussions has expanded beyond Harry Potter.
