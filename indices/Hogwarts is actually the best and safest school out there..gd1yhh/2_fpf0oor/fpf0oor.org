Astoria greengrass fixed a small shaving mirror to the bayanet lugs of her AK-74, checking the corner. Ever since her families move out of Britain and into America, things had never quite been as safe.

When a school run by Death Eaters was safer than a school that was the best in the country... Well. Maybe Dumbledore was onto something after all.

There. A sliver of movement. A twitch. There it was, something that wasn't quite what was meant to be. A shimmer. Astoria Greengrass aimed and fired, the recoil bruising her shoulder. She fired again, and again, into the shimmering mass.

The silver bullets struck true, sending a spray of gore over the stones.

Damnit. This was getting expensive. Two werewolves in as many months.

At least selling werewolves for parts was legal in America. Drawing her set of knives, she got to work.
