Yeah. My first thought was actually .300 blackout, however, I don't think it was available in the 90's apart from some specialised wildcatters. To be perfectly honest, the best option for a werewolf (following running away as fast as possible so the aurors can do their job) is probably one of the .50 calibre anti-material rifles. At that point however, the plausability of a child being able to handle such a weapon is null and void. P.S All my knowledge of firearms comes from cdda ([[/r/cataclysmdda][r/cataclysmdda]]) and shooting a knockoff chinese ak type rifle a while back.
