It's a reference to linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow And The God Emporerless Heathens) where Dumbledore recieves a letter from the Greengrasses asking wether an ak-47 is an apropriate christmas present for a proper pureblood daughter. Excellent crack fic. I mean, I'd imagine that 5.56 is a little light for going against a werewolf. So, in which case it'd be AR-10. To be perfectly honest, a heavier calibre like the 30-06 would be better. For all we know, the Greengrasses switched from potions manufactoring to arms importation.
