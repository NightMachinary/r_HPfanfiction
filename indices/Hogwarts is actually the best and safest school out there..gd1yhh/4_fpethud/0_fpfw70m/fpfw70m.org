  “Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me --- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned --- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced --- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here --- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”
