Professor Sinistra found Harry Potter to be a perfectly kind and respectful young man. He got average grades in her astronomy class but he was never rude to her and was always conscious of his classmates. In fact, if she didn't know his past, he would be just another average young boy passing through her class.

But Harry Potter was not average. Sure he caused the fall of You-Know-Who but that was ten years ago and he was only one. Now he was eleven and, honestly, up until the proceedings of the past week, Professor Sinistra would've said that the boy's quidditch ability was his biggest achievement at school. But taking down a fully grown mountain troll? As an eleven year old, first year student?

Just last week, she had heard from her brother - who was currently working as the Quodpot coach at Ilvermorny while continuing his research on the magical fungis of New England - and he said that Ilvermorny had a similar issue. However, when a half-grown forest troll (very like a mountain troll but taller) had entered Ilvermorny it had taken the professors half a day to track it down and another hour to finally take it down. And, now that she is thinking about trolls, she can remember a Quibbler excerpt from a few years ago where a troll entered Durmstrang and one from farther back when one injured two students and a groundskeeper at Mahoutokoro. The author of this article, Xeno Lovegood, theorized that trolls are drawn to places of great magic because of the nargles that swarm the areas and make tasty snacks. Now, whether or not this is true, Professor Sinistra was becoming exceptionally grateful to Mr. Potter and his two friends for taking this troll down before it caused further damage. But it had to be pure luck... right?

By Mr. Potter's fifth year, Professor Sinistra was increasingly glad that he had a streak of good luck or pure skill (she didn't care which) because between the troll, a rumored baby dragon, the three headed dog, dementors, more dragons, mermaids, and a sphinx, she wasn't sure the school would have survived without him. Of course, much of this wouldn't have happened if he wasn't a target of Voldemort. But, whatever.

At least she didn't teach at Uagadou. Apparently, they were located near an erumpent breeding ground and had problems keeping them out of the school grounds.
