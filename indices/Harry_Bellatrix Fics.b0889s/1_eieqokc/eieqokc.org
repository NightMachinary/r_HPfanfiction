linkffn(2896398) Is amazing! Bellatrix is “bad” here but Harry's also been forced to turn morally ambiguous. They have tons of tension, exacerbated by how they're in a new place, and I'm really not doing it justice. But it's a good read!

Edit: I forgot to mention it is AU since it's a lot darker than canon
