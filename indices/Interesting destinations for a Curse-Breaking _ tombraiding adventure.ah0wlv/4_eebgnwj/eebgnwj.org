I'd go for the tomb of a wizarding Emperor of China. Unknown to the Muggles as he was written out of history to preserve the Statute of Secrecy.

The Tomb will resemble the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor with rivers of mercury ant Terracotta Warriors. Except of course it will be also warded by ancient and powerful spells, the rivers of mercury will serve a magical purpose and the Terracotta Warriors will be preserved, animated and enchanted with special glyphs that grants them the ability to reform when destroyed after several minutes.

Harry and Co will have to deactivate wards, find and disarm traps. Carefully traverse dark hallways riddled with immortal warriors and and the reward? Who knows? Could be an amazing sword equal in power to the Sword of Gryffindor? Or maybe a staff that amplifies a users spells to the point that it could be used to flatten entire castles? Or how about ancient spells written in ancient chinese on fragments of bone chips held together by string? By unrolling them you form a scroll like shape.

Another idea is Atlantis, hidden from Muggle eyes but protected by long forgotten wards and traps and guarded by a tribe of Merfolk who are actually the cursed citizens of Atlantis.
