Any place related to Paganism, including the Norse stuff. So Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland, Lithuania and possibly Germany and Canada (Leif Erikson).

You could go for Roman/Byzantine Ruins, which means most of Europe and the Mediterranean. Hellenistic ruins might go from Italy up to the Indus river.

The Kievan Rus would be an interesting avenue because they mix pagan and orthodox elements and eastern European folklore (which is badass and might be the magical world instead of myths). So mostly the European part of Russia and Ukraine.

Possibly the Holy Land if you want to go with "Crusader Artefacts were enchanted items " route. So the holy lance would be magical and the Holy Grail might even be Hufflepuff's cup for all we know.

And lastly, Atlantis/the Aegean Islands. Minoan culture, Santorini, the Minotaur and its maze, stuff like that.

Edit: And let's not forget about the obvious choice, celtic ruins or something from the Arthurian Saga.
