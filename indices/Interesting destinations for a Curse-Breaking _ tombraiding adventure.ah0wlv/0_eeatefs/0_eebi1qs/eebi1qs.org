I think some modern myths are also interesting:

- Area 51: could it be a secret base run by both the US military and MACUSA?

- Denver International Airport: another secret magical site? Google for “DIA conspiracy” if you are unfamiliar with it.

- Secret Nazi hideout in Antarctica: or the last refuge of Grindelwald remnants?

- The former USSR had many secret bases and even towns, some of them seemingly abandoned and really creepy: Protvino Scientific Center, Zagorsk-6, Arzamas-16, Sverdlovsk-45, Object 221, Vozrozhdeniya Island...

- The above names are just some of the sites known to the public. What about those that are truly classified and in secret? The collaboration of modern military, intelligence services, and elements of the Magical World could be far more extensive than even before the implementation of the SoS. There was after all great need to protect and defend against weapons of mass destructions.
