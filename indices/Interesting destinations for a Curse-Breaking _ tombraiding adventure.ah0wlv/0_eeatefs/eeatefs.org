The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_the_First_Qin_Emperor][Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]] in China contains a 'palace' hidden at the center of the mound which has never been excavated. That could be a good place for new curse-breaking discoveries. The terracotta warriors have featured in several Hollywood movies, similar to the mummies of Egypt, but a Harry Potter universe take on it might be interesting.

Ireland and Scotland contain many neolithic [[http://www.paleo-camera.com/Megaindex.htm][passage graves]] which were made to only admit sunlight to the end of the passage on specific dates (solstice or equinox). A curse-breaking expedition could discover that a magical gateway hidden in the passage grave only opens for a few minutes while the light touches a specific carving. Perhaps muggle excavations/building destroyed the alignment, thus accidentally sealing the gateway but the curse-breaking expedition restores it. Some of the most well known passage graves are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange][Newgrange]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeshowe][Maeshowe]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth][Knowth]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowth][Dowth]].
