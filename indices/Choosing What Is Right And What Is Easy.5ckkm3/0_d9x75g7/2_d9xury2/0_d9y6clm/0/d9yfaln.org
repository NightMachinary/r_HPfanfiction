That feels more fanon than canon. I don't think JKR had any such intent about the plot, and I find poor evidence for this idea inside the books.

The real-world reason for the plot to take that turn was that JKR needed Harry to be the primary center of action of the plot, and wanted to set up the entire time-turner sequence (probably because it /was/ a really great read.) However, if you try to make sense of it within the context of the world of the book, the events make Dumbledore's behavior seem very weird, and certainly inconsistent with any reasonable theory of morality or the whole "do what is right, not what is easy" mantra.
