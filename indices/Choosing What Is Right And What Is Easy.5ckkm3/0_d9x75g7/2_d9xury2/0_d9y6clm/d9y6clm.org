  someone who believed in the primacy of deontological concerns would not have left Sirius' fate in the hands of a couple of kids with a time turner.

His reasons for acting there was to have Sirius escape death, but in such a manner that he would have to flee from the law and would not be able to have a significant influence on Harry.

His ideology there seems to be a blend of deontological and utilitarian concerns, which explains the lack of apparent rationality. His morality would not allow Sirius to die, but he was utilitarian enough to know that Sirius's presence in Harry's life could degrade his own influence on him.
