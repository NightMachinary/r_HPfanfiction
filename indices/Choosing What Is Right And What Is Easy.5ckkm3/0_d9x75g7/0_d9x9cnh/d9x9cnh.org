  Under a utilitarian system of ethics, raising a child soldier would be the correct course of action if the good that child soldier did for the world outweighed the loss of that child's freedom.

Well you are correct, but only if you already subscribe to an utilitarian worldview. The way I look at Dumbledore it kinda makes sense that he would be so narrow minded as to see his personal worldview as fundamentally "right". This is IMHO pretty damning, as suddenly this "philosophical" quote is nothing but a self-righteous rationalization.

Even though I pretty much /hate/ Dumbledore I'm going for a more charitable interpretation of his words here: He makes that quote during his speech about Cedric and the resurrection of Voldemort: What he is talking about is personal sacrifice... risking your own life to help your fellow man. Taking the risk of hiding the Muggleborn in your cellar so that the +Gestapo+ Death Eaters won't find them. That kind of thing. He's trying to prepare people for a Civil War. He's asking people not to be cowards in a clever way.

Nothing wrong with your thoughts about Utilitarianism vs Deontological Ethics, but I think this makes more sense considering the context (because both Systems of thought would agree that it is correct to oppose Voldemort, though for different reasons).

  "virtue ethics"
#+end_quote

It's important to remember here that virtue ethics (in the classical sense) is very focused on 'shaping' your character. It is not something you are simply born with. You strive to become a more virtuous person by pursuing actions that enrich you in that regard. So yeah, this makes a lot of sense if you believe in the manipulative/deliberate aspect of Dumbledore: He's putting Harry in Situations (Troll, Quirrelmort, Basilisk, Sirius, Tournament) to shape his character into a "Hero"-type character. What Aristotle had in mind though was conscious action, not brainwashing.
