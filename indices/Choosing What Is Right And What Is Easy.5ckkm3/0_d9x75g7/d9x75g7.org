The "right and easy" quote is from the end of GoF, not PS.

My interpretation of "right vs easy" is essentially the choice between principle and pragmatism. Or if you want to put it in more philosophical terms, the choice between deontological and utilitarian ethics.

Under the former, people have certain moral duties such as the duty not to murder. Accordingly, certain actions are simply right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. Murder is wrong, even if you do it to save someone else, for example. Similarly, raising a child soldier is wrong even if it saves your society from a madman.

Under the latter, actions are judged by their consequences with the correct course of action being the one that maximises utility (i.e. happiness). This is the idea of the "greater good". Under a utilitarian system of ethics, raising a child soldier would be the correct course of action if the good that child soldier did for the world outweighed the loss of that child's freedom.

Seen this way, Dumbledore's "right vs easy" philosophy is effectively an extension of his opposition to the ideas of his youth and the philosophy of Grindelwald.

Ironically, the system of ethics that JKR seems to advocate via the themes in the books and Harry's own moral perspective is neither of the above. Rather the narrative seems to promote an ethical system somewhat akin to "virtue ethics", which is (broadly) the idea that being a moral person consists of possessing certain virtuous character traits. These traits are more than habits and are not shown by individual actions but rather are about having a certain mindset. For example, a person wouldn't be virtuous if they only avoided murder out of fear that they would be caught. Virtue encompasses your reasons for acting. So when we see Harry cast the Cruciatus curse, despite this being torture it does not make Harry immoral, because his character is still essentially a virtuous one.
