From a practical perspective, Harry didn't grow anywhere near as much as he could have, in power or in heroic temperament.

If I might suggest an alternate explanation: if Dumbledore had told Harry right then, Harry might have run. He might have put up with his aunt and her family rather than returning to Hogwarts. Dumbledore wanted Harry to become more attached to the wizarding world before he told him.

On the other hand, that would only be enough excuse to delay the explanation and some of the training for a year or two. Instead, there's no training, and the explanation doesn't come until Sirius dies.

I think Dumbledore went for what was easy: he didn't explain things to Harry because he didn't want to have to answer awkward questions or possibly rethink his plans. He was still clinging to his hope and didn't want to plan around the possibility of Harry having to face Death Eaters and Voldemort before graduating. It was easier to pretend that this was a one-off thing, that Voldemort would be gone another decade. And in second year likewise -- it was a shade of Voldemort, reconstituted memories, and Voldemort didn't have tons of those to spare.
