Dumbledore explicitly stated in OOTP that he didn't tell Harry about the prophecy because he- rightly or wrongly- prioritized Harry's childhood over his utility in the war against Voldemort and thought telling Harry would ruin his childhood.

Also, back then Dumbledore didn't know that Harry was a Horcrux, because he was unsure what avenues Riddle had taken to become immortal. All he knew was that Harry's scar was wonky and caused by Dark Magic and that Voldemort was probably still around for an unrelated reason. So actually, Dumbledore had no reason to treat child Harry as a human sacrifice, because he didn't figure out that Harry was a horcrux until book 5 I think.

Dumbledore is not omnipotent in canon, which is the big weakness of the allknowing!manipulative!Dumbledore interpretation.
