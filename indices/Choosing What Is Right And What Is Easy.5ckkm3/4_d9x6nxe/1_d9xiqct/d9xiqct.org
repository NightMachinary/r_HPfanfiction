Barely a devil, just a insurgent leader born to tragic circumstances that caused him to be maladjusted and willing to blindly try idiotic immortality rituals without long term testing.

Voldemort is a man, for all that he tries to deny that.

Even with Horcruxes, he could be repelled, killed again and again, reduced into a soul without a body, a fragment of what once was a man.

He could be defeated, if not outright destroyed, by anybody who got a lucky shot at him.
