I am reminded of this quote from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][Enembee's ff.net page]]:

#+begin_quote
  "The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation."

Dumbledore himself doesn't choose what's right over what's easy. Mostly, he's a puppet master pulling Harry's strings, even long after he's dead, and his motivations aren't even what's right or what's easy, but rather what's good for the plot.

I'll give one, just one, example.

Why does Dumbledore's portrait inform Snape that the sword must be acquired in an act of heroism and tell him precisely when to leave it (on the bottom of a freezing pond) instead of just arranging to leave Harry the means by which to destroy the Horcrux? I mean, throughout Deathly Hallows, it is obvious that Dumbledore somehow knew just about /everything/ that was going to happen (though how, we never know). Why the puzzles and heroics?

The answer is obvious. If Dumbledore had just told Harry and co. during Half Blood Prince how to destroy horcruxes and given them some minimal training and equipment to do so, there would have been no reason for Harry, Hermione, and Ron to trudge around endlessly lost, cold, and hungry in the woods. And thus, with no internal reason except for ones that we can endlessly rationalize here (though they ultimately make no sense), the needs of the plot are made more important than the need to have things make sense.

I often say that J.K. Rowling's plots are awful, and the fact that she's an utterly brilliant writer is what saves that. She's terrific, there's a reason we're all entranced by her books in spite of the fact that the plots are awful. She's so good, so very good, at what she does that we never even notice how bizarre the plot is.

So, yah, sometimes, Dumbledore chooses what's expedient over what's right, but worse, I think most of the time he chooses what's expedient at the meta-level for JKR, and not even what's expedient from an in-world viewpoint. His feeding Harry an hour's worth of information over a year in HBP, his generally keeping Harry in the dark about things he /actually needs to know/ (how about a nice 20 minute lesson on all the known ways to destroy horcruxes? how about giving Harry a wee bit of warning and doing a touch of pre-planning given that he knows Harry will have to go on the run?), his lack of concern for Harry's lack of skills (yah, sure, maybe he's not going to be able to defeat Voldemort in a fair fight without decades of training, but would Harry knowing a few useful spells like Fidelius so he could hide or maybe a couple of healing spells hurt?), all of this seems, well, like pretty terrible preparation for a hero. But, if all you're doing is setting up the plot of Deathly Hallows, well, in that context it makes sense...
