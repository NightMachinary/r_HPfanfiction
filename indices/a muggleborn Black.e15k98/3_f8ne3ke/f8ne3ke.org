''Jane Black'' mcgonagall called out, James potter lent over and nudged sirus with his elbow 'Another cousin of yours, Padfoot'\\
Sirius Looked at James and then back to the girl\\
''I Dont belive so she does not seem to fit the family naming scheme. plus I am sure my mum would have ranted about how my cousin would be coming to Hogwarts and will be sorted into slytherin like a proper black'' Sirius spat out with a bit of anger he then paused 'Maybe she is from an american branch, I know there is an offshoot of the potters living in america, maybe there is a black branch out there too.' James suggested 'you know Black is quite a popular muggle last name' Remus interjected joining the conversation for the first time.\\
Sirius let out a laugh 'poor girl, not being related to the blacks and yet having to share name with us, I imagine cousin bella will be quite peeved about a muggle sharing our name Hogwarts will be quite a doghouse this year '\\
Remus and Peter groaned with annoyance. 'Padfoot I thought we decided you where banned from using dog related puns ' James chuckled
