Personally, and based on your mention of the character possibly being in gryffindor, I would think Snape would be far more underhanded about punishment. In the moment, I think he would silence the class and cease all chatter, conversation, etc. to stop the student from spreading the information to others, and also in hopes of ensuring as few people cotton on as possible. Next, I would expect him to deduct points and give the student an evening detention, or several consecutive ones, â€˜for talking out of turn' (but really to try to rectify the issue of them knowing about this potion) wherein he develops punishments designed to terrify the ever living shite out of the student. These punishments would be closely related to the process and after effects of the potion in question, but I'll leave the details up to you. Depending on whether he saw intent to brew and/or use it, the punishments/terrification should be escalated accordingly.
