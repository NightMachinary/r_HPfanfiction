Then we need more informations about Snape. Is he simply Head of Slytherin, or is it the kind of story where he is really good friend with the Malfoys and Godfather of Draco (plus this twin).\\
A basic Snape would probably use the opportunity to take 50 points from Gryffindor, try to destroy a child self esteem and will to live and be done with it. A godfather may be a little more involved and either try to understand with the kid would do it or give some advices.
