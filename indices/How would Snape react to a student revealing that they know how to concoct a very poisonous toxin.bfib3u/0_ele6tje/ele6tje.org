Okay, this is my reading from canon- he wouldn't particularly care that a student knew how, or try to keep the student from imparting this knowledge to other students.

The Wizarding World is vastly different from the muggle world. The students are put in dangerous positions all the time, and expected to deal with it. So if this was a regular poison, that would kill someone very quickly, well. There are lots of things that can kill a person quickly. Knowing how to make a poison isn't any worse than knowing that if you stick a knife in someone, they will die. People with good judgement who aren't murderous psychopaths aren't likely to do either. Honestly, they seem to make things in potions class that could kill or seriously injure students all the time.

So first, by /very potent/, you'd have to mean something like "the fumes from making it will kill everyone in Hogwarts" or something on the level of what could only be a terrorist action.

Things he might care about are where the student got the information, if the student is very young or could only have obtained this particular recipe from Snape's private journal, or from a death eater family, or something like that, OR if the student was caught /making/ the potion or Snape saw that he had plans to make the potion- naturally why and what the student was planning would come up.

Also, if the student has a class next, then likely so does Snape. Even if he doesn't, I don't think anything during school hours would be termed a detention. "Stay after class" or "You will be staying after class," would be the way I personally think Snape would phrase this if he wanted the kid to blow off his next class for the emergency of talking to him about the toxin.
