I agree with this. There are some easy ways to make deadly poisons out of household chemicals in the real world, but a student just knowing about it isn't necessarily a cause for concern.

And Snape especially I think would be cynical about it. He might give the student detention and a tongue-lashing, just on principle, but I don't see him being particularly surprised or alarmed unless the student was actually making the poison with intent to use it. And maybe not even then, depending on the circumstances.
