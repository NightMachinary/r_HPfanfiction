Have you read LF74's other fics? *Soul and Body* and *Blood and Water* are both very good, I liked them better than Charon.

Don't know what his deal is with updating. Hopefully he continues, they are good stories.

If you want more WBWL-ish fare, the usual suspects (Ashes of Chaos, Prince of Slytherin, Sarcasm and Slytherin, Boy Who Lived) should all be good options if you haven't read them already.
