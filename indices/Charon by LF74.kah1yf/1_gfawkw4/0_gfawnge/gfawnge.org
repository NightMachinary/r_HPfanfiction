  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?
