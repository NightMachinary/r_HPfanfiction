Since you don't mind slash fics, I'd suggest asking on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] for some slash recommendations!

I love the way astolat writes Harry and Draco, individually and together. I'd suggest linkao3(Timeshare by astolat; Reparatio by astolat; Unseen by astolat). I also enjoy both Harry and Draco in firethesound's linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare). linkao3(Tea and No Sympathy) is in Draco's POV but Harry is great in it.
