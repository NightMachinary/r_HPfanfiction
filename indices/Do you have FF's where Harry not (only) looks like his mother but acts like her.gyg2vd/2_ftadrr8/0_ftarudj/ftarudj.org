I've been following this one and there's definitely things that I like about it. It explores Snape's regrets over how his own friendship with Lily turned out and the parallels with Draco and Harry, which is nice. But it leans heavily on the 'Lily has a temper because she's a redhead' trope and Harry has a temper too because in this fic he takes after his mother instead of James. There's been several chapters so far where Harry has gotten away with physical violence that he should not have, including punching the people he claims are his friends. I'm still reading when it gets new updates, but I think that I need Harry to face consequences for his temper for me to really enjoy this one. Otherwise he's just a bully that's getting away with it because of his resemblance to his mother and that kind of makes him what Canon!Snape always accused him of being and takes away from the authors point.
