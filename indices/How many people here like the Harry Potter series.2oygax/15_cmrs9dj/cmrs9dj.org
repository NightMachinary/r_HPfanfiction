I always enjoyed the books, still do. They're one person's vision of a magical world and admittedly that vision has flaws and inconsistencies. That's bound to happen, I think, when one person writes seven books where the subject matter and storytelling is evolving to match an audience that's growing up alongside the main characters.

Part of what makes fan fiction awesome is that it allows creative, talented people to take that magical world and reimagine it in a way that suits their own personal tastes. Sometimes the results are amazing and sometimes they're Drapple. ;)

I guess what I'm saying is that it's not impossible to love the books and to love the fan fiction stories that strive to iron out the little things about them that drive some readers crazy.
