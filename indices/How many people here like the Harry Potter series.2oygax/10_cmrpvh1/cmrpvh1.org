Ugh. I'll be attacked for admitting to this, I'm sure.

When I was a child I loved the Harry Potter books, because they were children's books. Then I read it a few years later and my teenage-fuelled cynicism took over and everywhere I saw shallow characterizations, deus ex machinas, poor writing, etc.

Now, I'm not saying the original series was bad. I liked it the first time I read it, and still now some of the nonsensical stuff--stuff I hate one one hand--is the stuff that gives the world its magical wonder.

I don't really want to get into a debate over this.
