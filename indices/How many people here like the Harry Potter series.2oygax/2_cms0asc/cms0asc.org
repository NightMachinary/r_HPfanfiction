For me, it is the best example of children's literature, especially for the modern generation. Other loved classics, like the Hobbit and Narnia are fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the HP original series is well written, funny, inventive, full of morals that children can understand and also interesting, and it conveys a sense of depth in the universe that only LotR manages to best. It's not masterful like Eliot or Dickins, but the story and the characters are all believable and flawed in their own way. In fact, that is the books star feature. JK's characters are fantastic, and she manages to inspire hate beyond comprehension in a government worker doing her job, and similarly scaled adoration for an escaped convict, mostly by the way the characters interact with others.

As a eleven year old, first reading the books, they inspired an imagination far greater than any other books could, and were not boring and dull like some other books could be. Of course, upon rereading, they are not as amazing as my primary school self thought they were, but they are very readable.

When I have kids, I will read them Harry Potter. I will probably be the person in the room most enjoying them, even if my kids have bugged me to read it to them the twentieth time, and have every single square foot on their walls covered in Gryffindor.
