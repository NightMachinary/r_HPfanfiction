I can't really read the HP books anymore. I see too much teenage angst and stupidity. I end up just annoyed at things.

However, I'm going to try re-reading at least the 3rd and 4th book for a fanfic idea I have so I can get clear up some canon vs fanon stuff that happened and characters reactions.
