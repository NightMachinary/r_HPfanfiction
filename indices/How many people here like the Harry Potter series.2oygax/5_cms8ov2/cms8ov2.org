Well, I learned to read English with the first couple Harry Potter books. I had Snape and Draco stickers on my first computer. I had a Harry Potter themed 7th birthday party. So, they'll always be special, but they were never my favourite, and I did go through a time (oddly also around the time I discovered anime, who woulda thought) where I disliked the Harry Potter series. Especially in the fifth book. I HATED the characterisation of Harry. When I discovered fanfiction, it was like a whole new world. Overall, I've settled into a place where, I think JK did a fantastic job pulling together myths from all over the place, world building, integrating symbolism from many different foreign traditions. But, her characterisation, her plot, her representations of people, and most especially her outcomes, feel very one-sided and unsatisfying. She made a fantastic world, but the story she told in it was full of plotholes and moral judgements, and could definitely be improved upon. And thus fanfiction comes in, brings together the best of both worlds, and everything is fantastic again :D
