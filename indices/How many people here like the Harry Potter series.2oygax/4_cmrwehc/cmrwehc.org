Yes. I like the original series. Granted, I grew up with the story, being exactly the right age bracket for Harry to be near near enough to my own age the entire way.

Looking back at it as an adult there's some horrendous fridge logic, but I have to admit that most of what bothers me, only bothers me because I care about the characters.
