It's possible to be disappointed with a few elements of the original series and still love it overall. I'm in that camp.

Books 6 and 7 pulled a few elements out of nowhere (horcruxes, wand allegiance deus ex machina) and retconned them into the series. Horcruxes and Dumbledore's death basically made Harry's task impossible, meaning /Deathly Hallows/ was inevitably going to be a unsatisfying as a story.
