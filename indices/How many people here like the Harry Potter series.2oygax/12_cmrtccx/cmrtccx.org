I do love the series but I think at least part of that was the fact that I read it growing up. I think if I had just come across the series at this point in my life instead I don't think I'd have the same love for it, which I guess is in a way also due to fandom because in fandom you can find a version that has exactly what you're searching for which can make it seem like it does stuff much better.

The pure size of the fandom in this case is a bit of a double edged sword because no matter what you think of the actual series there is likely a fanfic that plays it much more to your interests.
