The issue I have is this:

This first book is wonderful on its own. But when you realize that it's part of a series and read the rest of them it becomes apparent she lost control and couldn't reign it in.

I'm paraphrasing something I read a bit back, but I agree.

It is the what could have been that leaves the foul taste in my mouth.
