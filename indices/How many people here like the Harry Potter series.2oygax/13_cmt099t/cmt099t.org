I love them for what they are, how they are written and what they represent. They are books for children and later on for teenagers. Its a series of books that encourages the reader to grow with them, touching very important themes for children and teenagers, especially book two and five. They are truly magical for that in my opinion.

The reason most people say they dislike them, and I used to share that idea, was for what they could have been. When we look back to the Harry Potter books we only focus on the fantasy part, and we are very disappointed with it. The fantasy in the Harry Potter books was badly plotted and developed and we wanted more. We want complicated magics, philosophical questions and answers, an adventure filled with mystery and delight, and these things Rowling did not deliver. And, like everything, we focus on the bad things rather than on the good things, and we project our desires for what we need now, rather than what the books themselves are about and for the needs they are trying to fulfill.
