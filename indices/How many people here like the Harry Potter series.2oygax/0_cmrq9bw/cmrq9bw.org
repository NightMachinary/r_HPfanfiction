I still love it; although I'm aware some of that is nostalgia now. I also still think it's a good start for people reading fantasy books or children's books, and for a series that starts out aimed at children; they are well-written with multiple plot threads, foreshadowing, and lots of hints that later prove important which really draw in readers from one book to the next.

I also think, for the time they came out, they were quite revolutionary in some ways - things like Hermione's devotion to logic and intelligence were actually for the time unusual traits to find in a female side character in a book (ostensibly) aimed at boys, as the series was initially marketed before 'Potter-mania'. Before Hermione, at least in Western kids books, smart female characters would generally be also artistic, dramatic, or passionate - in that way I think (obviously helped along by the series' huge popularity) Rowling trailblazed certain new character tropes into the mainstream.

It has also dated a lot though, even in 15-20 years. Fandom and the power of fandom is so important nowadays; and with the variety of fans the things that don't feature become glaring - all the main characters are (supposedly) white, and marriage and pairing up is still the big goal for all the female characters - and of course, fanon is a lot more angsty and gritty whereas Rowling tries to (by the end of the series) write both an adolescent school story for a broad audience, a mythic hero-journey, and a racially-motivated war (all with largely PG-13-rated violence, despite the /evilness/ of the characters in question) - so we as readers, especially adult readers going back to the books, are left with some jarring features and inconsistencies - all the 'good' characters in the war refusing to use lethal force, for example, which ultimately ends up in some of their own getting killed down the line. The movies also skew some people's view of the books I think - both now, and for future generations of fans who will probably consume both alongside or maybe watch the films first, which to me will mean (cheesy as it sounds) losing a bit of the magic of the books.

As an introduction to fantasy and the hero's journey they're great though; and even now I still feel like the characters are almost my friends, too.
