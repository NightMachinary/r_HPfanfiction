I loved books 1-5. I literally cried when DD died in book 6, but I really loved it the second time through.

Book 7 completely ruined the entire Harry Potter canon universe for me. I felt like the entire name Harry Potter was a farce, and Rowling was secretly creating a series about Severus Snape using the name Harry Potter as a facade to push her pro-Snape agenda... I felt like the Deathly Hallows were a Deus Ex machina, and the final battle was just cliche after cliche. I almost put the book down when Harry came back from the dead, but I managed to push through to the end. When I found out Harry named his son after Snape I almost vomited all over myself. The entire epilogue is a stain on the Harry Potter series, and that's coming from a H/G shipper.

I hated the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. HATED. I still do. I hated it so much and was so upset about it that I never even watched films 6, 7 or 8. I've have never to this day so much as watched a trailer for any of them.

That being said, I read book 7 within 24 hours of the book being released for sale, and have not picked up the book since. I realize that I am probably being unfair and emotional about it. I am sad it ended how it did.
