I still love it, and wish that every time I read it was the first over again. A lot of that love is nostalgia, but a lot of it is just for the familiar, for the lessons I learned and the characters who felt as close to me as my own friends and family. For the one liners that still make me laugh, and for the deaths I still mourn.

People say Harry Potter changed their lives.. For me, it shaped it. I grew with this series. I aged with these characters and I lived with them and they lived through me and the love I had (/have/) for them. I can re-read this series and look at parts of me and see where they come from, what lessons I learned and what I believe in written down on the pages before me. I can find characters who I see in my friends and know that, on some level, I recognised those characters in the people I surround myself with. I can close my eyes and see every spell cast, every battle won, every magical moment lodged within my mind and heart and know that it will always give me that feeling of wonder.. I can pull these books from their place on my shelf and feel the anticipation for the adventures I have lived so many times before that /they are a part of me/..

Harry Potter was never a technically perfect series. Honestly I don't think it would have captured so many hearts if it was.

But it was perfect to each of us, in its own way.
