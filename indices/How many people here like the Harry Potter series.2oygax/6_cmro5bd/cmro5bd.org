I love HP, and have since the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. It took me a while to get into it, though, as I was exposed to another burgeoning phenomenon a little earlier.

A good litmus test is thus: did you discover Harry Potter before or after anime?

Pretty much any shonen manga/anime will do here. I was barely seven when I started reading manga, and it wasn't nearly as popular as it is now in the UK, but for those who read it, it did a lot to solidify those common tropes (like Beam Struggles, Power Levels etc).

Even reading Western fantasy novels might jade a person's opinion of the original books, since the Chosen One is typically a bottomless pit of power-ooze in a world where magic is finite and/or has cost.

Reading the HP series with that kind of preconception would likely inhibit one's enjoyment of the world and its plots, I'd reckon.

EDIT: Fanon seems to have a negative effect on many readers' impressions of wizarding society. Authors who feel the same way usually use Hermione as a mouthpiece and eventual battering ram against the imagined feudal system that wizards appear to still hold on to. That's okay if you're writing an AU, but canon? Really?
