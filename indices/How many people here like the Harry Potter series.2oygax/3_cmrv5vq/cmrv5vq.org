I liked it. I know it's a kid's story, and it has its share of inconsistencies (Pettigrew-Marauder's Map, TIME TURNERS, Felix Felicis, etc), but Harry Potter still is a fun, compelling story with its charms.

I think FanFiction is fun because it allows the user to reimagine and put his own stamp on the world. For example, I would prefer a much darker story with a harder magic system. Fanfiction has that.
