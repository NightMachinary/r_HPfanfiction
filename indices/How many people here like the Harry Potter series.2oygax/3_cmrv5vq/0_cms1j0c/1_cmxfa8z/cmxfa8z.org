Didn't Slughorn say something in HBP like Felix Felicis can be poisonous if consumed over a long period of time? I haven't read the books in a long time though, so I might be wrong.

But yeah, the map thing I can definitely understand. Dumbledore with a time turner doesn't seem unbelievable but also doesn't seem likely.
