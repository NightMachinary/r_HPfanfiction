/One/ alien, actually, though a massive one (if we're only counting the sapient ones, of course). And I didn't find him scary... imaginative, yes, but I don't get why people consider Yggdrasil to be "scary". I actually quite liked him and I was totally on Team Yggdrasil when we learned the wizards had tried to take the Main Contient from him.
