I read a fic once where Harry fancied Ginny from the first chapter. But oh no! She has Dean as a boyfriend! Some pretty good stuff happens in between, you know, with Voldemort etc. The adventure part was alright.

Then, Harry believes he must die. So, he says goodbye to Ginny (she'd broken up with Dean months ago, Harry still hasn't asked Ginny out, coward). And he kisses her, so she would understand that poor, misunderstood and shy Harry had always loved her (and he doesn't have to face the consequences if Ginny didn't like it, coward).

So you think after Harry miraculously survives and Ginny catches him alone in his PRIVATE ROOM in St. Mungo's, they'll confess their love, kiss and be happy?

NO!!!!!! They both say something like "let's pretend that kiss never happened. We're just friends." Harry, the fucking coward that he is, thinks "yeah... friends.... fml" BUT HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! I HAD MORE BALLS WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN, HARRY'S SEVENTEEN AT THIS POINT!!!!

That's when I stopped reading.
