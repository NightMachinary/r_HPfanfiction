linkffn(The Problem With Purity)

I wouldn't have been /so/ irritated with it if it hadn't had so much potential. There were some good ideas and some good writing -

/BUT/ it was completely buried under the usual clich√©s, including OP Hermione Sue, soul mates because destiny and stuff regardless of how they actually treat each other, and Ron and Dumbledore being portrayed badly, if not outright bashed. Oh, and I saw the ending coming from the tenth chapter and kept reading hoping I was wrong. I wasn't. I got /very/ angry. Probably angrier than a bad reading experience warrants.

There were good points. I wouldn't have been invested enough to be /this/ upset, even years after reading it, if the author hadn't done some things well. Somehow, that makes it worse than if I'd just thought the whole thing was crap.
