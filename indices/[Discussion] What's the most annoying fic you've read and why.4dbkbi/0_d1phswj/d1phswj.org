I have tried several times to read a fic where Harry refuses to play his part. He gets locked away. Luna, whose dad has pimped her out since her mom died, flies a broom into his holding cell. They embark on a private rebellion.

I love the premise but the story has that thing with Luna not to mention Harry with the mad sexy powers, he is wildly supa charged with the sexy magic and Narcissa just can't get enough.. I've never made it past that scene because the full body shudders make it impossible to scroll..

It's annoying because with a different treatment the story could be so great but.. no..

I'm all for a badass Harry/trio/good guys. I want good to triumph and evil to get bitch slapped. So Harry/Marry Sue is right in my wheelhouse but sometimes..the means don't justify the end.
