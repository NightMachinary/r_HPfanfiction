I'm surprised that /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ hasn't been mentioned yet. I could say so many things about how, and why, I find that fanfiction annoying. The main reasons, however, are the use of the fanfiction as a preachy soapbox, OOC Harry, author-as-Harry, and other factors. Perhaps it is the author who is my main gripe concerning the story, as not only have I heard that he tried to make money off HPMOR, but he acts quite immaturely (and defensively) when it comes to criticism. That, or he tries to invalidate or discredit much of the criticism against his work completely, simply because he seems to take criticism against HPMOR personally. From what I've seen, he also acts quite arrogant, egotistical, conceited, and generally like he's better than everyone else, and I absolutely /hate/ that attitude in authors.
