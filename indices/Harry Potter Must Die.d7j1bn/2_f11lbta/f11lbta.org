Harry Potter, SCP-Foundation style Type Green reality warper:

  PHASE 4: The Child-God: Sadly, the majority of Type Greens will eventually progress to Phase 4. During this phase, the reality bender becomes obsessed with the power it possesses and will attempt to utilize it for personal gain at the cost of others. This phase is marked by reduced empathy for other humans, inability to accept personal faults, and increased megalomania.

  Although warning signs are numerous, the key aspect of a Phase 4 is the use of their abilities to manipulate other humans. Teenage and young adult Type Greens will typically use their abilities for sexual purposes, while children will attempt to make strangers their "friends." Older adults may attempt to manipulate others for love or financial gain. Although a few cases have resulted where the Type Green then reverts to Phase 3, 99% of them will remain at Phase 4 until eliminated. For this reason, Phase 4 Type Greens should be considered Threat Level 5 (Immediate Threat) and eliminated immediately, as they represent a major threat to all aspects of the Fivefold Mission.

Of course, this differs slightly from the prompt. A Type Green is capable of warping the minds of everyone around them; Indy!Harry is only capable of warping the narrative. However, I mention this because it provides an interesting narrative explanation of how Indy!Harry happened, and because the ways of terminating Type Greens are often over the top and involve launching them into the vacuum of space after teleporting them to the moon.
