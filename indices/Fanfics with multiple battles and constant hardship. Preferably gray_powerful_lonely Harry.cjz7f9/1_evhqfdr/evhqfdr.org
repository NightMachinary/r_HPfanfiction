linkffn(Time, Mr Potter?) has 5 or 6 very detailed battle scenes with much ass-kicking involved. The last battle is like seven chapters on its own, and is frankly awesome. Also, Voldemort is mildly terrifying. Cheers

Edit: Harry is very much warhardened and sarcastic, I might add. Not as sarcastic as could be, but he still takes a fair few potshots.
