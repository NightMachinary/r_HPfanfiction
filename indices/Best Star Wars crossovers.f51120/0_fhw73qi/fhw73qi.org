Can't say I'm a giant purveyor of Harry Potter/Star Wars fics but The Havoc Side of the Force (and its alternate PoV companion fic) is the one I personally enjoy the most. Linkffn(8501689)

 

Shiver Me Timbers! is alright and is set during the original trilogy linkffn(11675231)

 

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking for is a Kathryn518 fic with all that implies. (ie. Very good quality and very long updates, but the pacing is slower and chapters are updated on the pace of maybe once every year or two) (although, even though based on the fic and the author I sincerely doubt it was meant to be written this way, it starts to get a bit too much "Harry accidentally acquires a not!harem" for my taste) linkffn(11157943)
