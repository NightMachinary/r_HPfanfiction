I would say the Freeze in Time thing, personally. Once a thing is transfigured into another thing, it is, for all intents and purposes, the second thing. So, if you did change a cat to a cauldron, for purposes of entropy and aging and decomposition and whatever other natural process would affect it, it is a Cauldron. Unless you turned it into a Cauldron made out of Cat, it'd act in the same way a Cauldron made out of whatever metal would.

I think it'd be hard to untransfigure the living thing though, since you have to change it back and living things are quite a bit more complex than cauldrons are. You put an organ in the wrong place and mister tibbles ain't gonna last long after you change him back.

Personally, I also think this can cause some issues and possibly explains overreliance on magic. One canonical thing I remember is that 'magic overwrites mundane reality'. So, when you transfigure something, magic keeps it in the second form (hence why you need to untransfigure it) and thus that magic will overpower any mundane reactions applied to it (you transfigure something into wood, you can't use a match to set it on fire because magic will keep it as the wood you transfigured - you'd have to use magical fire to burn it. Same with the no-food thing - they can't digest something transfigured into food).
