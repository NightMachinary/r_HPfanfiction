Sure, but then you extrapolate outwards like she did. That paragraph is a proposition (Magic can overwrite mundane nature) and then conclusions based on that proposition (therefore, magicals can cure all muggle diseases and survive extra things). I'm just extrapolating that original proposition in a different direction. For example, we know that Magic can overpower gravity with levitation spells, and that it seems to be able to create fire with no fuel, and can conjure water from nowhere, etc. (There's probably a dozen more I don't know about.) Thus, we can extrapolate from the proposition and the examples that magic has the potential to override mundane nature in all regards, rather than just medically. Which I then pull together with the food thing to get my initial idea about transfiguration from the first post.

Also, I reread one of your previous comments and wanted to clarify - the idea is not that transfigured items can't be damaged by non-magical means, only that they can't be changed by them. You can't digest transfigured food into energy, because that's changing the food into another form, and you can't burn a transfigured house to ashes, because that's changing the form. However, you could throw a rock through the window, because then the item is still a house and that's the conceptual-form the magic is keeping it in.

There are definitely flaws in the idea, don't get me wrong (eg. is conjuration even like transfiguration?), but it's just an opinion that I feel explains some things in an interesting way. I'm not trying to claim my extrapolations as canon or as better than any other.
