Oh, sure, that bit is just my extrapolation from something she said. She just said the 'magic overwrites mundane reality' bit. The rest of it is my 'headcanon' conclusions drawn from that sentence. Apologies if I gave the idea I was trying to claim that was canon - I really don't know enough to claim anything as canon or not. And that was the actual sentence she used, she didn't specify diseases only. Just that:

  'I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature.'
