Oh man, years ago I wrote a blog post on this, going into some of the issues inherent with turning living things into nonliving things:

#+begin_quote
  In Harry Potter, live things are transformed into non-alive things, and vice-versa, on a regular basis. Desk into pig and back into desk. Hedgehog into pincushion. Rat into teacup. etc.

  What's up with that?

  First of all, are the living things still /aware/ while transfigured? Likely not, since there's no sensory organs on say, a pincushion. But in HP, a transfigured hedgehog is said to ‘curl up in fear' when it's approached by a pin, so it's possible that some awareness remains.

  “But animals aren't aware in the HP-verse anyway!” you might say. Well, I somewhat doubt that HP's world is one of Descartean automaton animals. Crookshanks is a cat, yet is quite aware of what Sirius needs and his situation. Hedwig is an owl, yet Harry bonds to her, and her states are described as 'affectionate,' 'bored,' etc. The owls in general seem to have personality and awareness. Also, snakes have their own language. It's clear that HP animals have mental states, and I'm not even getting into magical animals!

  SO, if you transform a sentient animal into an inanimate object, is that the same as killing it? If you change it back, does it have its old memories and self? Whereas, if you transform an inanimate object into an animal, is that animal just born? Would a desk, turned into a pig, result in a pig with fully developed mental faculties? How about a dog? A monkey? Many social animals have to be raised with others to be well-adjusted. Does the wizard choose the personality of the animal they create through transfiguration?

  Can human beings be transfigured this way? Could a wizard change a grandfather clock into their grandfather? Would he have a 'soul?' or would they end up with a soul-less shell?

  Can sentient nonhumans be transfigured this way? Goblins? Elves? Centaurs? Do they have souls? Could a wizard re-create Dobby out of a footstool, if they wanted?

  Furthermore, if you were a wizard, could you transfigure someone, or an animal, into a chair made out of wood? McGonnagall's desk was presumably wood.

  Wood was once part of a living thing. If this is true, then you can transfigure a living thing into once-living matter.

  Could you transfigure, say, a pig into bacon? Then back?

  Could you transfigure a /human/ into a /corpse/? Then /back/?

  Disturbing implications all around.
