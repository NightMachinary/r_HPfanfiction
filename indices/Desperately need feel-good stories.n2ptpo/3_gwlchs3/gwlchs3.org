[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13546950][Sharing is a Myth]] by XxTheDarkLordxX

Summary:

“Draco,” Harry breathed, stepping forward. “I have been in love with you since the moment you offered me your biscuit when we were five.” Draco snapped his head up, breath rattling in his chest. “What?” He himself hadn't realized his feelings till a few years ago. “Or maybe it was when you snuck out of your house when we were nine and you declared that you would use your inheritance to buy me the world.” Draco felt his ears heat up and he wished Harry would stop.

** Harry took a step closer. "Perhaps it was when I gave you my dirty old jacket and you smiled so beautifully that I slipped and fell."

Or Draco doesn't understand the concept of sharing, but sets out to learn. Sharing turns out to be far harder than he originally believed, but it can be rewarding if he just takes a chance.

THEY GROW UP TOGETHER AND ITS ADORABLE! Also Sirius and Remus are Harry's guardians :)
