super feel good (both bc harry doesnt act like an idiot and because i love smart! harry fics) and also super interesting is the Mischief's Heir series by mad_fairy on ao3 great worldbuilding & very interesting basically during a bad summer harry asks for help and Loki responds which leads Harry to start thinking for himself and decide he wants to build a wizard space program
