Gays rarely are totally submissive in their behavior unless they are PowerBottoms (and even then they can be headstrong guys who do not take shit from anyone) or have a massive Slave-Master-Fetish.

I cannot imagine snape being a PowerBottom. He does like to call people their Master though. But that comes with said Masters being strong enough to make him pop like a balloon.

So yeah.

No.

You 1. need to really think about what you want. People are not distinguishable into "dominant" and "submissive", their behavior is, not the person. If you mean their role when it comes to sex, then its "top" or "bottom" or "versatile", not "dominant" or "submissive"; got it?

Stop trying to push weird Hentai-Tags into Fiction.

Srly.

This irks me every time someone writes stuff like that.
