I really don't understand this.

Fics are a hobby. A lot of them are already of such high quality for something free, sometimes even better than printed/published work.

There will be mistakes, some will be abandoned, consistency won't always be a thing. It's part of the game. Because it's a hobby and not a business and people write for FUN.

But to come complain about britpicking, I find it kinda rude. Especially considering that there is one french girl in the story and neither JKR nor many fanfic authors ever bother to write her beyond the more ridiculous and insulting stereotypes. But many of the authors, who are not English and have different native languages have to be perfect about their English because in a 10k+ free story you will be put out because it's biscuit and not cookie?

That's really so entitled and rude.

People really put themselves out there by sharing stories/their own take on the characters and their potential etc. It's even harder when, for a lot of them, it's a second if not third language used to interact with the most people.

And, truly, you're reading about a magical world, I find it strange that you can stomach magic and all its (canon) inconsistencies but not the fact that someone drinks tea with milk and eat biscuits or cookies or whatever else.
