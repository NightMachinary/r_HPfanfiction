I get irritated at dialogue. They say "dude" or "mate" too much. Which unless you watch a lot of BBC you probably wouldn't know but that's the small thing I can usually spot that tells me the author isn't british. The story might be fantastic but the characters sound wrong.

Doesn't necessarily mean I'll stop reading the story but I will notice it.
