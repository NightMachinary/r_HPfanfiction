It does bother me sometimes. With a high-quality fic I can look past it, but depending on my mood I've been known to stop reading something because of Americanisms.

It shouldn't be that hard to find a Brit-picker though. There's plenty of British people on this sub, I'm sure, so it's easy enough to post "hey, I've got this new fic I'm writing, would any British person be willing to look it over for Brit-picking?"

I'm always happy to look something over, all anyone has to do is ask. :)
