Honestly, I think this is an impossibly difficult ask. American English and British English are different languages with a huge percentage of the same words. If you speak one, your mind tends to fill in the gaps unconsciously when you listen to the other, so you don't consciously learn the differences until you have a specific need.

Why should "apple" be the same, but courgette/zucchini not? Why should "socks" be the same, but sneakers/trainers not? It's impossible for an author to check every word to make sure it's the same on both sides of the pond-- and you never know which word is going to be a problem because there's no pattern to it.
