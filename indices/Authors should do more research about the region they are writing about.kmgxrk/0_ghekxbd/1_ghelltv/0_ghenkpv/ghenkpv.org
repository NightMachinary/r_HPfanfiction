It would be nice if good beta readers grew on trees, but they do not. There are many more non-British writers than there are British beta readers. A beta needs to have the time to Britpick and the inclination to help with any given story.

I make every effort to get my story “right.” The formatting. The grammar and spelling. The word choice. The sentence structure. The arc of the plot. Continuity. The food. The geography. The speech patterns and accents (I need to have a browser window open with a chart when I write Fleur or Krum). The layout (Ginny's room is on which floor?) and the timetable (Harry has potions on which day?) and the character details (which food does Ron hate?). The timeline (had that been invented in 1995)?

It's not sheer laziness that keeps me from “bothering” to find a Brit-picker. It's a manifestation of the fact that this is a hobby, not a business.
