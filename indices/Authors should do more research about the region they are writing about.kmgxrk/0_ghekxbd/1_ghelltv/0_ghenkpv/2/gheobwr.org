Thats the sort of effort I appreciate and when I can tell its been done I always contact the author and thank them. But yes I suppose at some point it becomes a lot of work and choosing where to draw that line will be a personal preference.

FYI I have totally kept like 30 tabs open on chrome just keeping track of character traits before. There is always a moment of relief when you can close all of them. Not sure if this is of any use but I started using "toby" its a tab manager where you can store collections of tabs by date or group and can sync between machines and reopen them at any date.
