I'm with FicAccount on this, I'm afraid. I do sort of agree that britpicking is a good idea and usually makes for better stories, but I think demanding people do it is a bit much and I'd add that it's not quite as easy as just 'getting the words right'. Culture is immeasurably complex, and even words can vary considerably across very small regions in the UK. Think about the difference in slang between Manchester and Liverpool, say. They're, what, 30 miles apart, and both accent and dialect vary massively. I'm British, lived here and spoken the dialect my whole life, and I still can't keep up with the different dialects spoken over just England (and then that differs even more between various immigrant communities, areas, and then you've got Wales, Scotland, and Ireland too). I get that it annoys you and I understand, but I think you really are expecting too much from something people do for free on the internet without actual training. There's only so much time in the day and people have jobs or school in the morning, y'know? As a culture nerd who worldbuilds for a hobby, I can say with 100% certainty that just writing a lot of words is a lot easier than doing in-depth cultural research on somewhere you've probably never been to, or maybe even never met a person coming from.

It also depends on your priorities as a writer. I can very much understand why a lot of people don't do in-depth research into a new culture when they just maybe want to write a fun story about characters they love. But for the worldbuilder readers who like all the little details to be right, because that's what generally gives them immersion, that kind of focus is definitely jolting to them (I am one of those people, but I've mellowed over the years :D).
