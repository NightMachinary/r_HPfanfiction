Imagine how I, as an Icelander, feel when watching movies, and playing games that try to use Icelandic...

I always cringe when Thor tries to pronounce Niđavellir. It's beyond awful. Or Bifröst, Mjölnir, Heimdallur, Frigg, Valhöll. Oh, and Þór, and Óđinn. Do some research...

Or when you meet a little girl in Skyrim who's called Helgi. Helgi is a man's name. The female variant is Helga. It's lazy, is what it is.
