  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  Harry wanted to be outraged on behalf of the castle that he still considered to be his home. Hogwarts didn't deserve to have a piece of Tom Riddle lodged inside it like a particularly vicious splinter. But there was something he was annoyed about even more than the fact that he was once again alive at the same time as a once and future dark lord. For the first time in his life, he sympathized with Voldemort, and knew that in this one instance, Voldemort might sympathize with him. Harry looked at Tom head-on, and said, "Albus Dumbledore is a bastard."*Both turned down for the position of Hogwarts DADA professor, Tom and Harry have a few things to say to each other.
