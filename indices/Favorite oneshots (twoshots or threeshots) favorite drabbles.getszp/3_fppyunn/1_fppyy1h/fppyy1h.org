  Harry never gets a chance to cast his patronus that night when the dementors come to Little Whinging. A dead man does it for him. Regulus Black has spent almost sixteen years hunting Horcruxes, but now he's ready to face the Light---as well as his brother, and the friend he left behind.

  The kiss is nearly chaste, but also fierce, determined. We are strong enough to survive this, it seems to say, and Sirius can't help but laugh against Godric's mouth, wild at the edges, because they will. Both of them have survived this world, survived more than anyone ever thought they would, and there's nothing that can cripple them. All the things that have happened, all the losses, and they're still standing.(Or, Godric and Sirius, in a possible future. Follows from what could conceivably happen in And the brave man with a sword.)

  “Granger, what the fuck is going on? Why are we running?” Parkinson screams at the top of her lungs. Harry is thinking similar questions right now. Why are they running? They work here- it's not as though anyone would think they killed that unspeakable. He wants to just stop for a second and explain to someone but he can't see anyone that he recognises. Why can't he see anyone he recognises?(harry, hermione & pansy time travel to 1979.)

  At first he had always thought that it was normal -- that everyone could see what he saw. Eyes were windows to the soul, he had heard someone say, and he knew that that was true. But it had been distracting, seeing the truth shining through so clearly.
