#+begin_quote
  The first time Sirius sees her she's perched in the window at the north tower, feet dangling.She's a scruffy thing, he decides, her hair wild and her knees bony. There's a daring in the curve of her smile as she turns her head from the expanse of stars above her to look at him with eyes that are too knowing and too old for such a slip of a girl.-Or: Sirius learns to love Harry before she's even been born.
