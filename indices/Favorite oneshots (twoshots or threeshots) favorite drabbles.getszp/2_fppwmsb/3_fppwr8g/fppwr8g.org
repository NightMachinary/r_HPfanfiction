[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2062122][*/two monsters walk into a bar and they are both beautiful/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][/dirgewithoutmusic/]]

#+begin_quote
  The beauty and the beast; the boy and the land-bound siren; the least interesting quality in either of them is the shape of their skin. Fleur is vain, selfish, petty, pretty, and she falls whole-heartedly into a war that isn't hers. Fleur is horrified when Molly thinks she will leave Bill for his scars. She is horrified that anyone would think her love skin deep, because Fleur Delacour, above all, knows what it is to be skin deep. They have been casting her as that all her life, but this beauty was her skin, not her vanity. This was her birthright, as much as Harry's green eyes or Bill's red hair and the war on his heels. This was so far from her self.

  “I'm not a reverse werewolf either,” says the man. “I'm your godfather.”
