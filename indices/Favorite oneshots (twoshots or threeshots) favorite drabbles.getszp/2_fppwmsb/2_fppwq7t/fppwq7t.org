#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8660149][*/Who'd Suspect a Hufflepuff?/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/KenzieMa/pseuds/KenzieMa][/KenzieMa/]]

#+begin_quote
  After losing the war Hermione and Harry are left as two of the last alive. In a desperate bid for their survival they travel back in time to kill Tom Riddle before he makes his first horcrux. Using cunning and intelligence learned from their time at war they work to save the world before it has even begun to fall. Lucky for them, everyone overlooks the Hufflepuffs.

  In the war, Dean holed up in hollows and friendly attics and Muggle pubs. He drew Umbridge the Toad, noseless Voldy confused by the last dozen plus years of wizardly pop culture, the Ministry of Magic with its fingers stuffed in its stuffy ears. He drew Snape as Headmaster, his sneer easy after seven years of notebook margin practice. Dean drew the Dark Mark over London's skyline and he left his work nailed up around Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow. He signed his name. He had things he wanted to say. There were long days when he didn't talk to anyone-- walking old fields and long roads, sleeping in haystacks. There were long weeks when he only talked to strangers-- passersby, shop owners, sympathizers, snatchers who he traded curses with. He drew the Gryffindor Common Room, hearths all ablaze. He listened to Lee Jordan's radio show on the crackling airwaves. He drew his little sisters, who had gone to France with his mother and father. He drew faces from the darkened boys' dormitory-- Harry's long bangs hiding his scar, Neville practicing his dance moves for the Yule Ball, Ron asleep with his head on his thick Weasley sweater, Seamus grinning at him over a three a.m. game of cards.

  He knows, knows deep in his soul, that if Potter ever wanted to take over Britain, he could do it, and most of them would probably just cheer along.
