  “Basing your theory that either of our boys had anything to do with Voldemort's demise on a mark they have on their forehead that's likely to be completely healed within a month is absolutely ridiculous.” James and Lily survive that Halloween, and have a little trouble believing Dumbledore wants to tell the world their oldest killed Voldemort, or that he wants them to send their youngest to Lily's sister of all people.

  Harry's Love was, is, even more powerful than that of his mother by far. So much so that when the fateful night came and Harry stood strong and deathless, wearing a face that Voldemort sneered at but secretly wished to cower from, and accepted his fate, accepted the green and luminescent avada kedavra with wide arms, he did not in fact wake up in a white King Cross where a grandfatherly Dumbledore would greet him in death.Instead his Love was so powerful it reunited him with his Loved Ones.(A reincarnation story where every time Harry dies, he's reborn as someone important to him. Part One: Cedric, Part Two: Hermione, Part Three: Sirius, Part Four: Luna, Part Five: Lily, etc. etc...)

  occam's razor: a scientific or philosophical rule that favors the simplest explanation"Every Defense professor we've had so far has attacked me, which means the odds of Moody following the pattern are high. Occam's razor," Harry said."That's not really what Occam's razor means," Hermione sighed. "But you do have a point."

  The Master of Death is not merely a superficial title, but a functional one. This makes Harry's near-death experiences somewhat awkward.
