  angelsarenamederika asked: "Have you ever written any works about that clean, empty train station Harry ended up in? Or rather, what that place may have looked like for other people?" At eleven years old, Ginny Weasley almost died on the cold Chamber floor.

  In those halls, they faced down Death Eaters under the guise of teaching robes. They faced them with raised wands, raised fists, or just raised chins, these children who kept telling stories in the dark about Harry Potter, who was going to save them.

  George was afraid of heights, so Fred dared and dared him into going higher and higher--patiently, kindly, gently--until at nine George didn't want to get down from a broom, even for dinner. When one of them set it up, the other had the punchline. When one of them started it, the other finished the sentence, or the sandwich, or the job. When Fred stared after Angelina in the Great Hall, George noticed, and looked to his plate. When Fred waxed eloquent about the grace of Angelina's passes in practice, George thought about what that meant for Oliver's game strategies. He remembered what it had been like, being afraid of air beneath your feet. When Fred talked smugly about the gardens outside the Yule Ball--the little niches and nooks, shadowed and cool, Angelina's backless dress--George fiddled with their latest recipe for Puking Pasties. (a series of snippets on ace characters in the HP universe)

  Prompt: What about Lupin? Lupin, who lost everything the night James and Lily died, who forgave Sirius, who died in battle?--When they told him the news about Lily and James, Lupin finished the mission he was on before he went to Godric's Hollow. He stood in front of the Potters' ruined home and fell apart in the cold streets. He picked the pieces up, slowly, over years and years.In the first half hour, he remembered how to breathe. He picked up his composure sometime the next week. He patched together nights of sleep. Sometimes the stitching couldn't hold; sometimes he couldn't pull himself out of bed in the morning.Remus kept picking himself up and patching himself together. Today, he walked by a beautiful woman with long red hair and when she laughed he didn't flinch with sorrow. Today, he made a joke, the kind James would have collapsed at and Sirius would have smirked at. Remus patched himself together, scars and sorrows, kindnesses and chocolate. We are the ways we rebuild ourselves.(a brief, rambling character study of Remus Lupin)

  "A baby." Sirius repeated blankly, staring at James beaming back at him. "As in a little you, a baby Prongs? Pronglet?"

  "Or a baby Lily." James says, looking enthralled at the idea. Abruptly his face shifts, darkening and Sirius wondered if his friend was imagining 'baby Lily' growing up to go to Hogwarts and become the focus of several boys' - or girls' - romantic attentions. 

  "But, you," Peter started, floundering verbally in shock. "How?"

  "Aww, do we need to give you the little wizards and witches talk, Wormy?" Sirius cooed, patting Peter's cheek and cackling when his friend shoved him in response.

  OR three false starts
