“ Yes I know it's December , And you think you're writing sounds like the ramblings of a crack addled Marmoset but don't worry . It's actually kind of funny, And a lot of people are going to need humor very very soon. So Keep writing, In a couple months some random lady coming off of a 12 hour shift in the ICU will be reading one of your stories to get a good laugh After a hard day Of work at a hospital halfway across the globe. Trust me You will be glad you kept writing. Also maybe invest in a backup hard drive your computer is going to crash once a week for like the next three months.”
