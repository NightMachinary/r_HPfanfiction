No, you will not get more than 3 paragraphs into your massive, /Infinity War/-esque HP/Star Wars crossover; you're 14 and can't even finish a short story. You just thought of the Epic Final Battle Scene in gym class and don't care about anything else. Also, that girl you like is an apathetic narcissist who will completely ruin you, WASH YOUR FUCKING HAIR, and stop trying to hang out with people that wouldn't notice if you died.
