Chill out with the reading until 2 am. Your 12. Focus on school, while you may hate it. Chill with your friends more and stop being a cocky little shit.

Also you get rejected by multiple girls, and the in time you get one you get cheated on so dint write a sob story where Hermione dumps Ron and he commits suicide...

Dont get into weed either.

Learn to fight better so when you fight certain people you can win without injuries.

Just in general relax, it's not you v the world even though it seems that way and dont forget who you are.

Dont give up on your stories just yet, and make your own account don't share with our cousin.

Oh and stop daydreaming, you eventually start to hate yourself so stop thinking about being another person. Later on you will realise the shit that happens to you makes you a better person, and while it fucking hurts getting past the pain, the pressure is a win. Your not going to get your crush, some of your friends are gonna leave you.

I cant promise it's good right now, m and I cant promise it will get better. But I can promise your creative with your ideas so write for yourself.

Plan your stories, not make the story as you go and dont get into too much trouble.
