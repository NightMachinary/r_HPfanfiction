Yeah I'd say even if it's a really loooong fic, get at least half the fic + the end before starting to publish.

In Neil Gaiman's Masterclass teaser, he mentions that /editing/ is the process of making it look like you knew what you were doing from the beginning, and ever since I heard that I've noticed a distinct improvement in my writing, for two big reasons:

- Every chapter is now constructed with the deliberate intent of getting to the next chapter and making some kind of progress toward the end.

- I wait longer to release chapters so that I'm more confident I won't have to go back to fix something that wasn't going to work out.

I've been writing for a long time, but just in the last year that wee bit of advice has really stuck with me and made a difference.
