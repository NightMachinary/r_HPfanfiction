I wrote myself in quite a few corners before I learnt this lessons. It's when I started to write for a fandom with no magic, no sci-fi, no supernatural element at all that I finally stopped publishing before having a very good handle on my story, a serious outline and the end.

Since you can't go back to change things around, you had to find a way to get out of that corner, without contradictions. Harry Potter, you can always create new spell, a creature, some wizarding-world weird law, some obscure bit of magic that no one heard about before, to resolve the dead-end you write yourself into. It can be far-fertched, but it's the kind of things readers forgive if your story is good enough otherwise.

When you write a fiction in the real world, you do not have those tools. And it becomes incredibily hard to find a solution that do not contradict everything you wrote before.

And the added bonus to editing a finished story and then publishing it, instead of publishing as-you-go, is adding foreshadowing here and there in the first few chapters for stuff you actually come up on a whim as you wrote chapter 40.
