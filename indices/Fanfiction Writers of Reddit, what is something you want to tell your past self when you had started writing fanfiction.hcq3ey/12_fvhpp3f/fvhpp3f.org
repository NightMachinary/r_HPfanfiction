People don't get over stuff in 3 days times or less. Just had an "a few weeks later", if you don't want to bother with the immediate effect of a trauma, but don't have your character be fine and cool from things highly traumatics the day after the incident.

Do not start publishing until you have finished your story. I know you're impatient to have reviews and such, but it's better to wait, and be sure you will finish the story than to publish and never finish it. In 13 years, you will have people asking for a continuation. And you won't even remember where you even wanted to go. You won't even remember half of your O.Cs. And each new review asking for more will make you feel guilty.

Speaking of that. try to figure out where your story end before anything else. You've got way too many stories that end awkwardly or continued way past its own story.

One-shot are good and perfect for that little slice-of-life scene you want to write. You don't need to force yourself to create a whole story just to include this slice-of-life.
