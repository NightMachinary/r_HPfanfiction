Post the damn ending.

I wrote a fic back in, oh, 2011. I posted most of it, then rediscovered the fic a few months ago. Realized that I had started posting it. Realized that it wasn't finished on FFN... and that I totally had finished it.

So yeah. Post all the things.

(Not a HP fic - was a tidy-up fic for the cliffhangers after Harry Dresden/Ghost Story.)
