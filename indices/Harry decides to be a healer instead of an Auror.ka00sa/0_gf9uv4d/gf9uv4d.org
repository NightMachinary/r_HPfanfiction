That's the direction my fic /Cleaved/ is going in, but it's more business than strictly magical healing. Fem!Harry and her Muggle friend work to bring medical potions to the non-magical world. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13382072/1/Cleaved]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20553980/chapters/48790226]]).

My other favourites are /Harry Potter, Healing Hands/ (incomplete, but I messaged the author who's expressed interest in getting back to it) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6585807/1/Harry-Potter-Healing-Hands]]), where at the end of 3rd year Harry decides to become a Healer, and /The Mapmakers/ linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502]]), a Marauders-era fic where Lily Evans is training to become a Healer in her 6th year with Vold War 1 happening in the background.

/Reparations/ linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599]]) is a Harry/Draco slash healing fic.

/After the End/ linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/]]) has Ginny become a healer. It's a really old fic though (2001-2003).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8920787/1/]]) : WBWL fic, Harry is a potions genius.

Other threads that cover this topic are listed below (pretty much every relevant thread I could find regarding healing, unsure about the bash-status though):
