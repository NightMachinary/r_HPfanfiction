I feel a fox wouldn't be out of the question either.

It's closer to dogs: he's powerful, loyal (to himself) and devoted to his beliefs. He tries to ensure the protection of his horcruxes [safeguarding & protection]

It acts like cats: he is a wizard [magic], practices dark magic [darkness] and is very independent. He wished to escape death so he made horcruxes believing they were the solution [hope]

It's a fox: he's sly and cunning, He messes with his soul [spirituality] - creates horcruxes [creation] - to prevent his death [afterlife]
