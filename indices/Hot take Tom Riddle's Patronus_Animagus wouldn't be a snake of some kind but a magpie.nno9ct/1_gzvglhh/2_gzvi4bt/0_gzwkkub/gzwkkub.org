“Strangers” and “James and Me” opened my eyes (and ears) to the whole English (and specifically Northern English) folk music. There are two more songs from Unthanks sisters which are just awesome (both with interesting histories): “[[https://youtu.be/ogXQm70S24M][King of Rome]]” and rather horrific “[[https://youtu.be/wmhACB1ZPQM][The Testimony of Patience Kershaw]]” (be sure to find the lyrics for it, and [[https://www.victorianweb.org/history/ashley.html][the story]] behind the song).
