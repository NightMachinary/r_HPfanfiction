I loved it too! I want to read their Antithesis story? If that's their style of writing I want more!

These aren't Harry stories but the other "Dark but brilliant" stories I've read are linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian). Tbh everything by this author is completely brilliant. A bit dark and gruesome and just brilliant.

linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) is also VERY heavy but was really interesting. Not what I'd normally read but I dunno, I like that dark, ruthless tone I guess.
