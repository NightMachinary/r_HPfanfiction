I have read this and have to say the starting few chapters were interesting but it gets boring after a while .. Fudge character in this is overblown in opinion, HP is so OP and creepy that he gives Dumbles & Voldy pause but Fudge is considered an opponent for him .. even if he is a minister, I didn't like that part.
