  Will NOT be rewritten by me, message me if you wish to rewrite. The Golden trio tries to recover from the war, haunted by grief and guilt. Two of them try to find happiness and redemption through their love for one another. The other goes down a dark path of destruction, hate and pain that threatens to tear the trio and the world apart. Nothing is what it seems and nobody is safe
