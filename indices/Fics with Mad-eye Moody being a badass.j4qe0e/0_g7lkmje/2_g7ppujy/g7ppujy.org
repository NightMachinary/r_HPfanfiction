very well written, I enjoyed what i've read so far, but am leery of Harry/Fleur when Fleur is engaged to Bill. I just don't want to endure the drama of however that's going to end up.

Also, while there have been people described as "leering" and "stunned" the most sexual comments about Fleur have come from Fleur herself. Not an observation that means much, but if someone is interested in reading this because they like Fleur's character and like it when she's flirty, they'll like this fic.

Harry is well written and he fields the angst of his sixth year in a much less aggravating way to read.
