A Dark Wizard/Witch is just someone who learns and uses the Dark Arts extensively. That includes Voldemort himself, Herpo the Foul, Salazar Slytherin (probably), Crabbe, Malfoy, Bellatrix, Snape, and, more generally, all Death Eaters that we've seen.

How much Dark Arts one needs to do? It's subjective, just like there is no exact number of kilometres you must run per week before you are called "a runner". It's not actually illegal to practice the Dark Arts, so there is no need for a hard-and-fast definition.

In canon, "Dark Lord" was a title that Voldemort's followers and sympathisers used to refer to him in place of his name (sort of like "his majesty"), the way others used "You-Know-Who".

It is not, however, a generic title given to a powerful Dark Wizard or Witch or a leader who practices the Dark Arts. Grindelwald was a Dark Wizard, certainly, but he never called himself or was called a Dark Lord that we know.
