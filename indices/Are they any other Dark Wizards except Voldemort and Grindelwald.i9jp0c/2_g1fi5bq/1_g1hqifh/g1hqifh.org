Salazar Slytherin being on the list is a bit up in the air, he was a person who lived in ancient history and as long as he was dead, the truth could be altered and forgotten.

He bred a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets but for a thousand years it hurt no-one until it was ordered to by Tom Riddle. He lived in a time where the mundane were actively hostile to magicals and the school the built was a castle, a literal fortress designed to protect its students.

And then there's the Forbidden Forest, and what lives in there? An acromantula colony, one that has no qualms attacking and eating students. What do they fear above all? The Basilisk.

The Basilisk might not be a simple monster-weapon for a racist to murder discriminated students. It was a deterrent and defence against attackers (both mundane and magical)and it was safe to the castle until a Parselmouth could find it and enslave it.
