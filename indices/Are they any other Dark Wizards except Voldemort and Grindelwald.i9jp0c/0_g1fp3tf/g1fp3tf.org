If by Dark Wizards, you mean someone using dark magic (and generally being a bad guy), there are loads of them. Technically, all the Death Eaters (save maybe Wormtail) qualify as Dark Wizards, and there is probably a lot of people abrad pursuing some Dark Arts study without being a follower of Voldemort.

If by Dark Wizard, you mean someone gathering followers and waging war against one of several governments like Grinderwald and Voldemort did (I think the term "Dark Lord" would be more fitting), I don't think there are any currently in activity. Considering the level of cooperation between the wizards via the ICW, I doubt the world would have to deal with 2 world level menace at the same time without the British being informed, there may be some minor one (like a simple run of the mill terrorist and his bunch of goon) but far from Voldemort level. Magical history is probably full of Dark Witches and Wizards though (someone already mentioned Morgan le Fey, Ezekiel of Azkaban and maybe even Slytherin himself depending of how you look at things).
