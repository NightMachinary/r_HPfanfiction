In Blood Crest by Cauchy Harry becomes an OC necromancer's apprentice. linkao3(22022296)

Hit the Ground Running was a really popular fic about scar Voldemort befriending Harry. Unfortunately the author got a lot of bad attention from the fic and deleted it from all of the fanfiction websites, although pdfs and such can still be found floating around.

You also may or may not be interested in Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus by Carnivorous Muffin. It also stars scar Horcrux Voldemort except Harry is female, functionally immortal, acts closer to canon Luna Lovegood than canon Harry Potter and calls Voldemort Wizard Lenin. linkao3(15675621)

That being said if you like BrilliantLady you've probably already read her Perfectly Normal series. Despite the story premise it dives quite deeply into Pureblood Wizarding Culture and features a very Grey Harry.
