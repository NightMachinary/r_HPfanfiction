I think Britain might be different in that women could inherit the title of their fathers. Now, it doesn't mean that even if your children don't inherit your title, you don't educate them, you still want to do a fruitful marriage for your children.

If you look closely, in history, women often pull some strings (you can look into the case of Yolande d'Aragon who has been theorized to have orchestrated everything regarding Joan of Arc)
