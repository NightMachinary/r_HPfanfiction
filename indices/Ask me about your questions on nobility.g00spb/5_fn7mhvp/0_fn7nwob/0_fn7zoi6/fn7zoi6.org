Regarding the second son, the phrase “heir and a spare” fits.

Girls in British nobility, If they were properly educated, seemed to have had tutors at home. The current Queen was educated in that way. She was taught French, History, and the British Constitution. Her education was a bit unique though. Just more of an interesting note, I guess.
