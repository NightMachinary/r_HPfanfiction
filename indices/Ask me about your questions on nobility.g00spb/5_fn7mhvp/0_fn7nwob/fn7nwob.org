Most often, in lesser noble families, the mother would raise her children. In important families where parents would be at the Court of the Monarch, they would usually have nannies.

A special emphasis would be put on the education of the eldest son, but if there was a second son, he was always raised to the same standards as the eldest if possible, he was kind of the backup heir and needed to be well educated in case something happened to the eldest. The father would try to teach his sons as most as he could while doing his work (whether it is managing his family or a job such as lawyer). As far as I know I have never heard stories where there were designated hours to meet with your children.

Most often, mothers would teach practical skills especially to their daughters.

Though in some cases, all children would be raised equally to the same level in arts, mathematics and all in the hope of making a better marriage.

All in all parents would be very influential in the education of their children.
