I meant a city house as showcased in the show Downton Abbey. The family as their estate in Northern Yorkshire with the manor and they also have a city house in London which they use mainly for the â€˜London season' which is when young aristocrats reach the age of 18 and are presented to the monarch by a more senior member of their family (e.g. Lady Grantham presents her niece, Lady Rose MaClare). It's more of a secondary residence than one with an estate. A bit like how someone could say the Black family would have a countryside manor which would have been where Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa would have been raised while 12 Grimmauld Place (where Sirius was raised) could have been the family's city house.

I hope I was more clear this time and apologise for the lack of clarity in my initial question. I also would like to thank you for offering us to ask you about nobility.
