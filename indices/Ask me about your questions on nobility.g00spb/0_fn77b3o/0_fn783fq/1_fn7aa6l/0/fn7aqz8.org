Thanks for the clarification ðŸ˜‰ It was a thing in the past, some of my ancestors owned a townhouse but none remained in the family. Out of of all the people I know I have only seen a few. As I have said to someone else, taxes have risen in France and with a tax on property and the inheritance taxes, it is insanely hard to keep one unless you are really rich. I hope that answers your question ;)
