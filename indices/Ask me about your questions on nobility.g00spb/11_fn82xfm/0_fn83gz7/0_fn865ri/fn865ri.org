What about forms of address? I read a lot of trashy romances as a teen, and they would have (to make up a name) Henry Stanley, Viscount Abbotsford. In short form, he'd be referred to as "Abbotsford," which is his title, not as "Stanley." It always seems wrong to me to see "Lord Black" or "Lord Potter," because of this.

This whole concept is a bit difficult for Americans to start with, as we are so informal as to be savagely uncouth by British and European standards. We call people primarily by their first names.
