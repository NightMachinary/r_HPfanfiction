A peer may address an equal or lesser noble by the title designation. So your example of the Viscount Abbotsford, another Viscount, an Earl, or a Duke might address him as Abbotsford, but a Lord, a Baronet, or a commoner would address him as My Lord or Lord Abbotsford to start with and then as Sir. But if he was Duke Abbotsford, the only people who would call him Abbotsford would be other Dukes and royalty.
