Its not technically true that titles are attached to land in most cases. So you might have the Duke of Liverpool, but he might not own anything in Liverpool anymore. When the title was first granted it would have been because the family held large amounts of land in Liverpool and the surrounding area, but the land can be sold off without losing the title.

There are very specific exceptions to this. The English and Welsh title "Lord of the Manor", which is about as low a "noble" rank as you can get (it isn't even in the Order of Precedence), can be bought and sold as a commodity because it is attached the land. You buy the land, you get the title. The same holds true with Scottish Barons, which are similarly attached to the land, and are also below the rest of the ranks of the peerage.
