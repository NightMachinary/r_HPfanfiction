Yes it does happen, it is often this or a particule (de, of, von ...) though for the latter, having one doesn't mean you are noble.

The dash name also can be explained by the fact that both parents gave their names to their children or that a name was revived (the name was extinct, dude went to court to revive it and added it to his last name with a dash).

I have heard that in England, dash names are often signs of wealth.

Congratulations on going to Sciences Po !!
