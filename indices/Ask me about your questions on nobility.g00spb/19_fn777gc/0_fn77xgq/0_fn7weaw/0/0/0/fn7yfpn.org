Oh my bad, I assumed you were French lol.

It's exactly that until we are 15. We have formal parties after we are 15. I made some very good friends there so we still hang out outside of those events. There are no real events apart from those soir√©es. We have approximately once a month until it ends (which it did last year for me), but from time to time, people offer to organize a weekend at their place, but it's done outside of the official planned events
