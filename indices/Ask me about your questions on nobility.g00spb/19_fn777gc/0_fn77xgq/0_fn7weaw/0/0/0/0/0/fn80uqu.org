Oh true, my bad! I am sorry. There is one thing called "Le bal des d√©butantes" which is a private event (but if you have the right connections you could get an invite). It basically is a ball where nobility from all around Europe come to, I think you can find some pictures online if you want. I guess that is the more "open" of those high society events, and even then it's pretty private.
