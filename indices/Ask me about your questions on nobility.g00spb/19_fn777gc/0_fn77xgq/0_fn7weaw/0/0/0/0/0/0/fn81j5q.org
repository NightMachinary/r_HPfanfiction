Yeah, most old families aren't really public. My grandfather sold art, so i have a few second-hand stories, but the names don't really show up anywhere, unless you look for them. I think it's mostly new money(and royals, I guess) that generates news. But I don't read tabloids so I don't know about celebrities anyway.
