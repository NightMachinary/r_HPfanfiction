I guess my point on balls wasn't clear, thanks for pointing that out. The thing is I have seen stories where Harry (or another character) attends balls when he is 8. This is not the case, in my case, my parents' and grandparents' it happened when they were at least 15.

As for your other point, I am just trying to make some things clearer in the hope of having a "cleaner" trope ;)
