They have a job. I often see nobles going into banking, merging and acquisitions, sometimes politics (but more on a local level). There is quite a bit of nobles in the army, that is true. Some are CEOs, some work in the field of law. You often see them in great positions, networking is often easier in the nobility.

Outside of their jobs, they live their lives. Hunting is quite popular during weekends or holidays, especially for young adults.
