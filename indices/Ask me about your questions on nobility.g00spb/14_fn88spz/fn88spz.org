  - Marriage contracts did exist. Marriage contracts did exist but they were rarely done from birth (at least in the 20th century). My great-grandparents were married by contract but my great-grandmother was 20 and my great-grandfather 40. They hadn't met yet but the contract wasn't signed prior to their birth or when they were 2 y.o

​Marriage contracts also usually did not micromanage the actions of those involved and generally involved clauses that could invalidate them or release people from them.

  - Manors/castles were indeed a thing. That's hardly a surprise I know but there are a few things I might need to clarify. Families would live together in those manors until the paterfamilias died. For example, my great-great-grandparents lived with their children and their grandchildren. But at the death of my great-great-grandfather, his eldest, my great-grandfather, inherited the estate and his siblings, nieces and nephews left. My great-great-grandmother, his mother, lived in a separate house built for the dowager. In many fics I find that 3 people live in a massive estate and that their cousins do not live with them. (It's not a great deal I know, but still).

​And so was a costly upkeep as well as families ruined by the costs of keeping an estate.

  - Most cadets went in the army where they were usually officers. They often hoped to make a name for themselves and become ennobled later.

​ Officers' patents were usually bought. You did not start as enlisted and rose through the ranks.

  - Regarding inheritance (in France at the very least), until Napoleon, if the family wasn't incredibly rich, the eldest male would get everything. If the family was rich enough, it could be split in between the children. I think something can be done with family vaults in that they wouldn't only be for the Lord but also for the Cadet branches.

​ And you didn't inherit something off your twenty-times ancestor. Those inheritances didn't lie fallow. All those generations inbetween the founders and you - they inherited too and then added wealth or lost it.

  - Balls. Balls did exist, it was a source of pride to hold a reception/gathering/ball. To put things into perspective, they still exist today even for the youth. I was in what in French is called a rallye. Those were formal parties where parents would hold a reception (often in places they'd rent - if you want an example in Paris, you can google "Salons France-Amérique"). We learned to dance Rock for a year or two before having those formal parties. There was a buffet, almost always champagne. Boys were either in a suit or in a dinner suit (though when we (males) became older the latter was often advised ), females would wear a dress and as they grew older they would wear a long dress. Those rallyes were composed of members of the nobility or rich families.

​ Social events were not just restricted to balls (or even to only one ball a year). You had a whole [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_(society)][Social Season]]
