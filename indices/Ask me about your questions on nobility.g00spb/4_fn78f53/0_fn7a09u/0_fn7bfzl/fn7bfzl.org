In a very real sense, saying that "it is a lost title" is incorrect. In the UK, which is as far as my knowledge of the aristocracy goes, it is very common for hereditary nobility to have multiple titles. Take for example the Duke of Norfolk, he is also Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norfolk, Baron Beaumont, Maltravers, FitzAlan, Clun, Oswaldestre, and Howard of Glossop. Each of those titles is of relevance because certain parts of the family wealth will be attached or entailed to that title. And it can happen that a title (and any entailed property) will separate from the main if the inheritance criteria are different.

For the purposes of what [[/u/Ripper1337][u/Ripper1337]] asked, if the Wizengamot is based off of the UK House of Lords (which is a reasonable assumption to make) you can only have 1 seat it in regardless of the number of titles. As I mention above, property and wealth is sometimes entailed to a title and so can only be inherited by the inheritor of the title. However, often times that would only be property that was entailed and money would be divided up in the will as they saw fit.
