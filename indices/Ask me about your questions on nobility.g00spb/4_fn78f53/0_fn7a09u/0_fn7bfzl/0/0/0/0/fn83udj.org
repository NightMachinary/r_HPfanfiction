That's something different, on the state level, which probably is not completely useful for the aristocracy. Until 1804 there was no one legal entity which could cover whole Hapsburg realm (even the part in the Eastern and Central Europe), there were twenty or so countries (e.g., the Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, Archduchy of Austria) which just happened to have one head of state, who just happened to be from the same family. This was very much true for both Maria-Theresia and her son Joseph II. Only in 1804, Francis II created one legal entity combining all these countries called Kaisertum Ã–sterreich (with the special status of Hungary, but that's the different story).
