What you will find is that families "absorb" others. Everything they owned now becomes part of the family that absorbed the other. Their title will become a secondary title, that can be given to the heir of the main title, but for all purposes it is a lost title. In my opinion it is an excuse to give Harry more power. You see that in the House of Lords, if a title becomes extinct, it is extinct end of story, and the seat cannot be revived as far as I know. In France, there was an equivalent to the House of Lords but it didn't last long.

Legally you can take the name of one of your ancestor (up to 4 generations). It might "revive" the title of you will, but in France now that the monarchy is abolished, it would be a courtesy title.
