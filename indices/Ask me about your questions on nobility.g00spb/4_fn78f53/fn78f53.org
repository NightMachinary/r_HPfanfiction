In a lot of fanfics where Harry inherits things he usually also claims some houses that have become defunct. Usually this comes with political power in the form of seats in the wizengamut along with a vault of money/ valuables.

Is any of that how it works? You wrote how a vault would be left to the eldest or if the family was rich enough be split amongst children. So do any of these tropes have a real world basis or are they just excuses for Harry to be “powerful”
