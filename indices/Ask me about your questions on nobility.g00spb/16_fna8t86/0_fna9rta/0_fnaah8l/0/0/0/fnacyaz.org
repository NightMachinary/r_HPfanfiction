My Lord is magnanimous

Actually no, Lux just comes from the word light in Latin, I looked into it and found that it was also the root of the surname Lucas which is a popular name so I designed an OC family for a fanfic I dropped. The founding member of this family was a general, so I picked it up.

Lol I hope your children find your diary someday
