And how does one goes about and getting this Nobel title?

I expect by doing service for the country and getting one by the Monarch in recognition, but I could be wrong. Can someone else bestow Nobility? Like how in movies a knight can make someone else a knight?

Since almost every old family in Potterverse treat their own Monarch like 'Muggle Filth' I don't see how they can go around and get said Nobility bestowed upon them.

What about Heir bullshit? Can the current Head decide a non-blood relative to be the Heir even though there are blood relatives still existing who have a strong chance of ascending to the position?

Does the previous Head retain any power? For instance, the Head made the older son the new Head but said new Head is a cunt, so the previous Head wants to make his younger son the Head instead and kick the current Head out of said position. Does he retains the power to nullify his decision?
