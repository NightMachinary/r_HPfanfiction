In the UK, the heir to a title doesn't have the title but one rank lower. Instead they are given whats called a Courtesy Title, which is the second highest title that their father has. So for Duke of Norfolk, his heir is given the Courtesy Title Earl of Arundel. Subsequent titles are given to the heirs son, and the heirs grandson, if those titles exist.
