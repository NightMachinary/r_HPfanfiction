To get a noble title, the monarch has to do it through a patent letter, only the monarch of the time can. A monarch can recognize a title from another state in his state. A title can be taken back if a member of the nobility did something unforgivable. In France, Louis 14, in order to fund his military campaigns would sell titles of nobility.

Titles are hereditary and cannot be bestowed by the holder of the title to someone outside the family. When the holder of the title dies, it goes to his eldest son and by default to the closest male relative (in France at the very least).

There is something called in French the /d√©gringolade/ (collapse) which basically allows a Cadet to bear the title but one rank lower (if your older brother is a Count you would be a Viscount), or you can call yourself Count X (First name) of Y.

Hope that answers your questions :)
