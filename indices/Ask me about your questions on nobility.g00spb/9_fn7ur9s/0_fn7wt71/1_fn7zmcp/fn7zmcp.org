So, If Lucius Malfoy ran away from France to Britain during the French Revolution instead of helping his country, then even if his Nobility isn't revoked(which it probably is) it still wouldn't mean anything in Britain, right?

And what exactly does buying nobility mean? Do they actually get something tangible for their money? Tax exemption perhaps? Or is this nothing more than a source of pride?

It's not about letting the son having a title. Um...here take this for an example.

Arcus Black the head of the Black family's main branch made his son Orion Black the next head of the Black family. But not only was Orion an idiot who would sink the fortunes collected throughout the centuries via poor investments he was also thinking about poisoning his sisters and cousins so that the power would stay in his line and not go to some cadet branch.

Arctus finds out about this and becomes horrified since nothing is more important than family to him. So he decides to revoke his decision and make his Grandson Sirius the new head instead.

Now, can this be done? Oh wait, I reread your comment,

  When the holder of the title dies, it goes to his eldest son and by default to the closest male relative

That...seems really stupid. So Arctus Black can't even decide his own heir? Does that mean if he wants to save his family fortune he needs to poison his son?
