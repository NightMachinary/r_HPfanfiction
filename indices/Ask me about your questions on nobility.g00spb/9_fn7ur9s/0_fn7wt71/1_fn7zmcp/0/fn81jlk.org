Buying nobility was basically paying the king to be granted a title.

The case you talk about is pretty extreme, parents pay attention on how they educate their children and especially the future Head of House. If Arcturus noticed something like that going on, there might be a way for him to remove him from the line of succession (disownment is often used in fanfics), there might be a way to get a dispensation/exemption from the monarch, or he could try to place him under legal guardianship for adults (arguing that he is crazy).

It happens that heads of House make bad decisions, an ancestor of mine decided to invest most of his money in Russian debt at the end of the 19th century, with the communist revolution, things went pretty downhill.

As for your point for Lucius' title meaning nothing, I am guessing there is a way to have your title from a foreign state recognized in Britain as well (but keep in mind that at the time France was still the enemy to Britain).
