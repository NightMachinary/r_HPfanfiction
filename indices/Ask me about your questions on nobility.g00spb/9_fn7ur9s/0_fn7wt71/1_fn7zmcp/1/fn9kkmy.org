If Lucius was the Viscomte de Malfoy in France, but fled to Britain he would be addressed as the Viscomte but it would come with no power or particular prestige. Foreign nobility do have a place in the Order of Precedence (which is the formal list of how important people are in the country, based on the jobs they have, titles they hold, or qualifications they possess), but its further down than domestic nobility of the same rank.

And yes, its very reasonable to assume that people were murdered over the centuries to centralise power within their family, or to prevent someone disastrous from inheriting. Or alternatively, murdered a short while after inheriting when he was definite that they were going to be a disaster.

There are historically legal ways to remove someone from the line of succession, they were rarely used however because it was generally seen as important for the eldest living son to inherit. Otherwise there was the risk of legal trouble, or violence. That was the reason for having such a set and clearly defined form of inheritance for every title, to prevent open warfare over the inheritance.
