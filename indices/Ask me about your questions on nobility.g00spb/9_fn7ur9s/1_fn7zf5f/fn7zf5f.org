Noble titles sometimes come into existence through tradition, rather than being granted directly. In HP, I'd imagine they happened if a family became the traditional leader of an area of land, or a group of people. Over a long enough time, some sort of hereditary title may become attached to that position, and that title may mark them out as a "higher class".

Not sure what you mean about "previous head", in general the bearer of a title has to die for it to be passed on. The only real exception to that is King or Queen, who can abdicate and pass the title on that way. If they abdicate however, they are very much NOT the King or Queen anymore, and retain no power.
