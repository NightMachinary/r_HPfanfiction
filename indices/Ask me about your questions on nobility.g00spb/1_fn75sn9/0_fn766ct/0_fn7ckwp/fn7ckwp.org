So what you're saying here is that if a fic went that route, it would be reasonable to expect an extended backstory featuring a rich (even for given status) family, with many members and multiple cadet branches, and 15 house inheritance would be unlikely even so?

Since even if family was 'close', cadet branches would still pave their own path to some extent, possibly even abroad, and Voldemort would need to do a fair bit of traveling to get them all for Harry to have that big an inheritance - or at least all not-estranged members.

And one more question: Could you expand on backward inheritance? (Properites returning to main line from distant cadet branches). What basis is needed (how close blood relation, what about detailed, long wills that are Trope etc.)? Basically, how distant is too distant, and your take on "Sirius will reading".
