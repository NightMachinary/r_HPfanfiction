In the UK, the return of property to the main line would happen in the following way: Person dies with no child to inherit their property. Their lawyer looks for their closest blood relation, who would be the person with the strongest legal claim. That might be a cousin. But it could easily also require going back several generations and moving several sideways branches on the family tree to find someone. And eventually, if enough cadet lines die off, those properties find their way back to the main line. If a will was made which directed the property to someone other than their nearest blood relative, then it would generally need to be settled in court if the blood relative cared to dispute it.

In regards to how cadet branches would forge their own paths, there was very much a tradition in the UK that the first son would inherit, the second would join the military, and the third would join the church. More sons than that were unusual, but would generally take either military or church serve as well. Whilst their father would, by tradition, support their livelihoods they were expected to make something of themselves and not just be social dilettantes. After the death of the father, the first son would inherit the title and most of the wealth. The subsequent sons would all likely receive a financial inheritance, but would then no longer receive ongoing support from their brother.

Cadet branches going abroad to seek their fortune wasn't unknown. Sometimes they might get given their inheritance early to make it possible for them to set up elsewhere (there was a point in time, in the mid to late 1800s, when 2nd or 3rd sons shipping off to the US and buying up vast areas of land was very much a thing). It would certainly be a direction to take a fic, Harry discovering he has a 3rd cousin who lives in New Zealand or something like that.
