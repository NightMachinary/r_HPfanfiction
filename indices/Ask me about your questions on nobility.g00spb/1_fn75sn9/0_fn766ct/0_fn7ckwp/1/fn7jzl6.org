I think it would certainly make an interesting world-building at the very least. Even more if some branches of the Potter family (that could live abroad) decided to follow Voldemort to try and seize power for themselves. Cadet branches could go against the values of the Lord, certainly.

My take on Sirius' will is that it is perfectly normal for Sirius to give Harry Grimmauld Place since he was on the opposite side of the war with two of the last Blacks left. He could have given it to Andromeda I guess. He was his godfather after all. Some cousins of mine have managed to get the family seat despite being from a Cadet branch and not normally in line for it since the Lord who died single was The Godfather of one of them.

Sirius would not have been able to give Harry his title. In France, titles normally go from male to male which is why sometimes a very distant relation ends up with the title, so there is not really a too distant (For example, Henri IV was a very distant relative of Henri III and still became King of France just because he was the closest catholic male in line). However in the past when there was a monarch, he could have granted patent letters to allow a daughter to pass on the title of her father if said title was about to go extinct. However it is not possible anymore.

I believe (though I am far from sure) that in England some titles can go down female lines. I am sure that was the case in the Holy Roman Empire though.
