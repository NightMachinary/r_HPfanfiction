How it goes is that often noble families will have one manor or castle where they live their everyday life. This one often goes to the eldest. Some things are true in those fics in that it is not uncommon for a family to have a manor for their everyday life and a manor for their holidays. Then the bride might bring a house too like a villa in Italy as you can often see in fics.
