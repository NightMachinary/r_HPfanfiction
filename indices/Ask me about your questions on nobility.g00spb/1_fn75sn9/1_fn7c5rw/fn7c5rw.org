Its actually feasible to assume that a particularly wealthy and noble family would accumulate a number of homes over the years. You might have the main family home in the countryside, and the town house near to the Ministry and Diagon Alley.

But you might also have the old family home, which at some point the head of the family decided they didn't like any more.

And the dower house, for the mother of the new Lord after death of her husband so that she wasn't getting under the feet of the new Lord in the main house.

In a muggle family, you'd also potentially have things like a highland house in Scotland, a shooting lodge in northern England, a hunting lodge near a big forest, a seafront property somewhere nice on the coast, a fishing lodge near a lake or river etc.

Some of these could easily have magical variants, and so its reasonable to assume that just from inheriting the Potter property Harry might get Potter Manor, the old Potter Castle, Potter House in London, Potter Lodge near Hogsmeade, Potter Cottage in the remote countryside, and Potter Hall in Kent on the coast. If he also inherits the Black family property, then he gets their versions of all of those.
