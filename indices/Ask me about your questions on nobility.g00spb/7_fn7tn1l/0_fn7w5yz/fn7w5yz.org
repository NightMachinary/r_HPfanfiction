The nobility officially doesn't exist anymore but between nobles, we recognize "our own'" if you will. It's a tricky thing, during the Revolution all privileges were abolished including the privileges nobles enjoyed (such as paying less taxes than the Third Estate). However when Napoleon became Emperor, nobility was recognized again and he issued titles himself. After the first exile of Napoleon after the battle of Leipzig, Louis 18 (brother of Louis 16) came back to power, reinstating the monarchy. When Napoleon escaped and came back during the period that is known as the /Cent Jours/ (Hundred Days), Louis 18 fled. When Napoleon was ultimately defeated, Louis 18 came back until his death in 1824. His brother Charles X succeeded him. He tried to pass stupid laws censoring the press and dissolving the National Assembly that was beginning to oppose him. In French fashion, the people of Paris revolted and brought a new king to the throne, Louis-Philippe 1st, bringing the House of Orléans to the throne, ending the reign of the House of Bourbon.

Louis-Philippe was descended from the brother of Louis 14. Louis-Philippe's father known as Philippe Égalité (Equality) was a cousin of Louis 16 and had voted for the death of Louis 16. Louis-Philippe was outed in 1848, but left alive.

It's true that during the Revolution many nobles died. Some survived in France, others fled and came back when the monarchy was restored or when Napoleon came to power.

Nowadays, titles are allowed under the law but no one has to call a noble by his title. It is worth noting that usurpation of a title is a criminal offense.

Last thing if you are ever curious on the subject, because there were three Houses that came to rule France in the 19th century, there are three candidates for a possible restauration of the monarchy : the Prince Napoleon (descended from a brother of Napoleon I), the Count of Paris (descended from Louis-Philippe) and the Duke of Anjou (descended from the Spanish Bourbon)
