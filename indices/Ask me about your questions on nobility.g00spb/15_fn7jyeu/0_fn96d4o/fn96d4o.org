It is somewhat expected that you memorize part of your family tree (especially alliances between your family and another one as well as recent members of your family) but not necessarily learn all of it. For example, my siblings never bothered with genealogy whereas it is an interest of mine.

But then, with family reunions you are bound to learn a part of it without even trying too hard.
