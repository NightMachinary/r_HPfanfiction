Here's the thing.

It's not uncommon for a character to be an unreliable narrator. It can be a wonderful thing in a twisty plot to have a character who lies, misremembers or just plain wasn't paying attention.

With Rowling, we have a situation where the author is an unreliable narrator, which is a thestral of an entirely different colour.

It's bloody amazing that she made such an outstanding world an characters in what is arguably such a broken set of books.
