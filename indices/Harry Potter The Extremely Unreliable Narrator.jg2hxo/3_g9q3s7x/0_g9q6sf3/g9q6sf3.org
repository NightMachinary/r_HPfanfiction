As a kid who had to wait for months and even years for each book to come out, I loved reading each book as I discovered more about the magical world with Harry.

It was only years later and reading fanfics that made me think of stuff that didn't make sense in-universe. But I try not to think of them too much anymore because JKR was clearly making up stuff as she went along. She's no Tolkien who wrote the whole LOTR as one book which just had to be broken up into 3 parts.
