Most students and teachers merely ignore his off-hand, off the wall comments. He isn't violent and it doesn't block him from doing his school work or playing with his friends.

One exception is a slightly younger student named Luna Lovegood. She steadfastly refuses to entertain Harry's nonsense, and insists on correcting him every time he says something wrong. Although her friends (and his friends) have told her to give it up as pointless, she believes if she is just firm enough in corrections, maybe it will sink in.

Dolores Umbridge was a psychologist brought in to help students with the aftermath of the 'special teambuilding exercises'.

To help students who seem to be having troubled development at boarding schools, the association of schools created a program where students identified with similar issues were grouped and participated in extracurricular, teambuilding exercises. As a cross school event, it involved many students spending an away year at neighboring schools. Harry, Fleur, and Viktor were all identified as having trouble integrating socially and seemed to be living in their own world. (Viktor was convinced he was a major sports star).

An upper-classman (Cedric) volunteered to help the group out as part of his senior project. However, disaster struck Harry's group and during one of the exercises Cedric broke both his legs. He is now homeschooled while recovering.

As the students in the group saw it, Delores was brought in to help them work through any issues with seeing a fellow student maimed. As much as she tried with Harry, she could not get him to abandon his delusions.
