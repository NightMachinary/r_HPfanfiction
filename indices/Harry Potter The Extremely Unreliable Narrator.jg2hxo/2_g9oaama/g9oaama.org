I think I read a fic like this. But I think it was Hermione. Who in the epilogue published their lives as the HP books in the muggle world. It was something like "The Dursleys weren't that bad..." "Harry, they put bars on your window." "There were a lot of break-ins that summer! ALL of the windows had bars!"

I can't remember the name of the fic...
