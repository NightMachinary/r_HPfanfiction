It's funny you say that because lately I have only been using Tumblr for fanfic and I've been much happier for it. But then as a vanilla canon compliant kind of person I guess it suits me more. But honestly I have found it far more supportive and enjoyable than here or ff.net.

Edit: There's no need to be offended that I said I've found Tumblr more supportive than here. Here is better for indepth discussion and constructive criticism when I ask for it. But while I'm having a difficult time, I'd rather have the positivity I'm getting on Tumblr. The downvotes this comment is getting is kind of making my point...
