I definitely work to avoid tumblr discourse! I refuse to answer asks about cursed child or shipping, for example. But otherwise, I'm having a great time. At one point I had someone being a bit nasty, but I just turned my asks off for a few days and then it was OK :)

I'm sorry Tumblr turned bad for you. That's how Reddit turned for me too, which is why I distanced myself lately. I'm starting to ease myself back in, but I think the nasty side of the internet can pop up anywhere.
