I'm a writer almost exclusively to be honest, I don't read much fanfic. I also stick almost completely to canon-compliant which is why I don't always fit in here. I post on ff.net and ao3 under FloreatCastellum (where my most popular fics like Not From Others and the Aurors are), but lately I've been writing loaaaads of prompts and asks on Tumblr from Harry's childhood up to next-gen. Some angst some fluffy. I think I've written ~150 drabbles and fics of varying lengths on Tumblr since the start of this year. I've linked most of them [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets#mce_temp_url#][here]].

It's just nice for me to get a prompt and just go for it without worrying about people providing overly critical feedback or anything. I'm having a really tough time at the moment so it lets me have some theraputic writing while also getting that sweet, sweet rush of validation.

I'll still be looking for more constructive feedback with my longer fics on my main pages, but for now Tumblr is giving me the support I need.
