Reddit certainly isn't the nicest place either. I prefer the regular fanfiction reddit over this hpfanfiction reddit for obvious reasons. People will downvote anything you say on here just because it doesn't level up to their own ideas. The main reason I'm sticking around is for reddits posting wholesome memes. They just make my day :')
