Well, I'm upvoting you for your honesty. Not everything about Tumblr is bad, I will admit that much. I used to run a very popular blog about bass guitars and I had a lot of fun while it lasted. Tumblr, unfortunately to me, had just shown its ugly rear one too many times. I don't think the founders of Tumblr had ever imagined that it would one day turn into a platform for extremities either.

Either way, I'm glad you found a lot of support there. :) I wish more people on that platform would show some support for each other's differences rather than just praising the similarities we have.
