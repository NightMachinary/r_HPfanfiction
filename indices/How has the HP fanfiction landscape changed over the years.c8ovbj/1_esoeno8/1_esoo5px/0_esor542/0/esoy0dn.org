Yeah, definitely have seen nastier sides of the fandom on Tumblr, but no more than I have seen here, or even back in the old days of dedicated forums. I don't think you can pin it on the anon function of Tumblr either - I regularly turn my asks on or off depending on how cluttered my inbox is or the mood I'm in. If I'm in a sensitive mood, I can pretty much garuntee I won't have to receive any surprise feedback from Tumblr if I turn my asks off and don't post anything. But I feel like on ff.net or ao3 I'm always at the mercy of some random anonymous review on a story I wrote years ago.
