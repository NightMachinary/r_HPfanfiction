Wow that is so contrary to my experience with Tumblr! If anything I would have said Tumblr was the closest platform to the old LiveJournal sites and forum communities we had back on the 'old' internet. Devoted fans with passion and who were generally open minded to explore different facets of the world & generally supportive of each other - flame wars notwithstanding from younger and more ah, /intense/ members of the fanbase!
