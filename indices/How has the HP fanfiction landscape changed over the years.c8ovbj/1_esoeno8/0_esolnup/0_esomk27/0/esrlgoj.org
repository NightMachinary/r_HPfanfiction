  Tumblr has some aggressive brigaders who police others within their fandom for being "problematic".
#+end_quote

not really. how many ''problematic'' ships according to [[/r/hpff]], like dramione or drarry, are popular on tumblr? let alone just slash pairings.

[[/r/hpff]] polices pairings much more than tumblr ever does.

  There have been a couple of cases on Tumblr where authors wrote fics that touched on sensitive themes like domestic abuse or homophobia
#+end_quote

this is just wrong. there's plenty of fics with domestic abuse on tumblr, & a vast amount of slash fics feature homophobia from the wizarding world.
