Oh gosh, where do I start?

For starters, I never had a blog dedicated to my own fanfics or fanfiction in general. Nothing happened to me on Tumblr for that reason, but I did feel the results in the comment section on FFN. I write about Snape, which we all know is a super controversial character in the HP universe. There are a lot of people out there who don't like Snape, and I get why. He's mean, a bully, and he spends most of his days trying to correct his wrongdoings of his past. The problems started when heated discussions started rise up on Tumblr to the point where it felt like Harry and Voldy standing across from each other at the battle of Hogwarts. Pro-Snape bloggers started attacking anti-Snape blogs and visa versa. A lot of backstabbing got involved. Entire groups clogged together and attacked certain authors for writing controversial stuff. Bloggers had to abandon their blogs due to all the bullying. Authors have taken down their stories because they couldn't handle the hatemail they received anymore. Snape is just one example, but this can also be applied to a lot of of characters and happenings in the books (and other fandoms as well, but HP is still the biggest one out there).

Tumblr was/is basically the breeding ground for the anonymous hatemail, and unfortunately I fell victim to it as well. After receiving my umptieth death thread I went on a hiatus. I returned to my fic after having abandoned it for nearly two years because I grew more of a backbone and I can handle the bullshit much more easily now. That being said, the bullshit has also significantly gone down. I still get an occasional anonymous message telling me my story sucks, but at least it's no longer a daily happening.

I will stand by my opinion that Tumblr is nothing more than a platform for extremism. Tumblr recently banned all porn-blogs, but they haven't banned pro-Antifa blogs, neo-nazi blogs, pro-anorexia blogs...the list goes on. The site got its priorities backwards and it shows. I can't emphasise enough to people that they really shouldn't post their fanfics on Tumblr because they'll be at risk for some severe online bullying, especially if you write stuff that isn't the default popular thing to write about.
