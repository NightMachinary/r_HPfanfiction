I just remember when the Black Lives Movement was in full force, and after (or maybe during) a particular protest-turned-riot, people were advocating and making memes about how they hoped police officers would get hurt or die. I have nothing against BLM on basic principles, I do think there is still some racial inequality, but I still didn't like how they were advocating for the deaths of people who were just doing their jobs (trying to keep peace in the protest/riot) and might not have been racist.. so I said that and I got multiple death threats, and was told I was racist and a bunch of other shit... But ya Tumblr was toxic as hell and way to extreme about a lot of things, there could never be a middle ground.
