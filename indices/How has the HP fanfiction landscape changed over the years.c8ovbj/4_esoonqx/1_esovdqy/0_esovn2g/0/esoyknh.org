You should put it out! There are people interested, even if it's less than before. Always on my interest list. :)

Haha, er, a variety. Hinnys, Romiones, a Dumblewald, mostly action/adventure, and my main one is actually a pre-OotP AU book 5 that I've just rewritten. But I've also caved to the pressure and wrote a Dramione and 6 Drarrys because no one wants the canon compliant stuff. lol!
