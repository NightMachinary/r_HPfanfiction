Sounds like we enjoy the same genre!

Action scenes are hard, I think no matter how good they get, they can always get better. But the only way to really get better is to keep working on it, and to read (and watch, I guess) a lot of other action scenes for inspiration as well. For example, I don't know if you read The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher (amazing book series) but it is full of amazing, mind-blowing action scenes which are ALL incredibly unique and exciting. And they get more and more exciting with each book. I can hardly wrap my mind around how he's doing them. But I also think reading them has inspired me to improve my own, so I would definitely recommend doing that. Research! And hands on research is great too, not that we can get into a wand battle, of course, but for example in one of my stories I stuck in a bit of Muggle kickboxing, and I had taken a lot of kickboxing classes (just the cardio kind), and I thought that helped a bit to frame them.
