Yeah I'm not much of a fan of any of the weird ships with the main characters at least. And yeah action/adventure is what I tend to skew towards with some political things included. As I said post war reconstruction is what I'm really interested in. I used to browse through HPFF.com alot. I loved the summer after the war and the winters after the war. And there was a trilogy someone did about a major wizarding war against an alliance of dark wizards that took place like 15 years after DH that I can't seem to find anymore.

I should put something out but I'm never satisfied with my action scenes in particular. I've found very few people that can do wizard battles well and I would like to be able to do it better myself. Also I have to reign in my tendency to make Harry too OP lol
