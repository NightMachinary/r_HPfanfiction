I'm only interested in reading a particular niche of fanfic, Post-DH mostly canon. And it is much harder and harder to find these days. I'm interested in the recovery after war. I like reading about Harry as an auror hunting down remaining death eaters and such. That seems to be something no one has an interest in writing anymore. Sadly.
