I can't argue, but it's odd, isn't it? I think it's a combination of factors, but boiling down to: it feels like she hasn't stayed true to her own world. Ron the Death Eater may have been an interesting concept to explore in a fanfic, but making Cedric the Death Eater /canon/ - yeah, no. Likewise the Fantastic Beasts movies would make great fanfics, but they are terrible canon. And so on, with many other examples of things that, while they might not strictly contradict the text of the original seven books, are clearly at odds with it, like poo-vanishing.
