  but now people can attach shitty photoshopped cover images to their FFN fics.

This. I hate FFN cover image, most of them are awful and add nothing to the story. Some story in AO3 even add some awful banner that makes reading AO3 on mobile broken. I think author should use their time to create a better summary than wasting time creating those awful cover images. On the other hand, I can see that they're new at graphic design and they're putting a lot of time on those image. I really don't want to be that person who doesn't appreciate their effort.

To be fair, there are some good ones I see here and there.

But please, if you're one of those authors; just spent your time creating a good summary, edit your new chapter, or even watch a youtube video on graphic design instead.
