  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  “I can't tell anyone”, he repeated over and over again.Hermione helplessly stroked his back a couple of times.“Then don't”, she said.He stared at her with a bewildered expression.“Don't say anything”, she repeated. “Just play. I will stay and listen, if you want me to.”This is a bit of an AU. I was always a bit disappointed by the almost complete lack of music in the Harry Potter books. In my world, music is such an important thing... so I decided I would deviate from canon and make this a possible thing. I'm trying to stay as close to the original as possible though. It's mostly set in the sixth year and it's going to be pretty short. I'm planning on about 6 chapters total.
