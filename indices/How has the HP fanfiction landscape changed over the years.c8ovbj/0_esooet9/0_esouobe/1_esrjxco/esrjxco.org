I really liked linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox). It is certainly not a songfic in the proper meaning of the word, but I really like it introduced some arts to the wizarding world (also, there is a bit of music in linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot)). I remember my teenage years (and I am certain not the only one in this regard) were completely saturated in music (I liked “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” for this), and wizarding world feels empty without anything. Also, linkao3(2146464) (and yes, I dislike Dramione most from all straight ships).
