- AO3 is now serious competition to FFN. I find it superior to FFN, and there's a separate culture developing there that's way more engaging. AO3 caters toward authors, while FFN caters toward readers.

- Most of the fanfic hosts have consolidated to two or three sites, when there were once hundreds of geocities communities dedicated to individual characters and ships. There are a lot of good fics that have been lost in the void in recent years, RIP.

- Readerbase is now aging up. There are fewer readers than in the heydey of 2002-2007, but the average age of each reader is more mature, resulting in a gradual shift in story themes, complexity, and explicit content, if you're into that. There are way fewer shitty OC Mary Sue fics than there used to be, and the ones that exist are often deliberate parodies of classics like "My Immortal".

- Fanfic authors and readers are used to throwing canon to the wind, but in the last 2-3 years, respect for JKR herself has been tossed aside. Her fall from grace is a weird trainwreck to look back on in retrospect.

- Certain trends have fallen out of favor due to the clarification of laws regarding copyright infringement. No more elaborate disclaimers, no more songfics, but now people can attach shitty photoshopped cover images to their FFN fics.
