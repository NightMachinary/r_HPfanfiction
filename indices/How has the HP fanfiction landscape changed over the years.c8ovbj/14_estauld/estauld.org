I think I got into HP fanfiction sometime around 2001?

The fic wars were insane. Hundreds of pages of threads debating them, especially Harry/Hermione vs Ron/Hermione. Just about everyone had a side, and they could get vicious.

There used to be such an emphasis on being canon compliant. Sure, you were writing about what would happen in the future, but there was an obsession with not changing anything that had already happened. Whole archives wouldn't accept AUs at all.

I feel like there was so much more anticipation and magic and optimism in the fics that came out then, because we didn't know how it ended. Anything could be possible! Now we know how it ends, and that leads to a very different feeling in the stories. Not that the fics coming out now are bad, of course. They just have a different feel. More dystopian, maybe? Less blind wonder at the magical world, more pointing out its flaws?
