This, I have thought about this so many times. I first found fanfic in 2003, during the Long Summer before OotP, and during that time the fanfic landscape was super different. FFN was still requesting bloody HTML files in order to preserve your formatting. A lot of people were, understandably, trying to continue the HP story, usually from book 5 and on (guilty!), and most stories that I came across were adventure, "case fics" I suppose, and most ended up being Hinny and Romione, as everyone was trying their best to guess what was coming. It was a really exciting time. So I wrote fanfic for a while, lost interest, and then found it again in 2017. People kept recommending Debt of Time in my HP group, and I read it, and then I started reading and writing fanfic again. Now... finding canon compliant fanfics is a challenge. Finding Romione or Hinny, even, is hard. Canon pairings seem to get a lot of hate, at least in fanfic --- not sure if this is representative of the entire HP community. Romance fics make up probably something like 90% of all fanfics... and adventure stories in the style and feel of the original books are almost impossible to find. I just found an amazing one, actually, but it was written pre-DH, so that doesn't count. And all the tropes, all the new tropes! They were not things before AT ALL! All the wizengamot politics. Daphne Greengrass. All the new HP information available has done a lot to change it. And Ao3, of course. And now lemons are "smut." Haha. And back then, fanfics were something people did not really talk about, outside the community. Now... now, most fanfics don't even have disclaimers anymore! I still put them. Old habits. /shrug

The fanfic community is super amazing now, and it's awesome how much more mainstream and acceptable fanfic has become. Though admittedly --- and at risk of sounding bloody old --- I kind of miss the feel of the fanfics from before, where there was so much less bashing and less focus on romance, and on pairing Hermione with literally everyone ever. I feel like fanfics before were about the love of HP, and exploring the story more, and growing the world, and a fair amount (not all, of course) of fanfics now are about fixing it. Re-writing the story. Pointing out things JKR did "wrong." Canon-compliant fanfics are still my fave, so I have a little more trouble finding them now, and I end up reading a hell of a lot more AU things. And it's a bit harder to find readers for them too. But there is room for everything now, and either way I'm glad to see how much its grown! It's pretty amazing. :)
