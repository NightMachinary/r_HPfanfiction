I agree with you, I didn't find it as early as you did, but I did join the community in 2011. There were a lot more of the cannon compliant and cannon couples available, and there were disclaimers and things like lemons, which I kinda miss the term, and like you said, the focusing on the romance. But I also love that I can have conversations with people in my day to day life about fanfiction, I even got my boyfriend into it. I've watched it grow in the last couple years and it has been amazing to watch it grow and I can't wait to see where it goes.
