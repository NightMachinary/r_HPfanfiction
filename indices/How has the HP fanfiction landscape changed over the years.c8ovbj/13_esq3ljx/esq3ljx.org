In terms of the actual content, I find that the inter-character dynamics are a lot more realistic now, or at least better to read.

No falling into relationships from looking into each others eyes, some actual dialogue to establish personality, decisions having impact, etc.

You can still find bad writing, but as the speed of new releases has gone down the quality has trended upward.
