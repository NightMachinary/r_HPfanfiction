There's not as many ambitious fics as there used to be. People actually trying to write all 7 years of Hogwarts with it not just being a rehash... Prince of a Dark Kingdom, Forging the Sword, On the Way to Greatness, the Boy who Lived... those fics are all pretty much ancient by todays standards, yet there hasn't been anything like those fics in forever. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time I found an interesting fic in the wild on FFN or AO3. It's all about "trope subversions" which don't succeed, character pieces that bore me to tears, and the same old shit that was out of flavor in 2009 but is now being read by a new audience who doesn't give a shit.
