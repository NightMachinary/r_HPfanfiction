I'll come back to this and write a longer comment off mobile, but broadly gender demographics have shifted intensely to more...i would hazard to say, parity nowadays from the definitively mass female space it was both early on and for, I would say the first decade.

Ironically given the hammering it gets on this community, I feel like HPMOR was a big shifter in how fanfic was perceived and brought a lot of new male writers into the fold.

Slash was incredibly dominant in the early years which likely brought a lot of older LGBT fans into the HP world as a fandom, as well as cementing its popularity with fangirls like in other big fandoms (Sherlock, Supernatural etc.), as was Harmony. Canon pairings fluctuate in and out of popularity but Harry/Ginny has always been fairly popular.

Predictably a lot of the now-common or at least well known fandom tropes (Marriage Law, harem etc.) only really found their way in after the influx of male writers, and are so different to the earlier spirit of the fandom subculture that they tend to provoke a strong reaction, perhaps understandably.

I feel like racebending or imagining the characters as nonwhite is relatively new as a controversial topic. That is to say...go back ten or 15 years and it may not have been a /common/ story element, but I also feel there was less anger as a response to people reimagining or imagining the characters that way. I feel like socially people were less angry in general at that time and if you were a black writer who always imagined Hermione as black, then fine, cool, we're here for the ride.

Wolfstar was much more popular and Bellatrix as a love interest was much LESS popular before the later movies. Also McGonagall/Dumbledore was tacitly assumed to be canon for a long time. I'll have a think what else I recall from ye olde days!
