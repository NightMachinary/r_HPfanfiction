  i dont think anybody does this, though. it's always: you can read her as black, not that JKR originally conceptualized her dark-skinned.

You'd be surprised. Tumblr and twitter have their share of people who are fundamentally well meaning but come across as crazy in practice.

  You know, she's just seeing something different. People bring their own imagination to it. They have to collaborate with the author on creating the world.

Yes, this is just how books work. It's still not a magic panacea that addresses representation issues across the literary world and especially in YA fiction.

  they're doing this with fanfic, though. they're rewriting HP to be more representative.

I'm definitely not /opposed/ to what they're doing, and have read several excellent fics with this sort of racebending going on. My contention is that when an author does this, they've created this nice little world that they and their readers enjoy, and then that's it. Whereas if a fanfic author engages with a franchise that is more diverse from the outset, they are engaging with a much wider audience and have less work to do to set up their work as representative.

Here's a wonderful example of this sort of Desi Harry integrated into an excellent fic. I really just like linking this fic for any reason I can justify even tangentially. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]])
