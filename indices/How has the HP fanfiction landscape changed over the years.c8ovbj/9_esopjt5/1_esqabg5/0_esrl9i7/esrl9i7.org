  IMHO, J K Rowling wrote both characters as white and to pretend otherwise is to give her credit she frankly doesn't deserve.

agree

  and saying "Well actually if you look at the text, Hermione is canonically black/Harry is canonically Desi/Hispanic".

i dont think anybody does this, though. it's always: you can /read/ her as black, not that JKR originally conceptualized her as such.

  Ms. ROWLING: It's my belief, you know, people who have stayed with Harry for four years now, I doubt that seeing the movie could harm their imagined Harry or Hogwarts. But I know what you mean. I mean, I think a lot of people are going to feel that. They really want to see it. I met a really clever reader the other day, and this is what's wonderful about books; she said to me, I really know what Neville looks like And I said, Describe Neville for me. And she said, `Well, he's short and he's black, and he's got dreadlocks.' Now, to me, Neville's short and plump and blond, but that's what's great about books. You know, she's just seeing something different. People bring their own imagination to it. They have to collaborate with the author on creating the world.

  Instead of trying to squeeze representation from a dry stone that was mostly written and set in the early 90's UK, it would be better for people passionate about representation to support more diverse works from younger and more diverse authors.

they're doing this with fanfic, though. they're rewriting HP to be more representative.
