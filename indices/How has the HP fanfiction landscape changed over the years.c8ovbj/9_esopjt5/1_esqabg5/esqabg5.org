  I feel like racebending or imagining the characters as nonwhite is relatively new as a controversial topic. That is to say...go back ten or 15 years and it may not have been a common story element, but I also feel there was less anger as a response to people reimagining or imagining the characters that way. I feel like socially people were less angry in general at that time and if you were a black writer who always imagined Hermione as black, then fine, cool, we're here for the ride.

I'd say that there's a difference between saying "In this fic Hermione is black/Harry is Desi/Hispanic" and saying "Well actually if you look at the text, Hermione is canonically black/Harry is canonically Desi/Hispanic". Also insinuating that you are bigoted for disagreeing is pretty much guarantee for drama in the discussion. IMHO, J K Rowling wrote both characters as white and to pretend otherwise is to give her credit she frankly doesn't deserve.

Instead of trying to squeeze representation from a dry stone that was mostly written and set in the early 90's UK, it would be better for people passionate about representation to support more diverse works from younger and more diverse authors.
