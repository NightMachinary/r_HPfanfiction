  I see so many ideas which were never written REALLY well

Taure's recent post about indy!Harry stories touched on this for me.

Even though the indie genre is one of the more popular ones in the fandom, and even though there are dozens of /super/ popular indie stories, it's entirely possible that there hasn't been a capital 'G' GREAT indy!Harry fic that's been written yet. Same with the examples you have listed.

I think as the fandom ages, I think there is potential for newer authors to perfect what's come before and improve upon the past.
