Mostly agree, but still I see so many ideas which were never written REALLY well, and so many tropes are kind-of-almost, but never really well executed and completed:

- repentance/conversion of Severus Snape (or Dursleys). There are few Severitus stories which are half-decent, but I have almost always feeling the repentance/conversion is almost always half-baked. Petunia stories like that are even fewer and usually a way worse.
- Related to it, really well done and humanly understandable Dursleys are really far few and between. That obviously started in the canon, where they are just caricatures of human beings (yes, sixteen year old abused narrator is per definition unreliable).
- Related to the above, some stories where Snape comes to the conclusion that there are more fish in the sea (or from my native Czech: “Sun doesn't shine just for one flower”), and starts dating somebody. Of course, I would like to see some good Snape/Petunia story ... those which are there are usually most horribly written pieces of trash ever written. Or they are unfinished (“[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=9931566][Terms of Matrimony]]” by Galad Estel, “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1078809][Unexpected Universe]]” by flibbertygigget).
- Related to that, stories of the Hogwarts life from the point of view of professors. Yes, linkffn(3124159) is good, but it is very time limited and there are very few well written professors POV stories like that.
- Post-War stories dealing with better execution of the realistic life of wizards among Muggles (Northumbrian has some stories like that, but they are usually either unfinished or just one-shots). linkao3(1623053;8402590) are probably best attempts of this kind of story, but I have [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][a lot of objections]] about the execution of the former, and the latter has not been finished yet (and given the past history of the author, I don't think it will be ever finished).
