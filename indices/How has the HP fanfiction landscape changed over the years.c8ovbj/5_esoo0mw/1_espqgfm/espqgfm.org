  but I'd much rather know where the good authors have gone to write...what is the new hot fanfic topic?

The answer is: everywhere. Loads of authors got their first taste of fanfiction reading HP fics, but weren't exactly diehard fans themselves. So they eventually moved on towards other books, movies, anime, etc. to jumpstart their own communities there. There hasn't been a migration of authors from one fandom to another as much as there has been a diaspora, and it'll take another story on the level of HP viral enough for a decent % of the world to read it for there to be another concentration of fanfiction at the level that Harry Potter created.

I think that the closest thing there's ever been is Naruto, which had the similar kind of freeform worldbuilding that made it so easy for fanfiction to explore the story and the wild (if not quite as mainstream) popularity to inspire a huge body of work about it.
