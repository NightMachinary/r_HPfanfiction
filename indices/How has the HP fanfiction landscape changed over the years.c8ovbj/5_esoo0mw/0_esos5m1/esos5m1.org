Agreed. Harry Potter is so popular because even though people bash on the world building Rowling does, part of the appeal is being able to change so many things without it going against what Harry Potter is. Granted the series has its flaws just like every other book. I doubt we'll see another fandom like Harry Potter for a while because generally books just don't get as big as Harry Potter.
