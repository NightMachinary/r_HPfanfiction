I'll comment on something else no one has yet I think, the movement of trope of the year.

Was a never ending trope of the moment for quite awhile, since inception of HP FF. You would see the Harry/Ginny relationship years, super Harry years, super trunk years, super bashing years, super goblin years, slytherin Harry years etc

It feels like we're now at a place where the majority of authors are all trying to be original without leaning heavily on any tropes of the moment. Good authors that is, and it feels like there's been a fresh of breath air in the content and stories being delivered over the last 2 years.
