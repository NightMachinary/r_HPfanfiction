It can't easily be summarized, since it's one drama clusterfuck after another. But mainly it's about one manipulative person (and her many alt accounts) running her own little fandom empire and getting into fights with other communities/prominent members and their alt accounts. Cassandra Claire of Mortal Instruments/plagiarism infamy makes a cameo as well.
