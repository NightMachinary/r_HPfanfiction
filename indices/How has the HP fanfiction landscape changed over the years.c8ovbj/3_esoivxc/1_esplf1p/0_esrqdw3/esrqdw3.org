Back in the day, did other ships have names that weren't portmanteaus? I only joined the fandom after 'Hinny,' 'haphne,' and all those other kinds of ship names came up. I kinda like the idea that a ship name would be composed of actual words rather than a combination of names, but I understand the appeal of the portmanteau.
