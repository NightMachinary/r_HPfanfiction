Back in the day, FictionAlley had the giant list of ships. I don't know the prevalence of most non-canon names because I stuck mostly to what became canon (wasn't /actually/ canon in my fandom heyday though because I am old) I am most familiar with Wolfstar (Remus/Sirius), The Good Ship (R/Hr) and The Pumpkin Pie (H/Hr). The full FictionAlley list is here [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names]] ETA: Thanks for teaching me a new word /portmanteau/
