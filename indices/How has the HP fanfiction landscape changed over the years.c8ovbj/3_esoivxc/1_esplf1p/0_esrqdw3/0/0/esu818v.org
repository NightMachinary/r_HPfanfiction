Glad I could help you learn a new word. :) And thank /you/ for that list. The idea that they turned a ship name into well, a /ship/ name makes me smile. Some of these are hilarious too: HMS Flaming Toad, SS Leather and Libraries, SS Pyro Studies, among others. The SS Betrayal makes me laugh so hard, tho.
