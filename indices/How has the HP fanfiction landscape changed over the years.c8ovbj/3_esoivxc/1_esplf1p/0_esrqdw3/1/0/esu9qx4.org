The only portmanteau name I prefer is Harmony over Pumpkin Pie, but then again Harmony isn't really a portmanteau since the vowel sound used in the first syllable of Harmony doesn't match either Harry or Hermione. I like Haphne over Golden Ice because Golden Ice just sounds like somebody peed in a puddle and had it frozen. I think all the other ship names beat the portmanteaus though. In my head everybody who ships Harry/Ginny is going to be called an Orange Crusher from now on.
