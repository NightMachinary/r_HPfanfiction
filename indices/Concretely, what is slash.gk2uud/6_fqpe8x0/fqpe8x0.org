Slash is gay but from the time when it was neither taboo nor mainstream so (i) it was kinda edgy to have gay pairings in fanfic (ii) there wasn't enough queer representation in media so people tended to satisfy the need through fanfic

To some degree, this is all still true but less so than in the 00s
