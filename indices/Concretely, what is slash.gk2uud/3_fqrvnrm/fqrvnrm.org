If you're asking where the term comes from, it's from the early days of fanzines (printed fanfics that, yes, used to be sold in the days before the internet). The two character names were written as Kirk/Spock (one of the earliest slash pairings), etc. Eventually "slash" became shorthand for gay relationships because of the slash that was used between the two names.
