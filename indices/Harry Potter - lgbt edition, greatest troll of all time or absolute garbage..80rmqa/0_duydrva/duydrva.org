I think it's really funny, but also shows a nasty side of this community: There's a 99% chance that it's a joke and all those hateful reviews are completely unnecessary. There's also a tiny chance that it is actually genuine, which means there's a somewhat disturbed young girl writing it, making the reviews kinda despicable.
