I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains][Ink Stains]] by Dreams2Paper11 might be something you'll like. However, it's an MCU crossover so that's why I was not sure if you would still want to read it.

In the beginning of this story, twelve year old Harry actually kept the diary long enough that Tom stole Harry's energy and basically switched places with him. So Harry's in the diary and Tom kept the diary to toy with him considering that Tom is Harry's only form of human communication. Eventually, Tom got rid of the diary with Harry in it to the MCU verse where he was alone for a long time with Tom's memories that was already imprinted in the diary. You can guess he became sort of â€˜dark' due to learning everything about Tom's life from those memories up until Tom stop using the diary. Bruce eventually finds the diary after who knows how long Harry has been without human contact inside of the diary.
