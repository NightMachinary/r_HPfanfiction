The fic “Unforgiven Pride” deals with Severus Snape's recovery from physical and psychological damage inflicted on him, basically throughout his life. The author is very precise and detailed about Snape's medical treatment and Ministry-ordered cognitive-behavioral therapy. Her therapist is one of the best OC's ever! It's shown as Snape/Hermione but the relationship is in very early stages. Snape is staying with the Trio while he recovers enough to stand trial for various crimes during the Second Voldemort War. The author is currently researching the British judicial system in order to write the Trial chapters. She's incredibly detail-oriented and I have enjoyed her (novel-length) fic.
