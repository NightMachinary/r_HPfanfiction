As an author, I noticed that you get the most views on Saturday night (GMT)/Saturday afternoon (US). While I am not writing for the sake of popularity, updating on a weekend is a low effort way to tell your story to more people without much inconvenience.

My regular schedule is once a week (which results in an update every two weeks for either of my fics) but it is impossible to keep that up during exams. University has higher priority than any hobby so the readers will have to be patient.
