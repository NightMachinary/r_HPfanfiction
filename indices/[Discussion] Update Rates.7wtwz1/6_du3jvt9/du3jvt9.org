What I find optimal as a writer is to update once the whole story is finished. However, what I typically do is write two chapters and then post the first. The second will come two days afterwards. Therefore, I update about two times a week which leads to a faster completion time altogether. However, my latest story I've fallen behind on and haven't updated in over a month now.
