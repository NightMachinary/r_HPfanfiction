As a writer, it really depends on the story and how well things are going with it. When I've got my creative bits all lined up, I can update several times a week, but when I'm stuck on a bit, an update can take a few weeks. I know if I planned my work out better, some of this could be mitigated. Sometimes when working on a multi-chapter an idea for a one-shot will intrude and I'll have to set aside one to work on the other.

As a reader, I don't really have any update frequency expectations. I'm fine with whenever a writer I follow updates. I think maybe non-writers tend to be less tolerant of non-regular updates. I will say though if a writer explicitly says they'll update at specific intervals, then they should do their best to keep to that schedule. If you're going to set expectations, then you need to meet them. I'm looking at you, Rothfuss.
