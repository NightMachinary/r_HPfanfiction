I never start posting a multi chapter story until it's complete and in the past I've updated twice a week. When I start posting my new story I might do it a bit slower. Or I might be impatient to get it out of the way. Posting regularly never helped me get any reviews though - maybe I even got less reviews because no one ever needed to ask me to update. I don't know. It seems to be different for everyone.
