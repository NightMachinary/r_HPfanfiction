Ahh there's your problem then. That sub is trash. I'm surprised that they reject CC since they seem to swallow everything else but okay.

Still sounds like more of an insult to me. It's just a way to attack it's legitimacy: "Not written by JKR" (and everyone knows fanfiction is *bad* therefore CC child is bad)

There's plenty of situations where people reject canon or extensions of canon and treat it as fanfiction in other fandoms too.

Btw: Large swaths of Pottermore are just bad fanfiction too. Maybe some day everyone will get to my level of grump.
