I quite understand what hyperbole is thank you very much, but I don't think everyone who says CC is "fanfiction" are actually using a hyperbole. A lot of people (more on [[/r/harrypotter]] than this sub, I'll admit) consider it fanfiction for not being by J.K. Rowling, and from arguing with them repeatedly I can tell you they did /not/ meant that as just a figure of speech, but were utterly convinced it had no more weight or officiality than fanfiction --- that it was just "endorsed fanfiction".
