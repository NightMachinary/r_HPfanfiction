Wait, is this literally a rant about you not understanding the rhetoric device of hyperbole?

Wow.

To clarify: When someone says "This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard", there's a high likelihood that they actually heard a dumber thing before. They are using this sentence as a rhetoric device to explain how dumb this thing is they just heard.

I'm sure that 99.9% percent who say that Cursed Child is "bad fanfiction" are quite aware that it is not actually fanfiction.

Edit: I just thought of a better example. Have you ever heard the sentence: "I love The Matrix. Such a great movie. It's a shame that they never made any sequels." - What you are doing right now is like trying to explain to this person that there actually are sequels and that they are mistaken.
