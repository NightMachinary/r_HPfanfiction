I agree with you quite a lot. I don't think CC is fanfiction. I think it's a mockery of fanfiction and of fanfiction readers and writers. I don't believe Tiffany and Thorne are fans in any meaningful sense and I think the utter disposable careless awfulness of it shows absolute contempt for HP fans. I understand it being called fanfiction as an insult by people who have no love for fanfiction, but by people on this sub? Yes, that disappoints me.

I didn't care for it myself.
