I find 'Cursed Child is fanfiction' to be deeply insulting to fanfiction.

I get better quality product from people who care about the canon more (though their interpretations may vary) and I don't have to pay for it. Also, nobody is going to claim that I can't understand it unless I pay /more/ money to see it performed.

Thanks but if I'm going to pay extortionate prices to go see a theatre show, it's going to be Hamilton again. That at least lived up to hype.
