How else was he supposed to get Seven Kids through Hogwarts? Steal from an Orphan who happened to be a Hero? Anyone who would do that is sick in the head! Those companies didn't need it. If Arthur happened to skim a little off of the Billionaires that barely pay their staff any Wages? So be it. He couldn't, unfortunately, take too much and spoil his family, because Molly might find out, and he doubted she'd approve. A few Confundus Charms on the Criminal Muggles to "Forget" their bags of money they just stole, and the fact that Gringotts don't really care what you do so long as there's money involved... Arthur laughed at the idea of Goblins being friendly, they're glorified mercenaries, they'd sell you their own mother for the right amount of cash.

It was unfortunate that some of his Aliases were cracked down on, but Muggles were silly, they had no way of tracking him, because the Wards on the borrow disabled any Electronic Devices, and who would believe Foolish Arthur Weasley, a man that talks about "Fellytones" and "Ekelticity" and doesn't know what a Rubber Duck is used for happens to be a Master Thief.

Molly, of course, knew the whole time. It was blindingly obvious when "Ministry Health Insurance" paid for Ginny to see a Mind Healer, when Health Insurance is a muggle thing. No one else caught the slip though. As if a Ministry Job would pay THAT well unless you were the Minister or took a lot of "Donations" the way the useless Minister did. She knew he wasn't hurting anyone, and was looking out for his family, though she did wish they could be a bit more lavish, but she doesn't want to be a Malfoy, she just wants nice things. Maybe after Ron finishes Hogwarts, that way the family expenditures will decrease, and they could afford to splash out.
