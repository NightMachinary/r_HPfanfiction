In Core Threads Arthur is terrifying, it's not really explained but he seems to have been either an agent or an assassin. The muggle thing is just a hobby since he stopped doing whatever he used to.

And I think he used to kill people with muggle things as well, or atleast he threatens to kill Harry with either a rubber duck or an electric plug (I forget)
