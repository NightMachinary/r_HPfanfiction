I have this weird, hilarious image in my mind now of Arthur souping up the Ford Anglia into the ultimate Q-car/sleeper, getting into street races and wild police chases, and laying low simply by Being A Wizard. I came up with this little snippet - Arthur is a /retired/ street racer in it, but I hope it suffices.

Secretly, Arthur Weasley could not have been prouder.

Obviously, the loss of his beloved Ford Anglia - formerly one of the fastest cars in Devon - was a hard blow. One would expect him to be furious that his son stole his car and flew it all the way to Hogwarts. Molly Weasley certainly made no secret of how disappointed she was in her youngest son.

She didn't /know/, however. She didn't know that Arthur had, in his second year at Hogwarts, done the same thing - his own parents had overslept, so young Arthur had crept behind the steering wheel of his father's brand-new Austin Healey and, with the help of some magic he /technically/ was not supposed to do, raced it to King's Cross Station at breakneck speeds.

That moment was what had turned Arthur onto the sensation of speed - it had been such a /rush/ weaving through traffic, that upon Arthur's obtaining of his Muggle driving license, he had immediately sought out the local car-scene and made a name for himself. The find of the Ford Anglia was serendipitous - it was, at the time, quite a popular car. A lot of aftermarket performance-parts could be found for it, if you knew where to look - and yet it was unassuming enough to blend in with normal traffic and disappear in plain sight when the police caught onto the noise.

Of course, with a larger family came more responsibilities. Arthur had not been able to keep up his true hobby under the watchful eye of his wife and seven children, so he had taken to enchanting the car instead. He pretended to not know the first thing about Muggle technology to keep up the idea that he wasn't, at some point in his life, a notorious street-racer with a reputation for recklessness and an impressive record with Devon police.

Arthur privately hoped the Ford Anglia had done for Ron what his father's Austin-Healey had done for himself. It would be nice to /finally/ have a child to talk cars with, and an excuse to get back in touch with his old scene, see how it had changed. He only hoped that, should it come to that, Ron would be a little smarter about getting caught so he wouldn't have to Confund as many hard-working police officers as his dear old dad did.
