I love prompts like this. It's what draws me to fics where Lockhart is actually competent and impressive like his stories say.

Arthur as infamous...hmmm. if he knows how everything works then irs his way of correcting because he's acting dumb to it all and trying to explain away his muggle knowledge! Maybe he was a bounty hunter, people think they can disappear into the muggle world since most wizards don't know about it.

His favorite weapon, a hun called the rubber duck he uses to identify others in the know or something. Maybe its a sniping gun they had made.
