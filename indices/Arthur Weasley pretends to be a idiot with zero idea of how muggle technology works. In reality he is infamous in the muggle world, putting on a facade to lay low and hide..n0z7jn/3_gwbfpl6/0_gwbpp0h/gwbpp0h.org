Speaking of Lockhart, I just read a crackfic where Harry has a good relationship with him and gets detention on purpose to pick his brain on various topics. It's called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2][Harry the Hufflepuff 2]]" and is part of a series covering HP's first 4 years at Hogwarts. Lots of subverted tropes in this series. linkffn(7330591)
