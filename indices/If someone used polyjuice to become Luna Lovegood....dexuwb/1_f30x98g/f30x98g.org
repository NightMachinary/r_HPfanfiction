If some of Luna's attributes are caused chemically, maybe. Like if she has ADD or something.

But other than that, no. I think the text makes it pretty clear that the potion only physically makes you take on the form of another person - you're still you.

And even in the case of chemical “imbalance”, people cope very differently with things. Her flightiness can very well be a coping mechanism to depression, but the person who's taken her form will deal with that in their own way. Nothing to say they'd act the same as Luna.
