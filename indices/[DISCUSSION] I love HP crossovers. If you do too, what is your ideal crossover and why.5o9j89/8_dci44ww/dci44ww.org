I feel HP/LOTR works best. Sauron's Ring was pretty much another implementation of Horcrux, there was powerful magic in LOTR universe, and the line between good and evil was clear cut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][Steelbadger]] writes beautiful HP/LOTR crossovers, such as *The Power He Knows Not* and *The Shadow of Angmar*, linkffn(11027086;11115934). Unfortunately, his stories only have Harry going to there alone.

I much prefer multiple HP characters going to other universes, because if it was just Harry alone, the other universe basically assimilates Harry, and stories become Harry Potter in Another World. *Forging A King*, linkffn(8250381), is not bad, but introduces an AU element in LOTR universe that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. *Failsafe*, linkffn(11281891), is very nice, but seems to be abandoned. So, I'm still waiting for my first perfect HP/LOTR crossover.
