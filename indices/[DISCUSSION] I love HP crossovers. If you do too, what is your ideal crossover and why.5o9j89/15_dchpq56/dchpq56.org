[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849939]] A brilliant sg+hp crossover

I want to do a harry potter/doktor sleepless xover so much.

I also muse about a harry potter/assassin's creed crossover where harry devlops an animus to harves lost knowledge and regains some ability no one else knows of.

An hp/warehouse 13/dresden files crossover with harry/myka/bianca cuz joanne kelly is so hot he deserves two of her.

What if Harry accidentally entered the code string that created freakazoid one day while using Hermione's laptop during the summer before fourth year?

A story where doctor doom is harry's blood relative and he raises him. He and franklin would be bffs and constantly yelling at their families to stop fighting because it interrupts their playdates.

Harry's chosen as the villain in rolling bomber. Harry and hermione are pulled into the world of the black crystal. They're gone for a year for our side but a decade plus there and have two children. When they're returned, they magically deage and are preteens with a toddler and a newborn.

Harry potter is the number one anchor in the wizarding world. When Hermione granger is brought back to run his newsroom sparks, chairs, and entire sets fly as anger spills over as they attempt to work together.

Alice in wonderland/hp crossover. Hermione falls into the mirror of erised. Harry has to go in and find her. She solves all the problems on her own and he just has to get her home. "This is why i'm marrying you, you are capable!"

Dumbledore is visited by the spirits of christmas past, present, and future.

Death eater remnant tries to create clones of riddle and have them raised in the same way he was. A boys from brazil crossover.

Hp/lord of the flies crossover where they're trapped on an island when the school's schooner capsizes.
