Well, a challenge site I follow had a Sentinel crossover challenge a while ago, and at least some were reposted in [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/littleblackdresscollection][their own collection on Ao3]].

Then Keira Marcos has [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/the-alpha-chronicles/][the Alpha chronicles]], which despite being listed as a series is all standalone stories - it's possible a later part might bring them all together, but for now they can be read completely independently. She also has a fantastic Sentinel/SG:A crossover, which was the first thing of hers that I read.

A fem!Harry who turns out to be a Sentinel: linkao3(7728121). Wait, nevermind, that's in the first link above.

Actually, probably all of them are, except the ones that were from the challenge but haven't been reposted. Yet.
