I've always wanted to read a Matilda/HP fanfiction. There are a few short fics, but Matilda is a character that would perfectly fit into HP since the original book is so whimsical and Matilda is easily written as a brilliant muggleborn. I'd like to see where she goes in the magical world after she's invited to a school of magic.
