HP Crossovers are a mixed bag for me. Sometimes they are great, and sometimes terrible, even within the same universe. Most of the worst HP crossovers I have read seem to involve the superhero worlds, although I have also not come across any HP and GoT or LoTR or similar style ones I have enjoyed either.

The best ones that I have enjoyed have seemed to be exclusively Star Wars crossovers, perhaps because its easy to look at something like "the force" and compare it to magic, or maybe because it being a world beyond earth out in space allows it to flow better together.

As for crossovers I would like to see more of, I can really only think of 1 main one that I have not read. HP/Twilight. Now I may get some flack for Twilight, but I always thought it would be an intriguing crossover since Vampires are a known entity in the HP world, and the ages could be made to be similar between the lead players in each story. While Twilight is not exactly award wining writing, the WORLD behind it combined with the HP world intrigues me, as does the possible pairing combinations between the HP characters and the Cullens.

The only other possible crossover I had considered that I had not read yet was a HP / Shannara chronicles one.

Oh and something for "fun".... how about a HP / Zombie Apocalypse survival story?
