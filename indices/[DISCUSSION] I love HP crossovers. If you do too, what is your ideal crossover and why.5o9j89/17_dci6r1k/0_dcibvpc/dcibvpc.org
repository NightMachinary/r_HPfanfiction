Like with any big fandom, you have to comb through a lot of crap to find gold. There are a few good GoT and LoTR ones, I can find them if you're interested. The only good star wars one I've found was "the havoc side of the force". Do you have any other recs?

A zombie apocalypse would be interesting. The possibilities are endless. Can wizards get infected or does their magic protect them? Are zombies deterred by notice me not charms or not? Is this all an accident because Voldemort lost control of his inferi? And so on.
