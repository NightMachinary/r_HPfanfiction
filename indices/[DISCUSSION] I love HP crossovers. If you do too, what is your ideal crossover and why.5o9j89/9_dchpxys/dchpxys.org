So full disclaimer I feel like you're talking about universe travel AU where Harry and co randomly appear in some other story, but I personally don't like those because they bore me and tend to be too meta.

Ever since I saw [[http://imgur.com/milJS4G.jpg][this]] piece of fanart ([[http://shorelle.deviantart.com/art/harry-potter-and-the-attack-on-titan-397830915][source]]) I have been interested in a Shingeki no Kyojin x Harry Potter crossover. The main trios aren't too alike, but I still think it would be awesome. However, I have never looked for one because it would basically be impossible to be done properly and in the way I would like (no universe travel), for many reasons.

- SnK isn't over and we are only just finding out about the world.

- The characters of SnK and the world are so deeply intertwined that the story would end up completely different and the new characters wouldn't make much sense.

- The magic of their two worlds are too different to merge together.

- I get the sense that Eren and the main characters are like, literally the only people who have interesting lives. Whereas the same problem doesn't arise if you were putting characters into Hogwarts/the magical world in general. Anything can happen at Hogwarts and it always feels like something interesting is going on behind the scenes. That's why I generally tend to like stories more that are X to HP rather than HP to X.

As a plot, I feel like Harry being Eren and James being a more sympathetic and less fucked up Grisha would work well. Draco would definitely fit the role and upbringing of Reiner. I definitely think the world of SnK is much sadder than HP, so it would be cool to see a lighthearted spin on it somehow.
