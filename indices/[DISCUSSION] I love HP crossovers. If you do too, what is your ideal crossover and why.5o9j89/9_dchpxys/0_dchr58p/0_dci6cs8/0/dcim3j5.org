It might sounds like nitpicking, but generally when the Japanese word is “no”, you don't capitalise that letter when you make an acronym from it. I'm saying since you genuinely seem not to know and “SNK” got me a bit confused at first (as that's the name of the video game company that made, amongst other things, “King of Fighters” and “Metal Slug” series)
