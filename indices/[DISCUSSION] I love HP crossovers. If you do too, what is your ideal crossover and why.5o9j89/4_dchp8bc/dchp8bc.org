I don't really have a favorite crossover, most thing can be done well much fewer /are/ done well.

I follow more HPxGoT than anything, but that is because there are more of them written. linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is my favorite, but that's because it is incredibly well written, not because its LotR. Dresden crossovers have a lot of potential, but I hate them as a meld.

The fic I can't write but would love to read is a Harry Potter / X-Men crossover melding the two worlds. At some point in the past, around the time the Statute of Secrecy, some wizards attempted to turn muggles into wizards; Thus creating mutants. The pureblood cause would be anti mutant as well as anti muggle. With squibs being born as mutants and tainting families. I have the idea that Voldemort, and Harry, will be mutants that can also use magic which is thought impossible. Voldemort would possess an ability that isn't obvious and people wouldn't know about it. Dumbledore will because Tom would've told him in his excitement when he was 11.

I'm rambling, but the fic would be largely AU for both X-Men and HP with strong influence from them. Harry fights Voldemort, gets involved with the mutant cause in the muggle world. Could be a lot of fun.
