I've wanted to see a Dark Tower crossover or kind of reimagining where (DT spoilers I guess) Harry plays the roll of the gunslinger and through the doors on the beach he pulls through analogues or twins of Ron and Hermione rather than Eddie, Detta etc. And what happens after I think there's some interesting things you could play with there.
