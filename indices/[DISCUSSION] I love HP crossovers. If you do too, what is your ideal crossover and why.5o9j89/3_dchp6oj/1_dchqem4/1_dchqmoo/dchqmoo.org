The Crow is a comic series as well as a movie series (but the first movie is all you really need to watch. The sequels aren't nearly as good). They also made a meh TV show and some novels. Basically someone dies and comes back later to avenge them and anyone else who died with him.

Xanth is a 30 some odd book series where everyone has a single magic "talent". Some are very strong, others are weak. It's rather random. The first few books were more adult in situations but it quickly became aimed at a younger group and is infested with word puns. The plot is quite literally the same each book too, with only the characters modifying the plot somewhat.
