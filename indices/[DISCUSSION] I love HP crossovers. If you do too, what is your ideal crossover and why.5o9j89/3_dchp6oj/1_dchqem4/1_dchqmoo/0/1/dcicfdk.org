The Crow is on everyones "should watch once" list, I think. It's a bit older these days (1994), but it's very classic. (also, it is listed on wikipedia as a 'dark fantasy action' film

They're actually working on a remake, so, I'd recommend watching the old one before the new one comes out -- that's the one everyone loves and thew new one.. well. It might be amazing, it might be awful.

As for xanth. <deep breath> The first xanth book was published in 1977 and they have generally being published at a rate of one or two a year since then. (the 40th will be published in a couple months) .... I love the idea of the story world. .... but the books were written a long time ago by someone who is even older. Nothing wrong with older people, but it is to say, the stories when our world was a bit different. It's not to say that every woman's a blushing maiden barefoot in the kitchen... actually even in the first book there are examples of intelligent women, and proactive problemsolvers etc. Probably very progressive at the time. However, progressive for 1980 is still a bit behind these days. That said, Xanth is totally worth the read--just bear in mind that there's some "older dust' to brush off. :)
