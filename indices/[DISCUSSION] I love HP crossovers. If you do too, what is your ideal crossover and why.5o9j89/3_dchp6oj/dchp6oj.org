I'd love a long Dresden Files crossover where Dresden helps train Harry to fight Voldemort. The crossovers I've read of them are mostly short fics or barely had Dresden in it. The couple that are complete and star Dresden tend to be slash and I'm not a fan of that.

Another that I think would work well is a crossover with Piers Anthony's Xanth series. I'd like it to be more like the first few books, as in more grown up and less cookie cutter Mad Libs like the last 30 or so books. Harry would really be able to do some crazy stuff there but the puns would be a bitch to include.

I could see a crossover with The Crow having James or Lily coming back to wreck some serious wizard ass.
