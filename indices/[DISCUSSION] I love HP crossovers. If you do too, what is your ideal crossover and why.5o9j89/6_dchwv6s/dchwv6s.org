I read a lot of RWBY crossovers where characters from Harry Potter end up in Remnant and training to become Huntsmen/women and most of those I've read are pretty decent. Huntsman!Harry vs Voldemort... Harry would win for /sure/.

I also like crossovers with other magical/superpowered fandoms where the Potter characters learn the magic/powers of the other fandom- which ties into the RWBY fandom like I mentioned before. I've read/written for Winx Club and Miraculous in that regard, but there are several others that I like.
