I dislike most Crossovers, because they confuse Witches and Wizards with super-heroes (So everything DC or Marvel is right out). I've enjoyed a few Star Wars crossovers, because there's some thematical overlap.

The Firefly crossover by nonjon is also pretty great as far as crossovers go.

As far as potential goes: IMHO crossovers are literally the oposite of potential. They are popcorn entertainment and throw for the most part caricatures of known characters in other universes. There's usually no room for anything too in depth, and so no real potential.
