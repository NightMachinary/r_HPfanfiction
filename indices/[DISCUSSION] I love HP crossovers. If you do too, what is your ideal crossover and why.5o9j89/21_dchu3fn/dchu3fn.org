It's literally just fanservice, the ideas are interesting but the execution tends to be poor. There are a couple that are good/entertaining, but none that I'd name as my favorite of all time.

I liked one Fate crossover, Crosswinds of Fate linkffn(9340220) , which is basically the reverse: bog-standard Zelretch setup, characters from the Fate/stay night franchise stick around in the HPVerse with plans to leave after a couple years.
