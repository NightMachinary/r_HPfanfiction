I'd really like to read some more Tolkien crossovers. Shadow of Angmar has been a of fun. The problem I have is looking through the list, it's just Harry/Legolas slash as far as the eye can see. I suppose part of the problem is that if you like pairings, you don't have many choices, because there is a supreme lack of female characters in the Hobbit/LotR era.

Bit of the same issue with Avengers. Many male characters favors slash. I have read a few Harry/Black Widow pairing stories that I rather enjoyed though. linkffn(The Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair) and linkffn(Harry Potter: The Avenger by kb0) come to mind.
