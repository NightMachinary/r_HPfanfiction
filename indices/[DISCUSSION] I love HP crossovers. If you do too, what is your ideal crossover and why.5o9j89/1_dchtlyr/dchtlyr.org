I personally quite like /some/ Tolkien crossovers, where the Golden Trio (ideally, the Ministry Six actually, but just plus Ginny would work) end up in Middle Earth. I'd like a fic where it turns out the Elves still exist, they're just even more reclusive than the centaurs, as in, extremely little is known about them.

Could turn out goblins are all descended from Gollum. Now there's a thought.

I also really like Avengers crossovers. You cannot convince me that Fury & co don't have ties to Department of Mysteries around the world, or a couple of Muggleborns or even purebloods working for them. As well as contacts everywhere.
