linkffn(2926255). Harry has/plays Lily's guitar. If you can ignore the spelling mistakes in the first couple of chapters (spelling gets much better after those), and the Dumbledore bashing (Weasleys don't get bashed, more like Harry slowly regains his trust of them after an event he thinks that they didn't do anything about), then this fic is pretty good. Has some interesting/intriguing ideas and plot lines that I really liked. Hasn't been updated in a while though, and is also stuck at a cliffie unfortunately. :(
