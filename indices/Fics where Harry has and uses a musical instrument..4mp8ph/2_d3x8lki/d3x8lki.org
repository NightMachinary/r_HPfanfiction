my Darkness!Harry story has him with a guitar(of James Hetfield's) that is gained rather amusingly. He doesn't play it right away but I plan to have him taking lessons in a couple years.

I don't know of any others save a crack story where he starts a rock band with Hagrid and Dobby I think. And maybe Draco in Dragon Leather pants.
