Aight, now I never have to read this story. Thanks!

As for the people in the comments saying you missed the point of the fic, I pulled open the fic and it does not say anywhere that its a crack fic, and the only thing that could indicate that its intended as crack would be the humor tag.

Its my belief that if something doesnt explicetly say its crack (and even sometimes if it does) it shouldnt be excused from the problems of the fic.

That said, this is a great well written review and this line really stood out to me.

  and I just can't help but picture swole 11 yo Daniel Radcliffe, but with handsome Squidward's face on top. Also, he's like twice as tall as the other students his age, just to add to that image.
