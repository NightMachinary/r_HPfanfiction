The hallmark of a crack fic is thinking the author was on crack when strange and irrational things happen at random, and then at least some part of the world reacts to that insanity. It's almost always done for comedy.

Core Threads is powerwank, and it's not even good powerwank.

For Core Threads to be a crack fic, Harry would have to discover his magic threads, then use them to weave himself an ugly christmas sweater that makes anyone who sees him fall in love with him while also believing he is a 90 ton herbivorous dinosaur.

He then struggles with how the Dursleys have completely filled the cupboard under the stairs with ferns, trying to feed him and how Dudley keeps trying to hop on his back and "ride his awesome dinosaur" to school. In his frustration, Harry unravels core thread-sweater, only to discover that the Santa Claus knitted onto the chest has imbedded itself in his chest as a permanent tattoo.

He then falls into a mindscape in which Lord Voldemort's Horcrux and Santa Claus decide to have a gay wedding, and Q from Star Trek pops in, bringing Elton John with him to officiate the event. Guests include Abraham Lincoln, King Henry V, the entirety of the Harlem Globetrotters, and Julius Caesar riding a Tijuana donkey painted to look like a zebra.

When Sir Elton John asks if anyone objects to the wedding, Mrs. Claus shows up and screams bloody murder, not because Santa is about to make himself a bigamist, but because she reveals that Santa Claus is actually just six house elves standing on each other's shoulders in a santa suit. All hell breaks loose when it's revealed that all six of the house elves are just Dobby using a clever array of time turners. In the resulting chaos, Voldemort's Horcrux and the Dobby brigade fuck off, violently expelling Harry from his mindscape.

When he comes to, he realizes that he's somehow blacked out for the entire Hogwart's train ride and first month of schooling. In his mental absence, the sorting hat sorted him into Waffle House, and now Harry has to walk around with maple-syrup-colored accents on his Hogwarts robes and he's always followed by the scent of greasy butter and lonely midwestern trucker BO.

The good news is that as the only member of Waffle House, Harry gets to play every position on his House Quidditch team, which does by using the self-multiplying tricks he learned from Santa Dobby. His perfect coordination catches the eye of one Ludo Bagman, who offers to recruit Harry directly onto his new pro Quidditch team, the Accidental Horcruxes. When asked pointed questions about the team name, Ludo gets all shifty-eyed, drops a smoke bomb, and Batmans the fuck outta there.

The rest of the year passes relatively uneventfully, although Harry does have to contend with the fact that this giant smelly troll won't stop following him around, snuffling at his school robes trying to find the source of the delicious trucker BO-and-greasy-butter smell. The staff allow it, however, since the troll is remarkably well behaved and has very little tolerance for bad language.

With the troll's help, he earns perfect O's on all potions assignments.

At the end of the year, Harry fears that Snape is aiming to steal a precious treasure hidden behind a cerberus on the third floor, and when Dumbledore rushes off to the Ministry - not, mind you, via apparition or floo, but by riding his Jazzy Mobility Scooter at a whopping 6 kph - and Harry's response to his concern is to mobilize his crack team of Snape-stopping friends: the troll, himself, Moaning Myrtle, and SHIELD super-spy Black Widow in her disguise as Sally-Anne Perks.

They make pretty short work of all the traps, and Harry feels a little silly about bothering Black Widow with the whole thing, since the troll just smashes through everything. Even the fire trap at the end is inconsequential, as the wall next to the fire is not, itself, on fire and the troll simply smashes through the wall.

Imagine their surprise when they discover the final room contains nothing but a mirror. And who should be standing in front of the mirror? That's right, motherfuckers: the *real* Santa Claus. And he is not happy. Not one fucking bit. He will tolerate no pretenders to his title, and Harry's mindscape has transgressed against him. As such, he seeks the Philospher's Stone so he can craft a special Christmas cookie that, when force-fed to Harry in conjunction with a number of other ingredients, will cause his mindscape to shatter, leaving Harry bereft of his magic-thread power.

Or at least, Harry assumes that was his plan. He never really finds out, since as soon as Santa drops the first f-bomb, the troll roars out "language!" and smashes a fist down on his head, splattering Santa bits all over the final room.

That is crack.
