Others have pointed it out, but no, Core Threads is not crack. A crack fic kind of requires a certain awareness of itself - it's a parody of established tropes and themes. Intent on the part of the author is important, otherwise it's just a badly written fic.

There is a crack tag on FF, the author didn't use it. He used the Adventure and Humor tags. Also of note is this part of his bio

  However, every once in a while I feel a gap appears where a story is needed, and I decided to put down in type the concepts of "Core Threads". If I feel that the character stands up through the entire story, I am planning on sending him through other universes as well, as I feel the cross-over stories list is overly full with uncompleted stories and abandoned scripts.

  Hopefully I can stay on topic with my story, but it relies heavily on the characters. I tend to allow the beliefs and ideals of the characters to dictate how scenarios occur, and how people interact. As a result, I tend to be just as interested as the reader about where the heck all this story is leading too. I have a general idea and the framework for some cool powers and story plot points, but how these get introduced and when they get used? No idea yet.

I took Core Threads as seriously as the author probably intended. The humor wasn't funny to me, too formulaic and even, at the cost of sounding pretentious, juvenile, but it's recognizable. There are times when you can clearly see that the author understands the tropes of HP and is trying something with them, but that's not used for humor, mostly as a wink to the readers that we're supposed to recognize. Like commenting on the difference on the goblins between Harry and Rose's worlds, what difference does it really make that one is a monarchy and the other a loose confederation? Who cares? Most are like that.

So yeah, not crack.
