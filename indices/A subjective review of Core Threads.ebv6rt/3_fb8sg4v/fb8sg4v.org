I remember Core Threads as a fic i could get invested in early on, when it first started. It wasn't too bad then. Sure, i didn't like to duck thing, but so far it wasn't too bad, better than some other stuff i had read.

Due to this early investment, it took a while for me to realize it was crap and drop it.
