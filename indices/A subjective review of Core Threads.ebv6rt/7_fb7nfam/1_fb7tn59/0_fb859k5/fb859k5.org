  And, maybe this is fallacious of me to say, but this story is fanfiction, not a published work. If it was something published, I'd want my money back for the quality of it, but since it's not - and since I know it's an amateur's attempt at a "what-if" based on the canon story and common fandom tropes - I can get invested in the story more easily.

I don't think I held Core Threads to the standards of a published story, just a decent one. But standards are subjective in the end.

  Yeah, Core Threads isn't the best, but I've never understood people raging about works of fiction, especially when it's not the sort of fiction that appeals to them.

I'd like to say I wasn't raging, but some parts made me genuinely angry before I gave up and embraced nihilism. Towards the end I just wanted it to end. Mostly, I wrote this for catharsis - the thoughts I had on this would have haunted me for months if I didn't put them down somewhere, so why not write?

  That said, credits to [[https://www.reddit.com/u/Misdreamer/][u/Misdreamer]] for sticking it through and then writing out their thoughts on it. Literary review/discussion is always good.

Thanks!
