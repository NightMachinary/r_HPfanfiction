It does. Like, yeah, I agree with [[/u/Misdreamer][u/Misdreamer]] on a lot of his points, but I also wasn't reading /Core Threads/ seriously (as one might read something with action/thrills/drama), so a lot of those issues aren't nearly that bad in that context. And, maybe this is fallacious of me to say, but this story is /fanfiction/, not a published work. If it was something published, I'd want my money back for the quality of it, but since it's not - and since I know it's an amateur's attempt at a "what-if" based on the canon story and common fandom tropes - I can get invested in the story more easily.

Yeah, Core Threads isn't the best, but I've never understood people raging about works of fiction, especially when it's not the sort of fiction that appeals to them.

That said, credits to [[/u/Misdreamer][u/Misdreamer]] for sticking it through and then writing out their thoughts on it. Literary review/discussion is always good.
