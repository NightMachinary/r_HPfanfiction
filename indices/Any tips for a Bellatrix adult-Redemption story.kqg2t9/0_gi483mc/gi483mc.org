Uhhh...to be honest, that's such a heavy job I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole without heavy AU elements - what canon Bellatrix did, is so out there crazy it's hard to imagine her as something else than absolutely insane, or as a result of heavy mental illness, and I can't begin to think how she could approach anywhere near redeemed and not be too disgusted with herself to live. In any way, I'd advise against too upbeat a happy ending for her, and minimize humor, because if treated without AU explanations for why she did what she did (and I have a feeling that's what you're going for, from your post?) too cheerful a happy ending might leave a bad taste overall...

I think for something to work, you'd want to try making her in her early years likeable, and do a good job explaining her descent into darkness - it'd help go through the 'how in the world can she even BE redeemed' mental jump on the idea of redeemed adult Bellatrix. Don't take me wrong, I'm not in the 'you must hate the magical nazis' camp here, I love stories about HP villains, I love reading dark/evil scenarios, and it's interesting to see redeeming scenarios for when they're younger/still starting, but writing redeeming after the attempted genocide, enjoying torture, and all the crazy around it sounds really, really hard. Anyway, goodluck!
