Just like to say that there is nothing wrong with hand-me-downs or used clothes. I don't think he problem with Dudley hand-me-downs were that they had been used before Harry, more that they were grossly oversized. Plus Ginny's family used them all the time, so that probably helped counter his bad memories.
