I more search by exclusion? I think I'm aro but I know Im not all that fond of romance or stories where that's the focus. So searching by pairing doesnt make sense to me? Because I'll deal with any pairing if the story and plot are good.

So I filter by what I don't like. Crossovers, specific pairings, tropes I'm really not fond of. And then I'll sort by either Kudos or Comments and work from there ðŸ˜€.

I find I come across more stories I never would have thought I liked that way ðŸ˜€
