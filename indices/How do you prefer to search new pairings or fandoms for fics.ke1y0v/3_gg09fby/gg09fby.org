I tend to search for a particular pairing first and then read the first stories whose summaries peak my interest. If i like that story i will read others by that same author (especially if they have the same pairing or others i'm interested in). Then if the site provides the feature i will read stories/authors that the author i just read likes within that same fandom figuring if I liked the first author's work i'm likely to like the stories/authors they like. (Now that's a crapshoot to some extent but i find that often an author writes and reads stories with the same pairings eg., if the author likes writing a Harry/Hermione pairing or a Harry/Tonks pairing then it's a pretty good bet they will recommend/bookmark etc stories or authors who write the same pairings.
