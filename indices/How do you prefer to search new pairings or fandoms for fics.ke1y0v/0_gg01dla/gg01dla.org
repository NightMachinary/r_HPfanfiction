I've been reading primary in AO3 lately, so my story filtering is specific to that site. If I'm getting into a new fandom because I am interested in a particular pairing I'll search by that first, then filter out specific tags/warnings that I don't enjoy unless I'm in a very specific mood. I limit by completed, no crossovers, English. Once I've been into a fandom a while I'll leave off those limitations, but I don't want my first foray into a fandom to be an incomplete or a crossover. I tend to sort by bookmarks rather than kudos, because I want stories that people not only liked, but liked enough to share or read again to be at the top of the list. Then, like you said, I start going though the pages and read or download anything that catches my fancy.

There's a few pairings that are long-term favorites, and for those I've already done the process above, sometimes multiple times. For those I will filter by newest first and/or allow incomplete works or crossovers so I am more likely to see stories that I haven't read yet.

For some fandoms (like Harry Potter) that I've read a ton of, I'll start at the fandom level and filter out all of the common pairings to see if I can find something new.

There are a couple of fandoms I'm into that I've never actually seen/read the source material, but I was browsing stories filtered by a specific tag rather than a pairing and that fandom kept coming up. So I read a few, liked them, and now I seek them out specifically.
