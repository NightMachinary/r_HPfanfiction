Renegade - linkffn(11302568) - has a Independent, Grey Harry with a Dumbledore who trusts and supports him. Harry/Fleur. 5 years since last update.

Lesser Evils - linkffn(13106612) - there's a lot of conflict between them and Harry's not completely independent, but it is quite realistic. Harry/Ginny, but it doesn't really affect the plot. Complete.

Defiance - linkffn(12516323) - again, rocky start, but they get along well later, especially after Dumbledore starts training Harry personally. Harry/Daphne. 3 years since last update.
