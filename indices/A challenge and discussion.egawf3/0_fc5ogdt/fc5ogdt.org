Depending on whether you accept 1951 as her birth year (I don't because this date is solely based on Black Family Tree used in the movie, in which her father's birth year was listed as 1938. Lol), either [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855;12511998), depicts a well characterized pre Death Eater Bellatrix.

--------------

I personally see lots of similarities between her and Ginny:

- Aggressive and violent
- Devoted to her cause
- Fanatically and unconditionally loyal to her hero; that and a strong dose of hero worship.
- Reasonably cunning and intelligent
- Magically powerful
- Physically beautiful during their prime age

Ginny's wand is Yew (Voldemort's) and likely Dragon Heartstring. Based on [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][JKR's wand lore]], it's a very powerful combo and its user can become either a great hero or terrible villain.
