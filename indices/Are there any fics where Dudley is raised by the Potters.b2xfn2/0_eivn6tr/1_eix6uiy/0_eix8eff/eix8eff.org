I personally find his prose a bit stilted and awkward, but that's just me. On a more literary analysis side here's a quote from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/arx32q/what_hhr_stories_did_you_read_that_made_you/egqwa8l/][a discussion on robst on the H/Hr subreddit.]]

  He has this amazing talent of coming up with good ideas and then ruining it through a combination of predictability and poor characterisation. H/Hr are never seriously challenged; the enemy is usually stupid or incompetent or both; and he writes Harry and Hermione as such sanctimonious, smug, little gits that I find myself wanting Voldemort to win.
