She corrected his pronunciation on a few things if I remember an interview correctly. Some spells, I think. I grew up on the Jim Dale version (not sure why the USA got Dale, who in comparison is rather unknown in the states compared to Fry) and he definitely is the reason I hear words pronounced a different way. (Akkio vs asio for accio). (Love your flair btw)
