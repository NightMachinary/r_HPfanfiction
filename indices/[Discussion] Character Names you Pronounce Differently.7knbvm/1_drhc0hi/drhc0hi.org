1) I keep the T.

2) Dray-co, like the constellation.

3)Lew-see-us - the Lush-us pronunciation makes me ill.

4) The anglicised Lestrange.

5) Ruby - us

6) Ew ew ew, its Ma-Gonagall. I'm Scottish, there are rules about how you pronounce 'mac's, any Mc or Mac before a G makes the C silent - like McGee (Ma-gee) or McGill, McGregor or McGraw (and their Mc equivalents) .

7) I don't hear Sev'rus in the movies tbh.

8) Neither do I hear a weird Hogwarts.
