  The obvious one is the T in Lord Voldemort --- silent or not, for you?

Depends if I'm speaking French or English.

  How about Lucius? "Lu-ss-ious", or "Lu-sh-ious"?
#+end_quote

The former for me. If you wanted to pronounce it in the proper, Latin way, it seems you should say 'Lu-k-ious'.

  Do you pronounce Lestrange the French way (something like "Luh-stronge"), or do you just say "Less-Strange", or something else?
#+end_quote

As a French, the former doesn't feel natural. I say 'Less-strange' in both languages and have never heard anybody saying 'Luh-strange' while speaking French. The 'an' would be pronounced differently in French, though. 'An' is treated as a single sound in this case and the 'n' wouldn't be pronounced. The 'a' would be different from the usual 'a', but I don't think this particular sound exists in English. Perhaps something like the 'an' in 'fantasy' if you don't pronounce the 'n'... The movie used 'Less-strange', too, in the dubbed versions.

I"m not sure I can explain properly how I pronounce the other ones in French, as some sounds from one language don't necessarily exist in the other. (For instance, the 'u' and the 'r' are really different in both language, the English 'e' is sometimes similar to the French's 'i' (pronounced like the 'e' in 'be') and sometimes to the 'Ã¨' (as in 'let').\\
I've spent several minutes trying to come up with a way to describe how I pronounce 'Rubeus', sadly I failed.
