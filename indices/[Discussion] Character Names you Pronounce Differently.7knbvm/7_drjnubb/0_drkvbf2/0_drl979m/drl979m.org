Yes, that is a possibility. But consider this: canon-wise, it's unlikely for Tom to actually know, or at least have known at the time when the anagram was made and chosen, French. As such, it is more likely that, in-universe--wise rather than on meta level, he chose it not for what it means but rather for how it sounds.

And I simply use the pronunciation that is more likely in-story.
