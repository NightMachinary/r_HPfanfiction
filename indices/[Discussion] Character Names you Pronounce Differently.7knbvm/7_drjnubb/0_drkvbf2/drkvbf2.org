  but in-universe it makes no sense for the nickname to use French pronunciation when Tom based it not on French language but rather on what he could anagram from his name.

Uh, I think it's a bit too much of a coincidence for /Voldemort/ to mean what it does in French purely by accident. I'm pretty sure of all possible anagrams, Tom picked this one /because/ he knew, and liked, the French meaning of the result.
