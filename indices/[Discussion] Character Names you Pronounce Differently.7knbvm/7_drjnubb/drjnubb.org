I pronounce Tom's nickname with an audible T. I know the official pronunciation is with a silent T, and I do know that the movies (which use an audible T) do not count, but in-universe it makes no sense for the nickname to use French pronunciation when Tom based it not on French language but rather on what he could anagram from his name.

As for the rest of the names, I go with what feels natural for a society that seems to be at least in some way using old languages and as such would care about the way things are pronounced; thus “Drah-co”, “Lu-ki-us”, “Roo-bee-oos”, “Se-ve-rus”, “Ma-Go-na-gall”, and so on. The Lestranges are a bit of an exception, since I have no basis to think that their name is French so I go with “Le-strenj”, but if Madame Rowling ever revealed that they do indeed have French roots then I would not have problems with switching.

I also pronounce Karkaroff's name with hard Rs (Krum's too). Oh, and while I pronounce Ginny “Jinny”, Ginevra is “Gui-nev-ra”. Likewise, Remus is “Reh-mus”. And the French people have their names properly frenched.
