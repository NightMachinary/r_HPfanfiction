linkffn(Might and Magic by Astroman1000) No romantic pairing. He's more of a pet/sibling to Tonks than anything resembling a love interest.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game of Death) It is Harry/Hermione and doesn't seem like it's ever going to be a harem, despite the synopsis. But it is a pretty good story that's deviating nicely from canon.
