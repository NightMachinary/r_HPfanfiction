This also gives Arthur Weasley and his department a much more constructive role at the Ministry.

Who looks at complicated muggle technology (Knight Bus, Hogwarts Express, even MoM phone booth) and decides whether it's right for enchanting?

Arthur even has his car as an example / testbed. Was he involved in the creation of the Knight Bus, etc?

Is he secretly evaluating how phone networking improvements can be leveraged to improve the floo network or something?

Lots of scope for ideas there!
