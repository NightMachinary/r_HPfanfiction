Taking this a step further, the logical next level would be enchanting these "advanced" muggle devices - unbreakable, ever-full ballpoint pens, flying cars that repair themselves if damaged, apparating buses that squeeze unseen through traffic, a floo network based on flashbangs (for emergency situations and wizards who can't apparate nor make portkeys)

The step after that would be working with the muggles, then - using enchantment where mundanities fail, using mundanities where enchantment fails. Artificial gravity on a starship, inertial dampening in fast-moving vehicles, interstellar transport through wizard space-fuckery.
