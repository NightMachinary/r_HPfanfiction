Neat analysis.

I can't think of a single canon device that bestows enchantment onto another thing. I think cursed items like Draco's Necklace and Gaunt ring in book 6 can count as enchanting an item to pass on an enchantment, but they're shown to be single-use.

Horcrux have some persistent ability to influence/curse whomever they're exposed to, so maybe you could make a enchanting printer if you did a little soul magic.

I assume potions can be brewed at scale, since they're finished by the cauldron. But potions are not explored much in canon.
