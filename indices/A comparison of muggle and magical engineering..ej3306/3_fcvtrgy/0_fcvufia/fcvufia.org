Potions can be manufactured at scale, but I think some of the ingredients (especially parts of magical creatures) might not be that easily mass produced. A common theme in fics where muggles find out about magic is that muggles want mass produced potions, because of course they want cures to all diseases if they find out that they exist, but there just aren't enough magical creatures and plants around to supply much more than the existing magical community.
