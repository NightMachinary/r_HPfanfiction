  One of the reasons I like magic so much is because you, as an author, can choose to limit mass production capabilities while allowing a civilization to create powerful objects.

But that makes no sense. Consider how complex even simple animals are. How many different cells, neurons and everything even a simple spell creates. And you can transfigure that by year three. Canon transfiguration also seems permanent.

So even an average wizard should be able to mass-produce almost everything (with the exception of things which are made out of gold or are food).
