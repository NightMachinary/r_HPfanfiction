But to some degree, even that ought to be possible. We never get much on enchanting, but IF it is rune based, transfiguration should do the trick. Or even just to speed up the production of the things you want to enchant.

Also, an assembly line style of manufacturing would speed up production by a lot, even if it would make the job a lot duller. For example, someone just enchants the same kind of twig with the same spell again and again while the next person works on the handle and a third one puts the broom together.
