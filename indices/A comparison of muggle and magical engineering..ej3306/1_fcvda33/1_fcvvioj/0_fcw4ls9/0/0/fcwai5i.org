I can't remember if it comes from canon or fanon, but there was that theory that said that enchantment are hard because it takes a very skilled wizard to make the enchantment stick together.

Like, applying one spell to an item (like a glowing ring for example) is easy, but if you try to add several spells to the same item, they may be interfering with each other, and the difficulty increase with each new enchantment. So, if we were to take the firebolt as an example, it is not manufactured by enchanting each individual twig and then puting the broom together, but rather by first crafting the broom, and then having a very talented person making every enchantment on it alone.
