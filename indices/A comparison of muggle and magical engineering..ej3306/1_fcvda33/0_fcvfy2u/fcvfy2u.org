It'd be fun to explore how a new invention could completely change the dynamic of power in the world though. There would be political opposition for sure, but would that be enough to stop an economical revolution?

The raw materials in a Firebolt aren't that expensive, just a bit of wood that can probably be duplicated magically. The expensive part is dozens of enchantments that need to be done by very skilled professionals, and R&D money. If you had a printing press for enchantments, and knowledge about the enchantments themselves, you could churn out Firebolts at a per-unit cost of practically nothing.

Same goes for practically every other magical item. Raw materials can be duplicated (except for gold, probably), muggle machines or transfiguration can be used to bring them in the right shape, and enchantments can be stamped on. You could churn out Goblets of Fire by the millions if you knew how the original was made. Only cost is R&D and setting up the assembly line.

How would the magical world react to someone selling incredibly sophisticated magical items like super-brooms, omnioculars, communication mirrors, magic maps (a map of your surroundings that keeps track of people around you could be very useful for aurors, think mini-map from video games), flying cars (with some improvement, FTL-capable and with interstellar navigation system), all dirt cheap?

It'd be very OP but also very interesting to write about.
