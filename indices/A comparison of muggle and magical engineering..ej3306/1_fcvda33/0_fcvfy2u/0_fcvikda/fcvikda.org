Perhaps a middle ground of using Muggle manufacturing techniques in addition to enchantments would be interesting. For example, the lightbulb: say you purchased Muggle mass-produced empty glass bulbs and magically modified (i.e. doesn't need electricity or something) a Muggle machine for some aspects of assembly. And then for the filaments,instead of using Muggle tungsten, you used enchanted gold wire (maybe not Goblin wrought as they have different ideas about ownership and would object to mass production of their work), which has it's own self-contained everlasting power source and only needs replacing once in a great while of ever, as the magic imbued in it would prevent shorts or the wire wearing out.

So, you have a wizard lightbulb -- a safety light without dripping wax -- using enchanted wire, Muggle-made glass, and assembly line techniques. The product lasts a very long time with the Muggle glass only needing replacement if it gets broken or gets burnt spots (like Muggle lightbulbs sometimes get), but the individual purchaser could prolong the life of the glass by adding an Impervious charm to the surface or something. And of course, everyone would want at least half a dozen each. There would be a small spike in the market and then it would taper off into a steady business of repairs and occasional manufacturing batches.
