There's a book called Master of the Five Magics that takes a look at industrial magic. The main character apprentices with a Master Alchemist (basically potions). However there's no real money at the 'mom & pop' level. Most people are happy with the inferior, but much cheaper mass produced option. The competition uses a sweatshop like assembly line to sell in bulk.

Meanwhile enchanters can sell their indestructible swords and armor for astronomical prices. However they're so difficult to make, it takes the entire enchanters guild years to produce one.
