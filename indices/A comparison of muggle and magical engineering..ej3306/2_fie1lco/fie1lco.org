The problem with magical society is that they peak too early. If the magic fluctuates significantly from time to time it's easy for them to plunge into dark ages because their entire previous technology accumulation was based on the strong magic which no longer exists now . The Song of Fire and Ice is a prime example for this. It's true magic solve a problem better and faster than muggle technology in earlier stages. But if magic no longer develops,it will no longer be at advantage in comparison with muggle technology which does steadily evolve and improve from the lowly place it started from. The size of magic population might be to blame. However,it's unlikely to be the only reason for the stagnant of magic development.
