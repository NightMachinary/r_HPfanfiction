Just opened the pdf and the first thing i noticed was a MONSTER of a first paragraph.

There is nothing wrong with long paragraphs, but they can be a bit daunting before you get a reader invested in your story. I'll read through a bit and let you know if anything else pops out at me.

Reading just the first few lines of the paragraph it could quite easily be broken after "planned on reading"

Some of the language feels a little wooden, but that could quite easily be solved by having a native english Beta go through and adjust the wording.

From the first page, the plot feels quite disconnected from the harry potter cannon, and while that is not necessarily a bad thing as some people like that, others do not, and if you are planning to close in with the cannon characters, a prologue with the cannon characters, maybe a preview of what is to come, before the first chapter turns back to introduce this Aurelius character.

Finished the first chapter, it felt like it has potential to be an excellent story, despite the OC focus, something I typically dislike. I'd be happy to give you some more suggestions focusing on tone and flow at a later date, but unfortunately i can't help you with grammar, it's really not my fortÄ—.
