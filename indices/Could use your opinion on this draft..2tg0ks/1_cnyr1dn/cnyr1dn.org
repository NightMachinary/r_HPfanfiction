The errors in the first paragraph should give you a good idea of what areas of English you should brush up on...

- Sentence beginning with "As if the orange ball" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- "Grandfathers pasture" should be "grandfather's pasture" (English uses the apostrophe to denote the possessive case. [[https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/][Helpful link]])

- Sentence beginning with "Last of the old mans" is a fragment--use a comma instead of a period before it. ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_construction][Helpful link]])

- "old mans" should be "old man's"

- "hinder" sounds like the wrong word here--try "stop" instead. (debatable)

- Sentence beginning with "Cake and cookies", as well as the sentence after it, is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it and after it. ([[https://www.uncg.edu/eng/writingcenter/handouts/APPOSITIVES.pdf][Helpful link]])

- "But for now, he'd linger" should be "But, for now, he'd linger" ([[http://drmarkwomack.com/a-writing-handbook/punctuation/commas/parenthetical-commas/][helpful link]])

- "He had finished the Macchu Picchu School" probably should be "He had graduated from the Macchu Picchu School" (debatable)

- Sentence beginning with "Leaving him with great knowledge" is a fragment--use a comma instead of a period before it.

- "Why Muggles flew to the moon without us" should be "Why Muggles Flew to the Moon Without Us", shouldn't have a period at the end, and should probably be italicized rather than in quotation marks

- "Analysis" should be "analysis" (no capitalization)

- "Arithmetic" should be "arithmetic"

- Sentence beginning with "All to end in a prototype" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- Sentence beginning with "This pivot" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- Try using "fulcrum" rather than "pivot", and "anchor" instead of "point of orientation". (debatable)

- Sentence beginning with "How they dealt with their dream" is a fragment--use a dash instead of a period before it.

- "dream" should be "dreams" (you're referring to /multiple/ "greatest minds")

Don't give up on your study of English! I've read several very good stories written by foreigners (two or three by an Italian, one by a German), and even /their/ English sounded rather weird, even though it was almost perfect.
