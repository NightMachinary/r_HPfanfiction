Anyone attempting to write, especially non-native english speakers, should find a copy of "The Elements of Style" by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White. It is a very small book that will completely explain how and why to put sentences together; proper application of it's rules and advice can turn an unreadable piece of shit into what you're really trying to convey.
