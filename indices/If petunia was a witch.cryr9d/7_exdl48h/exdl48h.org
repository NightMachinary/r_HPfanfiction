Its hard to say for sure. Essentially Petunia just felt inferior to her sister and wanted to be included. I think if that feeling were to happen again even for different reasons and if it were intense enough then it would cause the same issues between the sisters but its entirely possible that Harry might have been treated a bit better since you wouldnt have the issue of her finding magic repulsive later in life.
