I've been wondering about this myself.

Her personality would not be poisoned by toxic envy, as it is in canon. But I think she wouldn't be a nice person by any means. She's extremely snobbish, and as a magical this would translate into her wholeheartedly endorsing the Magicals-are-superior-to-Muggles ideology. I'd go out on a limb and suggest she'd be sorted into Gryffindor. At her core, I think there is a strength of character that'd make the Hat put her there. But being Gryffindor, of course, does not automatically make you a nice person.

In this universe, she would look down on Vernon simply because he's a Muggle so there'd be no Dudley. The most likely thing is that she'd find some half or pureblood wizard to marry and live a fairly quit life, during which she'd do her best to pretend she's not muggleborn and make occasional remarks about Muggles that even the average magical would think a bit tasteless.
