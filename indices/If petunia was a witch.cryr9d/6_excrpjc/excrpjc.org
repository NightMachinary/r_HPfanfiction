I read an interesting fic the other day. It's not Petunia-centric (it focuses on Lily/James), but Petunia is a witch in the background (slight spoiler for the fic, but just recommending it here tells you that much anyway). It has a few ideas about how and why Petunia the witch still dislikes/hates magic, Hogwarts, and the wizarding world that I think make sense.
