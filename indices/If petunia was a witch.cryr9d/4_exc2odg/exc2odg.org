Petunia's whole beef with Lily is her jealousy of Lily's magic, so no, she would not hate her. Lily adored her older sister until Petunia cut her out of her life, so if Petunia said to stay away from James she absolutely would (Lily didn't like him anyway until 7th year). Snape is a different story. He met Lily when they were nine, so her staying away from him depends on how much older Petunia is. If she's only one to two years older he's still their introduction to magic and Petunia could end up liking him as well. If not, I'd say that it's a 50-50 chance that lonely Lily still hangs out with him while Petunia is at school, as it didn't seem like any of them had other friends in Cokeworth.
