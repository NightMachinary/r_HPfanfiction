She'd probably still dislike Snape, since she disliked him from the outset, even before she was aware that he was a wizard. The dislike would be tempered however, since he'd be her only source of information about the Wizarding World. However, once she's part of Hogwarts, there's little reason in her mind to keep him around.

We know far too little about her childhood personality beyond the jealousy so I'm not really sure how she'd behave beyond this, or in Hogwarts, but it wouldn't surprise me if she'd indirectly cause Lily and Severus' friendship to break down even earlier with her prejudice against "his kind" and Lily listening more to Petunia -- her sister, who she now has a functioning relationship with -- than her other Gryffindor housemates (who has an obvious bias).
