It's worth noting that Petunia is probably a couple years older than Lily, so the idea of her primary dynamic at Hogwarts involving anyone in Lily's year is somewhat far-fetched. She'd be aware of them of course, but she would have her own friends, her own foes.

For some reason, I have a vision of her ending up with a McLaggen type. Maybe Cormac's dad or something.
