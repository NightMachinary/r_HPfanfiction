Linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament)

It's a live triangle (rectangle?) between a Harry, OC, Fleur, and very recently Daphne. Fleur is pretty foward and aggressive in this one but only in the later chapters. I 100% ship Harry/Fleur but in this one I'm all for Harry/OC (mostly because the OC has been developed more). Hopefully Fleur gets more screentime. It's been updated 3 days ago.

Linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic)

My favorite one but hasn't been updated in 5 months. I pray.
