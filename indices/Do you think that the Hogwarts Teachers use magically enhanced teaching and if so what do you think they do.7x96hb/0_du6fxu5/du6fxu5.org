The issue as far as Hogwarts is concerned is straight up teacher â€˜contact' hours.

Assuming a rather low 4 hours per class per week in Y1/2 and 3 per in Y3 onwards, with 2-House classes in years 1-5 for the core4 subjects and 4-House classes for the OWL electives and all NEWT classes, the core4 teachers (who also happen to be Heads of House AND patrol at night AND have lesson prep/grading) would each have 38 hours just in class time.
