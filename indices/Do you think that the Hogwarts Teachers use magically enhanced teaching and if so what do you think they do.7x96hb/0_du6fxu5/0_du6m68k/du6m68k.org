It would be quite a bit more for some. Let's take Lupin for example. Harry had class with him with no other houses. It was solely Gryffindor. Let's assume that there's 3 hours per class per week. For third year /alone,/ Lupin would have been teaching 12 hours. That's 4 houses, 3 hours a week, equals 12 total hours. For third year alone.

Multiply 12 hours by 5 (for years 1-5) and you get a crazy *60 hours a week* for the first 5 years alone. Count in 6 and 7 years and it goes higher. But if we want to make it 4 hours a week per class (which I personally don't find rather low; in fact it's more than my average college class) for the first two years, then it's 68 hours a week for years 1-5.

I also believe Transfiguration is taken with only one house class, so McGonagall would be looking at 60+ hours of instructing time a week too.

Now, if we made each class only 2 hours per week, perhaps one hour long classes twice a week, it would leave people like Lupin and McGonagall with 40 hours a week for years 1-5. But you'd still have to put in years 6 and 7 (many of which, in my opinion, would still be taking Transfiguration and Defense). And then there's McGonagall's duties as Head of House /and/ Deputy Headmistress.

No wonder she doesn't have time for Harry's shit.
