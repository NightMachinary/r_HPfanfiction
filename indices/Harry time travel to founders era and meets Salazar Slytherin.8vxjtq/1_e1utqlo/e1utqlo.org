I hate the Merlin in Hogwarts plot with passion... It's one of the mayor plotholes in JKRs work, although I don't know the specifics I believe there was a chocolate card or something saying he was a Slytherin and a member of Arthur's court. The problem of course is that Arthur is from the late 6th century, a few hundred years before Hogwarts.

Doesn't this drive anyone else mad...?
