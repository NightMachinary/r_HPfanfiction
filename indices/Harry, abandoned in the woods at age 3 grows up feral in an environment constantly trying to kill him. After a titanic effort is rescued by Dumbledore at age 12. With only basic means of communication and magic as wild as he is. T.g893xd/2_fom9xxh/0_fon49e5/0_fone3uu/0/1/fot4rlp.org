Well if whatever â€˜small' thing he does is not hard and practice for months is normal then there is nothing to argue. Teaching is not hard. Fighting a full grown death eater and getting defeated is weakness. That's what I'm trying to say. He is not trained for that stuff properly. If you know he is gonna face voldy, don't treat the eminent threat as future problem. Take that seriously.

If 1st year was luck, make preparations for rest of them to be handled properly.

2nd year voldy came again. You don't scold him for his reckless behaviour in 1st year and make teacher take the boy more seriously, and the boy went to fight a basilisk without asking teachers for help

3rd year Harry has to ask to learn patronas when he should be trained for that after 2nd attack promptly if 1st was considered accident. And he is surprisingly good at it. Scarred and scared for 10 years in muggle world the boy can still find happiness and do magic above his age and corporal patronising at that. What can't he achieve with enough training.

He may be average but since Dumbledore went to lengths to believe in the prophecy, he should train this average boy so that with hard work he can properly defend and fight on his own. Not plan to slaughter him at right time like a pig.
