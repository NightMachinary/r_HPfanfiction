Yes I've read the books. Harry Potter is average, and is only really good at defence. Each of his victories weren't by power alone but by being clever and lucky. Quirrel : Strange magic from his mother. Basilisk : Sword of plot convenience. For the dementors, one could argue that he managed to do it because he saw himself do it - then the patronus couldn't fail, because it was set in stone. Yes, he learnt it at a young age - but because nobody else saw any point in learning the patronus, and he did it after several months of training. The patronus isn't a hard spell because it needs power, but because it needs trully happy memories.

Fourth year : he's just good at flying with his broom. Sure, he managed to accio his broom, but it's not like it was that hard. The lake, he did nothing to show his amazing power, and the maze was rigged. He didn't defeat Voldemort, but barely managed to escape with his life by pure wand lore bullshit.

Fifth year : again, his only feats are training a bunch of students, and surviving a battle against people that couldn't afford to kill him. And his friends also survived, so it wasn't "him being ultra powerfull".

Sixth year : Once again, no proof that he's more than an average wizard. He learns about Voldemort's life and protect Dumbledore long enough so that the old man can use fire to get the undeads to stay in the water. Once back at Hogwarts, he is shown how mediocre he is against a dark wizard in the form of Severus Snape humiliating him.

And Seventh year, let's just skim through everything until the battle of hogwarts. What saved the day ? Not his amazing power of awesomness, but the same thing than seventh year : wand lore bullshit.
