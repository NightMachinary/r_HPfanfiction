Average? I think getting Outstanding in all required subject for Aurors job qualifies him to be above average if not elite. Training students above his age against dark arts at an age of 15. I have been part of groups in school and college and that kind of leadership and strength alone is rare. Morality and clear headed even when whole school has turned against you thrice for some bullshit reasons. I don't know how a school kid handles that but he is way more mature, forgiving and shows above average control of emotions. You don't have to be the most powerful wizard by the age of 17 and defeat voldy. Train Harry to have more experience, more magical power, practice of many more spells than just expelliarmus. At least let him defend himself properly instead plot armors like golden flames and priori incantatum.

Also Dumbledore hated his father and his brother hated him for whole life. And he knows how awe full muggles can be ( his sister's condition for example)
