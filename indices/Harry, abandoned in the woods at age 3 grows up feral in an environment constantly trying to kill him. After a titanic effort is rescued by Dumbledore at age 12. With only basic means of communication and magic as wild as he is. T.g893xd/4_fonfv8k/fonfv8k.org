Oh, there's one from years ago that I can't remember the title of that's kind of like this, Harry's raised in a secret magical forest that has dinosaurs and creatures like that, during the triwizard tournament some dragon handlers mistake the eggs for dragon eggs and take them, Harry goes and interrupts the first task to get them back, it's set up to be a Harry/Fleur I think, but it wasn't ever finished
