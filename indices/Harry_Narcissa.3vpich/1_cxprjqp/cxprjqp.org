This is actually one of my favorite pairings... not particularly sure why or what that says.... but anyway. Here are a couple of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766122/1/Ladies-and-Gentlemen][Ladies and Gentlemen]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3418412/mrs-milfoy][Mrs. Malfoy]] - I find the final scene and last bit of dialogue to be particularly enjoyable.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10990939/1/Why-are-you-in-my-house][Why are you in my house?]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6309912/Hyperopia][Hyperopia]] - I thought this one started off fairly good, but then the author just kept going with it. I think the story would have been better served having been ended sooner, but it's still fairly good.
