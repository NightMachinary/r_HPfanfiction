KUDOS TO YOU - no, really: Finally someone who agrees with that sentiment!

I mean characters having flaws is ok (it's even recommended, because it makes them more real as all living people have flaws!), but having characters so flawed that in reality they'd be outcasts (or dead - I mean Harry being a damned slacker should have gotten him killed in year 5 at the very latest IMHO, if not way way earlier!) with no one liking them at all isn't great either! (hell, even teachers normally don't like someone (like Hermione) who always wants to impress them, gives them double (or more) stuff to read and correct and is annoying in class (not taking part in the lesson is something teachers hate, but always needing to be the one to answer a question is also annoying) - not that they like the opposite (slackers!) any better (Ron, Harry), much less if they break the rules quite often...though: Don't get me started on the teachers -.- the only teachers I remotely like are Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout (McGee loses because she always parrots (she's not showing any initiative what so ever) Dumbledore and doesn't at least check on the stone in year one and doesn't confiscate Malfoy's badges in GOF and because she tells Harry to "keep his head down" in year 5, Snape is awful at best, negligent and dangerous at worst and he's a bully to boot, Hagrid is dangerous to the class, can't follow a syllabus and frankly can't teach anyway (monster book of monsters anyone? -.-)...and we don't know enough about the others IMHO))
