The series was so wonderful when I was growing up, but trying to reread them is awful. Harry's The-Boy-Who-Was-Dense; Hermione is a nosy, obnoxious bitch; Ron has so many negative character traits that I struggle to list them all. In fact, almost every major character in the book has some major character flaw that is their defining feature. Maybe I've just read too much fanfiction and it jumps off the page to smack me in between the eyes.
