I've found that reading fan fiction has increased my love for the Harry Potter universe while at the same time actually lessening my enjoyment of the original works. For me, what has happened is that fan fiction provides so many options and opportunities to find that "one true telling" that no single telling is able to compete - even the original. AND, if I can't find a story that's just perfect - I can write one myself. I've not gone back and re-read the original series in a number of years, specifically to preserve my fond memories of them.
