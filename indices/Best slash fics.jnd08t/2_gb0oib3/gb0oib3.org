I love this one, personally [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278]]. It's Draco/Harry, and there's romance in the fact that there's a relationship, ergo there has to be some level of romance, but the story is primarily focused on the more comedic aspects, and the relationship develops very naturally. It's not a sappy true love 4ever (much as I do love those), but rather a realistic portrayal of young adult Harry and Draco who have never met sniping at and getting to know each other.

I also adore [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955]]. It's technically not slash, rather a Gen fic. But the entire premise is Harry and Draco stuck in the 70s taking the long road, and being forced to stick together, so over time they developed a really close bond out of circumstance. It's almost like slash but without any romance or sex. I reread it every so often. (writing this actually makes me want to reread it right now...)

And for last, is the Saving Connor series. It's a massive epic that is highly controversial, quality wise, you either love it or hate it. It's got very long and complex plots, and it's Draco/Harry. However, iirc, the Draco Harry relationship, while not quite a healthy one, does have a fair share of time devoted to it. But at the same time there lots of plot going on to balance it out.
