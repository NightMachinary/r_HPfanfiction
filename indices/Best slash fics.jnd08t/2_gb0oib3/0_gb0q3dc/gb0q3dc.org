I forgot to mention this linkao3(67766). I know this doesn't meet your criteria as it's pretty much soley about the relationship, which is why I left it for last. However, if you're willing to take a risk, this fic managed to make me, a devout anti-harry/Snape shipper, enjoy the pairing, somehow. But it is a pretty divisive pairing, so it's not my main recommendation.
