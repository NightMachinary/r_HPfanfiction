What the */fuck/* is it with Daphne Greengrass (and by extension Astoria)? Why are fic authors so massively obsessed with pairing who is essentially a non-character in canon up with Harry Potter? If you want an OC, actually have the guts to /create/ your own OC, instead of this lazy shit. It's grown to be such a big /thing/ - and I am sick and tired of people trying to create a perfect edgy fuckable Sue out of one-shot canon background characters.

And I could get into a whole other rant about how there are too many goddamn Harry/Multi fics and not enough Hermione/Multi or Ron/Multi or anyone-else/Multi fics, but I am not going to do that here.
