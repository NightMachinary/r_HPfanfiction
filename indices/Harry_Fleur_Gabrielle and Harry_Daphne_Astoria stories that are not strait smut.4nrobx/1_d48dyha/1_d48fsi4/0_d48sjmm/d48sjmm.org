...exactly. We know /nothing/ for sure about her. We know her name and that's it.

#+begin_quote
  Her family is also implied as having significant connections between the two worlds and she is raised with vast knowledge of such things
#+end_quote

Again, do we actually /know/ this?

And yes, I know about the epilogue. I read the damn thing when it came out.

#+begin_quote
  enough of a backstory in reputed lore

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  there are a lot more options for WHY a multi could happen in his case already laid out within canon.

Where the fuck in canon does it imply this? I have literally never seen anything like that.
