[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), obviously. Even though some canon stations still happened, they happened in a way that's logical and utterly hilarious. The Graveyard Resurrection Scheme was a total blast!

Other fics that have Harry growing up differently and the canon plots completely shot:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily met Mrs Granger on Halloween 1981 and everything changed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Harry grew up in a loving Muggle family, and things quickly escalated in Year 1. I have begun to appreciate this story a lot more recently, despite some blemishes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]], linkffn(5782108): Not necessarily good, but this fic is a prime example of a different Harry doing things very differently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): Only Year 2 more or less repeated canon stations, but otherwise, things turned out to be quite different.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Apart from Harry being raised by Sirius, the entire setting is extreme AU. He, Neville, and Weasleys all went to Beauxbaton, for a very good reason. Dumbledore kicked ass in this story and did the heavy lifting, although Hermione and Ron's contributions were enormous too.

"The Pureblood Pretense Series", linkffn(7613196;8239413;10041727;11911497): Fem!Harry in an extreme AU, but only reaches Year 4 so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Lockhart found and raised Harry. He was sorted into Slytherin, and things heated up already in Year 1. [[/spoiler][Voldemort got neutralized quickly, and Draco somehow got the Diary]].

--------------

Finally, my favorite 'James and Lily raising Harry' fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), where he had never gone to Hogwarts and Ginny Weasley had been his main rival for many years.
