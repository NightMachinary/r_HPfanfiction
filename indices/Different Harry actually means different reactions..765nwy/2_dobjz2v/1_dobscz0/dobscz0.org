It may be fanon or just my headcanon, but I think training in Occlumency makes the wizard more aware of his mental state by separating from his emotions. By doing so, the Occlumens can detect and resist the effect of Dementors and Boggarts... for a time. An Occlumens visiting Azkaban would be able to function without fear, but one stuck there would eventually lose focus and fall victim to the effect.

Dumbledore seemed unconcerned with being put in Azkaban, as he said he would be able to break out in short order. We know Bellatrix is an Occlumens since she taught Draco, but she also succumbed to madness while imprisoned (or maybe that's just her winning personality).

For my own stories, I add that an Occlumens tends to become sociopathic and because of their magic-aided self-awareness they have trouble becoming an animagus.
