I mean, I know what Occlumency is, but that still doesn't answer my questions. My impression, even after reading the link, is that Occlumency guards against someone deliberately searching your mind for thoughts and memories. But do Dementors deliberately search victims' minds for bad memories, or is it a side effect of attempting to Kiss them?
