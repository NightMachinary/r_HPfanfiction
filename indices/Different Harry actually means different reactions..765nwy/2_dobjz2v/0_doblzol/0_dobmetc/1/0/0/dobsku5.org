If it's a side effect it still doesn't matter, because Occulmency is something you can use whenever you want. I mean the site stated that Voldemort used it against Harry, and Harry wasn't using Legilimency. It is a study to close your mind. So if your mind is being invaded in anyway by magic then Occulmency should at least help.
