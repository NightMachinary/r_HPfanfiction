Occlumency is more than just a defence against legilimency. It is mastery of one's own mind and allows you to resist all kinds of external mental influences, e.g. veritaserum.

We know that there must be some way of resisting the effects of the Dementors because Dumbledore says he could break out of Azkaban easily (and is not an animagus as far as we know). Occlumency is a pretty good candidate for this.
