You're over thinking this. Occlumency is mental defense. Dementors seem to attack your mind.

Therefore, being skilled in occlumency allows some level of defense against Dementors. This isn't a hard leap to make.

  Bellatrix Lestrange was skilled enough at Occlumency to instruct Draco, but the books imply that she was affected by the Dementors in Azkaban, just like all the other prisoners.

If Dumbledore put up a protego shield and had his fellow teachers pound away at it, he would fail eventually.

Bellatrix was being assaulted by Dementors for over a decade.

The Dementor's Kiss is entirely different from their standard mental attack.
