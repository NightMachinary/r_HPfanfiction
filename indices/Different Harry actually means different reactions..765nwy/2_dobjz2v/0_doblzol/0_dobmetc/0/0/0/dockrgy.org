No one is suggesting that occlumency can protect you from the Dementor's Kiss. But the Kiss is not the Dementor's "main power", it's a rarely used ability. The fact that proximity to Dementors brings up your worst memories is a separate power and one that appears to be a mental assault (being that it relates to memories).
