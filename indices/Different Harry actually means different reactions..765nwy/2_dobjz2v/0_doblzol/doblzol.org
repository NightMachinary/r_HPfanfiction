I'm going to assume you meant Dementors, and my theory is, because Occulmency makes you focus on only one image while shunting all your memories to the side it should mean you can do that with the bad memories as well. While they make you relive it they are still just memories otherwise it would cause harm to you as well. The same way that some people can trick their bodies into believing ice is hot coal, and getting a burn from it.
