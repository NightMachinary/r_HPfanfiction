To what extent would the plot have to change for a fanfic of CC to be legal? I know a lot of fans wished [[/spoiler][Scorbus was made canon]]. If that happened, [[/spoiler][instead of Scorpius asking Rose out]], would the fic be transformative enough for it to be okayed? Also, how much dialogue could you reuse from CC without being derivative? I'm not planning on rewriting CC myself, but I've seen some suggestions of a collaborative rewrite and I'm curious on whether that would be legal.
