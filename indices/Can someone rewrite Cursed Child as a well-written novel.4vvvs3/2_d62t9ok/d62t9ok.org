The reason fanfiction is (vaguely) legal is because it is transformative and because it can be said to fall under fair use. Basically, in order for a fic to be legal, it has to meet two criteria:

1. Transformative, not derivative. A fic needs to tell a new story. A rewrite of CC, telling the exact same story as the play, does not fulfil this, and is therefore not legal. But also:

2. The legality of a fic can depend on it's effect on the potential market for the original work. Again, a rewrite of CC, written as a novel rather than a play, will likely draw readers who will read the fic /instead/ of the play. This would, legally, be seen as devalueing the original work, and therefore, again, a rewite is illegal.

So basically, an exact rewrite of Cursed Child, without any plot changes, would be pretty firmly illegal. Illegal enough that I would not be surprised to see a DMCA takedown notice served to the author of the work linked in this thread, should the story become well-known.

I'm not a lawyer, but I have been paying attention to laws that impact fanfiction for about ten years.

TL;DR, read or write it if you want, but be aware that it won't slip though the legal loopholes that most other fanfiction does.
