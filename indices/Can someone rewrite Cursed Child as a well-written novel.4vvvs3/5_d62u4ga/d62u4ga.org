This isn't exactly what you had in mind, but I'm currently working on a version that has some very basic similarities in set-up and plot but that is more true to the original stories and eliminates or reworks most of the stuff that people had issues with. (OOC moments, weird time travel, T-1000 trolley witch, etc) I'm not quite sure where I'm going yet and I'll have to see how it's received, but I'll post here about it once I have the first bit up.
