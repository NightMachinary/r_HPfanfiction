Well, first off, you need to shorten your summary by a /lot/ - Aim for a singular paragraph.

Secondly, there gets to be a point, where you've mixed in enough different ideas and universes and unique characters that, well, you're really better off working on it as something original.

There's nothing new under the sun, everything is just a rework of something else. Don't limit yourself keeping it as “fan fiction” when you could make something incredible that's wholly your own.
