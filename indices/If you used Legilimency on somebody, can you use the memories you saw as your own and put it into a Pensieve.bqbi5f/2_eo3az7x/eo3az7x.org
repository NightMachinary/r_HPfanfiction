I am of the opinion that *pensieves* work as a player to reproduce recorded memories, regardless of the source.

​

Okay, in short, if we go back to the source for reference, Dumbledore used other people's memories to see what happened in some of the trials against the Death Eaters, and some of Riddle's early life, I think. But they don't see them from the perspective of the person who provided the memory. Instead, they stand in a spatial recreation that the person who provided the memory made on a subconscious level, just as he or she remembers it.

​

Now, if someone obtains such memory through legilimency, by reproducing it in a pensieve they would see the environment as the person from whom the memory was extracted remembers it, and not as the one who extracted it would remember it. The person extracting the memory maybe wasn't even there at all, so it would make sense that the pensieve used their perspective to create the reference for the environment.

​

Now, we have to keep in mind that using l*egilimency* is not like diving into a pensieve and watching scenes unfold around you. If someone used legilimency on a second person, he would not watch the person's memories as if he were standing in a different position from the other person. The caster would see exactly the same as the other person saw when that memory was created. It would be as if it were the caster himself who were remembering that memory. For me, when someone performs legilimency, they are creating a copy of a memory they want to extract, and store it in their minds. Later, it can be extracted and used in a pensieve so others can watch it too. Think of it like making a DVD rip to make a torrent later.

​

So, to use your example, if Dumbledore looked into Voldemort's mind, he would see the memory from Voldemort's perspective, but he would store it in his own mind, as if the memory was originally his. Then he could take that memory so others could see it. Once in the pensieve, though, the observers would be free from Voldemort's perspective. They could stand or move around as they choose in the recreated space provided by Voldemort. It would be as if Voldemort himself had provided the memory. Dumbledore just acted as a delivery man.

​

Let's create a different hypothetical situation. When Harry dreams about Nagini attacking Arthur, he has the dream from the snake's perspective. If he stored the memory of that dream into a pensieve and let others watch it, they would see the memory from "outside". Even Harry himself could be able to review the memory from an outside perspective. They could stand in the spacial recreation that the snake made in her mind when she was "recording" that memory, and watch the attack from outside the snake's perspective. They wouldn't be forced to watch it from the snake's eyes, as was Harry when he had the dream. They dream acted like a legilimency connection, allowing him to "extract" the memory, just as if were someone else extracting a regular memory. When they play it in a pensieve, they could see it from their own perspective and move around freely inside the memory.

It's a simple concept in my head, but my english is not the best of the world, so forgive me if I made things confusing and repetitive.
