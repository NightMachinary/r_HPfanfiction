I personally think legilimency is kinda stupid because minds dont work that way - it should be impossinle for one person's menory structures to be deciphered by the mind of the other person. And if the spell does that as well, then it would be simpler to cast it with more magic behind it, maybe chain multiple spells together to read the memories than a single spell which can only follow one train of memories. This would be easy ro handle on the legilimencer's side if they are master occlumens, and voldy's considered the best master at legilimency in all of britain, and is also a master occlumens, making it easily possible. Voldy's also (probably) made his flight spell, and I think he is good enough at magic to make spells anyways, and if he's the best master of a spell, he probably can change the spell to remove any possible reason it can't be multi - cast, and that was NEVER seen in the series, even when voldy tried legilimens-ing harry

So, to sum that textwall up, voldy's either impossibly stupid at the art he's the master of, or legilimency is a broken spell
