It's not because it's explicitly stated in canon to be not (see my other comment with quotes). When viewing memories in Harry Potter, we consistently find that the observer views things from a different perspective than the person who first experienced the memory, suggesting that the process is different from simply playing back their memory like a recording. This also aligns with what we know about memory in real life; our memories are incredibly malleable, and really we only remember certain key elements, reconstructing the rest with varying degrees of accuracy.
