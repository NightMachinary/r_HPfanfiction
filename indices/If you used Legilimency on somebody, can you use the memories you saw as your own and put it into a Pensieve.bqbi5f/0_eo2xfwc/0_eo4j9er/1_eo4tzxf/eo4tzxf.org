Well, how is it not? One may argue that it is memory reading, but reading memories is still mind reading. Harry's occlumency lessons, somewhat tainted by snape as they were, do indicate that clearing mind = no thoughts make it harder to read minds, meaning memory trawling works by grasping a thought and going through the memories connected to that, then memories connected to those, and so on. Modern psychology - and really even medieval psychology on this particular matter - states that memories are connected to each other, and you remember stuff by searching for relevant memories and those linked to them. There always is the possibility that some natural laws irl don't apply to the HP world, but this seems probable to me.
