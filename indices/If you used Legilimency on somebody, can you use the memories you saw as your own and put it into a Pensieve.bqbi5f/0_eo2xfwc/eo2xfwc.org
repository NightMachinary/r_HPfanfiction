So, legilimency is when you read the mind of another magically. If you can later remember that, you have a memory of seeing something. provided you aren't bound by contract or something like the fidelius, which would stop you from sharing the memory - and perhaps even then through loopholes - you can extract the memory the same way as any other memory. then you can put that in a penseive.

So, in short, yes. Unless the rules of magic in a universe somehow prevent that, that works.
