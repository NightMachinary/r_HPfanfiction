Ok, if I get this right, you're thinking of viewing the moment when someone extracts the memories from somebody else, not the memory itself. It's a bit of a situation like with the Erised mirror, Quirrel couldn't get the stone because he was thinking what he was going to do with it, instead of just acquiring the stone itself.

​

What OP asked is if you could used an extracted memory in a pensieve, not watch the moment when that memory was extracted. If the latter were the case, I would agree with you. We would stand next to two people, and we would see one of them pointing their wand to the other and then they would just stand there barely moving while their mind was being read. But we wouldn't see the extracted memory in question.

​

I already tried to explain my perspective of it a little in another comment in this same thread, so I won't repeat myself here and make this comment longer than it should be, but I recommend you read that comment to see if it all makes a little more sense to you.
