Personally I don't think so. Pensieves are pretty weird, they don't show actual memories. Pensieves show what really happened at some point in time around the person who extracts the "memory", not just what the person remembers. Real memories just aren't as accurate as the stuff we see in Pensieves. Either when you extract the "memory" or when the pensieve uses it, the actual memory is just used as a reference for what you want to show, and the real events around that memory are reconstructed through weird magic. So when you try to extract a memory that you stole from someone using legilimency you would instead just get the memory of stealing it, or maybe no memory at all.

Or maybe not, Canon never really explains any of this and it's quite confusing. Maybe wizards have some kind of magical memory that lets them perfectly remember anything that ever happened to them, even the details they couldn't have noticed, but the only way to access that memory is with a pensieve or with legilimency.

If you're writing a fic, just invent a way how it works and stick to it. If you decide that watching legilimency memories in a pensieve works, make sure that it works consistently and not only when the plot demands it.
