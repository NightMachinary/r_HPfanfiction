Hi there! My husband created the website (Dendrite) you are all using. I saw all the referral traffic coming from this reddit thread, and I'm glad you are all enjoying it. I'm sorry the 5000 character limit is not enough for the writing you want to do. Do you have any suggestions for what the character limit on each page/section of the story should be?
