The few that I have read usually have Pansy only going along with Draco in order to protect her family. Then some change in circumstances occurs where her family needs to change alliances but they don't want to align with Dumbledore who they think isn't truly looking out for Harry. So they decide to align with Harry. That's how White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais progresses.

The other way is that Pansy really doesn't like Draco but has to pretend or her deatheater father will force the issue and marry her off. She bonds with Harry when he stops her being bullied. That is the premise of We're in This Together by zugrian.

So her canon antics are explained by playing the role either Draco or her parents expect. When she gets an opportunity to safely go her own way she jumps on it.
