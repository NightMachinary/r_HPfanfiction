Flavour? To me it wouldn't matter much, I guess. I am ambivalent towards most of these things, I'd say. Naming comes from tradition, doesn't it, or it is because of some trend or some such stupid nonsense. I can't find it in me to care about stuff like that.

The idea to relate moral luck to the behavior of characters instead of relating their behavior to their names is something of a brainfart, I admit.\\
The fundamental question of moral luck is how our moral responsibility is changed by factors over which we have no control. Let's say purebloods are born into the situation of being purebloods, they are raised by purebloods to act like purebloods. They have the moral duties expected of purebloods, that is to say people expect them to be defendors of tradition and pureblood values, correct?

Now muggleborns on the other hand are raised by muggles, people that come from different backgrounds with various influences when it comes to morals. They are raised to become "worthy members of society" as defined by the ethics and moral laws of a society that is ruled by the people. Most muggleborn grow up learning that they need to stand up for something which they believe to be right, and that they need to act when something happens they perceive as wrong.

Now, is it /more/ morally reprehensible for the pureblood to defend his customs and traditions against the muggleborn or is it /more/ morally reprehrensible of the muggleborn to act against the pureblood's tradition and customs? - We could continue to spin this thinking up and about forever, I'd imagine, and I'm afraid my English is not good enough to discuss it without having to rely on my dictionary, however I'd want people to dig more into moral reasoning.

Uhm, did I make sense? In my head it did make sense.
