I don't see it, to be honest. To me it seems like you are trying to find something which does not exist.

And even if it were to exist, what purpose does it have beyond merely existing? Do you want to attribute the modernity of a name to the characters behavior? Names have no influence beyond the influence we grant them. Moral luck, now that is something you would want to look into if you want to measure the importance of the upbringing of a person compared to their actions!
