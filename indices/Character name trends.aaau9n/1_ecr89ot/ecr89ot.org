Well there's a thing in Britain that posh, snotty people look down on common names and less posh people give children more common names and think weird names are a bit snobbish. So the families that are snobbish have a tradition of naming people older more unusual names. Also more traditional wizarding families give their children more traditional names. As families go through time, they get less traditional so all of the old people have traditional names, but younger people have less traditional names. Simple enough.
