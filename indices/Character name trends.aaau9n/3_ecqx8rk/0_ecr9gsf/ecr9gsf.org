You seem to have mistaken this as a post about characters' inclinations. It isn't. It's one about the characters' families' views.

We know very little about Percival and Kendra Dumbledore. I've edited my post a little, talking about this. Minerva, Augusta and Pomona, as I said, we don't know their maiden names, and therefore, nothing about their families. It is the family that they're born into that gives their name, and Minerva may have been born into a Darker family and turned her back on them at some point...maybe (it can be possible after all).

  Peter Pettigrew, Walden Macnair

This is not an exception. He was on the light side in the beginning, and only switched because he was a self-serving coward. Macnair's first name is quite old, since it's Anglo-Saxon (and therefore Germanic) which is outside both the groups I mentioned. There are a few names like this in the series (Thorfinn is another Germaic name).

Vincent, Gregory and Theodore are exceptions, yes. Same goes for Luna and Remus.
