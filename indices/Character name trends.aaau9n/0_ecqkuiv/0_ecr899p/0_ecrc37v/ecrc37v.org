But if Andromeda was opposed to Voldemort, she could have named her daughter anything other than Nymphadora. I think the classification shouldn't be about wizard families supporting and opposing Voldemort, but rather the kind of families they come from. Who knows? Maybe some families had Christian ancestors while other "very old" families didn't, thus resulting in Greek and Latin names.
