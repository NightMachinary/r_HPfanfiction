I thought of including Augusta and Hestia, but we don't know their maiden names (and their families' inclinations). It's the same with Minerva McGonagal, Pomona Sprout, Emmeline Vance - we don't know their maiden names, or in the event that they're unmarried, if they went against their family's views and became "blood-traitors".

Nymphadora is not an exception - she was named by her mother Andromeda, who was a Black by birth.

I did not include Albus and Aberforth, because we don't really know much about their family's views (and by family, I mean Kendra and Percival). From the books, it looked like Percival killed the three muggle boys after the attack on his daughter - which isn't really enough to speak much about his views, really. Muriel says that Kendra went around telling people she was a pureblood in spite of being a halfblood, but that isn't enough to tell anything about her either. Aberforth says that he learnt secrets and lies on her knee, and that doesn't say much either...and that's it. Same goes for Elphias Doge, Amos Diggory, Dedalus Diggle.

This is why I didn't include older people who were belonging to older generations - we know little about /their/ families' views.
