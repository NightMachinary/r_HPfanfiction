There's a lot of little communities on LJ that work on that, and FF.net has a built in beta system [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/][here.]]

A lot of IRC's are often willing to help you critique your work, or look for grammar and things like that. Or, you can ask for beta's on this subreddit. I don't know if that's discouraged, but I've seen people ask for them here before and others volunteer.
