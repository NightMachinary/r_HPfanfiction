Definitely this. The story prided itself on not bashing anyone, but evil dumbledore was still bashed. Hell, at some point I began questioning who the hell was in charge of the afterlife in this story - because evil!dumbledore didn't even know that what he'd been doing was wrong, and had good reasons for pretty much every action he took. So from an objective viewpoint, he was working to defeat Voldemort and then finally retire, was suddenly yeeted out of his body (an action that can only be accomplished through soul magic, which is the darkest of the dark, so he likely had grave suspicions about the entity inhabiting his body), placed in a transcendental torture chamber filled with facsimiles of the dead around him jeering for the imposter as he systematically dismantles every carefully laid out plan to defeat voldemort, wastes time, money and opportunities and slowly but surely (and insidiously) gets closer and closer to his friends.

The author didn't realize this, of course, but the perspective of evil!dumbledore was all I could think about the entire time. From evil!dumbledore's perspective, the most logical conclusion as to what happened is that he's being possessed by some immensely powerful spirit entity that is slowly torturing his soul into madness and dooming the world into darkness - something that it has perhaps been doing to innumerable worlds in the past.
