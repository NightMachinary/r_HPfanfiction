Most of the girls I've known in my life like shoes, her reaction is a slight exaggeration of the delight my wife shows whenever she finds a new shoe store.

Me, I've got three pairs of shoes. My 'good' sneakers, a pair of oxfords for when I have to wear a suit, and my 'yardwork sneakers' which are last year's 'good sneakers'. This was fairly normal for men of my generation.
