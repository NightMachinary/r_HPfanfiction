The places where characters can go on a date are very limited. They are at a boarding school so anywhere offsite is out of the question, other than Hogsmeade, which leaves the characters with broom closet rendezvous (not exactly romantic), The Black Lake (which is probably freezing for most of the year), and the Room of Requirement which is honestly super lazy.

It works once, but it lacks inspiration.

I do agree with you, but the choices really are not particularly great to begin with
