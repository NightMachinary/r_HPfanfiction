  A Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover, if that wasn't obvious already. Fair Warning, some chapters will have mature themes in them. Honestly, probably not as good as "The Havoc Side of the Force" by Tsu Doh Nimh. If you haven't read that yet, go do so, like right now. If you have already, maybe you'll enjoy this as well. It can tide you over until the next chapter of that masterpiece.
