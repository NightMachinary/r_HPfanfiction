A number of HP/Stargate crossovers depict magicals as descended from Ancients who crossbred with humans after returning from the Pegasus Galaxy. Too often Harry gets involved in things because he meets some "percentage" of Alteran genes that apparently no one else on Earth meets. This often bothers me since Ancients are depicted as "better" than other races ("evolutionarily"?), implying that magicals are too, to some extent.

I prefer the fics where magicals are actually just one of Hathor's experiments she abandoned when she left Earth with Ra.
