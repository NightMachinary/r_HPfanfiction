Ahhhh, just what I could come to the [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] subreddit for: discussion on eugenics! Jk, but tbh this annoys the hell out of me for exactly the reasons you say above. Usually goes hand in hand with Death Eater apologist crap too, bleh. Sure, it can be interesting to read, but I haven't come across many, that's for sure. Sorry, haven't got any recs for this!
