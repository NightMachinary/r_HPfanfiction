I like the "paid/fed with magic" variant of this. Where house elves are basically magical symbiotes, working in exchange for magic (which they eat like food). Thus, they aren't /slaves,/ just employees who tend to get really shitty jobs with even shittier employers. It's usually never explicitly said to be as such, but I've seen a few stories with something like this being implied.

In these stories, it would be funny if there was someone who said something like, "Oh, just don't have more than two elves per wizard/witch in a home or they'll suck you dry." Or there's some old dude who's practically a muggle because he's got a dozen house elves working for him and they're taking all his magic.
