honestly, for all we know regular house elves could die if they are freed. But not for a magical reason, but rather them not being able to cope with the shame of being freed and being unable to take care of themselves. Like Winky becoming an alcoholic and needing Dobbys support.

But this still wouldn't be a argument for slavery, but rather make it necessary to gradually change their mentality before freeing them.
