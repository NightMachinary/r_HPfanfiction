I can't find the story, but it was called Faith. After the 3 wizard tournament everyone turns on Harry, Snape and Malfoys are good, Hermione and Ginny gets adopted into better bloodlines, complete with family magic, mudbloods are diluting the magic line and not respecting the culture. Bonus: Everyone is super gay.
