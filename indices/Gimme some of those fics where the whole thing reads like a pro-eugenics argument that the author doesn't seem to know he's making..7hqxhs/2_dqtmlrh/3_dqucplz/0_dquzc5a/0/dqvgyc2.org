True but there is also more than just one muggleborn the 48828115 was the potential number of descendants from a single muggleborn over ten generations.

I was also going off the assumption that magic is a evolutionary advantage that would help the children reach adulthood and therefore be more likely to reproduce.

Any way I was answering the question of why magic is not more widespread if it is such a good evolutionary advantage. The short answer is that when ever a child with magic pops up there immediately taken into the magical world and effectively romoved from the muggle worlds gene pool.

If the muggleborns were left in the muggle world and threw that there gene pool in under 20 generations magic would become the dominant type of human on the planet.
