You're /way/ overestimating the fertility rate there. In countries and times where children almost never made it to adulthood, a super-high fertility rate was common, but so was a super high death rate. By the time the world really started advancing and the quality of life shot up, the birth rate also fell.

This also assumes that no magicals die before they can have children of their own, that every child is also magical, and that no magicals interbreed (a couple's children would have been counted twice by your calculations).

The tl;dr of it is that while it's possible that wizards would have had large numbers, they'd be nowhere near as big as you suggested. It's also possible that they get out-bred by muggles, who hog resources and force down the wizarding fertility rate.
