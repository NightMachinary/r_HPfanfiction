I think there's two reasons that wizards are a rarity:

One has to do with how the wizarding world is and has been very similar to modern societies that have low birth rates today for a very long time. and that leads into number two the mandatory integration of all muggleborns into the magical world to uphold The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy which leads the muggleborns to adopt simallr low birth rates to the rest of the wizarding world.

The Harry potter world would be a lot more wizard and witches being born if the wizarding world had left muggleborn wizards in the muggle world ignorant to magic.

If in 1692 along with the Statute of Wizarding Secrecy the wizarding world decided to start leaving muggleborn wizard in the muggle world. By the time that we got 1992 300 years later there would be millions of wizards.

Let's say you start off with just one muggleborn wizard in the year 1692 they go on to have 5 children with the majority of them being magical, and then his children go on to have 5 children each. Continue on threw the generation over the next 300 years with. Each child having an average of five children that is a lot of wizards.

It's like the wheat and the chessboard

If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?

Edit: even if you only go foward ten generations that's still around 48828125 magical children from just one muggleborn and his descendants being left in the muggle world.
