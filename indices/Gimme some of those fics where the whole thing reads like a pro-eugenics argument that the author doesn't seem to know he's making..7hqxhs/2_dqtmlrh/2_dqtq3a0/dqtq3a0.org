I've always liked the idea that there are hundreds of little communities in just Britain alone but they don't know about each other and every time someone find out about one of the others that one's equivalent of the aurors gets the jump on them and obliviates that oddly dressed muggle because theirs is the only community and there's no need for such insanity thank you very much.
