JK Rowling's wizarding world is neither logical nor internally consistent. Unfortunately there's no grand theory to explain everything, as one aspect of it will inevitably contradict some other piece of canon information.

I mean, this is a world wherein lycanthropy is a terrible, awful curse and social malady, and some parents named their kid Remus Lupin; Remus from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus][Remus and Romulus]], and Lupin alluding to /canis lupus/, or the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf][wolf]]. This is like Fuck My Kid Up 101 in magical land.
