Well, let's pose this the other way.

Do you agree that sufficiently low IQ people maybe need less rights and responsibilities, are they less responsible for their actions if their IQ is super low?

Do they need to be give maybe a firm hand to be guided through life.

After all, while we need to take the mentally handicapped's wishes into account, at the end of the day, those with 'average' IQ really do know what's best, their 65 IQ really does rule out MIT, maybe we could get them into a good trade school, or they could bag groceries.
