We alreay practice eugenics. for example, some children who would be born severely handicapped to the point where their lives would not be wrth living, are sometimes aborted. There is nothing wrong with eugenics in principle. It is the way that the concent has been presented by certain groups in the past (most notably the German Nazi party) that has given the practice a bad reputation. If taken too far or in the wrong direction, eugenics is a horrible practice. It can be, and indeed already is, utilised to help the human race.
