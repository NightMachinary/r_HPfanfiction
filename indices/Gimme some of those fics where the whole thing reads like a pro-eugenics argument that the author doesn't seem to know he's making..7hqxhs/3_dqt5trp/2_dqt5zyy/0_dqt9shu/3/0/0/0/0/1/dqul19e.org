  the science of *improving a population* by *controlled* breeding to *increase occurrence of desirable* heritable characteristics

I would agree this is a relatively straight-forward definition of eugenics. Vague as shit (this isn't your fault, either, no one has ever been able to decide on a precise definition, so far as I know), and notwithstanding of implementation attempts throughout history, but not /inaccurate/.

But then you go on to somehow imply that society frowning on you sleeping with your sister is somehow controlled breeding.

There is a MASSIVE difference between selecting your partner based off of the chance of success of passing on desirable genes and aborting a child because the short life that they'll be able to live will be in agony. Or avoiding sleeping with people who're closely related to you, because it's known to cause birth defects.

You can argue all you want that it's a "weak form" or whatever, but it's just /not/.
