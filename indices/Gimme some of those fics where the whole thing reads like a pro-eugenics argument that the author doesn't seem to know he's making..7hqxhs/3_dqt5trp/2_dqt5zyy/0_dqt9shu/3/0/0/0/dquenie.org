Again, that's not Eugenics.

No one is saying not to fuck sisters. No one is discriminating and debating the morality of people having children with people who happen to be sisters. They're saying not to fuck and have kids with /your own/ sister. And even /then/, no one advocates abortion simply because it's a child between two siblings. We end up rounding back to my original point.
