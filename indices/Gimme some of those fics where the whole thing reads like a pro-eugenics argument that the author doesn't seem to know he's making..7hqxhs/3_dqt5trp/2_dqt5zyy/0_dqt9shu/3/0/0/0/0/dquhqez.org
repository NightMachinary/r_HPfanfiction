This is the definition of eugenics: 'the science of improving a population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics.'

Given this, the prevention of children born of incest in order to preventing undesirable characteristics from entering the gene pool qualifies as eugenics. Similarly, the abortion of children who would have been born with debilitating gentic disorders (and yes this does happen), qualifies as eugenics because it revents their defective or negative genes from entering the population, thus improving the human race.
