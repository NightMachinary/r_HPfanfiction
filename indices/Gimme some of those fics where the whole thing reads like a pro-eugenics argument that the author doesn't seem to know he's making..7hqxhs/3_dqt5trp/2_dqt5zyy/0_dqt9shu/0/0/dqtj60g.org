I'm aware of this, but at the same time I don't think eugenics programs are generally conducted well, or really needed. The amount of mentally deficient people that breed are minimal, as are the general birth defects that we see in society.

I'd rather focus on trying to see if we can fix birth defects in the womb. The only level of eugenics that I'd generally condone is providing literature about the problems of raising children with birth defects, combined with easier access to abortion for women. This tactic would minimize most of the problems generally associated with eugenics as have been implemented.
