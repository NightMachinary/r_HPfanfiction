I would be in favour of widespread genetic counselling for couples who are considering procreating. Not saying 'don't have kids with this person' but more along the lines of 'these are the risks if you have kids with this person'

In a perfect world, a written exam for people considering kids would also be great. Way too many people just pass the initial practical and then they're stuck with a baby they have no clue how to raise.
