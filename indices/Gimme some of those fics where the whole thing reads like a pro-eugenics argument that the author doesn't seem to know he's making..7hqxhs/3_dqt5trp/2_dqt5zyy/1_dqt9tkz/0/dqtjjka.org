The point is that the thing that makes animals not people is the difference in intelligence. By saying animals are not people you're basically reiterating the point that we set huge importance by intelligence. Animals have an internal mental life, they can feel pain, they can feel happiness, they form social groups. What they don't have is intelligence to the same level as us, and for that reason we say they are not people and therefore have fewer rights.
