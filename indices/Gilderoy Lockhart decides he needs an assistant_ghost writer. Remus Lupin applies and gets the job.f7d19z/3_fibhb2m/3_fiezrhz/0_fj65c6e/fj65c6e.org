As the days passed, Remus began to feel rather like a Jeeves to a Whooster or whatever he was called (Remus didn't remember), except he had been more self-aware. He had to answer fanmail, make his 'lovely tea', arrange meetings and occasionally help confused people out of the door (he always helped them home, although they rarely needed it). When he had time, he let socks disappear, but that was all, as far as pranking went.
