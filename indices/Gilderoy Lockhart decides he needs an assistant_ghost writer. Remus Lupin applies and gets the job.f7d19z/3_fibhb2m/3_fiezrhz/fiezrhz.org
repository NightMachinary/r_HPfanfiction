Part 2

It took a few days before a lila-inked letter arrived at Remus' window. They were off, in Mr Lockharts word. Just in case Remus had forgotten what he looked like, he had included a picture with a too-bright smile and a wink. And the letter... sang. Yes, really. Incredibly off-tune too, just to make it worse. Remus was to pack all his belongings and bring plenty of notebooks, ink and feathers. As if he had been planning to go without. They would go to the Alps were apparently there was a zombie-infestation. Well, they went alright, but Lockharts idea of solving the problem was letting the women there chase him and get drunk. The next day, Remust had to use his most icy /aquamenti/ and a glare to match the artic to get him to get up and help a bit, would he? There were zombies to burn. Groaning and muttering about 'spoilsports' and to-bright mountainsun Lockhart followed him up. Remus made sure to be his most annoyingly enthusiastic self, exclaiming about the beautiful day and 'look at that bird!' (shouted carefully in Lockharts ear, of course (who groaned and covered his ears in vain), until they saw their first zombie on the path below. Then Remus stopped his playing around. His face was stony now, with eyes of steel. Gone was the teacher or long-suffering assistant. In it's place; a seasoned warrior who was completely focused on his enemies. He made quick work of the zombies (it was easy, really, with how close they were standing. It only took one spell to light them all on fire), until quite suddenly, he was pushed. Despite his surprise, he managed to remain standing and turned around. Whatever he had expected, it wasn't this; that his boss hung of the rock by the tips of his fingers, and that he was so scared that he almost fainted. Hastily he used the first spell he could remember. 'Wingardium Leviosa!' It was just in time too. As Lockhart let go he floated into the air and on the path again, where he dropped into a dead faint. Remus sighted. This was hardly the hero of the books, but he should probably have expected that by now.
