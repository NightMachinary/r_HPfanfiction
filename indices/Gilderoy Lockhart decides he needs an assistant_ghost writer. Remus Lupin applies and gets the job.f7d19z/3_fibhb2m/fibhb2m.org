'Excuse me?' A slightly shabby looking young man graced Gilderoys office. 'I was asked to apply for a position as assistant for a G Lockhart. Is this the right place?' Gilderoy, having just been woken up from a truly /delightful/ nap thank you very much, took a few seconds to place the man. 'You must be Lupin!' He cried out, adding a bright smile. 'Come in, come in! I've read your cv, truly /impressive/, you managed to last a whole year in Hogwarts! With Sirius Black and all! I taught there myself, just before you. Had to teach Harry Potter how to handle his fame, with that basilisk around too. Nasty business that..' he trailed off, muttering. 'Perfect for the job then, of course. You see, on my travels and, to be honest, quite grand adventures, I need someone to take notes for my books. Can't do that while fighting werewolves, can I?' He shot his new assistant his brightest smile (managed to win /Witches Weekly/ with that! Twice!), who had paled significantly, gaze hardened. 'I taught Harry as well,' he said quietly. 'And I cannot /imagine/ him ever having needed help 'handling his fame'.' He hadn't risen his voice, or seemed angry in any particular way, but Gilderoy felt rebuked/chastised anyway. (He also hadn't failed to notice the use of Harry Potter's first name and wondered how impertinent this young man was - or how close they might be). 'Yes, well, I taught him well, then. Happy to hear it! From your cv I gather you've plenty of experience fighting Dark Creatures (he made sure you couldn't miss the capitals. It was a gift)o you're hired! I'll let you know when we'll be off!'
