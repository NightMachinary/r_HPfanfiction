I'd like to second the recommendation for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19381933/chapters/46118053][Black Ink, Red Rose]]. The author has done a great job showing the perspectives of both factions - and Ginny's downward spiral - without bashing the good guys or excusing any of the horrible things done by Voldemort's supporters. In particular, one of the pairings in the fic fits OP's requirement of no "massive age gaps unless it is clear that this is evil." The fic shows just how unhealthy the relationship can be.
