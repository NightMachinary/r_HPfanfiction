Most of my favourite stories come from TheDivineComedian on Ao3. They have absolutely mastered that dark tone with interesting introspections. I was hooked on every single one of their fics.

linkao3(Styx) really stands out just for the drama and tense atmosphere all through the fic. It has smart Peter and it's just a big ol argument with Regulus and it's great ðŸ˜Š
