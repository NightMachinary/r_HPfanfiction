If you want an actual dark Harry (and not just 'darker' as in this involves murder of like, a lot of people, most background character but a few 'main') i highly recommend lnkfnn(Nightmare Man)

I love the character development even just throughout the story itself (ntm, it has a prequel with even more), and the interactions throughout it. There's no smut, no relationship with Harry himself or any other character, actually. The entire story isn't dark, its got some good 'soft' points.
