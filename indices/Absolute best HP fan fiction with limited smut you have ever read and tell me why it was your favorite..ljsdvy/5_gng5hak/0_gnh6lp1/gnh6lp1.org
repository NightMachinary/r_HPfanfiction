Currently reading Antithesis and can confirm it really is bloody brilliant ðŸ˜Š. Being in Adrian's head is so tragic and interesting. How he grows throughout the story and interacts with those around him, it's so easy to see why he ends up doing the things he does. I'm really loving it.

I don't know how it ends but I don't see any smut at all so far? Even between Harry/Luna, I just read them as friends. But I'm Aro so I totally could have just missed the flirting or implications... Either way, even without the smut the story still works fantastically and the characters and relationships are interesting to read.
