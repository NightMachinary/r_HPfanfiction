WBWL by itself is not a bad plot to use .. however the way people write it makes less and less sense, they can use one of many other ways to implement it instead of driving out Harry, Potter parents bring them up away from all the attention by raising them in isolation .. possibly in muggle world, don't give more attention to one above other .. James pushes back as much as possible but it's not possible to avoid all the media attention or can't stop people from pointing fingers or showing one more attention than the other which gives Harry more drive to excel either to make people(not his parent as they are good ones) treat him like they treat his brother or to gain more power to protect his brother as he knows there will be people out to kill him for what they believe he did .. eventually turn it into Harry killing Voldy to save Larry or together .. there must be other ways of doing this without Dumble, James & Lily bashing.
