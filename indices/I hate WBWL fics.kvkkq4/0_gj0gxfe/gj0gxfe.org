Yeah, that's my issue with the trope. It's just always so dumb. There's always some stupid reason as to why /both/ boys cannot live together: Dumbledore manipulates them and Potters are dumb enough to listen to him, or Dumbledore is evil and /Imperios/ them, or Potters don't think they can take care of both children for whatever reason, or Potters are dumb and think that being the brother to BWL will make him miserable so it's better to send him to miserable someplace else, or they hide boys at different places but then they forget about Harry for some reason. And of course, the worst of all, Potters are drunk on fame along with their son, to the point that they ignore Harry.
