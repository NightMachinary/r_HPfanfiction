When they are well written they are fine but most are just plain boring.

Harry most often is portrayed as a 1.89m muscular, politically genius, magic god at age 11 who could work as an Auror if he was 7 years. That just puts the suspense out of every encounter or threat and therefore we never wonder if he got in over his head or not plus any rival turns from a hurdle to overcome into a bug to be stepped on.

And how do his parents react to all of this...

he just wants to get attention beat him up.
