I can't speak for what might have turned you off from it before, but personally I gave up on it shortly after the Yule Ball scene (Ch36)

The writing quality in the first chapter stays roughly the same throughout the fic. What turned me off is that the fic uses some of the most common and absurd tropes in the "time travel back to teen Tom Riddle" genre: Tom is ridiculously possessive of Harry, but that possessiveness is written as romantic rather than creepy. Harry and Tom are the sexiest young men in Slytherin, and everyone wants them. Harry is OP to the extent that he wipes the floor with anyone who challenges him, and uses his adult intellect to lead Tom Riddle around by the nose, etc.
