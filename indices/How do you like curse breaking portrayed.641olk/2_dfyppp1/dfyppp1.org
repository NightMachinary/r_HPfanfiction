Kinda Nonjon's a black comedy

In my story darkness ascendant harry uses cursepicks and a sneaky pete(yew wand with lunar hyena whisker core) to disassemble cursed sheets of parchment from bill. The cursepicks allow him to 'move' spells while the wand is more attuned to shattering other's spells than a regular wand would be. The moved spells can then be ignored while the spells underneath can then be broken.
