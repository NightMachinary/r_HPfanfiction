Basically, in my /White Squirrel/-tainted headcanon, a curse-breaker is a specialist of charms-weaving who observes the (usually Dark) enchantments on an object or location, and try to figure out how to unravel them.

They are hired by Gringotts because, somehow, the Goblins can claim ownership of ancient cursed treasures if they manage to get their hands on it; and, therefore, they need wizards (who can use wands) to break the curses on the ancient Egyptian tombs and get them the loot.

Curse-breakers can also be hired independantly, either for the same purpose of researching treasure, or to break individual curses (like the one on the DADA teaching position).

Finally, curse-breakers work at Saint-Mungo's to break the Darkest of curses on humans. I imagine a high-flying Cursbreaker would have been able to reverse-engineer a counterspell to Sectumsempra, for instance.
