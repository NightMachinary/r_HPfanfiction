Fanon wards are so popular because in a world where anyone can kill you or rob you using an everyday object(wand), it makes sense that there exist protections other than just hope/luck and the fidelius.

I fully agree with your view on magic. Magic by definition is the opposite of logic. While it may have guidelines and maybe some ironclad impossibilities, reducing it to a huge list of spells and recipes able to be read and mastered by anyone with an eidetic memory is just sad. That would make it a science.
