Curse breaking is interesting because of the gap between Canon and Fanon. Fanon has made curse breaking essentially the destruction of wards, yet in canon wards don't exist, so naturally it must mean something else right?

As a community we've pigeonholed curse breaking into the destruction of magical barriers (wards) yet we ignore cursed objects, medical healing of the dark arts, using potions and all sorts of other types of magic.

For me I imagine curse breaking as the discipline of removing magic. Whether it's removing a curse from an object, a wound or a building, a curse breaker can do it all. It's why in my head I've always had such respect for Bill Weasley. Curse breakers should have the knowledge to combat all kinds of magicks across all kinds of objects, I can't imagine of a more knowledge and skill intensive discipline. The only wizards shown to have any aptitude for the subject are Dumbledore, Bill and Riddle which goes to show just how skilled you have to be. The other notable mention would be Severus as his knowledge of the dark arts makes him the go to healer when Dark Arts are interfering with healing, be it Dumbledore's hand or during the war. I view that as curse breaking as well.

As for the actual physical act of curse breaking I prefer the mystical over the logical. I much prefer the curse breaker having to magically sense the magic they're trying to remove than using plans and mathematical equations. Magic is a mystical force that defies logic and understanding by it's very nature, I disapprove of attempts to make it solvable using equations. Dumbledore, Riddle and Harry view magic as an art driven by emotions and feeling and they're known to be the most powerful wizards of their age. Compare that to Hermione who views everything with logic and whilst being exceptionally bright, she is never on the same level.

Sorry went on a bit of a tangent there, but the point remains - curse breaking to me is an art, and any fic that expresses it in that way is fine with me. As mentioned here already, [[/u/Taure]] does a great job of that in his fic The One He Feared. As does canon I think when Dumbledore inspects the wards around the cave in Book 6. He doesn't use a plan with arithmetic expressions and calculate the counter, no he sense the magic and realizes what it wants.
