  Fanon often has curse breakers be required to have studied Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. I have no clue about canon.

According to canon they at least need Arithmancy:

  He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: /Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which are currently recruiting Curse breakers for thrilling opportunties abroad/...They want Arithmacy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'

Based on this description the common fanon depiction seems pretty accurate. I imagine that Bill is essentially Indiana Jones.
