/sigh/

Warning: I am not a kind reader.

Why is Voldemort sneering? Why are people bursting dramatically into halls? Why is a titchy little nineteen/twenty-year-old mouthing off to Voldemort? Why does said titchy little Snape have his characterization from over a decade later? Why is a boy apparently better than McGonagall at duelling? Why is there fanon all over this thing? Why is there so much bloody telling and no showing? Why is there no characterization worth speaking of? Why is le edge dripping from the entire last half of this first chapter? Why is "dark" so enthusiastically equated to le edgy stereotypes? Why can I smell a Gary Stu from a hundred yards away? Why is this apparently a serious fic and not crack? Why do I have a headache now?

Why? Why? Whyyyyyyyyyyyy?
