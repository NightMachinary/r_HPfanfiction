I liked all the House Elves in "A Black Comedy". The brief scene with Sully in Chapter 23 is one of my favorites.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] has some great House Elf characters, including Kreacher, who gets some quality character development. I liked the world building that the author did, and it's an interesting take on how the campaign for House Elf rights might have played out.
