I remember reading a fic where house elves are just a tiny physical body that lets them exert the smallest amount of their power on Earth but at the other end of their connection to Earth each of them is as powerful as a genie from Aladdin.

Two house elves fighting is a multiple galaxy destroying slug fest but from a wizards point of view they just stare at one another until one falls over.
