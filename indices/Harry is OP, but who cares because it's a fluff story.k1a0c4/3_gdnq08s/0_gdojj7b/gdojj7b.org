Was scrolling this thread thinking "if no one mentions this I'm gonna add it". This version of Harry is practically invincible, but the fic and most of the people around him are more concerned about making sure everyone are welcomed and accommodated. His networks of friends are really OP as well, the kind of "we'd just roll over the Wizarding Europe before lunch" OP in another fic, but here they just walk around having fun and ensure everyone are having a good time.
