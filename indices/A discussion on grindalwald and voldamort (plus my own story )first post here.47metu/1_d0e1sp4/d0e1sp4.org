  Now it was the begging of august and Harry was changed he was taller with some slight muscle on him but that wasn't the most notable change no that was his face gone was the smile and kind green eyes in their place was a hard stone like expression of a trained soldier and if someone were to look in his eyes they would find not the kind eyes of lily potter but eyes like hard emerald that clearly promised pain to anyone who angered him .

Words fail me.

This kind of edgy Harry is a dime a dozen. It's not unique in the least.
