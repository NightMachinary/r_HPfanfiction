One of the best ways to improve grammar is to proof read your story out aloud. Note where you pause naturally? That's a full stop. Say something as an aside? That should be in brackets. Notice you are getting confused? Need to restructure your sentence.

For example your post, you have written:

These are my opinions feel free to disagree Voldamort yes I know he was probably made this way for story but he is a moron plain and simple he has all this magical knowledge and power and can't beat a teenage wizard without a full Hogwarts education?

Firstly: You have an extra line break between disagree and Voldemort. You also spelt his name wrong. Both of these are easy to fix and should be obvious to you if you proof read.

Next; if your read it aloud, it becomes obviously too long. You run out of breath. The sentence also rambles. It isn't clear at all.

So what is the point you want to say? Break down each point.

- This is my own opinion
- You are free to disagree
- Voldemort was written in a certain way
- Voldemort was a 'moron plain and simple'
- Voldemort had lots of magical knowledge and power
- Despite this Voldemort could not beat a teenage wizard without a full Hogwarts education

Now put the points that logically follow together. Remember after each idea the sentence should end.

So the above becomes:

This is my own opinion and you are free to disagree. Voldemort was written to be a moron. Voldemort had all this magical knowledge and power, but he could not beat a teenage wizard (without a full Hogwarts education).

One of the quickest ways to lose a reader is to make it hard for them to read. If they have to pause every sentence to figure out what you meant, it is very hard work. In a lot of ways, poor grammar is worse than poor spelling.
