Grammar is a big thing for a lot of people, and you'll get a LOT more readers if you fix your grammar.

If it's not instinctive for you maybe just write how you normally do and ask someone to beta and correct it? I really think most people will skip right past a story with bad grammar since that literally makes it harder for them to read. You could have the best story in the world but 99% of people will not get past your first three paragraphs before giving up.
