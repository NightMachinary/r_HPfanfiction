It's hard to take this story, and you as a writer, seriously when you know you have an issue with your grammar but don't want help improving it. Someone on this thread also offered to help your grammar and you turned it down to ask why people write mpreg. Honestly, if you want people to stop commenting on your grammar and focus on the story then maybe do something about the grammar. It's very distracting.
