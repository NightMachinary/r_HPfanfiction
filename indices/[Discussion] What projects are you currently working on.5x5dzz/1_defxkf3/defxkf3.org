Summary: (Copied directly from AO3 because I'm lazy):

In 1945, Albus Dumbledore defeats Gellert Grindelwald. Later in 1945, Dumbledore is weakened, captured, and killed by the remnants of Grindelwald's Magic Army. In 1947, Alexander McElroy, leader of the Magic Army, is caught, apprehended for Dumbledore's murder, and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss. Later in 1947, Headmaster Dippet hires Tom Riddle as professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.

In the beginning of 1948, Stateira McElroy, upset over the loss of her brother Alexander, lashes out against a fellow student and lands herself in detention with Professor Riddle. It all flies out of control from there.
