I've never finished a fic as I always lose interest or doubt myself. Another problem I have is delusions of Grandeur about writing epic fictions. For instance I started planning and plotting a fic following 3 Generations of a Goblin family through the various Rebellions, Grindelwald, Voldermort and the Goblins long thought out revenge on Wizarding kind. I had plot points, family trees shit loads handwritten in a journal that I wrote whilst on holiday (sad I know). I stopped because it was too much for me at the time so it's shelved.

My current worm has been in my head for 6 months and I actually opened up my laptop today and wrote some scenes. It's an AU of Harry Potter in a more classical fantasy setting, knights, mythical creatures play a huge part and I'm just really inspired with it at the moment with new ideas coming all the time.

Due to the migration of Dragons at certain points throughout the year the United Kingdom is mainly small towns dotted throughout the country. Once the Dragons begin their migration in August muggles flee their towns and travel the country through dangerous terrains to reach their last hope to save their children from certain death. The Kingdom of Hogsmeade opens it's gates and escorts them to Hogwarts Castle where their children will be tested by the Sorting Hat to see if they will be allowed to stay in the Kingdom.

Thats a quick backstory, there's a lot of changes to canon some of which I'm really enjoying writing and brainstorming. Hopefully I'll actually release at least one chapter of this one.
