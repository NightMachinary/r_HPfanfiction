- *Title*: Fortuna Favet Callidus

- *Rating*: T (for now)

- *Warning*: minor violence, language.

- *Genre*: Drama/Adventure

- *Status*: In progress

- *Summary*: A Slytherin!James fanfic in which the Potters are a traditionally dark family. The plot follows James and his father, Charlus, (Fleamont is James' grandfather in the story. Screw Pottermore.) through their Hogwarts years and the primary conflicts of their eras. I'm using a more sporadic writing style as an experiment, so chapters may not be in chronological order when the POV is not James. It's my first fanfic, so I doubt it's very good, but if people would take the time to read it and tell me what they think it would be much appreciated, as I've not received much in the way of constructive criticism as of yet.
