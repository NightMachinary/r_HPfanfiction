- *Title:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10926278/1/The-Invisible-Girl][The Invisible Girl]]
- *Rating::* T
- *Genre:* Drama/Friendship
- *Status:* In progress
- *Summary:* "Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him." - Albus Dumbledore. Tom Riddle wasn't always alone. Evelyn Spencer grows up alongside him, first at Wool's Orphanage and then at Hogwarts. Although both children are orphans, they are not the same in any other way: he is entranced by magic; she is wary of it. But somehow they become friends.

*Notes:* I suppose this is my "main project" right now. Right now I'm writing about Tom's fifth year, when the Chamber of Secrets was first opened, but it's all seen from my OC's perspective, which is fun to write from. I've got two more parts to write, covering parts of 1943 to 1945. I'm thinking it'll have 50-60 chapters when it's all finished, which will be my longest fic ever, but I'm loving writing it, especially now that I'm in the meat of the story.
