My main question is how James is managing to interact with a Muggle while attending Hogwarts. Where did they meet? Why does he care about this particular person? Why would he try and solve a mystery rather than going to McGonagall and alerting her that there's a Muggle bent on exposing the Magical world and let the proper authorities (AKA his dad) take care of the situation?
