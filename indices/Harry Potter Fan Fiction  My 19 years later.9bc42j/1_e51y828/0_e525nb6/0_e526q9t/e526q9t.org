Okay, so I can understand James and Harry not being close and James wanting to impress his father. But, I don't understand quite how you are going to work this into the context of a school year. Students don't just randomly leave Hogwarts to take trips down to London to visit Dad's office. They did it in OOTP, but that was after everything at the school had gone to hell and no one was in control. Hogwarts has Muggle-repelling charms on it and Muggles can't even properly see it. How does he come to know that this particular Muggle has it in for the wizarding world? How old is this case? Why is it untouched? You'd think that if Harry came across a case where a wizard killed a Muggle family he wouldn't rest until it were solved.

It's fine if this is the story you want to tell, but make sure that you have concrete reasons for why things occur the way they do and you're not trying to shoehorn in things arbitrarily.
