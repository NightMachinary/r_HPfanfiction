Sorry. James finds the files during the summer holiday. When he returns to school he shows it to his friends and so that they could help him solve it. James in an effort to get more time to solve the case gets suspended. His mother, Ginny than in an effort to get both her husband and son to bound suggest that Harry take James to his work place. Camouflaging it as a way in which James could be productive during his suspension whilst truly getting them to bound. Whilst at the work place Harry does not spend much time with his son and is instead working cases or talking to his friends. During this time James manages to slip away from his father to help find evidence. So once he returns to school he has much more to go off of.

The muggle families murder happens during the early 2000s once Harry has joined the aurors. This case is a case Harry himself wanted to take however he refrained from doing it due to the ministries warnings about taking up cases that would prove to hazardous for the wizarding world. However, James only finds this out later once he has already helped the muggle. Once James finds this out both him and his father finds out both of them are not too different.
