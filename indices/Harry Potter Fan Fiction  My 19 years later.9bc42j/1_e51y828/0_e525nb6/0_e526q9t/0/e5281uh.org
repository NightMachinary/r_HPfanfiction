James knows about the case because of the office Harry has at home. James used on of the spells he got from his friend to infiltrate Harrys office (not alohamora). Once in James rummages through some files and finds one that interests him which is the muggles family being killed by wizards. He choses this one as is resembles what happens to his fathers parents and if he solves the case than his father would become closer with him.\\
Once visiting the muggle James begins to feel immense pity for him. James sees loads of pictures on the wall of “proof” that wizards exist. However, most of the picture are arguably fake. Once the muggle tells James what had happened James agrees to help him as he believes James is also a muggle and a believer in the wizarding world. So than James would try to collect all the evidence that he could (not enough to expose the wizarding community) to help the muggle find the perpetrator. However, once the sufficient amount of evidence is found the muggle is now bent on exposing the whole wizarding community as he believes wizards are too dangerous to be kept in the shadows.
