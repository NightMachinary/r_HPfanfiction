James and his father are not very close. The only thing they have in common is that they both love to play quidditch, however James isn't even a seeker nor as good as his father. Harry also is barley home mostly because his out all day solving cases. In an effort to get closer and impress his father James thought that he could solve this case and him and his father would become closer.

James found the muggle through Harry Potters untouched case files. This muggle has been long trying to find the wizards whom had killed his family. James, knowing about his fathers parents also being killed by a wizard felt pity for the muggle and tried to help him.

James would pressure his friends to help him go to his fathers working place to help him find clues to the murderers of the muggles family. However, James would come to know that justice is not enough for the muggle and he would like to expose the whole Wizarding World as he believes that they are way to dangerous to be kept in the shadows because of how the wizarding world tried to sweep his families murder under the rug.
