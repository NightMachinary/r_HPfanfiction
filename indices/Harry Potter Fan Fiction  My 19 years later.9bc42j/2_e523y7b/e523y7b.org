  Albus' strange abilities
#+end_quote

Oh please, why do people always make ASP the chosen child?

Anyway, here's the information on the next-gen characters that we know from the Epilogue (disregard CC and JKR's post-information) that you should keep in mind:

- Albus resembles Harry with a thin face and green eyes, but /he is not a clone/ (resemble does not mean identical but only similar). More than likely, he has auburn hair because of his name. He's good friends with Rose, maybe not extremely close but a sorting wouldn't break them up. He's the least likely to end up in Slytherin.

- James is like Ron. This means that he's highly ambitious, highly insecure because he's often neglected in favor of his siblings, but also extremely protective of his siblings (and probably distrusts anyone who dates them). He's the most likely to be in Slytherin. More than likely, he has black hair because of his name, and since Harry and Albus resemble each other so much, James probably does, too. He's also only a year older than Albus. None of the cousins are the same age as him.

- Lily has red hair because of her name. She's two years younger than Albus and is extremely close to her brothers, including Teddy. There's not much else to her character. Hugo is the same or close in age to her.
