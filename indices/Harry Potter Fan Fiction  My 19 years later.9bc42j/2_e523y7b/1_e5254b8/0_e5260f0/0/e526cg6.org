Oh I think you're story sounds fine to me. But I am hesistant about "special abilites" just depends on what they are. I have seen people go way over the top with that sort of thing.

Albus not wanting to live up to his father's name is a good idea. People taking different angles with characters is a good idea. Most of next-gen characterises them the same way: James is like the James , Lily is like Ginny and Albus is Harry . We see this in the epilogue in essence but taking different approaches is a good idea.
