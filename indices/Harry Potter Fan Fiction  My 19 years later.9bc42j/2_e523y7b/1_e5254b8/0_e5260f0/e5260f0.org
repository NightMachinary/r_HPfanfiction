In my story that is not the case. Albus does not care about living up to his fathers name, in-fact he would rather be for distant than close. Thats why in my story Albus finds a father figure in Neville Long bottom, a professor at the school. Also, Albus in my story is also not “the chosen one” I hate that gimmick to. Yes he has strange abilities but that does not make him the chosen one in my story.
