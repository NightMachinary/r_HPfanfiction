  Albus canonically has black hair
#+end_quote

This is nowhere in canon. His hair color isn't mentioned at all, we only know he has a thin face and green eyes. People assume he has black hair because of the "resembles" line, but as I already said, /resembles is to be like or similar, not identical/.
