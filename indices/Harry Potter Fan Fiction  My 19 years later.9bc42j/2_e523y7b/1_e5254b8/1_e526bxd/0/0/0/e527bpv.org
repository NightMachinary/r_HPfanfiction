Yes. But I'm saying if we talk about author's intention as in-naming him Albus was JK Rowling clueing us in to his hair colour, than it must be acknowledged that author's intention is that he has black hair like Harry. Basically, in one interpretation it has to be argued that Harry named his children after their hair colour-there is little to indicate this is the case considering their names. However, if we think of author's intention then you may have a point-but author's intention is that Albus has black hair.
