Assuming their name correlates to their hair colour is strange. That wasn't the implied intention with the naming convention. Lily was always going to be Lily, James was always going to be James and Albus was always going to be Albus (and if we're talking about author's intention then surely it must be acknowledged that Albus canonically has black hair). In essence if Albus had been born with black hair, Harry's not going to suddenly name him Severus Albus-Albus Severus would always be his name.

James isn't ignored-he just didn't get the reaction he expected which is very different. He's taking most of the intention despite it being Albus' first time at Hogwarts. That's pretty indicative of him being a bit of Fred/George character.
