You're kind of taking their names too seriously. Just being named Albus or Lily really doesn't mean much in terms of hair colour. Each of their names follows the same pattern, so there's no reason for it to have relation to hair colour. Lily's the only girl, and their had to be a Lily. James was taken-so let's name him Albus after someone else we want to honour.

James is said to be like Ron after loudly exclaiming Teddy's relationship with Victorie. This is meant to indicate that like Ron, James could be insensitive to other's privacy/relationships. Not that he was like Ron in his insecurities-which would be weird to bring up. We see him joking around, he's clearly meant to be like Fred and George, and Ron in his humour. There's nothing to indicate he has any place in Slytherin.

Also this is fairly indicative about Albus' (and Rose's) personality-broody and solemn like Harry. While Lily is more lighthearted.

  “If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no pressure.”

  “Ron!”

  Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.

But I agree making Albus the chosen child/special one is the wrong thing to do. I like stories that have Albus being shy and awkward and trying hard to live up to his father's name but not necessarily making it.
