linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent) is probably second-best Haphne fic to Novocaine, but has the benefit of being complete. I personally don't think it's a great introduction to the ship though because it subverts so many of the tropes.

That said, I'd read Novocaine and a couple of James Spookie's fics to get a feel for how the cliche's of the ship are normally used - linkffn(the things we do for love; lion tamer; legacy preservation act) - and then Importance of Intent.
