  AU. Two days after returning home from fifth-year classes and O.W.L. exams, Daphne Greengrass finds on her pillow, a letter from her much-older self. Included in this letter is a Muggle envelope addressed to Harry Potter from his much-older self.Daphne's letter reveals that elderly Daphne and elderly Harry, after each had outlived a spouse, got married. Marrying Harry Potter, elderly Daphne assures young Daphne, was the best thing to ever happen to elderly Daphne in her long life.Elderly Daphne also tells her teenaged self---Sirius Black's just-read will emancipates almost-sixteen-year-old Harry Potter and grants him the Lordship of the House of Black. In turn, emancipating the Potter Heir turns him into Lord Potter. Harry Potter gaining two Lordships means he'll need two wives. Young Daphne, why wait till you need a cane before you become betrothed to the best man in Wizarding Britain?This is an alt-universe GreenPot Harmony (H/Hr and HP/DG) story that bashes Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley.
