Consult the book of armaments!!! - Chapter 7, Verse 25

And on the fourth day after the first task of the tri-wizard tournament Daphne Greengrass woke up as the sun shined into the Gryffindor 4th year boys dorm room. "I loved last night Harry, I will cherish it forever." she spoke to her green eyed warrior. "I'm so glad I picked you so many hears ago instead of all those fan girls who threw themselves at me. I can't wait until we are 15 so we can get married. I want to make little Potters with you." she sighed in complete bliss "I can't wait either darling." she then nuzzled back into his shoulder and fell asleep.
