Idk if they would go that far. I see Gryffindors as pretty loyal to each other. Like they ain't known for their loyalty like for Hufflepuff but I can see them being you mess with one of them you mess with them all. Like I love the scene in OoTP where the twins are comforting the crying first year after detention using the blood quill. This shows the house is really close and loyal to each other.
