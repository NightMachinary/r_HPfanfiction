Maybe but I can't see them doing anything too dangerous. I can see their hazing being more embarrassing or stupid than something that will get a poor first year killed. Like maybe hand Mcgonagall a can of catfood, streak through the great hall in their underwear, hug Snape, or tug on Dumbledore's beard. I don't see the Gryffindors doing something that would put new first years in life threatening danger.
