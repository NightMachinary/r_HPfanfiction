  I see Gryffindors as pretty loyal to each other...you mess with one of them you mess with them all

But that's when outsiders come to mess with people considered part of the group. I can definitely imagine a Gryffindor house where people need to go through hazing rituals before they're truly considered a part of the group. Sure that's not really depicted in canon, but stuff like that happens (or at least happened) all the time in real life at military academies (both high-school level and above), uni frats, high school sports teams, etc.
