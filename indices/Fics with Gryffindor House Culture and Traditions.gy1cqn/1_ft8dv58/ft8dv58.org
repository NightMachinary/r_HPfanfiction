The only one I can think of is the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1259006][War is for Children]]" series from petroltogo, the second (and most recent part) was updated January this year. I enjoyed the first part a lot and while I'd like more detail into the culture the conflict it causes is the main focus of the story.

Honestly outside of Slytherin, I can't think of many stories where the other houses get fleshed out beyond canon.
