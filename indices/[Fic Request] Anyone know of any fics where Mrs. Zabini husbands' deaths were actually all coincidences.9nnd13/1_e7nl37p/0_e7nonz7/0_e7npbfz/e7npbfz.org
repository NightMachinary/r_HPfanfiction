I agree - and that's touched upon in the story. If I recall correctly, Daphne and Blaise make a pact to never say 'mudblood' again precisely because all the claims of "ironic" muggle hatred seem like justifications.

And I'm not kidding about the author making the Slytherins into saints - Draco Malfoy turns out to be tutoring the first year girls in potions, and Snape's blatant favoritism is just to counterbalance how the other teachers and students oppress them.

So it's a very entertaining mixed bag, and I recommend reading it.
