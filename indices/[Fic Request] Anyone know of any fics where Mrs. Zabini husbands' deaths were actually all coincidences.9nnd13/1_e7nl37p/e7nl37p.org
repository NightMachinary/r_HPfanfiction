Warning - I haven't finished this story, but it has what you're looking for. In fact, in my mind it takes the "Slytherins are all misunderstood" a bit too far - they're all practically saints who're bullied and put-upon by the rest of the school.

There IS some very interesting introspection where they all claim to say "mudblood" ironically, and how they're always making jokes about joining Voldemort and how THAT may influence how the rest of the school treats them, but I can't guarantee that that interesting line of thought is carried through the rest of the story.
