I could see her being a help, showing him secret places in the castle (maybe find the RoR a bit earlier), be a lookout/information gatherer. While she has been around a couple decades, I doubt her magic/academic knowledge has progressed. She splashes water around a bit, but I doubt she can flip through a book if she wanted to. She can't practice any magic either. How much memory capability would she have anyway? It seems that the ghosts have some capacity for making/storing new memories (they greet people by name, haunt them, etc), but if you came back 10 years after graduating would they remember your name? You can make the ghosts strongly AU by giving them attributes and powers they don't have in the books, I suppose.
