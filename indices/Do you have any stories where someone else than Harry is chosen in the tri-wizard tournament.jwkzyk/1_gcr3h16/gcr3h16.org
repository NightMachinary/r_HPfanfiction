Hmmm, there was one where Harry thought that his name might come out of the cup, so he was prepared: he did a quick switching spell on the piece of paper for one with (as I recall) Draco's name on it. He peeked at the original and saw it was Cedric, so at first he thought he'd been wrong. Then a fourth slip came out and he did a switching spell again to put Cedric's name back in.

Don't recall if the fic was finished. Think I have the name written down somewhere so I could credit the switching spell idea if I used it.

Edited to add: yup, found it. Break the Pattern: Tri-Wizard by Squirrel of Shadow, and it is complete. Fun details I'd forgotten that were in my notes: the "school" he entered Draco under was Cheaters Prosper. After the names were drawn he excuses himself to the loo and burns the slip of paper with his name on it. linkffn(11114679)
