Firstly, a Death Eater Weasley killing her own parents and most of her family is quite dark, even by his standards. Harry killing Sirius isn't that unsettling for he barely knew him whereas Ginny grew up with her family who loved her.

Secondly, different people have different sensitivities. For example, I puked out my breakfast after reading a Hagrid Dobby smut fic linkffn(1634396) while I am fine with reading about spells conjuring ants that eat people alive, to peel the skin, etc.
