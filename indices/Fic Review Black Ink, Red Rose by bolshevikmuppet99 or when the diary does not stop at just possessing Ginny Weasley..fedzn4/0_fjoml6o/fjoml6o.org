Bolshevik writes really good stuff. He has good combat (love the silent casting though I think spells could be cast more often), good characterization (Dumbledore's especially), and great stories. They can tend to be depressing though, with his tendencies to corrupt good characters and just kill of characters in general. I really hope he returns to Phoenix Insurgent now.
