Linkffn(Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak)

I'm a big fan of a well done Harry/Hermione fic. This one in particular is probably my favorite. It starts off canon compliant, right after the epilogue. Each chapter skips back and forth in time, and there are several point of view changes. Starts off mysterious until everything finally comes together in the end.
