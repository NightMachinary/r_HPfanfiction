[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel narrated from James Potter's POV. How can she end up with Harry? There's a twist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Harry is raised by his BAMF archaeologist aunt, Dr Petunia Evans.
