IMO I don't think so. Unicorns in cannon are light footed and hard to catch by humans so getting the hair for a wand core is I think hard for the wand makers and apparently while getting the hair they're treated with the utmost respect so I think in that sense it's more that the unicorn willingly gives up a hair I don't think they'd feel any attachment to it or in your questions feel the magic of the wand.

Also, there's unicorn blood, hair and horn used in potions... following your logic they'd feel that too?
