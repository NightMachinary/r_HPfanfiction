You're ignoring the fact that Harry seems to have a very intimate connection with Voldemort through the Horcrux though: Going as far as having actual clear visions like watching a movie. It doesn't get any more sympathetic than that.

IMHO the reason why Voldemort doesn't feel the destruction of his Horcruxes is author fiat, a pure plot contrivance. (And people like you always go on about how superior magic is, so even if 'feeling the destruction' isn't innate to the Horcruxes I'd expect a super wizard like Voldemort, who creates a Magical Homunculus to house his soul in, to come up with some kind of additional enchantment for that purpose)
