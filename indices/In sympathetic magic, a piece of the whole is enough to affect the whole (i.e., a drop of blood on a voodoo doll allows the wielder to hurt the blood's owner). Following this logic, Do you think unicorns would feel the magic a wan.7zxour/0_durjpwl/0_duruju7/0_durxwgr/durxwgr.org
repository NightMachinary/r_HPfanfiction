Regarding Harry having the connection, one could posit that it's due to the blood connection they share as living creatures. The Horcruxes, on the other hand, are inanimate objects that have no life beyond the bit of soul stored in them. I do confess that I have felt it strange that Voldemort wasn't sensitive to the destruction of the devices, especially given how the locket was portrayed.
