Yeah, HP magic doesn't generally use the principles of sympathy. It's an extremely localised magical system, where it's quite rare for magic to be able to affect things far away from the caster. When it does do so, it generally does it via the medium of affecting an abstract object with no location like a word (the Taboo) rather than by directly casting magic across a wide geographical area.

Just consider horcruxes - Voldemort didn't feel their destruction despite them being part of his very essence/being. If a piece of your soul is insufficient to form some kind of sympathetic link I have no idea what would be.
