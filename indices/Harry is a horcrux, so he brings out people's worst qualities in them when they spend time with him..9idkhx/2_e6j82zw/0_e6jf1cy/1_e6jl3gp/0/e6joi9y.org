I haven't said that he isn't a true horcrux. I said that the mechanics of a horcrux in a living host may differ. /How/ they differ, I don't care to say. Thats entirely up to the author.

And who knows what Rowling meant by "not a true horcrux"? Did she elaborate on that? I haven't found anything on it. Maybe that just means "can be destroyed by anything that kills the living being" - so not just basilisk venom and fiendfyre.

And /once again/ I'll say this: If something would make everyone involved a moron, chances are they aren't /all/ morons and its just not a feasible way.
