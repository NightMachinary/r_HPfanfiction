I wouldn't call Harry not having that effect as a horcrux a plothole. We don't know the exact mechanics of a horcrux, nor do we know the way his horcrux differs from the others. Its well within the realm of suspense of disbelief that his own just doesn't work that way, or that horcrux in living hosts have other effects.

The "Twins never notice Pettigrew" thing is more of a plothole, as it becomes quite a bit of writing gymnastics to explain away why they never wondered who was sleeping in their +Number 1 Target's+ brother's bed with him.
