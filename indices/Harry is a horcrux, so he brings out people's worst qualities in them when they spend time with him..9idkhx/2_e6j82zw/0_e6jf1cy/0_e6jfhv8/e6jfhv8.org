I actually doubt Percy would have had his pet sleeping in his bed. He'd have had a stand for his cage or something, thus not showing up as in his bed very often. They actually ignored Ron most of the time, I really don't see them taking much time to check if he's in bed or not....if I were up to mischief at night, I'd be checking prefects, not whether my little brother was in bed or not! Hogwarts is a huge castle, and unless they were looking for Harry, I doubt they'd specifically go to that one dormitory.

And lets not forget, they were unobservent enough that they actually thought Ginny was upset about Mrs Norris, because she loved cats. We never see the slightest indication that she's so fond of cats that she'd like Mrs Norris, whom everyone hated, including Hagrid.
