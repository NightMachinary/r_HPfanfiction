I think the idea that the Mauraders were invisible to be the best solution. We know that the Mauraders made defenses for the map when it insulted Snape, so it's safe to assume they did far more than just a few insults. As for Remus seeing Sirius and Pettigrew, Remus was a Maurader too. Surely they would be able to find each other on it.
