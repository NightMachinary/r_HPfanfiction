I'm pretty sure it's canon that enchanting living beings is quite a bit different and much harder than just enchanting an object. It's not unreasonable to assume that by a similar mechanic a horcrux can't make a person invulnerable in the same way it can make an object.

The horcrux's soul fragment might also simply be sealed inside Harry's own soul and thus unable to interact with the outside world directly.
