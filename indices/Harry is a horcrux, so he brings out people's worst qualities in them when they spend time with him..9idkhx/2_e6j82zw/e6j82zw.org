It's one of the plot holes in JK's writing. When people connected the dots between harry being a horcrux and a horcrux's properties. JK later tried to justify by saying that harry wasn't a true horcrux. There are many such plot holes which were later discovered by fan theories like why didn't Fred and George not notice Pettigrew un the marauder's map.
