Grimmald Place has always been one of my favorites. Privet Drive is a more subtle one: privet is usually planted as a hedge, a barrier behind which Harry is hidden but also trapped. (I've always thought Kreacher/creature was demeaning, and it makes me think less JKR every time.)

One of my favorite fanon ones is when somebody threatens Rita that they will squash her like a bug, and she isn't sure whether they know her secret or it's just a turn of phrase.

P.S. I noticed your solar flair.
