We know from canon that she can be quite snippy if somebody insults her friends or family (See Hermione taking crap about /The Quibbler/)

However, she usually deals with difficult people using her quirkiness as that tends to weird people out enough for them to stop bothering her. The way I see it, she uses her oddness as a buffer to shield herself.

That *isn't* to say that the oddness is just a fa√ßade that she hides her real personality behind (As some fics have done). I think she does it almost unconsciously. It's a way to protect herself from others. A bit like how people act more formal around people they don't know well. Luna just turns up the quirkiness. Like everyone, she behaves slightly differently to not be bothered. Her mannerisms are just different from the average person.

For example, I don't think she would rise to Malfoy's bait in the same way Harry, Ron and even Hermione sometimes do, unless he was insulting her friends/family. Instead, she would subtly insult him. Here's an exchange I've come up with.

  <Malfoy says something insulting to Luna, Harry and Ron as they are walking down to the Great Hall for lunch>

  "Oh dear. Have you spent any time around Indian Burial Grounds recently, Draco? The curses they have do tend to bring out the nastiness in people. I think I have a counter charm bracelet around here somewhere."

  Luna roots around in her bag and pulls out what looks like two rat tails tied together in a circle. She holds out the bizarre object to Draco, who instinctively leans away from her. "Here you go, this should help with the mood swings. It might help clear up that acne on your forhead too."

  Draco stares at Luna for a few seconds, bemused, before stomping away with red cheeks, and a hand covering his forehead.

  "Oh my, those spirits must really have a hold on him."

  "It's nice to have you around, Luna" Harry says, over Ron's guffaw.
