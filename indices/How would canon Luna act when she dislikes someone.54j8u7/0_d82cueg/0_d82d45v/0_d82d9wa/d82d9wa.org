Ahh I didn't know this was a question about first year. I admit to having skimmed the content of your post.

In first year Luna should be more withdrawn. You must consider that her mum died recently, and she doesn't have much social experience. I think she might be more vulnerable to insult (compared to her 4th year when we meet her in canon), but you could also believably fashion her into being a bit more feisty if that's something you want to do.
