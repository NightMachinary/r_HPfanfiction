  After Frisk's first year at Hogwarts, things should be looking up for the Dreemurr family, as the awarding of the Order of Merlin suggests. But the next new students at Hogwarts may tip some very delicate scales... and in the Underground Kurt Kairos and Sans have a project of their own. Sequel to Harry Potter and the Underground's Saviour.
