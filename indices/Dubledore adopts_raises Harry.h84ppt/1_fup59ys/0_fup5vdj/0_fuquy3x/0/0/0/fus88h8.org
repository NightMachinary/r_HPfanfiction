Yeah, Ive read this. It's not a slash fic or in any way creepy. The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is familial. Iirc, there's a scene where Harry thinks he might be gay and Albus tells him that he's gay and about Grindelwald, which might be what people are saying is "creepy," but it's not - it's giving advice to a child in his care from an informed perspective. It's not a precursor to some weird Harry/Dumbledore pairing.
