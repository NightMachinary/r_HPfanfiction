The term your looking for is Muggle-wank and there are tons out there. Unfortunately most of them are extremely cringeworthy and instead of bashing purebloods they normally try to say that somehow non-magical stuff is always better than magical stuff as if anybody alive today wouldn't murder a cousin or uncle or something if it would let them perform minor acts of magic let alone the stuff that happens in the wizarding world. I understand bashing the parchment and quils and the racism but the moment a fic goes "all magic is obviously inferior to SCIENCE and LOGIC and REASON and MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE" I check out. Honestly I would do a lot worse than kill a cousin if only I would get the ability to perform ONE spell from the middle books let alone any of the really cool stuff you can find in the fandom. I don't understand why anyone would write stories about a magical world where all they do is talk about how cool non-magicals are.
