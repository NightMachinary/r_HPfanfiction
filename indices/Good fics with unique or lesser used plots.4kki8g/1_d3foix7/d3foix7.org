linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is a crossover with Dungeons and Dragons (specifically 3.5e). Knowing something about tabletop RPGs helps, but isn't necessary, to enjoy it - a lot of the humour is universal, although some makes more sense if you know the terminology. It feels a bit like Seventh Horcrux at times, although it's older. I'd never played any WotC D&D before reading it, and enjoyed it immensely.

A few choice quotes that sell the story even without any context:

  The first years all filed into the Great Hall apprehensively as McGonagall explained about the four houses. Milo mentally filed them into: house for the PCs, house for the villains, and two NPC houses to make up the numbers. Fair enough.

  "What's Quidditch?" Harry, Hermione, and Milo asked simultaneously. Ron fainted into his pudding. Once he came around, he described the rules. It was some unbelievably dangerous-sounding sport (two of the players' jobs were to send heavy leather balls flying at the opposing team!) played on broomstick. As Ron explained about the Golden Snitch, Milo considered it thoughtfully. From what he could tell, the Seeker's success or failure completely invalidated everything that the other players did. It was as if the sport was set up entirely to give Seekers a backdrop to compete against.

  "I like it!" Milo said. "It has everything. Magic, danger, and rules blatantly skewed for the PCs to shine. Harry, make sure to write this down." The Boy-Who-Lived dutifully added it to his growing list of plot-relevant items.

It's also over 300k words long so far, and has completed the first two years of canon and started the third - at first, it's a little bit rehashy, but the second year is very original.

linkffn(End of the Line by Shewhoguards) is a series of related one-shots set in a train station. It's also quite sad. There's a minor crossover with some of the Diskworld books, but it isn't necessary to enjoy the story. Any more info could spoil it.

linkffn(The Serpent and the Crown by The Green Pumpkin; Wit of the Raven by japanese-jew) are both interesting AUs that are sadly both abandoned. What's there, however, is both original and of high quality.
