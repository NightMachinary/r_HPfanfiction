I enjoyed linkffn(Out of the Dark and Into the Green). It uses a well known trope - Harry running away from the Dursleys - but makes it something unique. I love how we get to see Harry becoming his own person, instead of just being told he has x trait because y happened to him. Btw, if any of you know similar stories, I'd be interested!
