linkffn(A Little More Time) was my very first fanfiction. It focuses on Remus/Tonks, which is a relatively uncommon pairing in HPFF. The plot is that Teddy would like to save his parents and so he tries to bring them forward with time. Its internal logic is incredibly inconsistent and i cannot remember any glaring plot holes or other details that pushed my suspension of disbelief. In fact, it uses and enhances canon, which was what i looked for in my fanfiction at first. Read this if you like to explore the implications of characters stuck out of time, especially mothers who last saw their kid as a baby
