  And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk

So in canon, the voice appears to match the caster speaking. But it's also possible that Moody was actually speaking out loud to him. In fact, since it was a lesson, it's probably more likely that Moody was doing so, just so that there couldn't be any accusations of inappropriate commands being given. Maybe if he had used mental commands instead, the voice would have been different.
