Try linkffn(11487602) and linkffn(2980054) Both are wonderful fics, and the first one is rather new. Novel length and complete aswell, so no waiting for updates or risk of abandonment. Resurrexit was mentioned here a bit back, however, due to its recent release and the fact all of it was released at once, it does not have too many reviews and things, a shame, really. Resistance has some grammar mistakes at times, but its easily forgivable.
