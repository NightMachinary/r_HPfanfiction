linkffn(6375811) HP and the Rejected Path. Revenge Fic, lots of sex.

linkffn(8378840) Passageways. Time travel, Harry/Bellatrix pairing.

linkffn(5490079) The Little Veela That Could. Definite favorite and a unique take on Veela.

linkffn(8233291) Princess of the Blacks. Fem!Harry, but damn if it isn't the best one I've ever read. Silently Watches is always a treat to read. Also has legitimate White and Black magic, which I NEVER see.

linkffn(8848598) Allure Immune Harry. Most adorable Harry/Fleur pairing I've read. Also linkffn(9469775) Escapologist Harry by the same author. Pure crack.

linkffn(8197451) Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them. Harry's an elf, and you're not talking him out of it.

linkffn(3689325) The Original Naked Quidditch Match. 'nuff said.

linkffn(5708111) That Boy is Trouble. More Sex. More Crack. Sexy Cracky Sex.

linkffn(10685852) On A Pale Horse. Dumbledore summons a Hero from another universe. Who happens to be Death. And insane.

linkffn(10015981) West of Here. Harry gets sent back in time and becomes an old western Marshal. Odd, but good.

linkffn(7145549) Duality. Harry starts smoking cigarettes. That's all that matters. Really.

linkffn(2889350) Bungle in the Jungle. An exciting story uniquely told in the second person. Can be difficult to get into, but worth it if you do.

linkffn(6781360) The First Step is Fatal. Harry goes to Hogwarts! Too bad he died long before he got there. Ghost!Harry.

linkffn(9036071) With Strength of Steel Wings. Harry gets a tattoo, with (if you're magical) predictable results.

linkffn(3389525) Stronger Than Hope. A Legilimency fic done right.

linkffn(9911469) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus. If you're looking to be confused, look no further. A true surrealist fic.

That's all for now, I think. I've got plenty more, if anyone wants to know. Not even counting crossovers, either.
