Quantity of reviews in no way reflects the quality of a story. Look at Twilight as a prime example of this in the real world, and it's not surprising to see that sort of doctrine trickle down into FF as well. I'd almost go so far as to say the exact opposite is true - the more popular a fic is, the more likely it is actually going to be quite bad (MoR, Poison Pen, Partially Kiss Hero...)
