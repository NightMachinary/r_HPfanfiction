"Faith and Understanding" is a very well-written "Missing Moments" fic of much of the series. Ginny Weasely meets Luna Lovegood and slowly the two girls become very close friends. This is one of my all-time favorite fanfictions across any fandom. Luna is written beautifully, insightful and kind and blunt and eccentric. Ginny's got a spark to her that you don't often see. This story is heartfelt and funny and real. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3821794/1/Faith-and-UnderstandingThis]]

"Dinner with the Weasleys" is just what it says on the tin. A summer evening at the Burrow set shortly after the War, told from Luna's perspective. This fic is like a nice Sunday dinner that you'd have, going to your grandparents' house after church.

And I love the stories that tell of Neville, Luna and Ginny becoming the Silver Trio. Three very different people who need each other. What more can I say?

Oh, and this one is just straight up hilarious. Severus Snape becomes a ghost and is forced by the Universe to haunt Harry. Neither one of them is the least bit happy about it. And Ginny is a terrible baby-name giver. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The_Wendell_That_Wasnt]]
