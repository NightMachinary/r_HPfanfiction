[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] by kathryn518 just updated! It is a total time-travel mary-sue type fic but in the best possible way.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
