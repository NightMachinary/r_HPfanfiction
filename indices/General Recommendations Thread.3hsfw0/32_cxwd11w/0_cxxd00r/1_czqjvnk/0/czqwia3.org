  So my story can't be as bad as you say it is if I'm getting reviews like that can it?
#+end_quote

You'll come to realize, sooner or later, that reviews don't really matter that much, especially those that do not offer constructive criticism. There are tons of stories on FFN that have 1000+ reviews (most of them highly praising the work), but are objectively bad. Reviews are never indicators of whether a story is good or bad, and seeing your attitude makes me lose all interest, however little, I had on re-reading your story.

  Can't say anything nice don't saying anything at all I'll only take consecutive criticism and you're basically saying my story is a load of shit.

Did you actually read my post? I haven't called your story anything of that sort. Actually, I've offered ways you could really improve your writing. You say you want "constructive criticism", but when you are given concrit, you say "fuck you". You notice a problem here?

In case you can't figure it out on your own, I'll spell it out for you. You're arrogant, and quite frankly, you have no right to be, seeing your writing skills. I myself have recently written a oneshot that wasn't very good, and when people gave me criticism, I accepted them because I knew that I needed to step out of my comfort zone in order to become a better writer. If you truly want to improve, swallow up your pride and accept that your story needs real improvement.

But then again, seeing how you've responded until now, I'm probably wasting my time with you, and you'll probably begin cussing at me for trying to actually help you out.
