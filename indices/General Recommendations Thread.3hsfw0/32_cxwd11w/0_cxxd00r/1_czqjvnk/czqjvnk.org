Here are all the reviews I have got on my story (on a different website to Inkitt.com)

Chapter: 1 Omg this is so cool! I love this.

Chapter: 2 i understood this alot more. i like how your adapting it :D

It's pretty complicated but that does give you a degree of freedom on choosing where it's to go next. have to say spelling errors are a distraction. Nearly stopped reading it because of the cruelty seen in Narcissa and Lucius, written well enough that I wanted to erase the whole thing from my emotional reaction. Hoping Magie rebels, with Draco's help perhaps, and make her own way in the world.

Chapter: 4

Erm...hurry up and write that next chapter...im so into this right now! Few spelling mistakes but their not major :)

Chapter: 5 Proper loving it. Its coming on great :) I only spotted one spelling mistake which was, mouth, instead of month. I do it alot so it doesn't really matter

Hiya! I love this story! It's a bit dark, but that's OK

Chapter: 6 Omg this is really good :D i know im only reviewing on this chapter but ill read the rest later. I never thought charlie, bill and percy would be that critical and cruel towards their own family. I like how've youve adapted them so far, but i still find it strange to see them criticising although i understand as it is the Malfoy's and Draco's old self. However, i really am enjoying this fic. Couple of spelling and grammer mistakes in random places but can be sorted. Like my fics. Keep going im looking foward to the rest of it :) -A xx

Chapter: 7 I liked the story line. Some spelling mistakes though. I'm eagerly awaiting for the next chapters.

Chapter: 18

Really enjoying it

I'm glad you updated and I hope the end isn't soon

Chapter: 20 So happy you updated! can't wait for more!

I am your bestest fan ever ! I enjoy this story and when I get my computer back I will log on and post using my actual user which is (I'm not telling you her/his name). I love your YouTube ! It's cool that you actually have a YouTube account called Slytherin Forever ! :)

So my story can't be as bad as you say it is if I'm getting reviews like that can it? Can't say anything nice don't saying anything at all I'll only take consecutive criticism and you're basically saying my story is a load of shit. Well **** (I actually typed the stars so I technically haven't broken any rules) you.
