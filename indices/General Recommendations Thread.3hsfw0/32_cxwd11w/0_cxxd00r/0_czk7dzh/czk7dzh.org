Only just read that post today. I think the plot interesting. Their are now 20 chapters to the story, if you want to it try again. I know that I'm not the best at spelling or grammar but I plan to fix all that when the story is finished or at least halfway through. I don't want to be writing the last few chapters and having to think about the first ones.

The first chapter is meant to set the plot, the main character and cause curiosity for the rest of the story. Which is solved in the last chapter. I mean what were your first impression when you read the first chapter of Harry Potter for the first time. I personally dislike the books (I've only read the first two and attempted the other 5) but I love the films. Please read again. Please Reply MD XX
