Some general advice:

First, this is a recommendation thread. If you want to promote your own work, make another thread with [promotion] or [feedback] at the beginning of the title.

Second, don't spam. Don't repost the same content several times in a row. Once should be enough.

In case there might be a misunderstanding, I'm not trying to mini-mod or anything. Rather, I'm trying to help you out :P

Now, as for the actual feedback: I'll be honest with you, since I found that brute honesty is the best sort of feedback that'll help your writing. I tried reading your story, but I couldn't get past chapter one. There were various mistakes in your technical writing (grammar, sentence structure, character voice, etc) and the plot wasn't interesting. What I would recommend is that you go through your story again and edit it. Also, it would probably help you if you get a beta to give you more feedback in grammar, plot, etc.

I'm not trying to make you feel bad or discourage you from writing. When I started my first story, I probably was worse when it came to plot, technical writing, character voice, etc. What I would advise you is to keep on practicing, and you'll get better as time goes on. Also, have someone help you and give you advice on writing.
