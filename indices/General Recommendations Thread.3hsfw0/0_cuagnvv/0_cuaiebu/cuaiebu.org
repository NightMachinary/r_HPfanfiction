Ectomancer is also my favourite. I only read it recently and have to say that it's a sterling example of top notch action and fight scene writing. My theory is that the author had these great ideas for battle scenarios like the troll fight and the fake dumble fight at the start but didn't have the entire plot thought out and so he/she abandoned it.

If you're interested, I'm working on a fic in a similar action vein that takes place during Albus Potter's 7th year.
