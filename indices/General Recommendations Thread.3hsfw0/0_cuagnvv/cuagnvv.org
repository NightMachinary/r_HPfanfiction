My full "best HP fics" document is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?usp=sharing][here]], and my "best HP smut document" is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-w-bt80EWqTHL8VdrANYU1QStEVBh87ahPiIqLHC41c/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. To pick out the absolute best:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging_the_Sword][*Forging the Sword*]]

::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.

/Truly great fic, all about the characterisation of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Believable growth, fantastic exploration of magic. Only problem is its slow updates!/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][*On the Way to Greatness*]]

As per the Hat's decision, Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin upon his arrival in Hogwarts---and suddenly, the future isn't what it used to be.

/Best Slytherin Harry AU in the fandom, hands down./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][*Ectomancer*]]

Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

/My favourite fic in the fandom. Great adventure elements, with a badass Harry who is nonetheless in-canon, as the fic really plays to his strengths of thinking under pressure, improvisation and practical learning./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*]]

The locals in a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills are surprised to discover that they have new neighbours. Who are the strangers at Drakeshaugh?

/Wonderful post-Hogwarts fic in which we get to see a very middle-class Harry and Ginny from an outsider's perspective. The is obviously very well acquainted with the life of the young parent and it really shows./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][*What You Leave Behind*]]

The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

/The best new fanfic of the last couple of years, this fic follows a talented Harry in an AU world, taking him through his 7 years at Hogwarts at a good pace. The first year is a good old fashioned mystery, so to say more would be to spoil it. Highly recommended. Great characterisation, dialogue, magical theory, setting and mystery./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][*A Long Journey Home*]]

In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

/A fem!Harry story with great characterisation, humour, and a superb exploration of wizarding history via time travel./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived][*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived*]]

Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

/Possibly the most popular fic in the fandom, this shows an AU genius Harry at Durmstrang. It manages to avoid all the pitfalls of the “Other BWL” genre, avoiding bashing. But the real draw of this fic is the depiction of the development of a magical heavyweight, and the Durmstrang worldbuilding. N.B. Chapters 12-16 of this story can only be found on DarkLordPotter.Net./

Top Smut:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][*Whatever Happened to Bromance?*]]

Cormac McLaggen explains a few simple truths to Harry, with profound consequences. Harry/Romilda. Smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][*It Could Only Happen to Harry*]]

After defeating Voldemort in his final year, Harry requires a rare ritual to save his life. Luckily, he has friends who are willing to help him. H/Hr, H/Parv, H/Luna, H/Tonks, H/Fleur. Canon personalities. WARNING: comic smut. Not for younger audiences.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10100723/1/Parkinson-s-Knickers-Or-Lack-Thereof][*Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)*]]

Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4884595/1/Tease][*Tease*]]

After Quidditch practice, Harry receives some unexpected attention. 5th Year AU! PWP SMUT/MYSTERY. NON-CONSENT! FEMME---DOM!
