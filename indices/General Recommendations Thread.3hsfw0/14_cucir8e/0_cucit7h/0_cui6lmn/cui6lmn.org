Junior Inquisitor should come with massive warnings for bashing, cliches and manipulative and evil/incompetent Dumbledore/Order. Like, it mentions it, but nowhere near enough - that is the story, basically. Harry loses his horcrux after a healer takes it out, Harry's being drugged endlessly, and so on.

I think it's the worst story I've ever read, though I've had the privilege of coming late enough into the fandom that I can skip most of the duds.
