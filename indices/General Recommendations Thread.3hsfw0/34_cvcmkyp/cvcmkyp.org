  AU, first in the main Dangerverse series, now complete. Lone wolf. Dream-seer. Bright child. Scarred child. Singer. Prisoner. Dancer child. Dragon child. Eight semi-ordinary people. One extraordinary family, and how they became one. Pre-Hogwarts story. Pre-Hogwarts, the sequels cover all of Harry's Hogwarts years. A lot of foreshadowing, nothing is what it seems. If you're going to read everything it will be a looooong read, but definitely worth it! Living with Danger itself, excluding all the sequels, one-shots and AU's (yes, AU's within an AU!), has a higher word count than any of the Harry Potter books with the exception of OotP. The main stories are all completed.
