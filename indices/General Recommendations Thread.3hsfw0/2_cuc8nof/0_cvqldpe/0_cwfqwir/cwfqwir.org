Its a crossover with Dr Who. There's an episode called "blink" which introduces creatures called angels.

Id really recommended watching the episode. It 100% works without any knowledge of the Dr Who series (its the only dr who episode ive ever seen) and its won a bunch of awards and stuff. Though the fic was pretty similar in tone to the episode, so if you didnt enjoy the fic then your milage on "blink" may vary
