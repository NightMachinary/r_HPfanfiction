Hoo, boy.

I'm aiming for this list to be complementary rather than to supplant, so I've scraped my less-mentioned folder for really good reads. Only two of these have been mentioned so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][Reign of the Serpent]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]

#+begin_quote
  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused. Funny and utterly non-serious, but ultimately sort of sweet too.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth][The Wizard From Earth]]

#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future. This is great. Mystery, worldbuilding, and enough of an AU that it doesn't feel anything like canon. /Warning! */Abandoned***
#+end_quote

[[http://copperbadge.fanficauthors.net/The_Uncle/The_Uncle/][The Uncle]] Wherein Remus Lupin is a crime lord. Short and kind of dubious quality-wise (not exactly high-class literature, and I'm not sure it actually merits being on this list), but amusing enough to overlook it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time. Extreme Time Travel AU. But the writing and the imaginative departures from HP canon are phenomenal. The author went on write professionally, and it shows. Atlantis, mysterious dark magic, Fleur Delacour, and stereotypical mysterious persecution combine to produce a wild time-travel romp that definitely won't make sense until you're halfway through. Highly recommended. Complete, has a sequel.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6663972/1/][Secret Steps]]

#+begin_quote
  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS. AU where the wizarding world is separated from the Muggle one by a magical Wall.
#+end_quote

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8073][Coming Back Late]]

#+begin_quote
  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late? In which Harry comes back late to his body at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. Has a depth of politics and layered build-up of the government and the wizarding world around it that I haven't seen anywhere else. H/Hr One of the first fics I read, and still one of my favorites. Has Evil!Ginny, which you might not like.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581693/1/][Yule Time]]

#+begin_quote
  Augustus Rookwood, former Unspeakable, escapes capture at the Battle of Hogwarts. He develops a new form of time travel, which falls into the wrong hands and seals the fate of trillions of souls. Then, something remarkable happens. A rather different take on time travel. At once horrifying and heartwarming.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/][Just A Random Tuesday]]

#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is. /The toils and travails of Professor McGonagall under Umbridge's reign. Well-written, biting, and rollickingly funny./
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10714425/1/Messing-With-Time][Messing With Time]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange. Harry goes to bed and wakes up in the past ... age five. Lots and lots of humor. More fleshing out and better use of future knowledge than almost any 'serious' fics of this genre. Good writing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3280711/1/][Time Will Tell]] Time travel murder plot. Draco Malfoy must prevent Hermione Granger's murder. Might not be everyone's cup of tea.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/][Quo Vadis]]

#+begin_quote
  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way. Horror story with Lord Voldemort as the hero.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]]

#+begin_quote
  PART I: Days before his 6th year, Harry Potter is sucked into another universe by forces not of this world. Dazed and confused, Harry finds himself in a world where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer Harry Potter is sucked into an alternate reality where he is a Death Eater. Mediocre writing, great story. The characters, magic, and world are well built-up.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]]

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour. Dimension Travel AU. Harry and Hermione from a much darker version of Deathly Hallows travel to another world. Phenomenal.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4590039/1/][Future Imperfect]]

#+begin_quote
  One Shot. AU. A world in which Voldemort wins. And honestly wishes he hadn't. Time travel. Lord Voldemort regrets.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2368294/1/If-Only-Redux][If Only]] What could have been, if only Dumbledore had listened.

*Crossovers:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] (Harry Potter / D&D)

#+begin_quote
  Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry. Updates Fridays.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/][That Which Holds The Image]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldemort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

If you're willing to read other fandoms:

*Sherlock:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6914974/1/Alone-On-the-Water][Alone on the Water]]

#+begin_quote
  Sherlock is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Warning: angst like whoa. Sherlock has a terminal illness. Heart-rending. There's a reason this is the most-reviewed piece in the category.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6228163/1/][A Facade Faded]]

#+begin_quote
  Alternate Ending to last episode. You know that person who we thought for a split second might be Moriarty? Well, he is. You know that moment at the pool in Episode 3?
#+end_quote

Just devastating. Great emotion. The characterization of Sherlock is ... iffy, but the story is great and the description of emotional state is superb.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7968683/2/The-Secret-Identity-of-John-Watson][The Secret Identity of John Watson]]

#+begin_quote
  Taken out of context, John Watson leads a terrifying life. You have to wonder what those poor women he dates thinks of it, especially if John decides to try keeping one away from Sherlock, and Sherlock decides that it'd be best if he could get rid of her Rollickingly funny. Solid writing.
#+end_quote

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/334557/chapters/540728][The World on His Wrist]]]

#+begin_quote
  First, he is shot in Afghanistan. Second, he wakes to a phone call in Chelmsford, Essex. Third is pain, fourth is normalcy, fifth is agony and sixth is confusion. By the eighth, he's lost track. (John-centric AU) John Watson suffers a strange accident.
#+end_quote

*Doctor Who:*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/471497][Time v3.0]]

Probably the greatest piece of fanfiction I have ever read. Heart-rending and inspiring, awful and magnificent at once. The author reaches for the heavens and tries to tell the tale of the Time War--and succeeds. This is, honestly, the best piece of fan work I have ever read. /No/ complaints, and I complain about everything.
