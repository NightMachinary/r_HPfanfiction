Excellent battle scenes. Quite strongly AU.

*Halo:*

Very hard to find good writing for.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4305125/1/The-Enemy-of-My-Enemy][The Enemy of My Enemy]] Excellent war story. Tons of detail, the atmosphere is right on and the battle scenes are superbly written.

Game of Thrones:

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...

Stannis turns left.

AKA an AU where Stannis Baratheon stayed in King's Landing and became the man he could've been. ** /Abandoned/ ** (but fantastic)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8858961/1/][Time Lords and Terror]] (Doctor Who / Equestria)

#+begin_quote
  After witnessing a series of strange events Twilight Sparkle and friends search for answers, only to find themselves entangled in a war between two ancient races and a plot that could end all existence. Luckily, our heroes find help in the form of an eccentric brown pony with an impossible blue box. As another reviewer said, this is"Ten-but-a-pony," which is probably why it's so appealing. Feels and reads like an episode of Doctor Who.

*Extras*

Those that don't quite rise to the standards above, but which are still "good" reads.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4165301/1/][Time, Mr. Potter?]]

#+begin_quote
  Five years after Voldemort's victory over the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter is a man on the run. But what happens when he is thrown into his twelve-year old body in a freak accident? Non-DH compliant. Complete. My personal favorite of the "Harry travels back in time" genre. Has excellent battle scenes.
