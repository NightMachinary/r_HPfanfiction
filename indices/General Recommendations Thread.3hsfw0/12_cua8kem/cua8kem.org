0800-Rent-A-Hero - Significantly better than it's title.

Alternate dimension, Girl-Who-Lived but basically cannon. Divergence is when Voldemort fails to get the prophecy in OotP he abducts Trelawney and then releases it to the public. With the wizarding world trying to conscript Iris the Order uses a ritual to summon Harry. He is not happy.
