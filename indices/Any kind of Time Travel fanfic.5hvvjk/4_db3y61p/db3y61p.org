Harry, Luna and Hermione go back in time to defeat Voldemort. Lots of cliches, but quite fun.

Hermione designs a time-travel device as a school project and asks Harry to help her. Quite unique time travel mechanics... probably the least derivative time travel fic ever. Abandoned/Unfinished though.

Harry goes back in time after dying at Voldemort's hands. Some potion cliches, but quite well written overall.

By Rorschachs Blot... so it's full of crack and hilarious. Not to be taken seriously at all.

What would an actual War Veteran Harry do, who saw too many people die, when he gets the chance to change things? This is a story of a ruthless Harry (but not dark), who understands that in a War you have to kill your enemies... and is not afraid to get his hands dirty. Focuses a lot on his relationships in the changed time-line, especially to Hermione.

I saved this for last, because I never see this recommended... a short, but sweet (also a little sad) time travel tale of Hermione going back to the Marauder's Era. It's not very long, so I'm going to stop here in order to not spoil things.
