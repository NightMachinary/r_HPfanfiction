Plus quite frankly an "easy out" for Hermione would be "Professor McGonagall I was in an empty classroom practicing the Oppugno charm when Ron burst in and startled me and I lost control of it". Since you never saw the teachers in canon asking for memories to determine what happened in previous disagreements between students it's doubtful that would happen here.

So I can't see Hermione getting in trouble for that at all.
