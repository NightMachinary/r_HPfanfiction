Of course, who wants to bash Hermione always finds a stick (hint: she is sixteen, we all did stupid things when we were sixteen, if we should be expelled for each of them, half of the human population would have unfinished education).

Despite my persuasion above, there is a story (which I cannot locate now) with heavy Hermione bashing, where everybody makes super-big fuss about the scene with Ron. Perhaps linkao3(Golden Bullets by CescaLR)?
