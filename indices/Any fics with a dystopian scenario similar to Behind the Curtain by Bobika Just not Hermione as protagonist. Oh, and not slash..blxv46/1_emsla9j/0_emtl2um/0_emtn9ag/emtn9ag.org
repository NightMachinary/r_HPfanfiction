I thought about it a bit since, and there are a few fics with similar tones, like the post-apocalyptic setting and the rebellion keeping going long after Voldemort won. Some of these are pretty well-known, so you may have read them, some are a bit older.

Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is /the/ classic Voldemort won fic, sadly dead but incredibly long and intricate. It's the closest you'll get to Beyond the Curtain, really.

Linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is kind of like an inverse of Beyond the Curtain.

The Star Wars crossover linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) was somewhat similar, but Harry and the remaining wizards are fighting back against a slightly different Emperor.

Probably next closest is linkffn(Worthy of Magic), where you get to see both before, cause, and post apocalypse. This one ain't Voldie's fault, though.

Oh, and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) is a time loop story that's also miraculously completed, has a sequel, and that's completed, too.

Linkffn(The World I Leave Behind) was worse for Harry, but not as catastrophic for the rest of the world.

I remember a fic based on the concept of Hermione chasing after Ron when he stormed out during the Horcrux Hunt. They couldn't return to Harry, and many years later, their daughter (Rose, maybe?) runs into Harry, still searching in the aftermath of Voldemort's victory. I had a line here about being unable to find it but aha, my Google-fu is too strong. linkffn(8418356)

linkffn(Circular Reasoning) started off in a post-apocalyptic environment, but it doesn't stay there the whole time. Dead but good.

Uh, what else. Linkffn(Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigmata) is a completed zombie fic which I guess feels pretty similar even if the plot is a bit different.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse) kind of one ups Voldemort by making Harry literally an incarnation of Death, the Pale Rider, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Surprisingly un-apocalyptic. Ironically, the fic is dead.
