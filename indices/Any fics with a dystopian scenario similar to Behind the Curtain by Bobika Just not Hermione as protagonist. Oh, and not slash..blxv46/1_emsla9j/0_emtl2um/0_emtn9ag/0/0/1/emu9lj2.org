Yeah, everything you said about Emperor turned me off even more. Though this Tyrant may seem interesting.

But yeah, Wastelands just doesn't do it for me, Idk what about Harry in particular I don't like, but he's just isn't relatable to me.

I've tried reading other things from Darth Marss, but really couldn't enjoy. Dunno what about that, but just wasn't my cup of tea.

Prince seems more interesting, I also love, well arcane shit and impressive magic. Or even different concepts from pre-determined things. Like a Horcrux that embodies a type of emotion that Voldermot purged from his soul. You can get into really interesting and esoteric things, because, lets say Voldemort "purged" his "adventurous curiosity" which is a abstract notion in itself, combined with the corruption of others in close proximity of a Horcrux, you could have a scenario where people will do reckless things without considering anything, and you could make the protection of the thing as a series of impossible obsctacles that the person will simply "want" to try because of the influence of the Horcrux.

Stuff like that is why I love fanfics, and if you splash romance on it, it becomes quickly my favourite fic.
