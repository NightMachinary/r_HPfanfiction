Betrayal. linkffn(9095016). Yep, I read that one too. There are a lot of "Hermione accidentally/intentionally goes with Ron" fics, it's one of the only good points of divergence in the seventh book and a good chance to insert someone else into Harry's life.

Darth Marrs writes interesting fanfics. It isn't always to people's tastes, but there's thought behind it and the fics aren't stuck to the stations of canon. Revenge of the Wizard is interesting because it slams the wizarding world's magic directly against the technology of Star Wars and the power of the Force, and both sides have to make adaptations to continue pursuing the other. There are ups and downs and I personally enjoyed that fic.

Emperor... It reads less like a standard fic, and closer to a narrative retelling of historical events. There's complex political movements, battles and campaigns adding up to strategies within a war, and generally just a lot of maneuvering. It's not one person fighting heroically through a series of problems. In that respect, it's an interesting fic. I wasn't super into it, honestly, but brought it up just because it kind of matches the theme. If you're on the fence about it, you might actually want to first read linkffn(5324704) Tyrant. It was the stated direct inspiration of Emperor, and was in turn inspired by the history of Rome under Caesar, but applied to the Wizarding World under Sirius Black after his defeat of Voldemort.

Wastelands didn't rely on the loop mechanic too often except as setup to how things are now, both an excuse for Harry's knowledge and skills and a motivation to keep going instead of letting things play out. A lot of time loop stories get bogged down at the beginning, instead of skipping ahead to the end, because why have a time loop and then not actually show it, right? But Wastelands moves forward and has a concrete and finite plot. I liked it. But it was a bit of a whirlwind, all sorts of things being brought up with little context, the readers dragged along by a character who already knows many details of the plot.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom starts out with a /very/ AU world and doesn't do a lot to acclimatize the reader. I enjoyed going through and seeing familiar elements in totally new situations, though, and the way that the different circumstances change how they act. I'm also a sucker for fics that have magic as something really magical and deep and powerful, though, not something that can be easily substituted with technology, and this delivered on that many times over.

Incorruptible's politics bogged down the entire thing, yep. I wasn't there to read about Harry getting yelled at for his decisions, I wanted to see him killing zombies. Riders isn't that great a fic, I only recommended it because it has commonalities. I didn't even make it to where it stalled.
