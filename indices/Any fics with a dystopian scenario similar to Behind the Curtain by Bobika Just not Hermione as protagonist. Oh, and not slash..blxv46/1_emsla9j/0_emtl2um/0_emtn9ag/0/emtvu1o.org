I loved that fic with Rose, and to expand on that idea on a fic where Hermione left together with Ron, there's that fic where Harry becomes sorta like a ghost story and keeps up the fight by himself, and eventually kidnaps Daphne as a request by her friend, Zabini. I think it was Betrayed or something.It won some award too.

I loved Worthy of Magic and his endgame scenario was such a twist for me that I felt completely in awe of it. Weirdly enough, I suggested it yesterday to someone.

I don't usually enjoy SW at all, so Idk. I've tried reading some but never got me. Same with GoT. Too Hype-y to my tastes.

I don't know why, but I've never read Emperor, and I think it must be one of the most recommended fics here on this sub. I don't know if its the summary or what, but I always stay clear of it, mostly because of expectations. What would you say about it to convince me to read it? Considering the amount of good people here on the sub that suggests good fics, it can't be all that bad, so IDK.

Circular Reasoning was meh, same as Wastelands. I didn't like Harry's personality and the whole groundhog-day scnario from Wastelands (didn't read it all, stopped after 5 or 6 chapters.) And Circular, Idk, it was too weird and convoluted to me. Just wasn't my thing.

Same thing for Prince of Dark Kingdom as Emperor. Dunno, never appealed to me.

Never read The World I leave behind, but it seems interesting.

My issue with Incorruptible is that, yeah, the whole dystopian scenario is great, and the worldbuilding is impressive. But there's SOOOO much politics that it boggles my mind why there was a need for it. Yes, its plot relevant, but its so annoying. I couldn't stomach, sorry.

I disliked the premise of Riders, and even though I tried reading it, it felt way too forced for 11yo talk the way they did and it turned me off.

I'm picky, I know, but what can I do, I like what I like and hate what I hate. Though I do change my mind on somethings. I once disliked the Idea of Grow Young with Me and then I actually read it and it simply became my favourite fic all time. I love it soo damn much that I asked Mallory if I could translate it to my native, which she said yes, bless her.

But thank you for the suggestions, I'll take a look at that one where Voldie kidnaps Harry.
