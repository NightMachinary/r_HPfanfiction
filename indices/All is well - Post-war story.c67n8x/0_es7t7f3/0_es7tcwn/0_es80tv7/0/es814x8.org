The thing about it is my story is canon-compliant, which doesn't leave much room for going off-limits in terms of standout elements. My greatest strength is creativity in creating diverse atmosphere and conveying feelings and emotions more deeply than most, while also highlighting the key ups and downs of Harry's life as a hero and its ramifications. To answer your proposition, the “problem” here would be that to see the real distinction, you have to actually read the story for yourself, because those are usually not elements you outline in your description.
