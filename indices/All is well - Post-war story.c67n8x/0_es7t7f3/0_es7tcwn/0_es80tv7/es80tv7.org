So like the reason people like to read things that have original elements in them is because the originality makes them stand out. If a story did something really differently from the rest of the fan fiction written about it, I would probably be more inclined to read it than a spectacularly well written story with a less than impressive premise. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of good post-war stories out there, and what you might need is something in the summary that will set yours apart.
