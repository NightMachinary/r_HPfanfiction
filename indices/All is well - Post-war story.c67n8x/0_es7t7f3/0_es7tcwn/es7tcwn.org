Great question! Of course, I wrote it so I'm a little biased, but I personally think I captured the essence of the characters somewhat consistently and in-character. The story itself is, admittedly, nothing outrageously original and sophisticated, but I believe the plot points and the tearjerking scenes, along with what I hope is somewhat good pacing, will pull this story's weight
