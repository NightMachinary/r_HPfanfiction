Not necessarily, it depends on their use, duration and effects. Slughorn openly states that Amortentia is incredibly dangerous in HBP, and doesn't play it up as something harmless or desirable. Also, I can't remember when or where it's said that Mrs. Weasley used a love potion. I would happily count myself as a Mrs. Weasley fan (I like all the Weasleys).

The point I raised with OPs proposal is that I just don't see James Potter doing anything like that to the person he is very much in love with, and dispute the suggestion that it is plausible according to canon.
