You picked a good analogy; well argued.

Just for the sake of conjecture though, I could see a bunch of young witches bringing Amortentia as a party game at sleepovers. Not to feed to anyone, but instead in a similar application as a ouija board: smell the potion and determine something prophetic about your 'true love'.
