Remember also that it's only Amortentia that has been classified a dangerous potion; there are many weaker, similar imitation potions, such as the ones sold in Fred and George's joke shop. It's never specified which potion Mrs Weasley brewed, and given that she did it as a young girl its likely that it was a simplified version of an imitation love potion. Still not ideal, but not as bad. Also, i agree with the previous commenter in their suggestion of the use of these potions. Its like a love calculator site. On that vein, imagine a divination equivalent.
