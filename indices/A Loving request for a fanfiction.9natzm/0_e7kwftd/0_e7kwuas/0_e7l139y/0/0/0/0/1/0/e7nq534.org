Thanks for the correction. I misread that section to be Slughorn saying they would learn how to brew Amortentia before their NEWTS, but he actually said they should be capable of brewing it /after/ their NEWTS.

So all in all it's a wash. We don't know under what circumstances she brewed the potion, and we don't know that it was ever used.
