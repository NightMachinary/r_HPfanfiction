As much as it pains me to point that out, the magical world does not see love potions as rape drugs but merely some harmless fun. Best example for that would be Molly Weasley, who has many fans around here despite admitting the use of them at least once (we don't know on whom). And Romilda Vane faced no criminal charges either.

Therefore James wouldn't disqualify as headboy if he used them.

Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with OP's hypothesis, but I see where they are coming from.
