I don't think this is possible. If Lily suddenly fell in love with James, there would have been a similar scene as with Harry and Ron in HBP when Ron eats the love potion spiked chocolates. Everybody (which includes Lily's other friends) are aware of James's crush on Lily and it is not that difficult to understand that James might have given Lily a love potion. If it would have been that simple, Severus (the 'oh so great' potions genius would definitely have given it to her).

Lily is a muggleborn ==> Anne Frank

Snape is a blood purist ==> Nazi

The problem with Snape is -

1. Had Voldemort decided to go after Neville or had he not known about the prophecy, Snape would have still been a death eater. James would still have been in the Order of the Phoenix. The contrast is quite clear, isn't it?

2. Let us compare a bully in our modern life versus a mass murdering terrorist. You are sure you would support your friend if he/she decided to marry the terrorist or would you support him/her if he/she fell in love with that bully and decided to marry him knowing that the bully has changed his/her ways.

3. Snape did not 'love' Lily. He was obsessed with her. He had the same patronus as Lily, not its complement.

4. For those who hate James, we have seen one specific scene through the eyes of a person who hated him. Of course, it is going to be biased. Maybe Snape even planted the specific memory there so that Harry would come to doubt his father, hmm?

If you would remove that bias and view what James has actually done, you would appreciate him more - became an 'illegal' animagus to keep his ill friend company at great personal risk, took Sirius in when he ran away from his abusive home, became apart of the Order of the Phoenix even though he could have stayed away from the conflict as he was a pureblood and could have married some other pureblood witch instead of Lily.

Whereas Snape - appreciated the dark arts and called what his friends (Mulciber, Avery) done as fun, called his (best?) friend an extremely derogatory insult in front of the entire school when she had personally defended him and their friendship from her other friends, joined a terrorist organisation which was against the best friend whom he reportedly claimed to have loved and constantly abused Hermione, Neville and other children (Neville - constantly called him names, tried to kill his frog, Hermione - when the (enlarging?) spell hit her teeth - "I see no difference"). He probably might have killed many mudbloods in Voldemort's service happily going about his duty.

To conclude and for emphasis, had Voldemort decided that the prophecy was about Neville, Snape would still have been a death eater.
