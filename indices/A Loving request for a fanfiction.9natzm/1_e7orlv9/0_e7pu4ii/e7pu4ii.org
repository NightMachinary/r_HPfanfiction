Snape was a very prideful man and despised people who were given things they didn't deserve. He would see using a love potion as a dishonourable thing and would never do it.

Snape isn't evil. He isn't good. He is all gray. Neither good nor bad. The triple agent who deceived both Dumbledore and Voldemort for himself.

1. Snape was a death eater because he had no real option otherwise. He enjoyed the dark arts and was very talented in them. He was a talented Slytherin who fell into the wrong crowd. In a world where everyone wants to kill you, he was all but forced to become a death eather simply because everyone believed him to be. When all his friends are doing something with the only muggles he ever knew, his father, being abusive to him, it would be very odd for a teenager not to join the wrong crowd. You are forgetting that Voldemort wasn't openly evil at first. He was just a rising figure that seemed like a paragon of the dark arts. Imagine following an Angel, being greatly impressed and indepted to him, and then the angel suddenly revealing to be an angel of death.

2. Snape has never been confirmed to have killed anyone. In fact, it was (deductively) *confirmed Snape never killed anyone* due to his soul not having been split as murder does in the HP universe. Excluding assisted suicide via Dumbledore.

3. People in love are usually obsessed as well. Would you argue that Tonks didn't love Lupin because she had a wolf patronus? No, you wouldn't because the patronus is your protector or a representation of a person very dear to you. We cannot know for sure why Snape's representation chose a Doe, but it could be because that was what represented her entire being which Snape witnessed.

4. We also haven't heard anything about him from someone who wasn't also extremely biased in favor of him. You are arguing that you like bias A more than bias B, so this bias A must be true. As for the planted memory, Snape was very upset and angry that he saw that memory. Snape would have had no way of preparing him to see said memory anyways. Also, didn't someone admit that said memory happened later? I'm not sure.

Snape called what his friends had done as "fun" because they were schoolboys who likely only made someone trip as a prank. Do you honestly believe that schoolchildren were going around murdering people and calling it "fun"?

I DON'T EVEN BLOODLY LIKE SNAPE. I just recognize that you are going out of your way to bash a character in a post that has little to nothing to do with him. All of your points reek of a strong biased viewpoint particularly in the way you take things out of context to the extreme in order to paint them in a poor light. Did Hitler's kindergarten teacher praise his murdering of millions of people when she called him "talented" or by telling him to go have "fun"? No, because she had no way of knowing what attrocities he would someday commit.

If you reply to this, I'm just going to block you without reading the reply. I see no reason to hear you rant and hijack a thread about a possible fanfiction idea that mentioned Snape offhand. You sound very much like a pureblood going on a rant about muggleborns when they have no idea what they're talking about AND the muggleborn reference was inside a history lesson on an offhand note about character.
