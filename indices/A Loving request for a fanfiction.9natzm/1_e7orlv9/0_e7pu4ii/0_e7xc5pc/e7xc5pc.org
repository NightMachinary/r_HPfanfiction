Addressing your second point - perhaps I missed this part of cannon, probably because JKR put it on Pottermore years after writing the books, but to my knowledge killing someone doesn't split one's soul. Rather, one has to kill someone in order to split their soul (I'm under the impression that the magical backlash of ending a life is the only force strong enough to split a soul, but that's just speculation on my part).

Supporting this:

1. As you said, Snape killed Dumbledore and his soul did not split.
2. In GoF, Barty Crouch Jr as Mad-Eye Moody kills a spider in a demonstration of the Killing curse. Not a human life, which might be the difference, but we did not receive any indication that the act split Crouch's soul
3. Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback, amongst other Death Eaters, have high body counts, especially in innocent lives in Fenrir's case. We receive no indication that these characters have had their souls split.
4. Voldemort himself: he has killed countless people, including James and Lily Potter, the old man he kills in the seventh (?) book, and several followers who displease him. However, he only has seven Horcruxes, seven splits of the soul.
5. Molly Weasley killed at least one person, Bellatrix (i say at least because we don't know her role in the first wizarding war. Given her nature and her obvious duelling abilities, I am certain she had an active role, but again we cannot know). We received no indication that this split her soul.

This leads me to conclude that it is not the act of killing that splits the soul, but rather the utilization of the magical backlash of ending a life. Perhaps what you mean to say is that the act of killing leaves a scar on soul? Of course, if dearest JKR has taken the time to contradict herself on this matter as well, please feel free to correct me.

So, second point (presumably) invalid.

Also, what prideful person decides that bullying children is an acceptable pastime? Actually, why would someone abhor love potions but then continue to take out a grudge he has against a dead man on children? Snape is far too childish to have such a rigid moral objection to love potions.
