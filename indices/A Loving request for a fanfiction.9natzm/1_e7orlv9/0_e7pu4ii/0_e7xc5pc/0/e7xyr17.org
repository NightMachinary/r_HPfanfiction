When Dumbledore and Snape are talking about Harry being a Horcrux, Dumbledore says he doesn't want Draco to kill anyone because it would damage his soul. Snape replies in a way that implies his soul would be damaged and that it has not yet been so. It's definitely not the most concrete of answers, but it's pretty substantial. I may have said it was Harry they were talking about, sorry.

  “If you don't mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?” “That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.” “And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”
