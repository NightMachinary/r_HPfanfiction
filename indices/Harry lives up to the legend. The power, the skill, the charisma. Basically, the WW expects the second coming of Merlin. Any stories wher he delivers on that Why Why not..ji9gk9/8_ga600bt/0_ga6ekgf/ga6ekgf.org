I make it a habit to steer clear of robst stories. It's always the same old boring formula. On a first read through, it's fun enough I guess, but it gets real old real fast. His fics are what early fanfic reader me enjoyed. I prefer more meat on my bones these days with the occasional OP self-indulgent fics, and those I prefer Naruto, or Worm.
