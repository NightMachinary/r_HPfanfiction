I like this: James and Sirius being Aurors, I believe that neither one had jobs. (If I remember correctly, nothing was ever mentioned them as Aurors)

I like this idea, but I believe that they were not: Alice and Frank being in the Marauders year.

I personally don't like this, but understand why people do it: Emma and Dan Granger. Those aren't Hermione's parents names, they normally aren't important characters in stories, but more often then not, if a story has mention of them, that's what their first name is, and it's because of Hermione and Harry's actress and actor being named Emma and Daniel, but still.
