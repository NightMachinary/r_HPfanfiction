-Emma and Dan Granger

I've seen this a lot too. But I'm kind meh about it. If anything I'd like to propose Emma Watson's actual parents' names Jacqueline and Chris (I'm not sure if it's short for anything). Especially because Jacqueline hints at a possible French connection and gives us an excuse for Hermione holidaying in France.
