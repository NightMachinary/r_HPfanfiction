I'm not sure she needs an excuse to be in France. France is just a bog-standard holiday destination for the UK; even if you're not holidaying in France you've probably crossed the channel crossing* to travel to other places.

If it did mean anything, I would assume 'Harry misses out on routine family holiday destination.' Excepting those in poverty, I don't know anyone who hasn't been to France.
