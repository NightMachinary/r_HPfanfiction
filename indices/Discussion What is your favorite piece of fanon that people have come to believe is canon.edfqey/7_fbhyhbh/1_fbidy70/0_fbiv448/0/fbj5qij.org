People use "Tempus" for time travel? I've never heard of that. Even so, I'm definitely anti-both of those.

I'm a fan of neither Cursed Child's super Time Turner nor the typical fanon send-adult-mind-back-to-the-past potion, but I'd take both of those in a heartbeat over a "Tempus" time travel spell that is presumably a base form new-timeline-creating time travel method to contrast with canon's self-consistent regular Time Turners. This level of power and precision to time travel like this shouldn't be given to a mere spell. It should be given to either a potion, which canonically allow wixes to achieve effects commensurate to much higher level spells, or a specialized device.

My main gripe with "Tempus" as a time-telling spell is that it deals with arbitrary, manmade units. No canon spell does this. Even protections spells are cast on objects or locations, not arbitrary and predetermined areas.
