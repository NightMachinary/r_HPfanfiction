I have a fan au that actually covers that answer and it's stupid simple. Divination magic is any magic that refers to gathering, understanding, or processing information.

Xylomancy is divining with stick, aka dowsing, this is canon. Medical diagnostic charm is an information spell, hence divination.

Divination to me is not some mystical inner eye stuff mostly. I would say the majority of it is analysis spells and similar.

Picture a Quant company getting hold of magic and learning about spellcrafting. The resulting spells would likely be similar to extremely refined market analysis programs.
