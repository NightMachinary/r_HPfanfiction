It tells you the time without having to carry anything extra. Like a watch. Magicals are lazy.

They only give the watches when they come of age because of tradition. You know magicals, they have to keep up with tradition. Like riding an archaic steam train to hogwarts UNSUPERVISED all the time. Instead of using the faster magical transportation options available. It's probably cheaper too.
