Yeah that makes no sense. Snape's a weird half-blood & Lucius is Lucius.

If I was going to write a godfather for Draco, I would probably choose Mr. Greengrass (Daphne & Astoria's father) or Rodolphus Lestrange. The first because it would set up Astoria x Draco pretty well and the second because I've never actually seen him get time in a fic, especially after Bellatrix x Voldemort became canon, and it makes sense for a brother-in-law to be a godfather.

And no one ever mentions Draco having a god/mother/. Just because Lily was a loner and James had no female friends doesn't mean the Malfoys were the same way.
