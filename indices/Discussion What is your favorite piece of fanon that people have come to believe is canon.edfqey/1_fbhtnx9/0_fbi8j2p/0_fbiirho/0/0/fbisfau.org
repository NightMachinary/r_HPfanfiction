  "And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. ..."

I mean, it's not a lot to go on. Basically just Malfoy being happy when Snape was sorted into his house, which everyone does. And that's in his sixth year, so they probably didn't spend much time together.

I agree with how you characterise their relationship, but that would come after the First War. And I doubt it would be enough to name Snape as godfather, even if the timing was right.
