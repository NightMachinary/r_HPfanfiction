  There's no reason Lucius would think so highly of him

He is shown sort of taking Snape under his wing while they both attend Hogwarts and Lucius is a prefect, as revealed via Snape's memories in the Pensieve in DH. But I agree that they wouldn't necessarily be friends.

If anything, it would be closer to a Mafia-style relationship where Lucius would consider himself Snape's mentor and benefactor and would expect favors (e.g., good grades for Draco) in return.
