Them being quiet or more thoughtful is never mentioned in the epilogue itself and Albus has the most lines in it out of all the kids so he's not exactly quiet. He's introduced in the middle of a fight with James where he's screaming even. There's nothing stating either are more like a certain parent other than Ron claiming Rose has Hermione's brains. I have the epilogue in front of me rn.
