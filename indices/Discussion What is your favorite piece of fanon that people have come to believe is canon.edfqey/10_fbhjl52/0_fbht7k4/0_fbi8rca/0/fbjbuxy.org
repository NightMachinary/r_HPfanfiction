James being like James (or at least similar to Fred and George) is somewhat canon though. So too for that matter is Rose being an even worse Hermione (implied in Deathly Hallows and used in Cursed Child).

It's an interesting story usage when they are /trying/ to be like their relatives in my opinion. And then dealing with the depressing reality of not quite matching up/they are in fact different people with their own differing personalities. In one of my personal favourite next-gen stories Rose has spent her whole life trying to match up to Hermione and not quite making it (lower scores), and dealing with her forging her own path. In fact, all of the next-gen characters dealt with their parents legacy in it.
