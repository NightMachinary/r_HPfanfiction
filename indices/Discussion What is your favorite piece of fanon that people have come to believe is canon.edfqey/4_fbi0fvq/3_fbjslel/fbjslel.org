I, too, love this piece of fanon. I literally don't give a damn what JK has to say on the subject. I am a believer in "Death of the Author" in this particular case. (Also in most other cases).

I know others have said that Hermione casts basic wards in Deathly Hallows. I say yes *temporary* wards. I would love the foundation of more permanent enchantments and wards to be runes. Otherwise the study of a dead language seems out of place in a curriculum that seems to be otherwise eminently practical.
