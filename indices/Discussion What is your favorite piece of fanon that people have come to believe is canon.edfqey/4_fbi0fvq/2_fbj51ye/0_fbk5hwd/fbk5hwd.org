Completely agree on Arithmancy, especially calling it JKs headcanon. She has stated that she was intentionally vague about it in the books and that she didn't know what it was at all. The idea that it might be a form of divination came later, probably at the promoting of someone that knows the historical meaning of the word. As such, within the realm of Harry Potter the historical meaning doesnt have any relevance to me, both because it was clearly written without it, and because it isnt as interesting or internally cohesive.

With Runes I think the well established fanon still has strength. Yes Hermione cast defensive wards around the campsites, but the part of fanon that really works with regards to wards is their use as "anchors" something that makes those spells stronger, sturdier and more lasting. Also, Ancient Runes in this fanon totally works as an elective in my opinion. Runes as the basis for enchanting would be like a magical shop class, teaching kids to make things. I would imagine that warding would be a seventh year or mastery level application of the subject. Building walls instead of cutting boards.
