No need to say that all enchanting and warding require runes. I personally like them for a couple of reasons, one being permanence. Not mentioned in Canon as being a thing, and in a couple of places actually disproved, but as fanon I like to believe that most charms and, depending on the fic, spells in general, are temporary. Anchoring a spell to enchant a toy in a rune sewn on the back gives it permanence. Similarly, going back to the shops class idea, just because you can make a container to hold something out of wood (runes) doesnt mean you can't also make a bowl to do the same thing out of clay (transfiguration or something) different ways to do the same thing. I like to imagine that Runic magic is heavily centered on the relationship of things and symbolism. A protego charm is a charm that makes a shield, but a runic array that shields a home is based on the individual meanings of each rune, their meaning together, and what or if they spell, given that they are a system of writing after all. All shaped and powered by the intent of the witch or wizard.

The other reason is to avoid Anglo/Eurocentric views of magic. Ollivander and family have been making wands since like 300 ad or something, and the name could be seen as Greek. (I fanon an Olive wood wand for Ollivander). Assuming the wand and incantation method of magic to be a Greco-Roman invention would explain its adoption throughout Europe and America. It would make sense for other cultures to have their own methods of magic that may have been lost during Roman conquest. As such, Runic magic could have been the magic system used by Germanic tribes prior to the Roman conquest. After the conquest it becomes deemphasized in magic studies in Roman conquered areas, though maintaining relevance in Scandinavian areas that didn't fall to Rome and adopt the wand.
