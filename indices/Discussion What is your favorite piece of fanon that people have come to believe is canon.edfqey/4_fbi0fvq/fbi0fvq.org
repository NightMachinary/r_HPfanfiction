Ancient Runes is the study of magical runes used for wards and enchanting. Arithmancy is the study of the magical properties of numbers and the foundations of magical theory.

Both are far better than a useless foreign language class that's really just a foreign, dead, alphabet class and a math class that vaguely has something to do with predicting the future with numbers.

Also, I reject the fact of Arithmancy having anything to do with numeric divination as later stated by Rowling to be canon. If it had anything to do with divination then Hermione's rants about actual Divination would have certainly included references as to how Arithmancy is a far superior method of divining the future rather than calling all of divination a wash.
