I tried making it conditional as well. Then the idea of using that to create a perpetual motion machine broke my idea.

The only way I could see to make runes magic and not easily broken it to make them harder to use, less effective and only have a limited charge to them compared to spells. We know spells can be made permanent somehow from enchantment.

For me it came down to either they are so convoluted and restricted they served no purpose or they could be used as game breakers. So I just have cut them entirely.
