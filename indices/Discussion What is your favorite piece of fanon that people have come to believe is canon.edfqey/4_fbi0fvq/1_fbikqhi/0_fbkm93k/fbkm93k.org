Yeah, I was trying to write a Rune Prodigy!Harry fic and I had to try to work around the sheer opness of it. I went with changing the activation process of runes. Instead of wands like in the usual fanon, you have to like, load them up first, which can take a while, and then they activate as a reaction to a pre-determined action.

Now, I think this makes them more balanced because it's much more convoluted, which can explain why almost no one will be using them. But it also can be convoluted in a writing sense, so I'm not sure if I should discard the story tbh. But I think it might be neat to have like a mad genius Harry planting what are pretty much magical bombs everywhere.
