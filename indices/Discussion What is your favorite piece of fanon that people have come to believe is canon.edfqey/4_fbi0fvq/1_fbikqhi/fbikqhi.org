Oh God yes, Ancient Runes are entirely fan built stuff. It just studying old dead languages and nothing else. Runes in fan theory are the most broken thing ever.

Every book that uses runes I check how the rules for them apply. Then try and break the universe as hard as possible. Usually it's not hard at all. Just finished writing a fic where I played with their godlike power without Harry realizing how OP they are.

There is a reason my Fan Au file has runes as a language class. Runes break everything, like a dnd wishing candle.
