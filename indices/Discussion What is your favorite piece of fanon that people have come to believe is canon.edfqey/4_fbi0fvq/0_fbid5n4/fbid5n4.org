irl, arithmancy has referred to divination using numerology for centuries. Just like with necromancy (originally just divination w/ dead spirits/people) and other "-mancy" terms, the meaning's been flanderized beyond recognition. Hermione does rant about how Arithmancy can do much the same as Divination but better.
