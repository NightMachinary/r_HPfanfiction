I personally find life more enjoyable when surrendering to the constant shift in language. Give it 15 more years of use in fantasy and -mancy will have another entry in dictionaries listing its modern use to refer to a type of magic. I also just checked and the only time Hermione actually compares Divination and Arithmancy she only says that their first Divination lesson was rubbish compared to her first Arithmancy lesson.
