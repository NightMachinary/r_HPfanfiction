That's kind of a bs argument given that you also made a value judgement between the original and newer meaning, but seemingly without knowing the historical context. Accepting that language changes doesn't mean I can't like some language shifts and dislike others. "-mancy" as it pertains to these terms is derived from the Greek "manteia" meaning "divination." I don't mind if someone uses a newer, fanon version of Arithmancy. (I could easily see the field of og arithmancy expand over centuries into the fanon arithmancy. That'd be a really cool bit of worldbuilding, of the kind fanfiction writers don't use very often.) I took exception to your "reject[ion]" because the evidence you used to support that view was false and because I like the original version of arithmancy and I wanted to make a case for more people using it more.

Yes, that's the quote. Remember, Arithmancy as numerological divination is canon, as you noted yourself. Thus, in that quote, Hermione is directly comparing the merits of two divination classes, Vector's Arithmancy and and Trelawney's Divination.
