Apparently Hermione Jean Granger was in the 7th book, but I don't remember myself. I can't see anything on Pottermore matching up to that.

Charlus and Dorea Black have to be my biggest pet peeves, especially as I've seen a few authors acknowledge that it's not correct but fancied it anyway as a magic solution for their plot.
