I think making Harry loosely related to the Blacks via Charlus and Dorea is just better tbh. It explains why Sirius got close to James in the first place much more credibly.

It's also important for fanfics because it keeps fics set in that era much more compact by reducing the number of 'OC lite' characters that have to be introduced in terms of the families of the Blacks and Potters during the Marauders era. It not only gives you an excuse for James and Sirius to know each other before Hogwarts, but gives a Black family relative to Sirius other than his parents without adding another OC
