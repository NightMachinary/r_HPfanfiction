Hermione *Jean* Granger.

Dan and Emma Granger.

I don't know what stories those names originated from, but they stuck around for a long time (even now).

--------------

Charlus Potter and Dorea Black being Harry's grandparents.

It was a pretty solid fanon inference from the Black Family Tree, but it ended up being Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, instead. Still widely used in stories, though.
