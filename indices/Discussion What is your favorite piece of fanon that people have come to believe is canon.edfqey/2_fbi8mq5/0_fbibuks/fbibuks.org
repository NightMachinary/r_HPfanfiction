But, we never know how long it takes to become an auror (via the books, not via wikipedia or something). I'm gonna try to finesse some math without doing much research here.

Lupin was 12/13 years older than Tonks. We just barely missed seeing Tonks while Harry was in first year, so she is 7 years older. That means in PS she is 18. Let's say she immediately does auror training after Hogwarts (like the military or college). Tonks and Lupin meet in OOTP when she is roughly 22 and already an auror. That means the process is 4 years or less. If Alice and Frank are the same age as the maruaders and have Neville at the same time, they would have been 21 when they died meaning that the auror program is either 3 years long (or less), or that you are correct and they are older (a year or more older).
