I think this bit of Fanon is part of the whole '4 eras' structure most fanfics use:

1. Grindelwald war era/Tom Riddle at Hogwarts ( normally with Minerva McGonagall at the same time in Fanon)
2. Marauders Era into the First Voldemort war - James, Lily, Sirius, Snape (plus the fanon of the Longbottoms etc)
3. The Harry Potter/2nd war Era where the Canon is set
4. The children era where the epilogue is set
