I just meant that it is possible, that taking Tonk's as an example only works if the circumstances are the same. Depending on curriculum and leadership there may have also been a different program and thus a different training period. It may have been shorter in a time where the job requirements were more combat focused that detective work as in the war criminals present themselves to be caught. Thus new recruits might have rushed through or skipped certain skills that might have usually taught. I was not saying that there definitely was a shorter program, just that it is a possibility. It may also have been a shorter program if there was less to teach in general- standards change over time.
