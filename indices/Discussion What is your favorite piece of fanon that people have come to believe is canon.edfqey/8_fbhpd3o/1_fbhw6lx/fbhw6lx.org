  The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Potter_family][Potter family]] was excluded from the list because it is also a common Muggle surname, and that [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Henry_Potter][Henry Potter]] also took an outspoken pro-Muggle view during his time in the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizengamot][Wizengamot]].[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Twenty-Eight#cite_note-1][[2]]] This is despite [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dorea_Black][Dorea Black]] marrying [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Charlus_Potter][Charlus Potter]], and not being disowned, which would almost certainly indicate that the family had no known [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Non-magic_people][Muggle]] ancestors or relatives. Also, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/James_Potter_I][James Potter]] is consistently mentioned as being a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pure-blood][pure-blood]]. One possible theory indicates that the author of the Directory considered the Potters and other "pure-blood" families (such as the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_family][Princes]], the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Crabbe_family][Crabbes]], or the Goyles) to have some amount of Muggle ancestry.

Also, the Sacred 28 were the 28 families still considered to be Pure Blood back then by the author of the Pureblood Directory. That doesn't mean much about lordships or anything.

  The directory seems to have certain levels of bias and information inaccuracy, as the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Potter_family][Potter family]] was excluded due to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Henry_Potter][Henry Potter]]'s outspoken pro-Muggle ideals and possible Muggle origins of their name[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pure-Blood_Directory#cite_note-1][[2]]], and the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ollivander_family][Ollivander family]] was included despite [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Garrick_Ollivander%27s_mother][Garrick Ollivander's mother]], a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle-born][Muggle-born]], was married into the family at the time of the directory's publishing.[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pure-Blood_Directory#cite_note-2][[3]]]
