That was one person pointed out over hundreds of years. I wouldn't be surprised if there were lots of other people that created/invented stuff too. Add in businesses and investments? Then you add in the Wizengamot stuff. That last part screams high society.

Toss in the fact that the potters have been around since the 1200's? Gringotts opened in the 1474. I find it hard to believe that the Potter vault is 687. I see it being anywhere from double digits to 200 at the highest. 687 sounds like it does in fanon: a trust vault. Because seriously, who would drop a fortune on an 11 year old orphan?
