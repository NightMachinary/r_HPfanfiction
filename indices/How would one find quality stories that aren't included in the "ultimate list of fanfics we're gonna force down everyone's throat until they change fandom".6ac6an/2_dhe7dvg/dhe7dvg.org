Looking at other reviewers'/authors' favorite lists is a good start, but they tend to be full of all the popular fics.

To find hidden gems, I filter the wordcount (100k+ and complete narrows the "lolzmyfirstfic" writers down to the serious writers). Then I sort by reviews, but instead of starting my search from page 1 (the fics have thousands of reviews), I go to pages 30+. This gets me to fics that have around 1000 reviews--not the most well known, but well-liked enough that they have hidden gem potential. When you get to page 50, you get to fics with reviews fewer than a 1000, and I've found a lot of hidden gems there.
