I found that checking the favorites of authors I like is a good way to discover more stories. Although with the authors who have huge lists of favorites, it's not too helpful.

For reddit, asking for particular plots - "Good stories centered on Neville", "Good Slytherin!Harry stories" etc. - is a good way to hear about less popular stories, since that way you can exclude a lot of the most popular stories you already know.
