Keywords, fellow reddit lurker. Playing around with synonyms and tags would help. Like crossovers or indy/independent /insert preferred character here/ on ff.net comb through the communites. The filter option is too broad, and sometimes they filter out one shots or short stories.

Try author names as well. If you know an amazing author most likely they have other stories/favs that are amazing too.
