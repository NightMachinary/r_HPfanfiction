Best Ginny I ever read was 'The Hogshead' by MyGinevra (on ff.net or siye) It is actually the first story I read when I found fanfiction, and my authorname is an homage to the one who started me on my path.

I am actually a Harmonian (only took me one decent Harry/Hermione story to realize it), but I love me a good Ginny.
