Thats far and away my favorite fic ever. In second is Taking Control. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11709]] It's a powerful independent Harry fic with a great romance with Ginny. But theres a lot of Ron, Hermionie, and Dumbledore bashing. This takes places after OoTP and is complete but the sequel is not. In third is The Refiner's Fire [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=8104]] This author has the most fully fleshed out universe and story of Harry's life that I've found on the internet. It is complete with a sequel and tons of short stories to fill in the post hogwarts years. All of these recommendations combined probably near 1.7 million words. While these authors have great ideas and plots their writing is not as great as After the End so be prepared. Still both well worth a read. Oh also The Refiner's Fire is all cannon pairings and post OoTP
