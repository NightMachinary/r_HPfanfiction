I read mostly romance centered, not as much action and adventure, but I might have a few suggestions for you. I like well written, sometimes darker stuff with strong characters, so I would suggest giving any of these stories a shot based of the fact that they are just /good/ stories.

This is a very beautifully written story. It basically resolves around Ginny losing her magic for some unknown reason and her POVs are parallel to Harry's.

Here is probably my absolute favorite Harry/Ginny fic. Definitely my favorite Ginny characterization. It is from Harry's POV, but I would still suggest reading it.

Okay... I couldn't resist suggesting this one. This is not a Ginny-centric fic, but she is a main character and very likable. It is the most original, funniest fic I have ever read and more people should read it.
