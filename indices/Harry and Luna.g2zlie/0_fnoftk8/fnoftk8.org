Protection from Nargles ( linkffn(7352166) ) is probably my favourite straight Harry/Luna romance fic, it's adorable and features one of the best takes on Luna Lovegood I've ever seen in fanfiction. It's a shame the sequel is abandoned, but what's there is really good.

Accidental Animagus ( linkao3(14078862) ) isn't a romance-fic as such, but it is a very well-written AU fic - Harry turns into a cat-animagus via accidental magic in a bid to run away from the Dursleys, ends up getting adopted by the Grangers. The Harry/Luna aspect shows up during and after Year 4.
