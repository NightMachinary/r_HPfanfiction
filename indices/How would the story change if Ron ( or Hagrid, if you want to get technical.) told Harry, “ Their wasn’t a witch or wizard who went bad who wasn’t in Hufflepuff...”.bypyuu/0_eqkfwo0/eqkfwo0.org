I'm not sure it would /actually/ change very much --- unless this is a whole AU, one imagines Harry would be disabused of this notion pretty quickly and distrust Slytherin anyway, because Malfoy, because Voldemort, and because they generally /look/ evil and untrustworthy.

But, of course, for a humor fic, you could certainly wring something fun out of that premise; say, Harry, primed to think that Hufflepuffs are untrustworthy, fixates on the notion that some random First-Year Hufflepuff is secretly possessed by the shade of the Dark Lord, or something.

(I'd write this, except I kinda already used both of these ideas, in different forms; ironic humor of Harry & Co. coming to completely the wrong conclusions as to what's going on with Voldemort in First-Year on the one hand; evil Hufflepuffs on the other, though in this case, the Hufflepuff /was/ actually evil. So if I tried to write it in my style, I fear it would feel rather stale. If someone else wants to try, though, I'd sure like to read it!...)
