So i dont think it would change much unless this also implies that Voldemort was in Hufflepuff too. So in that case instead of Voldemort highlight the negative side of slytherins it would be the negative side of Hufflepuff's.

Hufflepuff qualities are hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play so harder to make a villain that has these qualities instead of Slytherin ones. But most assholes in life don't set out to be assholes. So maybe the sense of fair play combined with lack of understanding on a matter but drive to act and follow through is what Voldemort would be. But I don't think the issue would be killing muggleborns. Maybe a way to handle them thats cruel without meaning to be.
