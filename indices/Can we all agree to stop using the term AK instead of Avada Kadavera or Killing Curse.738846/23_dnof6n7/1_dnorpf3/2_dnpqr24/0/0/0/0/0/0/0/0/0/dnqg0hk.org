Adding two curse words to a sentence is not going off track, which is what I meant. I wasn't talking about anyone going insane. Despite me using the wrong phrase, you /clearly/ should have known what I meant. Do people often say that as a way of saying off track? No, but hey, if we're going by your way, it's alright, isn't it? So:

Why don't you learn to read better and understand what I mean before making assumptions on the way I wrote something? Thanks mate.
