  Irrelevant. I didn't argue that characters said DADA themselves. Quite the opposite.

But every other acronym used by JK does.

If I'd meant writing, I would have written writing. I meant we as in we, when we are speaking out loud ourselves, and we as in when we're putting words in the characters mouths to be spoken.

Honestly, this is all pretty clear, unless you're intentionally misunderstanding to try and create unnecessary conflict.
