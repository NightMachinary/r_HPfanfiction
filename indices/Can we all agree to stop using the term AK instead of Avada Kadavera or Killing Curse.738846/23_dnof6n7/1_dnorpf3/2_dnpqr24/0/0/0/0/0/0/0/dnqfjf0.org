  You made no statement either way. Just said it was cannon.

No. I said that in dialogue, there isn't any DADA stuff, but there's at least one example in the narration itself. So yes, it's irrelevant to bring up the "pronouncing" bit as my original comment was already made by that point.

  But every other acronym used by JK does.

Who cares? She uses DADA in Half Blood Prince. It's narration, sure, but it's there. As I didn't say it happens in dialogue, this whole fucking point is stupid.

  If I'd meant writing, I would have written writing. I meant we as in we, when we are speaking out loud ourselves, and we as in when we're putting words in the characters mouths to be spoken.

What the fuck are you even talking about? Nobody says "we" when they mean character dialogue. That's absurd. If anybody is trying to create unnecessary conflict, it's you.

I made my point already. You didn't specify narration or dialogue. I pointed out it happens in narration, but not in dialogue. You're just going off track at this point. Bye.
