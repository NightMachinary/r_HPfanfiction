  What does that have to do with the class?
#+end_quote

D.A.D.A. stands for Defense Against the Dark Arts. It isn't meant as dada/daddy... It's just an acronym. Not every acronym has a meaning like that.

  Also, my first comment said "talking"
#+end_quote

You said "can *we* also stop talking about DADA teachers?"

We're not the characters, so it obviously doesn't imply you're talking about dialogue.

#+begin_quote
  And my second comment was about "pronouncing".
#+end_quote

Irrelevant. I didn't argue that characters said DADA themselves. Quite the opposite.

  I feel like you could maybe spend a couple more seconds reading what I actually wrote.

I feel like you should pay attention to your own written comments before being a condescending ass.
