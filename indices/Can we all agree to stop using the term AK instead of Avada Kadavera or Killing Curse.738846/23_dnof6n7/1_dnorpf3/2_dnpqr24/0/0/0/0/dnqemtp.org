The word dada is often a nickname for someone's father, similar to "daddy". What does that have to do with the class? At least her other acronyms, owl, newt, and so-on, are words related to the magical world.

Also, my first comment said "talking". And my second comment was about "pronouncing". I feel like you could maybe spend a couple more seconds reading what I actually wrote.
