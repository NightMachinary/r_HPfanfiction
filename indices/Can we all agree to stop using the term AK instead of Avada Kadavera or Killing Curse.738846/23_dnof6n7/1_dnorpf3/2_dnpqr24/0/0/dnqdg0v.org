As far as I recall, it only shows up in characters writing (letters, timetables, etc). As a written shorthand, I'm fine with it. But it's not something a character would ever say, and I strongly doubt JK would ever write it in narration. Consider her other acronyms (O.W.L, N.E.W.T, and so on) that all have some clever meaning. Would she really create a meaningless acronym with a meaning that has nothing to do with the class, and just sounds like baby babble for "daddy"? She's not that careless.
