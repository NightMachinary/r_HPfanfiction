Can I just say how much it bothers me to read a story where a comma isn't used with a name every time in speech? Like you get this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Jerry, treat that curse..."
#+end_quote

but completely miss these two:

#+begin_quote
  "what the hell are you talking about Jerry "\\
  "Avada Kedavra Harry"
#+end_quote

which should be:

#+begin_quote
  "What the hell are you talking about, Jerry?"\\
  "Avada Kedavra, Harry."
#+end_quote
