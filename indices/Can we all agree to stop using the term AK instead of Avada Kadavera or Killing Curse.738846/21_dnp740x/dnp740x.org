Abbreviating something that could kill you is really annoying to read, just as annoying as someone misspelling a name wrong or getting facts wrong in their story.

Now if it wasn't in a story I'd be fine with it, but if it's in fanfiction, and unless the story is suppose to be a parody I'd feel annoyed by it personally.

However upon saying that, saying something like Defence instead of Defence against the Dark Arts is more acceptable in my opinion.
