Well, how big his trauma is form losing his parents to the killing curse, when he was an infant, is debatable and depends on many circumstances and well teenagers can be irreverent.

Still personally i agree it's pretty poor style for the author to use AK in anything other than a tactical situation where the characters need to communicate something quickly. In the latter circumstance it actually would make less sense to use the long version.

There is also the fact that in the wizarding world people seem to take names very seriously, so a spell deemed as unforgivable should be given some gravitas
