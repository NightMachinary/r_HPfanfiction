Most uses of AK are in battle scenes when there are killing curses flying around constantly, although considering that repeating words constantly is pretty poor style, this should be avoided. If the killing curse is used scarcely there really is no reason to abbreviate it.

So i am assuming that writers who would not pass their english exam essay with max points use it to spare time and effort.

Of course there is also fact, that realistically speaking a lot of people use abbreviations in everyday life so the characters using AK makes sense. Especially for aurors, cause militaristic communication especially loves to keep it short and simple.

It depends on the context too. In casual conversation and in tactical situations AK would be somewhat reasonable and realistic, in official and academic situations not at all.
