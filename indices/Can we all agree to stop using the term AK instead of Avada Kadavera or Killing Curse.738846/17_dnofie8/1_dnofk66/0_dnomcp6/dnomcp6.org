Spell check doesn't even recognise nonsense words (which kedavra certainly is for an English spell checker. Kadavera is a nonsense word too.

I honestly agree that misspelled words are more annoying than shorthand. Shorthand I will read as of it was written out, fanfics that use McGongal, Lilly Potter, avada Kadavera etc just jar me, because that's not the right word to use. If you write fanfiction, respect Jkrs writing and use her stuff correctly.
