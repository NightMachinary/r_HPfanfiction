but isnt DADA the official (even used in the Book) short version of the class? Im fine with it, but maybe my first thought would be a Baby calling for his parents. Using the whole length name is cruel, DADA is nice and short. Defense is actually good, but it can be confusing, if the context doesnt fit. And you really cant use "lets go to dark arts" :D Of course "lets go to Professor Xyz (class)" is also a solution, but this requires the Reader to know, who the actual Teacher is (if the fic isnt Canon)
