It makes me want to stop reading when someone writes that into their fic. That and making fun of voldemorts name, i get it you think his name sounds dumb so lets call him moldy shorts or something childish...but you do realize this is the wizarding worlds equivilent of hitler/the anti-christ right? No one in their right mind not even harry would make fun of his name that way. The most insulting thing that i could picture anyone who doesnt fear voldemort doing with his name is calling him Tom.
