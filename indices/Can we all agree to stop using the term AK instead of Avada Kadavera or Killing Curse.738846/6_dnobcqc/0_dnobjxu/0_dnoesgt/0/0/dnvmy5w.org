TOP DEFINITION

GröFaZ

Nick amusingly given to Adolf Hitler by certain of his commanders out of earshot.

Taken, with every degree of irony, from 'Größter Feldherr aller Zeiten' - Greatest War Leader of All Time.

/In demanding the reduction of the Kursk salient without providing for a reserve while we were still reeling from Kharkov, GröFaZ totally fucked us over. - Manstein: Lost Victories/

It's pronounced a bit like "gruer-fatz." Gruer is one syllable. Make your mouth like a giraffe's.
