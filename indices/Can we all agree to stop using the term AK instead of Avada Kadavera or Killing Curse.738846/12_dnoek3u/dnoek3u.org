It really bothers me too. It feels very out of place in every fic I've read that has done it. To me I think it's because Avada Kedavra doesn't read as a noun. 'An Avada Kedavra' doesn't sound right, so 'an AK' doesn't sounds right either, in addition to feeling out of place. I feel like if it is going to be used as a noun, that 'a killing curse' sounds much better.
