Hm. I don't think it should be used in a /story/ (not in the narration, anyway; I could see wizard-raised Aurors coming with it as oral shorthand and the muggle-raised among them quietly snickering whenever Moody or somebody uses it, refusing to explain why), but I don't have a problem with it on this sub itself.
