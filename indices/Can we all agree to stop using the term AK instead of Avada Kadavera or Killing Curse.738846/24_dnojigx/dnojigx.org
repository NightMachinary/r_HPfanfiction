WHY YOU WANT ACRONYM FOR AVADA KEDAVRA? IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH AS KILLING CURSE? YOU THINK NEEDS IMPROVEMENT? THEN MAYBE YOU FIND JOB WITH BLOOMSBURY! YOU HAVE DRINKS WITH J.K. ROWLING, TRADE STORY OF MANY NOVELS WRITTEN AND CURSES DESIGNED AND DETAILS OF BAD LATIN NAMES!

OR MAYBE YOU NOT DO THIS. YOU LOOK AT SIMPLE, FINE DESCRIPTION LIKE KILLING CURSE AND THINK IT NEED A COOL ACRONYM. YOU HAVE DISEASE OF AMERICAN CAPITALIST, CHANGING THING THAT IS FINE FOR NO REASON EXCEPT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM COMRADE ROWLING.

KILLING CURSE IS FINE. YOU FUCK IT, AND WRITE AK, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU MEAN AND YOU TRIVIALIZE DEATH. COPY IT, AND PASTE WHENEVER YOU NEED, AND YOU NOT NEED TO WRITE DUMB SHIT LIKE AK.
