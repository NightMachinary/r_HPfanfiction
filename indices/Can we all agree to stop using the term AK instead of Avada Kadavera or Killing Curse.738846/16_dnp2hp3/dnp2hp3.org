It doesn't bother me. I think it perfectly reasonable that the incantation is not spoken, given that, you know, it's the incantation to a spell that is associated with near certain death. Imagine going about your business and suddenly the words catch your ear. Especially those who'd lived through a war. I feel it's far more respectful to avoid saying it.

I also feel the unforgivables should be taboo'd, so there's that.
