Personally, I'd rather see a character using the abbreviation AK than anyone using the nickname 'Voldie/Voldy/etc.' in a fic. Talk about the quickest way to not only make me cringe but hamper my enjoyment of a fic.

As for AK, depending on the circumstances, I honestly don't mind it much. It's an easy shorthand that I could see some in the Ministry and/or Aurors using both on inter-department paperwork (i.e. cause of death: AK) or conversation between one another. Do I think they would use it in an official report that was to be made public or in a speech? Not likely; just as you wouldn't want to use slang in a professional setting in real life, they likely wouldn't want to do that either.

Do I think school-aged Harry or his classmates would use it? I doubt it unless it was introduced by someone else first. For example, I could easily imagine Tonks (in her capacity as an Auror) using it in a casual conversation during an Order meeting only for it to be overheard by Fred and George and then /them/ parroting it in front of Harry, Hermione, Ron, etc.

No matter how mature a child/teen likes to think they are, they'll still parrot things that they think makes them sound more mature than they actually are and, like a virus, it spreads.

That said, even if that were to happen, I doubt they would say it every single time (unless they were a really small child who did it for the attention).

As for using it in a subreddit?: Really doesn't bother me in the least. It's a shorthand that makes for easier posting for some.
