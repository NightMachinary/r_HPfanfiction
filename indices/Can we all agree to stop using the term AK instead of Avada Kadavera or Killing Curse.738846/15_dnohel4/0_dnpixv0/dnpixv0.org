There was one story that used "Voldewhore" in the narrative. A lot.

  It was on October 31st, 2004, that Harry finally succeeded. He had won the Final War. The mighty task of killing the monstrosity known as Lord Voldemort, oops, make that Voldewhore, was complete.

  Lord Voldewhore immediately retrieved and re-hid his remaining horcruxes -- Hufflepuff's Cup and Ravenclaw's Diadem -- behind fidelius charms. In typical Voldewhore fashion, he left taunting messages and traps in place of the former horcruxes.
