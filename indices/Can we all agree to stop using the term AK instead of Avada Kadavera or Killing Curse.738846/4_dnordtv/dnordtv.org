"You see Chairman of Dark, if you use glorious Awtomat Kalaschnikowa of pure stalinium you can fire 600 curses of death to dirty blood enemy."

- Comrade Antonin Dolohov

No, but seriously. I hate abbreviations in general. Just write the word out. I'm not reading a technical manual, I'm reading a novel. Abbreviations tend to destroy the flow of a sentence. Which isn't a problem if its just necessary reading. Military Field Guides are practically 50% shortened words and concepts. But in a piece of literature you may want to hold of on it.
