Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

You've probably read this one. The killing curse on Halloween 1981 blinds Harry but he gains a form of mage sight that allows him to see magic and souls. An unprecedented ability, it paves the way for a truly OP!Harry by the end of the story. Features Good!Dursleys and Harry/Hermione.

Linkffn(Growing and Standing by Crazy Mishka)

Harry befriends a deaf Hermione (and Neville and Luna) during his fourth year and it changes how he looks at life and magic.
