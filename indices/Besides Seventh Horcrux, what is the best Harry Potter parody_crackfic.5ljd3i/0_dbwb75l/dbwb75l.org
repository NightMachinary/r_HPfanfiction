Some one-shots:

- linkffn(Lessons With Hagrid): "Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord."
- linkffn(How Moody Got His Eye): "The real story of how Moody got his magical eye."
- linkffn(Ninety-Nine Trope Subversions And A Deckchair Party): "Harry Potter and friends kick back and relax at the First Annual Post-Voldemort Party And Jamboree."
- linkffn(Two Weeks in the Alley): "13 years old, a vault full of gold, and two unsupervised weeks in Diagon Alley---what's a boy to do?"

linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do) also has elements of parody and sometimes outright crack (chapter 5).
