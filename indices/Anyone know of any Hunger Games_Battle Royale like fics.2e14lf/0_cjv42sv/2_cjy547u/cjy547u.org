Just finished this story. It bothers me. Maybe I haven't read BR in so long that I'm glossing over the differences, but aside from the primary divergence, this is /exactly/ like Battle Royale as I remember it. Might as well have just taken the text from that and replaced the names. Personalities, injuries, deaths, locations, weapons are all the same. I know you're not the author, but seriously: what was the point of writing this at all? Ugh.
