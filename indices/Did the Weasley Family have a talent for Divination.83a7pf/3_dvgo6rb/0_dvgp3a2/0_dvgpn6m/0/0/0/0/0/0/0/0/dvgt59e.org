Sorry, I guess I didn't see the bottom where you asked for additional thoughts. :)

I'm not sure that divination could really help Ron with chess. There's a nearly infinite number of possible states in a Chess game. "Playing x moves ahead" just means anticipating your and your enemies reactions on shifting variables. Divination would provide those routes, perhaps, but that's functionally identical to just imagining them yourself, anyways.
