Okay... such as? Those are the major methods shown in the books, except for dream interpretation.

But no matter, really, because no one could call "a vague conversation which happens to be relevant at some point in the future" as divination. You could loosely relate that to prophecy, but people don't remember their prophecies, after. It's called coincidence. Or, because it's a book, foreshadowing.
