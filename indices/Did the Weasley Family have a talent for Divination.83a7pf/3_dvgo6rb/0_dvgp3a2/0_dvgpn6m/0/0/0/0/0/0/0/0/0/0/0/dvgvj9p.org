always in motion is the future.

which is why i say that Distance into the future is one of the two main parts that measure difficulty.

the other is possible Possible outcomes so at the start of a chess game the person playing White has 20 possible first moves 16 pawn moves and 4 knight moves which is a lot more than the 3 possible outcomes from a coin toss.

meaning the difficulty of predicting what moves your opponent in chess is going to make is a hell of a lot harder. and with the further you do into the future the more possible out comes there are with each harder than the last to predict with 100% accuracy than the last.

then say if the person is using divination for gambling on a football game and they only want know which team will win for there bet then there is only 2 possible answers less than 2 hours into the future.

or gambling in a game of blackjack trying to predict which card is going to come next with 100% accuracy gets easier the longer the game goes on because that amount of possible cards it could be only goes down.
