That's... fine?

I don't mind that you think differently than me. We all have different headcanons and the books can be quite open to interpretation. I wouldn't mind reading a story where the Weasley Family have a high ratio of divination-inclined members.

... but you posted a yes-or-no thread specifically to ask the question that I answered...

And that answer is "No". The Weasley family did NOT have any extraordinary talents for divination. Not canonically, at least.
