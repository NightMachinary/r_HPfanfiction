/Shrug words still have definitions in fiction too. I'm not trying to be argumentative, I just like the OP's original thought and it seemed to fit well in the framework of the story. So I pointed to an example of in-story confirmed (via Dumbledore) prophecy occurring in ways that were similar to what the OP suggested. There is obviously a difference (Trewlney never remember either) but I assume the fact that prophecy was never covered in any of the in-story divination classes, and there are multiple years of class-room content that there are multiple ways to divine the future all of them falling under the banner of Divination.

/edit added word to clarify
