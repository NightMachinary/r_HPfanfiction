I see Divination in two parts when if comes to predicting the future first is the amount of Possible outcomes and how far into the future you are trying to look.

so predicting a coin toss which only has three possible outcomes and is seconds into the future is probably one of the most simple divination exercises. bit its also about getting its right 100% of the time.

for predicting the chess game sure Ron would start out predicting 3 moves a head but as he gets better he would eventual be able to Predict every move his opponent would make between the start and end of the game with 100% accuracy
