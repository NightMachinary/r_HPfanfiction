How is foreshadowing the same thing as divination?

Divination is about reading tea leaves, looking into crystal balls and making prophecies (which you /don't remember, afterwards/).

Why would vaguely saying something that you could maybe kind of attribute to some future event but only after the event has occurred, anyway be even remotely similar to divination?
