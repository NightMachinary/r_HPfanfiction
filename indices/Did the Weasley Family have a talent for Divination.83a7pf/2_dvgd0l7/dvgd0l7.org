I think in a story like Harry Potter, there's a fine line between foreshadowing and divination.

There's no reason why you /couldn't/ make the have latent (or not so latent) divination talents, but I don't think there's anything that you can point to and say "Yes, they have this talent."

Especially considering how ill-defined divination is in the books. The only thing we know is real, actual divination magic is the crazy prophesy stuff. But at the same time, there's a lot of the trappings of historical and cultural divination lore, like tea leaves and crystal balls.

You could argue that those things obviously must work in the HP Universe otherwise they wouldn't be taught in school. But you could also argue that nobody took Trelawney seriously as a diviner, so obviously those things /don't/ work.
