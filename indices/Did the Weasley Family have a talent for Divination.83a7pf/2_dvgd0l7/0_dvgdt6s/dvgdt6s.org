I like the idea that there is a Conspiracy to discredit Divination by either the ministry or the People who are actually good at divination.

The reason i say that the people who can actually do divination might be in on it is that if people actually thought it worked they would put restrictions on it but if divination is thought of as a joke. No one is going to look twice at the Wizard that goes into the muggle world ever weekend to watch the races or other muggle sports.(although the wizard doing that would probably have to be good at disguise magic so the muggle don't get suspicions over the person that winning all the time)
