I read it more as Bagman being complete such that he would win the bet

then gain if i were the Weasly twins I have sold Bagmans Debt to the Goblins after all they would probably be willing to buy it if the twins were will to accept Half what they should have gotten(which is better than what they got, because didn't Bagman take there money they used to make the bet so they never got back there original money)
