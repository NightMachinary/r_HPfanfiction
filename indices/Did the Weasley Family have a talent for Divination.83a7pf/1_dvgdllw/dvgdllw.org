It's interesting that you ask that because back in the day, like between OOTP and HBP, "Seer Ron" was a very popular fan theory. There were also those that were convinced that DD was a time-traveling Ron, especially when it came out that in his youth, DD had red hair. There was one super great story--I can't remember the title, but it was by LavenderBrown--that had Ron come out of the Department of Mysteries fight with Seer abilities.
