*After School*

- I'm a big fan of Harry-with-kids plots as well as Harry-the-Auror plots, but I've never seen one that combines the general fluffiness I love in them with Voldemort as a threat. I mean, /Cursed Child/ had Voldemort's daughter as a threat, but the story was crap. The closest to what I'm thinking is linkffn(12121323), where it's not Voldemort that's the threat, but the setup of Harry teaching DADA while his kids are at school was a lot of what I thought was neat. The adults keep trying to deal with the threats, but the kids end up getting involved anyway, just like in canon, only this time the adults are the original heroes.
- With Voldemort coming back later, a lot of the people who died in canon will probably still be alive when he does return. (e.g. Sirius, Fred, Snape, Remus & Tonks) This means we could get Auror & father Harry working with the adults from the original series as an adult himself. Unlike a lot of Auror!Harry fics, here there would be older people he trusts and looks up to who are just flat-out better at a lot of things than him because of their longer life experience, but he'd still be no slouch himself.
- OTOH, a lot of the people who fought Voldemort in canon will be older now. In particular, I'm thinking of people like McGonagall, Slughorn, Aberforth, and Mad-Eye, who might not be as prepared to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters as the were in canon.
- By the same token, some Death Eaters will have rotted away in Azkaban, while other will have grown up a bit more. What would Draco Malfoy be like after a few more years of the Dark Lord not returning? There's a lot of fascinating directions that could be taken.
