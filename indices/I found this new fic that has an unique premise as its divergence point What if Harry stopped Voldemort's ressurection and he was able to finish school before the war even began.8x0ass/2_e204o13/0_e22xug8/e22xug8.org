You're right, this could be really interesting. If the fic followed Harry through his school years, it could be interesting seeing what crazy things he'd inevitably get up to in 5th-7th years without Voldemort actively being back. Umbridge probably wouldn't be sent to Hogwarts without the perceived threat to the Ministry's authority, but then who /would/ the Ministry send? No Umbridge means no DA, which dramatically changes things. Without the Order of the Phoenix being reformed to fight Voldemort, Sirius probably wouldn't have set foot in Number 12 Grimmauld Place.

*During School*

- You could make things match canon more closely if you wanted by having Harry (and Cedric?) go on and on about Voldemort in the graveyard. Then the Ministry would still try to discredit them.
- I could easily see Dumbledore keeping the prophecy from Harry for at least a few more years.
- Dumbledore would probably still find the ring in the Gaunt shack and put it on, although it might be earlier (if he has more time to spend without worrying about running the Order) or later (if he doesn't feel it's as urgent). I'd probably have it happen at the same time just to make things easier.
- I'd probably have Dumbledore tell Harry the prophecy around the same time he was finally teaching him about Horcruxes, as a sort of "I need to pass this stuff on before I die" thing.
- Hopefully Dumbledore would explain more of his plan to Harry before dying now that Malfoy probably wouldn't be sent to kill him.
- This would be a good opportunity to write a better romance than in canon. I almost certainly couldn't do it, but the chance does exist.
- With Sirius still alive and Voldemort not fully back, there could be the common fanfic plotline of trying to prove Sirius's innocence, only now later than usual.
- Remus/Tonks romance has no particular reason to happen. You could either leave it this way (if you don't like the pairing) or write your own.
- If fifth year happens largely the same but Voldemort doesn't return at the end, the Ministry wouldn't have any reason to back off from its position in sixth year. Also, Umbridge may still be around if they didn't have to throw her to the centaurs to go to the Ministry.
- If Dumbledore still dies in sixth year, after that would be something you very rarely see--the heroes having to prepare and fight Voldemort without having Dumbledore at all. Usually (and in canon), Dumbledore's death is synonymous with Voldemort taking over, but here Voldemort would still be at a severe disadvantage when Dumbledore died.

Really, this is a great jumping off point for any number of divergences.
