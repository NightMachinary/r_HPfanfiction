Excellent premise. I'd like to see this become a trope as it opens a lot of doors for authors to explore with. Here's a few ideas I'd have around this premise ... off the top of my head:

- What would happen romance-wise -- how would Harry juggle having a partner, maybe even a kid -- THEN having Voldemort be reborn?

- Would Harry relax, thinking Voldemort is gone "for good" or would he train to become better?

- Assuming the Death Eaters are free once more -- perhaps a story showing them panicking at Voldemort's second destruction by Harry Potter, and the drama that would cause. Perhaps a chase against time to locate the Dark Lord and get him back in a body again. Would they do the ceremony / ritual different? Would the Dark Lord look different -- better or worse? How would they feel about Potter -- hate him or fear him?

- How does the Ministry respond? Surely they would try to bury this -- if he really was defeated again (set back, not "vanquished") then Fudge would definitely want to keep it quiet. Would Harry be more accepting of this because he knows the Dark Lord isn't an active threat, or would he still want the truth to out. How would people respond if he says he defeated the Dark Lord again? -- "Fishing for glory" etc. People would think he'd be lying.
