Whenever I need a type of magical job for a fic, I mostly look at lists of medieval jobs, tbh. There's a lot there that I don't think would fit, but it's a good source of inspiration just by dint of listing so many jobs that are needed to stock stores and let life run smoothly. Clock makers, toy makers, cobblers, bricklayers, seamstresses, weavers, blacksmiths, etc. Pretty much any object you could imagine being sold in Diagon Alley needs someone to make it, and just based on historical experience, it's no stretch of the imagination that some of the spells necessary for making these things are kept a trade secret.

And I also just really enjoy exploring apprenticeships to artisans.
