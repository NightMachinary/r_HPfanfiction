I've got no idea how permanent things are in canon; it's been a while since I've read the books. As for building items, my headcanon goes like this: an average wizard can conjure bricks because they've seen bricks. They know what bricks are like. Getting the bricks is easy. They can't however make those bricks into brick wall that will stand well because they don't have experience with the mortar, support rebar (if there are any), the physics of putting it together in such a way that it'll stand when dry, etc. The same thing with metalwork: anyone who's seen a piece of wrought iron can conjure a length of it, but building a wrought iron fence or a fancy gate once they have the raw materials is so difficult that it's easier just to call in a professional.
