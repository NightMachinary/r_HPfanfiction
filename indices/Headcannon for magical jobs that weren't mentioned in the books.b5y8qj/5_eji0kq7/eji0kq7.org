I had an idea for a fic where Harry becomes a Bloodborne styled Hunter and is sent to a monster infested Eastern Europe to clear out monster (like eldritch abominations) afflicted towns and cities and during one of her qudditch games Ginny is stuck in one of these cities with Harry while he trys to clear it out. This would be a fic where Voldemort was either dead all along or Dumbledore found his horcruxes on his own. Harry would never have gone to hogwarts and i am tempted to make him go to a Hunter School somewhere
