It would make sense for a werewolf to have his own business like this. Whenever someone tries to hire him for the full moon, he could just explain that he's already booked that day. It makes so much sense, I had to come up with a headcanon for why Lupin didn't do this, since if he had, he wouldn't have been so poor.

The Lupin in my stories has the wolf trait of needing to be part of a pack, not as a leader, but a follower. He'd feel very uncomfortable running his own business. He just wants to work for someone else's business, which sucks, since bosses don't want to hire him.

The exterminator in my story is a werewolf too, but one with a more entrepreneurial spirit than Lupin. He was turned at age seventeen, not four, so he developed more of a human sense of independence than a wolf sense of interdependence.
