Depending on how separate the Wizarding World is from the Muggle one, I'd like to imagine that there are Magical farmers working on what Muggles think are unarable land; using magic to increase soil fertility, create sources of water, and altering the local terrain and weather to something more beneficial to growing crops and/or raising livestock.
