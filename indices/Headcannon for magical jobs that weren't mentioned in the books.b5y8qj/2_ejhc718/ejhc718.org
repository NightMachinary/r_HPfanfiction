One I made up for Victoria Potter:

Chapter 14

  [Petunia] took in the visitors, noting their robes with a slight curl of her lip. "You're here to take her away, are you?"

  "With your permission," Mr Bones said, "I've cleared it with the Ministry of Magic, of course, and we've had a charm-mason lay down extra security. Nothing like what you've got here, but I understand it's been several years since the last---"

  "That sounds fine," Petunia interrupted, her voice strained, no doubt distressed from the sudden invasion of magic into her home. "Will you be leaving straight away?"

Chapter 15

  When they weren't helping with the vegetables, the girls liked to explore, returning home each afternoon with flowers in their hair and scratches on their legs from the wild undergrowth. Victoria was developing a tan from all the time under the sun, and Susan's normally clear skin was coming out in freckles. Further and further they ventured, beyond the vegetable patches, past the fields where cows grazed and into the woods.

  It didn't take long before they encountered the edge of the Boneses' land. A low stone wall cut through the woods where the property ended, its surface a jigsaw of irregularly shaped rocks. Mr Bones had made them promise not to cross into the Muggle world, so they followed the path running alongside the wall, which led them in a giant semi-circle that would eventually take them back to the river.

  "They put this in over the summer," Susan explained as they walked, "we used to have a few wooden posts marking the boundary, but Dad said we had to get something more secure."

  She looked nervously at the wall. It didn't look very sturdy. "How does it work? The wall, I mean."

  Susan shrugged. "I'm not sure. There's spells on every stone, but I think different stones have different spells. I watched the charm-mason put it down; it took him weeks to finish."
