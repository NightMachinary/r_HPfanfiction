A very fair point. Wizards do seem to have the complete lack of common sense and logic that keeping family members out of the prison or keeping visitors attended while they're in the prison would necessitate, so it is possible they're that stupid.

Would have interesting enough implications to ignore the ill logic of the premise too, in my opinion. Purebloods having to masquerade as Muggleborns out of survival necessity would be a fascinating concept to play around with and examine.
