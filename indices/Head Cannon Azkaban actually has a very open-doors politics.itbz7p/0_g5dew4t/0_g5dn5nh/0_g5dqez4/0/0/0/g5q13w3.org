Well Azkaban is meant to break its prisoners hence the dementors people sent there aren't supposed to get out. Patronus doesn't contain them it merely beats them back. But they can be contained, logically Azkaban is the perfect way to contain dementors by providing them with people to suck the happiness from. Like you said only actual government officials so far it seems only high ranking officials can actually visit the place. So I wouldn't exactly say logic and decision making is a weakness of theirs.
