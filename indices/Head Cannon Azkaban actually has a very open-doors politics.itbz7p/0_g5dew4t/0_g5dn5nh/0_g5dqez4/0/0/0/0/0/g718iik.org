Ok I'm going to be honest here dementors aren't free they can be contained. I mean seriously I highly doubt they would have brokered anything with dementors if they couldn't control them in some way. I also personally believe that the actual guards and staff of Azkaban work in cycles by that I mean spend some time at the prison then get switched out for awhile then go back when it's your time again. I just highly doubt they would risk their own people in such a matter. As for VIP's visiting once again I highly doubt it happens Fudge went there for an inspection more then likely. Crouch was literally the head of the aurors hand had authority to visit the place. Obviously what I'm saying and what your arguing against worked well for them cause dementors became so little of an issue that most people stopped learning how to cast the patronus charm.
