I see your point, but I do still disagree. Feeding them so they don't wander off is direction and appeasement, not really containment. Containment is sticking them in a box where they can't get out or somehow preventing them from spreading/doing whatever they want. Giving them people doesn't stop them going to other places to find more people with more happiness to eat, it just keeps them interested until they find something better. It's like the old 'grabbing the tiger by the tail' idiom. Sure, things are okay now, but the moment any element of the system falters, you're gonna get eaten. It's still an immensely risky play with a lot of very delicate balances to maintain and very serious issues caused if that balance breaks.

There's a good reason 'Dementors leave Azkaban and attack towns indiscriminately' hasn't become cliche, despite being such a well-used trope.

And well, subjecting your leaders and high-powered officials to mental manipulation also seems somewhat of a bad decision. We know that long-term exposure to Dementors has extreme effects on the mind and memory and general awareness of life, so imagine what the Head of the Prison experiences, and imagine what tiny but important things a VIP might forget if they visit too often. Might not be an immediately terrible idea, but it's certainly not a good one.
