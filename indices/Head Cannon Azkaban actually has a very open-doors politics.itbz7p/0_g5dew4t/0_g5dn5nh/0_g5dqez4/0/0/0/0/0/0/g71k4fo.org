We're arguing two different definitions here, so this argument isn't going to go anywhere. By my definition, Azkaban didn't contain them because they literally wandered off without effort to join Voldemort in the later books. By your definition, Azkaban did contain them because they didn't leave earlier. Same data point, different interpretations. So, let's please stop this here.
