Yep, until her sister decides to turn around and start to spread chaos, potentially getting the entire thing discovered and both her and Lucius thrown in Azkaban /along/ with her.

My understanding is that the DE that were connected enough and discreet enough to escape prison did so, either the way I proposed or the Malfoy way (perhaps some got out of the country for safety) with the only ones /staying/ in Azkaban being the ones that either didn't have the means to get out or who were too high-profile/obvious to let out without putting the entire family who got them out in danger.

Plus there is the fact that some may have liked the way things went without a Dark Lord throwing cruciais around like candy or some of their most unpleasant allies around bothering them while they still managed to keep a hold over their own resources and even improve on them.
