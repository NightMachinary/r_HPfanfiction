I really love Dirty Blood (linkffn(Dirty Blood)), but it is not just Lily, but her and her friends and the marauders equally. The updates take some time sometimes, but it is a great WIP that sets in her 5th year, even if to me personally Lily is at times the least likable character.

Other than that I could put in a little self-promotion. I write a story about all of Lily's years in Hogwarts at the moment and how she navigates her life in this new world and the war and how it affects her relationships with friends, family, allies, enemies, and lovers (but the last point is relatively small still), right now I'm in the middle of year 6. If you want to, take a look. linkffn(Lily Bud by schak)
