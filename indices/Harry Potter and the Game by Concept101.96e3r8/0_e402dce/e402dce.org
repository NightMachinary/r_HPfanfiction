  A really, really good story, with great worldbuilding. Some parts may ear dark, while some appear childish. It has many deviations from canon. But the best thing is even though Harry has the Gamer abilities, he s not god. There are people who are more powerful than him. Definitely the best Gamer crossover I've ever read.
