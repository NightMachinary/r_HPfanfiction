I didn't begin this story at first because of the summary but when I finally got into it I was positively surprised.

As for gaming crossover I also really liked "The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited" linkffn(9708318). Some aspect of the skills, xp and stats are in my opinion better handled. It's just damn sad it's on hiatus. And after reading and following so many fics, hiatus don't sound good if you want an actual end to a story...
