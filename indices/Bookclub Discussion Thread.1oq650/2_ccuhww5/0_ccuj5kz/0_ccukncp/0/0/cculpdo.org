Would I recommend it? Erm.../sorta/.

It's well written and action packed, but it's almost not even a Harry Potter book. It's not set in Hogwarts, few canon characters are involved, and Harry is so OOC to be unrecognizable. But it's a good read and feels like the ultimate evolution of the super!timetravel!Harry genre.

Overall, I'd say it's worth a look and expect a high probability that you won't like it. It succeeds at what it sets out to do, but not everyone wants that in their fic.
