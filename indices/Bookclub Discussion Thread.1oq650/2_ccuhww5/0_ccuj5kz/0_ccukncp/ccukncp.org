I disagree that being a super!harry fic is what makes it tensionless; it's the mismatch of conflict to powers. The strongest Harry I can think of is from Wastelands of Time, with perfect foreknowledge throwing out building sized explosions and ancient magics, but the story is still interesting because Voldemort's omnipotent to counter him. Plenty of other fics do well with super!harry as well.

They just follow the rule. "You can't make Frodo a Jedi without giving Sauron the Death Star."
