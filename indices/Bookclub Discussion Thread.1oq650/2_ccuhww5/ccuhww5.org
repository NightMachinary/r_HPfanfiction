I got to about chapter 18 and dropped it. I was torn between trying to read through it for the book club and wanting to drop it since about chapter 7.

It seems to suffer from absolutely random powerups when they could just solve the problems with effort instead. I can take a story with character powerups, but it's very bad form when they're just random bullet points thrown in to make characters awesome. Also, there was no tension in most of the story, probably due to the aforementioned powerups.

A good example is the legacy spell. Originally I had thought that Snape was just bullshitting Harry about casting a Legacy spell. Snape already knew that Harry would become awesome in the future because of timetravel, so he could lie to him to convince him to study hard in certain areas. Later on if the secret got called out, there could be tension about his ruse being a lie, him being asked to cast it on others, etc. But no, he actually just whipped out a hundred year old spell that has a stupidly narrow scope, and he got that power for /no reason/.

Similarly, Harry just overwhelms everything. When he heals a child recently bitten by a werewolf I can sorta buy that if it's fresh. But then a guy comes who's been a werewolf all his life begs for healing. I assume this will be a nice point of conflict where Harry isn't powerful enough, setting up a medium-long term goal and creating tension in the story. LOLNOPE. Instead Harry just kicks in super-saiyan mode and heals it anyways, then for extra measure explodes in healing that permanently vaccinates people.

The spelling and grammar were good. I didn't enjoy how much telling vs showing there was, but that's fairly common. Also I enjoyed the foreshadowing with Coral in class->Scabbers in class->Pettigrew joins Voldie early on. The Quirrelmort scene in chapter 6 was well done as well.

I did enjoy the characterization of everyone. Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, all the supporting cast, etc. They seemed believable and interesting. It's just that the plot/pacing/conflict in the story was so bad to overcome that.

Overall, I'd put thumbs down for it.
