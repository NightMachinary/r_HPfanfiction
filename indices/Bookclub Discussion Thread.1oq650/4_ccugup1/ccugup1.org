I dropped after chapter 7 or 8. The biggest problem I had with this story is something that a lot of fics get wrong: there is no real conflict. For as far as I read, Harry hasn't had to stuggle, at all. He's powerful, and happy, and well adjusted, and hard workiing and etc...Paragraphs of description about how well someone's life is going is only effective if it proceeds to get fucked up in some way.

The author did try to inject some dramatic tension into the story via the whole 'Snapes secret' plotline, but that didn't work either. The problem was that I as a reader had no reason to believe that it would be a problem if Dumble finds out that Snape traveled in time. Through the first 8 chapters, Dumbledore is depicted as a reasonable man who wants nothing but the best for Harry. That being the case, why would he be anything but happy that Snape came from the future?

In the positves column, the author does seem to have a decent grasp of the basic mechanics of writing. It was grammatically correct with no blatant typos, and the writing was technically solid. I'll also add that the concept of the legacy spell intrigued me, but I would have prefered a more elaborate version used in a better story.

I would not recommend this story to others.
