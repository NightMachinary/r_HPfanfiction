This /is/ a discussion thread, I don't think you /can/ make it too long.

We'll have to get our bookclub organizer to try and contact the author then for the next time. The main problem being if the fic is really really old and the author contact info is out of date or if he just doesn't care anymore about his fics.

I know if one of my fics was picked, I'd be delighted (after a sever depression due to much criticism of course), because it would be such a help to improve.
