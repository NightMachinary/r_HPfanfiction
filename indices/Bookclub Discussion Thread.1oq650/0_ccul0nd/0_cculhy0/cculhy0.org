I really love how detailed your review of the story is.

It makes me realize how useful it can be for any fanfic writer lurking around here.

Also, it makes me wonder if it would be a good idea to invite the author of he chosen fanfic to the bookclub discussion thread. Chances are they won't be available, but on the off chance, it could be interesting.

You are quite thought-provoking OutOfNiceUsernames!
