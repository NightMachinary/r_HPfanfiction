Someone in the previous thread told that it gets better later on, so I didn't drop it on the first chapters (which felt like a really long introduction that even the author was not interested in putting there). Later on, however, things got somewhat more interesting. But the “interest level” was still fluctuating through the whole story.

I'll first write *what I did like*, and then what I did not.

- It's nice that this fic starts to differ from the canon so early on. Most other books that involve time travel of any kind usually end up just replaying the original events like the author is replaying the same game with only some cheats or mods enabled.
- *Spoiler* for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/31/][Ch. 31]]: I liked how Lily's defending of Harry was performed and described in this story. [[/spoiler][(“/... It's all I can give/”)]]
- *Spoiler* [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/10/][Ch. 10]]---34: It was nice that Harry was unable to cure the Longbottoms right away and had to really work on his knowledge before even attempting anything. It added some realism to the story, which it really needed in my opinion. The notion of human personality's fragility in the brain was also a nice touch.
- Grammar and language were more or less ok, even though there was no unique excellency to this author's style.
- *Spoiler* [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/30/][Ch. 30]]: [[/spoiler][“/Being centuries old, Nicholas and Perenelle remained silent but by his side, knowing that there were times one could provide no words of comfort or condolence, and that sometimes the best thing to do was be silent./”]] I liked this part.
- Nobody was trying to /stun/ Death Eaters.

Unfortunately, there is much more of *what I didn't* like in this fic. Here's most of it:

- Author's simulation of many characters is out of sync:

  - people constantly roll their eyes (Harry, Snape), punch walls when they are angry (Snape), poorly control their emotional outbursts otherwise (Harry, Snape, Dumbledore) and often can't keep their emotions in check (Snape, Bones, Dumbledore, Mcgonagall etc).
  - Slytherins become Harry's allies way too easily. Especially so the older generation.
  - Dumbledore was rarely proactive and Snape was doing everything for him---at one point Dumbledore even went to Snape to ask for what should they do next.
  - Z. Smith's extreme hostility towards Harry was never properly explained. As Draco became Harry's friend, Smith was just converted into the story's asshole.
  - Voldemort was completely unaware of what was happening under his nose.
  - Bella was made into a lunatic that was completely dis-attached from reality.
  - *Spoiler* for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/23/][Ch. 23]]---34: Two of the most powerful wizards of their century get serious injuries from simple gun bullets. In case of Dumbledore the bullet injury causes a permanent brain damage. In case of Voldemort, none of his death eaters are being capable of properly fixing the damage (again, from only a single bullet). I understand that the author wanted to make a point about how the 2 civilizations can learn from each other and so on, but for that purpose the whole magic was being constantly nerfed.

- Neville's toad [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet][Taking the killing curse]] at one point was completely ridiculous.
- *There* /was/ */too much unnecessary formatting/*.
- Story's overall pacing was unsteady, its ending was haphazard.
- Idiot Balls rolling all over (*spoilers* through the whole story below):

  - [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1oq650/bookclub_discussion_thread/ccugup1][as MeijiHao mentioned]], there was no good reason why Snape wouldn't tell Dumbledore what's really going on. But as original Dumbledore would be a too powerful ally for the story to work, he was awkwardly kept as a NPC.
  - When they assault Quirell, they make a nice small talk with him first so that he can prepare to defend himself and make a way for an Awesome Duel Battle Scene.
  - Snape “forgets” to do something with Peter, Peter escapes to VD and VD comes back as before.
  - Snape “forgets” to do something with Voldermort's father's bones, VD comes back as before.
  - Dumbledore gives away a sample of his blood as a blood donation supply. Seriously.
  - Dumbledore suspects Fudge to be under Imperio, gets a warning from Harry that VD is planning something for the day of his planned visit to Fudge in Ministry and still does nothing to prevent Harry from moving into a TRAP.
