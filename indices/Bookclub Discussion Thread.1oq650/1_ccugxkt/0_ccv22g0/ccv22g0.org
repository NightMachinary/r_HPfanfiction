I have to say I wasnt a great fan of the story, the first few chapters were pretty good but then it seemed to descend into stupid ball tossing and 'and now Harry can do this'. Once it got to werewolf healing i felt that it really took a turn into the super!harry street, and would have liked to see more conflict with a 'big bad' just to knock that back a bit.

Snape was very off for me, I spent the first couple of chapters thinking he might have an ulterior motive aka using Harry's mage status to bring back Lilly, but it turned out his dark streak had been nurtured.

I'm glad you enjoyed it though because this is what this club is all about exposure and development :D
