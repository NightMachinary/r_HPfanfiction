- I loved the story. It isn't the type of fanfiction I usually go for (mine are normally ships) but this made me realize that it's possible to do a rewrite without it looking too 'off'.
- I read it all on the day it was posted. It was impossible for me to stop, so no, I definitely did not drop this one.
- The new spells/parselmagic were interesting. I didn't really care for the whole taboo legacy spell thing, I think too much weight was put on that. However, I really liked the healing magic. At times it was a bit too 'super!harry' but it was a central part of the plot.
- I liked the different take on the characters, but I didn't like how Sirius was portrayed (I can't remember how far in he shows up, so I don't think I'll get too into it).
- It wasn't a perfect fanfic. It was a long crackfic with humour and adventure. I don't really like to complain about small grammatical/spelling errors because at the end of the day, it's an online fanfiction. You didn't pay to read it, nor is anyone forcing you to read it. There weren't any glaring errors in my opinion, nothing so bad that I'd have to stop reading.
- I liked a fair amount. It was unique enough, and the whole Malfoy family being in debt to Harry was a nice way to move them away from Voldemort and have Draco as a potential friend.
- Though I liked Snape, he didn't seem realistic in this. Same with Harry, I understand that he has the potential to be studious and such but at times I couldn't handle it. Especially when [[/spoiler][he is completely unfazed by getting a broom for his birthday because he isn't bothered with Quidditch.]], it drove me insane. Also at times Harry seemed too perfect. Plus I didn't like how Hermione and Ron were barely mentioned (it made me sad). The whole Sirius thing pissed me off the most though.

I'd only recommend this story as an easy going read. It's simple, there's not a whole lot to it, and it's an easy way to pass the time. I read fics like crazy so I had no problem with it, but someone who doesn't read as much would find that it drags on a bit too much.
