ff2ebook.com does not cost anything. Some TTS voices do cost something but all of Google's voices are free and frankly the best.

I am unaware if Google Play Books can be accessed on iOS honestly. It's quite unlikely too, though most ebook readers like FBReader and eReader Prestigio have TTS options. If they are not available either then I'd imagine whatever the most popular ebook reader on Apple is will have TTS.

Yeah, speed and voice type are changeable in all three of the readers I mentioned. That shouldn't be a problem.
