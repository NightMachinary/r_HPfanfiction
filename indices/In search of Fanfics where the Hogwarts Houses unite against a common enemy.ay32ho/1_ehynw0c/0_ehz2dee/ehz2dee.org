Sir, this is a school. It is not a maximum security vault, nor a safe house for spies, nor a shelter for active and homicidal Death Eaters, nor a side-hobby to your political aspirations, nor a base of operations for hunting Dark Lords. It is none of those things. Hogwarts is a /school/ for /children/.
