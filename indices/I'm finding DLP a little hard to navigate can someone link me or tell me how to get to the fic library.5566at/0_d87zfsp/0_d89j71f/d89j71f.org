You know, the whole point of the 5 posts to view requirement is that it means only people who genuinely want to be part of the community can see the betaing subforum. Spreading around the specific requirements is kinda a dick move as it just means that people will spam posts in order to get access, which in turn increases the work load of the moderators who have to discern who is posting solely for the purpose of access and ban them.
