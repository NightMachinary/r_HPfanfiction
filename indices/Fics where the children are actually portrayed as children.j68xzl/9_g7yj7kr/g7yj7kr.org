A Second Chance

This is the only fic that I think demonstrates children being children. Sirius gets a trial after 4 years, and takes over Harry's guardianship.

So you get almost all of Harry's emotional developments. He has his issues of abuse from the Dursleys. Jealousy issues from Sirius' girlfriends, testing boundaries and rules as any child does with their parents, and a lot more.
