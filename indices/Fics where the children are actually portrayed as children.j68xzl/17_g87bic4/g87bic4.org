Writing interesting or funny stories about kids is hard. While kids always do stuff it is not that engaging for older readers, nevermind the younger writers that see themselves as more mature than they are and write the characters in a similar way.

I personally like to write stories about kids more in a slice of life style, in those they can their behavior slowly, without needed to show any specific moment when they grew in that way
