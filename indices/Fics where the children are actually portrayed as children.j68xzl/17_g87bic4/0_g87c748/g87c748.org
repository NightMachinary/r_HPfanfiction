I agree that it is a challenge, but I think that makes the story that much better in the end.

Though managing to portray them adequately out of a 'slice of life' style story is harder, I think. For me, at least, even though it makes the non-slice of life story THAT much better.

I don't think it should centre around specific moments, though. Small thoughts or observations are usually enough to set the mood, especially if your POV/Limited is a child protagonist.

For example, I recently included one of those moments in my own fic - Harry (age 8/9) is spending some time in Egypt, and so he needs to be prepared for the weather. His parents force him to use sunscreen, and he hates using sunscreen. So he sulks.

It's a pretty simple bit, but my fic isn't centred around 'slice of life' - it's fantasy/adventure. And this whole idea of 'engaging for older readers' I find a little bs. It's a magical world, and there's no age limit for magic. Experiencing new sights and sounds doesn't require much in terms of maturity, and you can still write a fantastic story.

Harry shouldn't be written as a child wizard, he should be written as a wizard, who happens to be a child. In that order of focus, while keeping both in mind. That's my angle, even if I have to remind myself at times.
