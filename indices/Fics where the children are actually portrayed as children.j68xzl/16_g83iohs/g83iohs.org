I've been trying really hard to do this in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18335585/chapters/43406147]])

I also have the adult creatures behaving as adults in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15911484]])

because this is also a frustration of mine. It's been really challenging, but as you say, I'm aiming for precocious, smart but naive bad innocent children with their own childish logic rather than children that are smart and so think like adults. From my comments and feedback so far it seems most people think I'm doing ok with it.
