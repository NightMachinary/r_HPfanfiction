  I find it really strange when reading all these varied stories where an eleven-year-old can outplay seasoned political veterans after one month of study.

It's because kids are hard to write, even the canon books made them way more mature than most kids their age.

  Or when adults act way too petty or immature.

  It just doesn't make sense

Boy, do I have something to tell you about "adults".

  I guess I just really need a regular age-appropriate experience in a fantasy setting. One where the character actually matures because they grew as a person over time.

Those are hard to come by, some times it's hard for the writer, or sometimes they don't bother because many readers would find it boring.

  Eleven-year-olds should be making retching noises at kissing and protesting against the use of sunscreen. Not politicking or 'employing ample quantities' of verbose.

I can agree that should be the norm, but reading about that can get boring, and you can justify kids being more mature or having better vocabulary, OR you can just skip that and begin the story in 3rd/4th year and have the characters be old enough for more interesting magic, romance, and more danger.

  Just give me a 'normal' boarding school fic that isn't focused on the actual day-to-day fluff.
#+end_quote

I am gonna be honest, I find normal boarding school for eleven year olds boring, it's just hard to imagine kids doing interesting stuff that we haven't read a thousand times.

That's why I like when authors put Harry in another House and write it well, it changes things up, many authors keep to the stations of canon way too much and we end up getting 'boring' stories.

I have no trouble with kids acting more mature(as in dialogue) but it has a limit, I don't like when they make the adults so incompetent, or when the kids are too mature, having an eleven-year-old acting as if they were fourteen on some things is not THAT unbelievable, you can just say magic children are different. With Harry who lived a life of abuse it's even easier.

But yeah, kid politicians just stretch it.
