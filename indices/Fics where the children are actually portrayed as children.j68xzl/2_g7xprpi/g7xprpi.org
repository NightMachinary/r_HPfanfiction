  Or when adults act way too petty or immature.
#+end_quote

I 100% agree with the "Kids should act as kids" bit, but for the petty adults . . . Snape. More seriously, and without going too political, recent events showed us that some adult can be just as petty and immature than kids. I think it's fin to include it in fanfictions (and stories in general), as long as the character is considered as /petty/ immature/ in the story, and that there are some mature people to balance things out.
