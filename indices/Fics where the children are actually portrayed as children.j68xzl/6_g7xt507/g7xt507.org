This is such a pet peeve of mine. I really hate when kids talk like Shakespearen actors. I will immediately drop a fic that does it. I want one scene where 12 year old Hermione get indignant with an adult, starts using big words, and gets corrected on one of them. She'd get all huffy and embarrassed, I'm sure.
