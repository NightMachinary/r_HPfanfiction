I've always wanted to see fics show kids doing what kids would actually do if they had magic: play. Show me animated toys or stuffed animals, those cup-phones enchanted to work without a string, hide and seek within Hogwarts, exploring the grounds around the school, pretending to be spies or detectives, etc.
