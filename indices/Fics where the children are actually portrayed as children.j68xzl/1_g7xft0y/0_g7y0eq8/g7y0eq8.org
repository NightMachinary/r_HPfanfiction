That's a big thing that struck me yesterday - a fic that I just read actually /had kids playing/. I mean, the muggleborns ran out onto the grounds during their first afternoon off, dragging along their new (magical and somewhat unwilling) friends, and played some footie. They had wars with the little green army men (which are superior to ones that move for eleven-year-old-boy reasons) and so on.

They weren't magical toys (iirc the only 'magical' game was aurors and robbers) but like... I had never seen it before. It was refreshing, especially since this Harry didn't have a normal childhood either. It wasn't even a huge part of the plot, but it was present and it gave the impression that it happened frequently even if we didn't see it.
