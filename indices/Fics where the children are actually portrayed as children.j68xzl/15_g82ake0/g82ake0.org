Incomplete, and tragic, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/411709/chapters/683216][It's Green]] is great. A young Harry just wants to take care of plants. He is actually a child figuring things out for himself. Adults are mostly mildly perplexed by Harry, excepting the few that are outright malicious (Dursleys, a teacher or two). But they feel like adults dealing with a precocious, but odd, child.
