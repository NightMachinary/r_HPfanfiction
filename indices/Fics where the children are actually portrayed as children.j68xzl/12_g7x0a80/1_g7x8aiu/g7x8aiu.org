"The Best Revenge" and it's sequel are amazing! I love it so much! I would have to say that my favorite things about it are how the adults actually act like /responsible/ adults and the kids act like kids, as well as the Wizarding World Explorers Club and Hufflepuff Harry. It's exciting and suspenseful at parts and it also shows how much better things can go for the Wizarding World when people actually come together, despite their differences, and try to find a common ground.
