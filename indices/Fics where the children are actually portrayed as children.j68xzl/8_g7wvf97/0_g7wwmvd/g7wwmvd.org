Not at all!

For example, I'm completely fine with 'the boring stuff' as you put it. It can be some of the best parts of a fic.

What annoys me are the fics where they try to make 'the boring stuff' unrealistic. Like, for example, first-years speaking in a formal language with each other in the hallways between class. Talking politics or calling each other Heiress X or Heir X while in the common room, y'know?

What I'm saying is we need more realistic boring stuff, not less of it in general.

Like, enjoy school life. You're at a mixed-gender boarding school. How are you not goofing off or acting your age in your free time?

"Stop sending mail to the goblins and go take a dunk in the lake, Mr Potter!"

But what I meant by that comment is that we only get this normal interaction in the 'friendship/family' fluff fics or the ones that centre themselves purposely around those interactions.

We never get this casual attitude in fics not centred around school life. It's never used as just a regular side-thing. That's what's sad to me.
