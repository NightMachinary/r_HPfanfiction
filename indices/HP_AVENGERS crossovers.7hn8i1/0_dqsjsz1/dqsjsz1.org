You probably know it already and it is Loki/harry, so maybe not the best rec, but I remember enjoying it very much. And if you decide to give it a go, I advice you not to ignore author's music recommendations for the mood:) linkao3(of wizards and heroes)

Linkffn(the triumph of these tired eyes) Loki is Harry's father in this one. No slash but I though it very good, at least the beginning.

Also there was a femslash one, let me know if you're into that and I'll try to find it.
