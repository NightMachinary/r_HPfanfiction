I don't think it will have a significant impact. This fandom has resisted a lot of bullshit from Rowling, like the completely bizarre Cursed Child, the mediocre cash grabs that are Fantastic Beasts movies, and all the pottermore pooping wizard stuff. The fandom is more attached to her setting and characters, rather than her politics or her idea of canon. The only thing I think would seriously alienate the fandom is if she tried retconning a villain into a trans woman or made Hermione a mouthpiece for her TERF politics.

The fanfiction community, I think will only naturally slow down considering the series is older. I don't see them abandoning it immediately. Regular fans though, yes I've seen a lot of posts from people who are disappointed in Rowling and will probably not buy her future works. This isn't the ASOIAF fandom, where a lot of people drop out due to disappointment. There are plenty of HP fanfic writers who don't agree with her politically, and writing fanfiction doesn't really benefit her monetarily. That said, I can understand why some might be completely turned off the fandom by her actions, and I expect they'll simply switch fandoms, and good for them.
