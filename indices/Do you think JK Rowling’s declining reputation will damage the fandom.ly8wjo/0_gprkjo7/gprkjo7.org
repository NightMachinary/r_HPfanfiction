Probably not. At this point, more headcanon exists than actual canon. Even if we pulled a Farenheit and burned every copy of her books and every copy of the movies and every memory of the play, the fandom would still survive on headcanon alone. It's been a decade since the last movie (of the OG series) came out and a decade and a half since the last book did and people are still arguing passionately about whether Snape was a douche or James Potter was an angel or how magic works or what a relationship between Hagrid and the Giant Squid would be like.

The HP Fandom will be fine. :)
