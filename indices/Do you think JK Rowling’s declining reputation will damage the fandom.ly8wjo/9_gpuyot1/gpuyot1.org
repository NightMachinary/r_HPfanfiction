I dont think so

There are some people that dont want to have anything to do with it/trying to be bossy and demand that others dont either but that's on them

I think it's doing well, especially with the time people are having from quarantine

Side note- I'm not gonna share my opinion on the whole thing but some of the hate JK is recieving is ridiculous. It shouldn't be acceptable to say that you hope she gets raped or something
