I think at this point, Harry Potter has really drifted out of Rowling's hands and people just do what they want with it. If I could give any advice to Rowling, I would tell her to cut things off and just let Harry Potter belong to a corporation or public domain. The fandom itself will definitely survive her issues, but I feel like many people will refuse to financially support it, as the money will go to Rowling. On a side note, torrenting is kind of fun.
