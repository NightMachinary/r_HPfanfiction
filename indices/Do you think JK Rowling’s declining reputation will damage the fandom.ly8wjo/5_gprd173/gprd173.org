Well, there's already people distancing themselves from harry potter as a franchise. So, I'd say yes, the fandom is likely going to be in for a rough patch. I don't know if it will be a meaningful detriment to it given how enormous the harry potter fandom is though...

Personally, I'm not wanting to support Rowling too much, right now. Not just because I do support the trans crowd, but also because everything recent hasn't been very good.

I will probably buy the video game if it looks good because it likely doesn't have that much to do with her personally, and I really want there to be a hogwarts video game that doesn't suck.

And I'm still going to read fanfiction, because that doesn't support Rowling in any way.
