Not much on fandom directly, but her readership will probably decline in the long run. Given Harry Potter is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_book_series][the most popular book series ever]] and [[https://hobbylark.com/fandoms/fanfictionnet-vs-archive-of-our-own][the most popular fandom]] (twice as many stories as next Naruto), I don't think we have too much to fear.
