I actually know of 2 fanfic authors that refuse to write HP fanfics anymore because commenters gave them so much crap about what they wrote in the fanfics for some reason. So I'd say that the fandom is already kind of declining in terms of fanfics but for those who stay to the absolute cannon I believe that that probably won't dissapear. But I could be wrong
