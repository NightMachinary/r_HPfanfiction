Also, I wouldn't say the book villains are exactly Conservatives. I think that's being a bit harsh on Conservatives, seeing as most Conservatives aren't in favour of torture and genocide.

I grant you that they hold Conservative views on the Wizarding World, but the villains of the books are extremists and I think it lacks nuance to just call them Conservatives.
