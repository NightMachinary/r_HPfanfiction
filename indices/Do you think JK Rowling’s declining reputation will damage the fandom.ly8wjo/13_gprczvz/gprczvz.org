Its not doing a lot for existing fans but younger people are a lot less interested. That might have happened anyway, they're 20+ years old now. Personally while I'm still into the series I try not to spend any money that might go to TERF causes and that has influenced my purchasing decisions in the last little while.

Considering the books' villains are basically conservatives I don't see a lot of overlap between people who agree that trans women should be treated as men who want to rape you in the bathroom and HP's target audience.
