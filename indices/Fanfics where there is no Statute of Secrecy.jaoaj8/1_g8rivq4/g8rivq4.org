I just mentioned this in another post but I think it qualifies here.

I don't remember the title, but two sets of the Golden Trio are accidentally sent to parallel world where Voldemort won. He has taken over all of Europe and most of Africa. The humans are slaves or helping with the resistance (in South Africa, I believe).
