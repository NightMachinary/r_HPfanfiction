This is (somehow) an indy!Grey!Dumbledore. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent]]) It's still in progress but it is a fun read and regularly updated!

There is nothing (to fear) is a series of shorts/one-shots about about a Tom Riddle sorted into Gryffindor. Somehow it makes him even creepier than in canon.
