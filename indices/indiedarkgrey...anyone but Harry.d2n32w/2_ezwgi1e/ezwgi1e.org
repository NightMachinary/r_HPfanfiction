Well... the novels were titled "Harry Potter and the ..." for a reason.

Not saying fanfiction shouldn't subvert that, but most people prefer Harry as the protagonist. That's probably the reason why you think people are obsessed with Harry Potter as a character. It's not that they are obsessed, it's just that without him, it could just as well be a generic fantasy world. That's how I see it and why I don't like HP fics that don't involve him.
