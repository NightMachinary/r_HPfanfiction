Imho, Harry is what makes the novels so generic. The Chosen One? Check. Mistreated but secretly amazing and famous (and even rich)? Check. Has no knowledge\power but is always lucky to defeat the villain because he should? Check. Not terribly good and compassionate, but is said to be exceptionally morally good? Check. Etc, etc.

I don't think it's just me who dislikes these tropes, most people in this fandom aren't teenagers anymore and want to read something different. But imho some of these tropes are easier to get rid of when Harry is not in the picture. I've seen fanfiction that subverts them, but the worst offender, the Chosen One trope, is usually still in, because that's Harry. He's still a Mary Sue. Writing from someone else's POV would eliminate lingering tropes automatically and if there's still a fight with Voldie, the new character has to use intelligence and\or earn some actual power to defeat him.

Sure I understand that it's just me who dislikes him for these reasons, so I'm not exactly arguing. Just discussing. And it helps. Now I think that maybe I should've created a topic that asks for non-MarySue protagonist who works for everything the hard way, rather than ask for fanfiction about alternative characters. The former seems to be what I'm looking for, after all, the latter being just potential means towards that end. ;)
