That.. is probably going to be a tough find. It doesn't help that most Harry Potter - Avenger crossovers are either abandoned, one-shots or unreadable due to too much grandstanding. Heck, I can only remember one fic that even has her as a character, and even that is largely minor.

Ps. I will say to those interested that Heroes Assemble! By Stargon1 is probably the best crossover in this genre I've come across. Also has some pretty interesting ships that I wouldn't have expected to enjoy as much as I do.
