Then "A Third Path to the Future" should be interesting to you too. Many rarely used Marvel characters are sometimes heavily featured throughout the story and the MCU is really not close to being the main focus.

"Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe" on the other hand has the MCU as a focus, but done so totally different than other crossovers that I am loving the crap out of it. It is hard to explain why its different, you just have to try it for yourself. And it gets updated every few days too!

And yea, Wand and Shield was I think the first marvel crossover I read but as you said, it is probably abandoned forever :/
