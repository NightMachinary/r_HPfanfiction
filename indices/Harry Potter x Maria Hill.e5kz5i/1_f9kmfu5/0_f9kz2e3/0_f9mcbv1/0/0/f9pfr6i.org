I tentatively still hold out hope for Wand and Shield since the author is still updating some of his other stories.. maybe just a creative break?

Also, kind of hate you for telling me about Third Path To The Future. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty great how it focuses more on the X-men and other minor teams (F4, Inhumans) and I like how Post-Apocalyptic Potter has him willingly join up as a Shield agent, rather than almost coincidentally falling in with the Avengers.. both are pretty new takes on HP-Marvel crossovers. No, I hate you because I can't stop binge reading them and I'm in the middle of final exams!
