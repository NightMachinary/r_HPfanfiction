I'm still enjoying it, but that may be because I'm mostly a DC comics fan, and most of my Marvel knowledge comes from the MCU. This story allows me to learn more about the other parts of Marvel, and let's be honest - there aren't a lot of good crossovers that merges the worlds nicely. I'll check out those other to you mentioned, and also recommend Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest; it's more of a 'alternate dimension' crossover rather than a dimension where both the magical world and Marvel world coexist. Pretty good, although it's been 4 years since an update.
