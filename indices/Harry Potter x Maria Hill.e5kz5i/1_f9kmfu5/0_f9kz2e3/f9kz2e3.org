Loved Heroes Assemble! but it got so boring and repetitive around chapter 70 that I stopped following it. Maybe I will give it another chance if it ever gets finished. Luckily "Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe" came around to fill the void as far as HP/Avengers crossovers go. Enjoying it a lot and so far it is making much better use of what a wizard could do when thrown into the Marvel universe. Honorable mention is "A third Path to the future", a guilty pleasure fic for me and probably not for everybody as Harry is approaching godlike power levels. But somehow the author still managed to keep it interesting for 1.8 million words :D
