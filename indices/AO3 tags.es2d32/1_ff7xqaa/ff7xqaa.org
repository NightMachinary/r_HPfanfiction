I don't do blind tag searches. When I read a story that I really like, I check out the tags for that story and click on the one(s) for the aspect(s) that I really enjoyed about it. That typically leads me on a "free association" trail (just like old-school web surfing) of tags that may or may not have anything to do with one another.

That said, try "The Author Regrets Nothing" for a fun ride.
