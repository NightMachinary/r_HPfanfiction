I usually just look for ships and then check crossovers/no crossovers depends on what you want and start reading. If you want something happy look for "fluff" I'm also fond of "angst with happy end" but normally i don't really do tags.

I mostly use them to exclude stuff, like oc's genderswap etc. You get the hang of what you want eventually but it's always good to look for tropes you are into.

Personally I like "Master of Death Harry" and "Time Travel" You can also look for a lot of other tropes or exclude the ones you dislike. "Wrong boy who lived" or "Harry is a Slytherin" "Dark Harry" "Mentor Snape" are some popular rropes i think. "Creature Harry Potter" or "Creature fic" is also cool. You can also explicitly search for "Werewolves" or "Vampires" or whatever you want

If you don't want anything graphic exclude "Porn what Plot" "Graphic Violence" "Rape/Non-con" maybe "dubious consent" "sex"

I personally never sort by hits or kudos or comments otherwise you don't get to see the new fics. I also tend to mostly browse through completed fics which is a checkbox you can click. You can also sort by rating and relationships. You can also exclude certain ships and decide if you only want M/M relationship fics or F/F or F/M or other
