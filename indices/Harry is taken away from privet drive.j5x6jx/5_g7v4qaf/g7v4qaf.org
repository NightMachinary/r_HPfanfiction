Linkffn(To Shape and Change by Blueowl; The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) are both well regarded by the community.

[[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/The_End_of_Days/][Nightmares of Future Past]] has a wonderful moment were Arthur Weasley tells Dumbledore they will be taking Harry in. It's a wonderful scene and is my favourite depiction of the Weasley family as a whole in fanfiction.
