Hail Odysseus - Grindelwald takes him.

The Daring Win - Umbridge takes him.

Those two are /very/ good. Don't avoid them because of who takes him in imo. And then there's....

Raising a Wizard - Natasha Romanov (Marvel) is his aunt, and takes him. First of a series (still a WIP, slow updates.)

Innocent - McGonnagal decides the Dursleys are shit, and gets Sirius freed. Sirius takes him.

The Accidental Animagus - Harry /runs away/ and the Grangers take him. First of a series (I've only read the first one, and I /think/ part two is still in progress?)
