That'd actually be kind of an interesting explanation. Unlike the rest of the world, Luna runs on Cartoon Logic, where things going missing is actually always the fault of sneaky animals and authority figures are always out-of-camera or doing ridiculously contrived and evil things. I'm not sure if it'd be a more interesting story if she was aware of this or not, but it's a cool idea.

I'm just picturing her falling off a broom or thestral or something, then everyone screams and tries to catch her, only to stop and stare as she starts running in mid-air, staring intensely away from the ground. :D
