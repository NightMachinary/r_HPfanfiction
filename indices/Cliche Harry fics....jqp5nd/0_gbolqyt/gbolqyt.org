I was going to suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][this]] one but then I realised he keeps his friendship with Hermione, I think. It's been a while since I read it. You still might like it because he and Hermione have to work through stuff, he doesn't just let her keep berating him and stuff, and he becomes very independent from her linkao3(harry gets smart and takes control)
