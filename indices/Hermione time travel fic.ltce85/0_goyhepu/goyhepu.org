Some of that sounds similar to Debt of Time, Where Remus gives Hermione a gift and a letter before she is sent back in time. It's most likely not the fic you are looking for though, as Debt of Time starts after a mostly canon end to the series with lots of people still alive, and Hermione ends up related to the Potters, not Dumbledore.
