Yeah. I like this prompt, but this hasn't been as popular as I expected it to be.

I'm sure there are fans who like Draco a whole lot more than I do, but I do find him a fascinating character to explore in fanfiction. Most fanfics paint him as a bigoted moron. Some paint him as someone legitimately dangerous. Some paint him as someone redeemable, especially if he gets away from his father.
