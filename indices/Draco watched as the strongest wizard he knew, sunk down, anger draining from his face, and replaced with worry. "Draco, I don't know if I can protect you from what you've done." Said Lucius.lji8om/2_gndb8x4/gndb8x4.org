Instead of Bellatrix throwing the knife that killed Dobby in Malfoy Manor, it was thrown by Draco just as Harry and the rest were sent to Shell Cottage: Lucius remembered the pure admiration Dobby held for Harry Potter, and he for the miserable elf, he knew Potter probably wouldn't let this go unanswered.
