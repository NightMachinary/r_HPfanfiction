"Draco, what have you done?" Draco never knew Father to show his temper so wildly, or in such an emotionally confused way. Draco's mask never faltered.

"I suppose that's payback for some of Potter's insolence."

"Draco... How do I explain this..." Father smothered his face in an expression of grief, and what little colour in his cheeks seemed to be gone when he removed his hand. "Draco. That was Dobby, correct?"

"Potter's insane house elf, yeah."

"/Potter's/ house elf, Draco. Do you not understand?"

"What's the big deal? It's just a stupid house elf."

"Draco..." Father shook his head and ventured to the fireplace, grabbing a handful of Floo powder and calling Headmaster Snape's office. Green flame illuminated the Malfoy Manor study.

"Lucius, I am very busy at--"

"Severus, Draco has done something I fear I cannot protect him from."

"Pray tell," Snape drawled, "what has Draco done that could possibly be worse than loosing a group of Death Eaters to run amok in the halls of Hogwarts?"

"He killed Potter's house elf."

"Oh."
