I would like to point out that /in medias res/ is *not* "have a few scenes/a prologue in the future and then start the story from the beginning".

In medias res involves the story starting from the middle with minimal exposition, with the reader having no clue what in the world is going on, slowly piecing together the past using context clues. Flashbacks can be used, but the less of them the better since they can completely break the narrative flow.
