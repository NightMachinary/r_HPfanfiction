The Dark Lord spoke curtly. Two words--an insane command, if it could be interpreted as such. His cracked lips were pulled in a rictus grimace, and he was staring daggers at Draco.

Draco stiffened his upper lip, but looked down at the Dark Lord's chin, then down at his table. He glanced at a young girl that had just joined them. "Miss," he said. Then he gulped and looked down at his hands. "Before," he managed in a quiet voice.

Draco could feel heat from the intensity of the Dark Lord's stare, now. He began to speak. Draco's breath hitched and his heartrate leapt.

"Hit. You've sunk my Battleship."
