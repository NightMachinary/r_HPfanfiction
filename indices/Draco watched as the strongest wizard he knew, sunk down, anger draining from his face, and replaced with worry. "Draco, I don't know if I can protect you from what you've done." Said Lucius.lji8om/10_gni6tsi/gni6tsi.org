1. Draco is possessed by the Riddle diary Horcrux, he fights it off, but not before he's found out to be behind the Petrification of some students.

2. Draco jinxes or pranks Harry in some way before he goes in to the Tri-Wizard First Task enclosure, Harry dies or is grievously wounded.

3. Draco uses his authority as Inquisitorial Squad member to tyrannise students, leading to i.e. a child dying or people leaving the school en-masse, getting Umbridge fired -- essentially he's leaned /too far/ into the role and now he's ruined Umbridge's plans.

4. He retaliates against Harry after the Sectumsempra incident -- he ambushes Harry and takes him to the Dark Lord but everyone knows it was Draco, so he is persona non grata for the rest of his life.
