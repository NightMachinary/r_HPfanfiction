Lucius' shoulders were slumped, his head cradled in his hands, his usually flawless blonde hair in disarray from running his fingers through it so many times.

Draco was beginning to wish he'd never shared his plans with his father.

"Let me make sure I am understanding you perfectly clearly, Draco," said Lucius through gritted teeth. "Of all the ways you could have chosen of displeasing the Dark Lord, you have used this...what did you call it...'whoopee cushion'? Not just a puerile practical joke, but a puerile Muggle practical joke?"

Draco shifted in his seat uncomfortably. "Well, Father, you see, somebody placed one underneath Snape's chair in the Potions dungeon last year, and everyone found it hilarious...perhaps the reason the Dark Lord is so angry all the time is that he needs some levity in his life. I just thought..."

"That is the problem, Draco. You clearly did not just think!" Lucius interrupted. "Go upstairs, now. Begin your packing."

Draco looked at him blankly. "Packing?"

"Yes, packing," said Lucius, finally looking up at his son. His face was a picture of terror. "We are going away, as far as we can. If the Dark Lord ever discovers who placed the cushion, we are as good as dead. I would rather live out my days somewhere where even he cannot find us. Go. Now. I will inform your mother."

As Draco left and ascended to his room, he muttered to himself, "It's only a fart noise. I bet even the Dark Lord laughs when someone lets off."
