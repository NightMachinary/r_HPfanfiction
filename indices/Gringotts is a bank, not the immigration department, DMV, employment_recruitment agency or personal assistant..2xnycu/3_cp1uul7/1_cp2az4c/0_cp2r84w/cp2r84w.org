A fanfic I read a while ago (can't remember which) theorised that the Goblin rebellions were all about the economy and that essentially the Goblins /won/.\\
Gringott's operates the magical world's mint (canon: Galleons etc. have Goblins on them, not wizards) and only banking system.

This actually makes some sense. While we know gold cannot be created without a Philosopher's Stone nothing is preventing wizards from scamming each other (or Muggles) with leprechaun gold or the like, so you'd need a way for the coin of the realm to not be forged.

Goblins have magic (otherwise it makes no sense to /deny/ them wands) so it's not a stretch to say they use their kind of magic to keep Galleons from getting manipulated.\\
Loophole: Hermione's fake order Galleons. Unless these were complete fakes, or a spell on top of them.
