This. The thing to remember about Gringotts is that we don't see any evidence that there are other wizarding banks. The goblins don't need to bend over backwards to keep you happy or make sure that your every whim is "taken care of."

If you have a large amount, they'll probably be nicer to you because they know that you're more likely to take advantage of whatever services they /do/ offer. But they're concerned with maximizing returns and aren't going to do anything beyond what's required to get their hands on as much of your money as possible. They don't care about "customer service" and they don't need loyalty.
