I am guessing that the perceptions of many teens is that if you are very rich, your bank becomes sort of like your personal butler.

Which could be possible if one was the type of client to take advantage of bureaucracy where one or a few people are responsible (inside the bank organization) to try and make sure your large amount of money remains within the bank, by pressuring said responsible employees into being your personal assistants in return for not screwing over the only task set to them.

Except that in HP world, there has never been a mention of any other banks to which a spoiled rich wizard could reasonably threaten to transfer funds.

In fact, most fics that go overboard with services Gringotts provides (usually for Harry) also combine it with going overboard with the size and power of same bank, often making it a worldwide organization and holding a contractual monopoly on banking in Britain and/or the enture wizarding world - entirely missing the part that if the bank actually had that much power, they could make a point of using rich wizards as human toilets, as an add-on to their financial services, and there would be little said rich wizards could do about it as long as their entire fortunes remains hostage.
