Friendly Goblins = directly contradicted by any scene they're in. At best they appear to be /indifferent/ to humans. Just refer to the tone of the article on the Gringott's break-in from PS.

Goblin honour/keeping their word = Contradicted by Book 7. Griphook betrays Harry when he has no reason to (he would have gotten the sword anyway), Harry has even saved his life before.
