One idea I've always stuck by is that the Animagus is a representation of one's soul/magic, becoming an Animagi involves fully manifesting your "inner beast". In this case the Lychanthropy Curse alters an individual to such an extent (or specifically targeting the magic/soul that involves Animagi) that you could not change yourself enough either way.
