I like to think of it as another one of those wacky laws of magic. Easily bent but never actually broken.

For example, we know that magic cannot create food. It's one of the fundamental laws. Yet nothing stops you from /enlarging/ food, maybe even duplicating food. The end result is the same -- you get food from magic -- but you've not violated the fundamental law.

And so a fundamental law of lycanthropy is that humans who survive being bitten by a werewolf gain the disease. But that's the thing, isn't it? When you're an animagus in your animal form, you're not human. You're a cat, or a rat, or a deer, or a dog, or whatever. Since a human didn't survive being bitten by a werewolf, the animagus doesn't get infected by the disease.

I think an animagus in their human form is just as susceptible to lycranthropy as anyone else, and it would likely strip away their ability to transform into their animal self, since werewolves are unable to become animagi.
