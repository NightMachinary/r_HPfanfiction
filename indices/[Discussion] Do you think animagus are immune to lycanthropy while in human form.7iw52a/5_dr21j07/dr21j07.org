Yeah. I had talked to a lot of people over this exact same thing when I was writing my latest chapter of Seasons of the Witch. Harry fought a werewolf while in his animagus form. Ultimately the consensus that I reached was that I had to use the spirit of the law, which means that lycanthopy only affects humans. So, while you can look into it deeper and what it ultimately means to be human, but I really just looked to canon and Sirius and friends could "keep Remus in check" so that's what I used as my baseline for Lycanthopy not effecting animagi.
