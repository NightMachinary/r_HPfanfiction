[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/981332][Before I Knew]] and its companion story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2385353][This Is Where]], looks at the series from the POV of respectively Dean/Seamus and Lavender/Parvati. They're set up as a series of vignettes that look at canon events, and moments between canon events, from the perspective of Dean and Seamus for the first story, Pavati and Lavender for the second.

Fair warning; Both of these evenually involve same-sex relationships... but it's very tastefully done and not explicit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094981/1/To-Know-You-is-to-Love-You][To Know You Is To Love You]] retells the entire series from the POV of Ron and Hermione, but with a twist.

The premise is that Ron and Hermione, a few years after the Battle of Hogwarts, decide to try out couples councelling. In order for them to understand one another better, the councelling has them magically re-live their entire lives up until that point, but from each other's perspective. linkffn(9094981)
