I love a good "books through Lupin's eyes" fic, like linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban)

linkffn(Calibration by The Divine Comedian) shows Remus training the Boggart before his lesson with the third years.

FloreatCastellum, who wrote Not From Others, has written several "the books through other characters' eyes" drabbles, such as [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/186550527216/absolutely-loved-your-recent-remusharry-missing][the Hogwarts Express scene in PoA from Lupin's eyes]], [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/185848257806/hey-have-you-imagined-remus-reaction-to-siriuss][Remus reacts to Sirius' death]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19788034][Ron after Harry's name comes out of the Goblet]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19820686][Ron waits in the stands during the Third Task]]. Her list of ficlets is [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][here]], but I think it's an incomplete list.
