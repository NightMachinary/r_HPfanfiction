I've seen many other fanfics with different nicknames but most stem off of Herm, or Mione. I've seen Mine (idk why but most common), I've seen Hermy which is what Grawp calls her and in some fanfics (to make fun of usually), and in a Krum/Hermione fanfic its My Own, I think the author thought it stemmed of of how Krum pronounces her name is Hermyown.
