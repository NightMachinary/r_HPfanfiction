I've seen Mia which makes no sense if pronounced Mee-uh, and I've seen Mia specifically noted that it's pronounced Maya, which makes a little more sense pronunciation-wise but I don't get why it would be spelled like a different name... I also recall a fic which had her nicknamed Neenee, which makes just as much sense as any other nickname.
