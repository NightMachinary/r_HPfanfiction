That's a sweet description I love it ðŸ˜Š. Thank you. Yeah the bits I read did feel very Philosophers Stone era Potter. Which was a bit of a jump after reading so much like Marauder/First War fics you know? To suddenly have an innocent mystery again.

I'll.go back to it with a new head.

If you like dark fics, linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) I thought was brilliant if you haven't already. A Handmaid's tale inspired story. A lot of mystery and secrets and tension and plot. It was really well written. The characters are a bit OOC I thought but in a good way that fitted them into the story. I would recommend it ðŸ˜Š
