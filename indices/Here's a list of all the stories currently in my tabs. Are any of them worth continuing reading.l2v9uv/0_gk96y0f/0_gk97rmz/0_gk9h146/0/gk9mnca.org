Oh it got me. I read it all at once in a day or two but afterwards I had to read a bunch of agressively fluffy Wolfstar muggle AUs just to cheer myself up again... I don't even like fluff I just needed to read something that was the opposite of cripplingly depressing.

The first arc of Manacled is very dark. You're right it's very invasive and exposing and just harsh... Super interesting though I loved it. Draco was chilling it's great! The second arc from chapter 26 or something is...marginally lighter... It's a little easier to read after that which is something anyway. So you have that to look forward to!

Stick with Manacled. It is worth the read you will enjoy it. And if you need them, I'll send you my happy Remus/Sirius fics where theyre in a band and sappily adorable to balance out the sad ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
