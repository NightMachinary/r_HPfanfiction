Thank u! Yes I tend to read several fics at once. I started manacled I think I'm on chapter 13 but I don't know that one I think I need to read in pieces cause it feels like just a pit of despair at the part I'm at. I have read other fics with ppl being held captive and with assault...I can't put my finger on why but this one bothers me more. Maybe it's the way the mind reading (total look at all her memories and all her thoughts and all her feelings) and the forced pregnancy that feels just so invasive and exposing.
