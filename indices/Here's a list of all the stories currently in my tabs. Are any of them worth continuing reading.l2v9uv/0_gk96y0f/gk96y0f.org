I really liked the SallyAnne one I think the prose is beautiful and the story is really touching. I think Dobby shows a lot of agency and his magic/abilities are valued. I like that it has them in 3rd year and there is no romance. It feels a lot like the first book in tone in that there are lots of details and scenes exploring the magic and history of the castle/wizarding world. And touches on themes of love, friendship, loss, and how children can often solve things because they have more natural curiosity to them.

So I mean I understand everyone looks for dif things in fanfic I often read darker fics where they are older or deal with more mature themes. I also like darker fics and horror and adventure. But I found this worth it for sure and it reminded me a little about how I initially felt coming into the Harry Potter universe back in the 90s.
