I like several of those fics, but if they aren't for you, they aren't for you. There's too much fic out there to force yourself to read something you've forgotten.

The first two you mention are both quite long, and both follow a plot so standard that it's not really about the plot. Against the Moon is Marauders growing up; Bureaucratic Error is time travel Peggy Sue. Sometimes in those situations I'll read a few chapters out of the middle at random. If the character interactions grab you, keep going. If not, delete the tab.
