  *The Beurocratic Error* :: it kept being recced but I can't seem to get past the second chapter...

Personally, I really enjoyed it. I was a little wary at first since the summary gave me the impression it's all about Remus, and I don't really like him, but I gave it a try and it's good. There are some problems, but that's the case with all fics. The author spends quite some time with Sirius and tries to get into Sirius' head post-Azkaban, PTSD and grief which I feel many fics ignore completely.

  *The Strange Dissapearence of Sally Anne Perks* :: I think I got a bit bored of this? Is it worth cracking on with it?
#+end_quote

I think it took me a few years before I decided to read this fic. I saw it recommended everywhere, but I just couldn't get into it until one day, I was in the right mood, and I consumed it in a few hours. It's pretty short, only 10 or 11 chapters if I remember correctly, and quite enjoyable. Harry and Hermione solving the mystery of Sally Anne Perks was a nice change.
