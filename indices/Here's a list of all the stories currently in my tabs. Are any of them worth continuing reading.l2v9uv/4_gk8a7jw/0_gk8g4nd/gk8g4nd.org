I suppose im a big adventure person? Heroes battle the odds to save the day, that crap but I'll read anything. I'm assuming something in these tickled me if I opened them in the first place. I just don't remember what that is.

I'll give the Eyes another go so. But I might wait till im in the mood to properly concentrate on the story.

I really like Remus/Sirius so I'll keep Red as Hearts open and give B.E another whack. Im not far into it so my opinion isnt valid here but I think Remus being weirdly casual about losing his son and family is throwing me right now. He seems too happy and not at all confused about the fact he has timetravelled which... is an odd tone... But again, its probably to early for me to tell.

The other three I might bookmark so on your recs. I can't keep everything open its clogging my browser and my brain and driving me nuts!
