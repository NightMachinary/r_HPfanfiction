What kind of things do you normally enjoy? If you're only into Draco-Snape coffeeshop AUs, then you're not going to like any of those fics.

Haven't read Against the Moon or Miles Brand, so I can't speak to them personally.

The Eyes is one of my favourite fics and I adore cosmic horror in general, so I'm heavily biased in favour of this. If you're not into the weird, esoteric "It was indescribable and squamous and his mind snapped instantly!" type vibe of horror, it probably won't be for you.

Bureaucratic Error is a pretty solid time-travel fic with lots of Remus-Sirius interactions. Didn't find much particularly notable about it myself, but it's a solid fic if you're into that kind of content.

Strange Disappearance is pretty well written and I'd say it's worth reading at least once, but again, not an overly striking fic (IMO, your mileage may vary). I enjoyed it overall, but it's not a fic I'd chomp at the bit to reread.

As Red as Hearts and Autumn is pretty much just Marauder's scenes and Black Family drama (with some interesting background) that Sirius later introspects and mopes over. Some interesting plot ideas though, I found it worth reading.
