Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13314997/1/Five-Istari-and-Four-Warlocks]]) It has MoD! and op!Harry, but god is it good. It's a sequel to linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13206329/1/Through-the-Veil]]) You don't have to read the first one, but it does help. While the first one doesn't start out strong, it becomes so much better after about the midpoint.
