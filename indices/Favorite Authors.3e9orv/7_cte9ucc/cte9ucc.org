These people are on ffn.

I really like *Shayalonnie*. First thing of theirs I read was The Debt of Time. She recently finished Presque Toujours Pur, which I also loved. Debt was extremely long, and I felt like for its length, it stayed steady instead of suddenly becoming rough or lower quality, which I've run into plenty. I follow her on Tumblr, and I believe that's how I found the next author.

*Provocative Envy*. I was told to read her story Nightmare (Riddle/Hermione time travel, it was the first time I had read that pairing). She's got a thing for rare pairs, I know some of her stuff goes up on Tumblr, I don't know how much of it goes onto FFN (but I do recommend following her on Tumblr for short rare pair fics/situations, she's hilarious).

*Resa Aureus*. Author of 'The Last Marauder' and 'The Trick of Time.' I didn't actually realize both of those were the same author until I was partway through Trick and something about the style felt familiar. (I put fics on my kindle so the author usually isn't showing). I think her quality stays pretty consistent between stories.

*Whydoyouneedtoknow*. Author of the 'Dangerverse.' Some people don't like her style or some things she used when writing her series, but I felt like she was consistent throughout with both style, quality, and enjoyability. I binge read the series just as the last one was finishing up.
