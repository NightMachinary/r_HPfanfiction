I don't have any big name favorite authors. Most of them write one or two stories that I like and then they stop or start writing stuff I don't feel like reading.

My favorite authors are the new people with 5 reviews. They spent the time and had the courage to put something online for others to judge. Occasionally there is a gem hidden in that pile of average and it makes my genuinely sad when lesser known good stories vanish.
