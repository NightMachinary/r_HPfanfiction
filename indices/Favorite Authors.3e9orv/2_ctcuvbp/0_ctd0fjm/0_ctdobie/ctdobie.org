I sometimes think of taking down OBWL. I hate reading it. The errors and inconsistency make me want to dig a hole of shame and stick my head into it, yelling LALALA as I fight through the cringe worthy dialogue.

But when I'm feeling down about my writing or I think something I'm currently writing is shit, I can look back at OBWL and use it as a measure of my growth. Whatever I write now can't be as bad as some passages in OBWL. Also, some people still like it, so I must have done some things right with it.
