I'm sure it probably turns into something fine and I doubt I could do much better, but the parts I read just aren't all together. I never saw a point in taking down fics, especially popular ones. There was this one Naruto fic, it was pretty good, but abandoned, then the author came back and instead of updating it, they changed the entire thing into some weird prologue thing of some sorts and there was only that remaining (the favorites and stuff were still there so it was the same story) and none of the previous story and then never updated it after that.

How is the new chapter of Battle School coming along? It was pretty cool how you updated right as I got towards the end of what's currently out last time, but it's been over that whole estimated release time (I'm not rushing you or anything, it's just that you bother to put that).
