I just tried his other main fic besides Battle School and it didn't quite do it for me. The writing was a lot more awkward and rundundant and in the first few chapters you get things like Hermoine mentioning something about Neville being stubburn and then Harry looking at her and thinking that she's "no doubt thinking of a time when Neville was stubborn"

In Battle School, I really like their rivalry and everything in general is quite interesting.
