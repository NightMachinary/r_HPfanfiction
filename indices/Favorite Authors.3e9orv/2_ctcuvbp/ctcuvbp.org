KwanLi... Love that guy's stuff, mostly because of writing quality but also because of the (I can't think of the word, sorry :/) way his plots tend to draw you in. Probably doesn't help that my all time favourite ship is H/Hr either.

Ruskbyte was really good back when they used to write stories. Rorschach's Blot is good too.

But they're the main ones I can think of off the top of my head.
