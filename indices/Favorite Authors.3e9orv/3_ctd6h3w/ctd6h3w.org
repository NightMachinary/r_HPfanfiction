Inverarity /(Alexandra Quick; Hogwarts Houses Divided)/ is a truly fantastic author. His writing is always incredibly consistent and well-plotted.

The Mad Mad Reviewer /(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen; Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch)/ is a fantastic author and his stuff always has a fair amount of clever humour in it. Sadly, I think his account's gone dormant, as he says he's currently focussing on his original fiction.

Picasribit is consistently fantastic as well. He focusses mostly on R/S fics, though, if you're not into that sort of thing.
