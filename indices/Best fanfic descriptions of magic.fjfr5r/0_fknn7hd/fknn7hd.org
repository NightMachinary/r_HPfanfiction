That fic indeed has some beautiful depictions of magic - even though I don't /really/ agree with the idea behind it (the generalist one on display for Dumbledore doesn't exactly sit right with me from that duel), but it's absolutely top notch.

I'm also quite partial to AngelaStarCat's descriptions of magic in "Blindness" and "With Strength of Steel Wings".
