I disagree, on both the quality of the fic and the quality of the magical system depicted within the fic.

On the topic of the magic, I think the quantification of magic detracts from the experience. The wonder of magic is both in its logic and in its illogic. Magic has to make sense for a story to succeed but part of the wonder of the magic in Harry Potter is the illogical aspects, the mystical haze around its workings, and the awe of those who can use it skillfully. The pseudo-science detracts rather than adds to the fic. It doesn't even work for the fic. The "energy" of magic clashes with conceptual based magic used elsewhere throughout the fic. The most powerful wizard, Voldemort, is said to only be able to take on five aurors before losing (having gone through many powerboosting rituals). This makes no sense for the world in the story. It shows wizards like Voldemort, Dumbledore, and "Lord Slytherin" having the ability to defy the ministry and the masses without any ability to back it up.

Other downsides to the story other than a magical system that does not even work for the story? The grooming. A good summary of what happens with Ginny is "Man manipulates child into loving him and also turns said child into a weapon while portraying the parent's concerns as irrational because...wrong boy who lived". It's been a while, but didn't she even drink a potion to make her hate the other twin?
