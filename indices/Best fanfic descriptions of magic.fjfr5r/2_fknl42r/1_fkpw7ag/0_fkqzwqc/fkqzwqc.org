- Eh, I like there to be some explanation on how the magic works instead of author fiat. It's a good way to show growth instead of "I practiced a spell." It's a great equalizer. People have different starting points, but with enough work, anyone can be powerful.
- The Voldemort and five auror thing gets to me too. It makes a weird bit of sense that a properly geared and trained group of people can overcome one person instead of them being a god-like entity. It doesn't mesh well with Harry Potter though, even though the god-like entity part irritates me there.
- The Ginny thing is complex-ish.

  - She wanted to go combat, since she didn't have a niche when everyone else did.
  - There was grooming, but more for being chesspiece useful sort(he switches back and forth between jaded old man and kid that never lived).
  - Her parents concerns /at first/ were irrational. "On the say so of a child, we're going to mind-rape and veritaserum our daughter."
  - She was getting mad at the mixed feelings for the other brother and asked for the potion herself.
  - If you want grooming, look at Hermione. That was straight up grooming there.

I'm mainly reading this story for the political machinations and drama. The manipulative Dumbledore with believable reasons for the whole schtick instead of "Because I'm an evil arsehole" is icing on the cake.
