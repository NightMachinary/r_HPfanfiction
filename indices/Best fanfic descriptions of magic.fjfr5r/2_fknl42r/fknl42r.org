By magical theory, do you mean how magic works?

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][link]]

There's no magical cores. There's two units of measurement: The Flamel and the Merlin. The former is how fast you can channel magic, and the latter is a unit of measure. I guess in order to nerf magic (IE not making people have unlimited reserves of spamming power), there's something called toxins. You use your magic, convert magic from the atmosphere to your magic, which introduces toxins. These have to fade, otherwise the conversion goes all wonky or something. Ritual are heavy duty involved too. Historically, Divination wasn't as useless as it is now.

Severe AU. It goes heavy into politics, pureblood stuff (traditions, family magics, etc), and what being a Light/Dark/Gray Lord actually mean.

ALSO! WBWL. Dumbledore may be an antagonist, but he has his own reasons to do it. Those reasons aren't shown for a while, but they are. And they are believable.

The major downside to this fic is that they are still in the second year...
