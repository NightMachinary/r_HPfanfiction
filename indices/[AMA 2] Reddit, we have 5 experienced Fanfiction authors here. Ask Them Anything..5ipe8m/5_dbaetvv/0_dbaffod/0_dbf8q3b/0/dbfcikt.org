Well, in a sense, I am a professional writer. I do freelance ghost writing. So I am paid to write >.>. It is; however, not my full time job and just something I started doing while paying off the student loans.

I do have plans for a few original novels mostly complete and will probably shift my focus onto those in the coming years. Mostly it's just a matter of time. Writing takes forever and I'm hoping that as the loans disappear I can shift the focus from ghosting to working on original pieces.
