I don't think I try to emulate him, because there have been a lot of Hemingway imitators, and very few of them, if any, were successful. But I draw a massive amount of inspiration from Hemingway, even to the point where a lot of my fics draw on similar themes to his books.

Other authors who influenced me range from Mary Shelley, to Dostoevsky, to Ian Flemming, to Hunter S. Thompson. Too diverse to emulate all of them, and if I did one of them, I feel like I'd be doing a really poor job of it.
