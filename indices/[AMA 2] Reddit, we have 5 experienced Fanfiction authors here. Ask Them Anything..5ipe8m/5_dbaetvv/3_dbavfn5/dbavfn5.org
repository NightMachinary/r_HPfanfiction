Emulate? Not really.

However there are a few I absolutely love to read and therefore take some parts with me into my own writing. Steelbadger, for one, is such an author I read pretty much everything from. Stargon1 falls into the same category, just as Darth Marrs, Tsu Doh Nimh and The Santi. I couldn't put a finger on why, but all of those authors have an easy time catching my attention.
