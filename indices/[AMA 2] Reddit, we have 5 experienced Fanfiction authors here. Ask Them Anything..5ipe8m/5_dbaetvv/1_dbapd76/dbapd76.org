I don't really try to write like anyone. Sometimes I will be in the middle of a book and look at a passage and admire how beautifully it was written and wish I could come up with such things as easily, but I don't think I ever sat down and tried to write like a specific author. I have done small writing exercises here and there to try and develop better writing skills.
