Hey, thanks! It means a lot to know people like my fics.

I'm actually not much of a ff reader, or at least, I'm not as much as I used to be, so almost all of my recommendations are going to be old or well known ones like A Black Comedy for regular HP fics or The Black Prince for x-overs, rather than deep cuts. I could recommend a whole bunch of original stuff if you'd like.

As for your question, I try to write chronologically, and generally, to avoid being info-dumpy, I try to do a lot of implication: Since we're working with a world that our readers are most likely familiar with, we re-introduce concepts in a way that doesn't treat them like an idiot. When you rewrite concepts that the readers know in a wordy manner, it bores them to tears and gives them no incentive to keep reading.

So any canon concepts or background should be implied by the writing, and maybe touched upon, but never lengthily discussed. Instead, try to give the reader an immediate narrative hook: a funny conversation, Harry (or whoever your protagonist is) in an unfamiliar situation to people who've only known him from canon, etc. I think that does a better job of drawing the reader in without wordy or overly-explanatory.

Hope that helps!
