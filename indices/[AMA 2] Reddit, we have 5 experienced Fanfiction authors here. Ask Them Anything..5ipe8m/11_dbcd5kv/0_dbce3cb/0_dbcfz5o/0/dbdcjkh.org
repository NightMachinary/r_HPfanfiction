No problem, I'm really excited to be answering the questions. It's a lot of fun/ I'm really thankful that I have questions to answer. My outline says 20 more chapters, but it's honestly going to be probably more than that. I've noticed that some chapters that I outline end up being more like three chapters and I've decided to add more things in about Graham and Wamil. This fic will end on Graces birthday.
