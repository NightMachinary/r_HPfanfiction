Oh I'm sorry I didn't see another comment. What was the question/ comment?

Hmmm of the top of my head I can't remember them. I know he's stopped some big ones, but I can't for the life of me remember what they were. He ripped them away too fast. I know in my authors notes I mentioned it when it happened I just don't remember what it was. Oh now I remember one! I was going to have them go to an amusement park in February! Which he pointed out would not be possible it was way too cold. I'm so glad he told me though because I feel like them going to the house for Valentine's Day was more meaningful.

He's very good at making sure I keep them in character too like reminding me when Graces wouldn't know a phrase because she's a pure blood and wouldn't know a muggle phrase. I also a month ago brought up an idea for a character death, that I wasn't originally planning. And he told me to wait a week before making the decision. It was a very rainy week. ( I have decided to kill off the character though)

I have a lot of deleted scenes hahaha. Sometimes I write chapters in different ways then choose the parts I like and morph them together. And sometimes I don't finish scenes because it's not needed and this fic is already so long. If I start a scene and then realize it doesn't serve any purpose in my writing I will sometimes just stop or delete it.

My husband doesn't read it. He's very busy, so I understand. He's started it a few times here and there, but he's just too busy. He's in med school currently so his time is very limited and when he does have free time he spends it with me. He's always known about my writing and though he doesn't read my fic he knows about every chapter. I talk to him a lot about my fic, he knows everything. Including the ending. He's very supportive. He may not be able to have the time to actually read my fic, but he's always asking me how the story is progressing and talking to me about it.
