[[/u/grace644]] I wrote a comment, but maybe you missed it or don't want to answer xD You mentioned one of comment, that you almost made some big mistakes. Can you write some examples? Do you have some "deleted scenes"? Does your husband read your story? When did you tell him about your story or he knew it since the beginning?
