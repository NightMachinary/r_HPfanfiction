Well... we're going right into spoiler territory here.

The spoiler free version would be: you'll see... eventually.

Here is with spoilers: [[/spoiler][FEV is a forced evolutionary virus. Through the atomic war, not only did some areas of the world become radiated death zones, but there are also areas of the world enriched with fluctuating magic, harmful to those without it. The FEV would react to those areas, creating mutations that allow creatures like Super Mutants to develop magic resistant skin, much like that of dragons. In the story there is a very early hint as to how that fact is used.]]
