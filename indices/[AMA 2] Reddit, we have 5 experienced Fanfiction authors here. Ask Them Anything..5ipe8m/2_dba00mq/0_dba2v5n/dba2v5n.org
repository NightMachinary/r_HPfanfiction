No. Emily Riddle was always Emily Riddle. The potion was botched, in a sense, but not in a way that affected her gender. Wormtail's incompetence and her insistence on the masculine pronouns will be touched upon far more in more detail later in the story. As will the most commonly asked question; the shade in the Chamber of Secrets, which was still male. I can't really say otherwise without getting into fairly big spoiler territory so I'm going to avoid that. I can say that the 'when' is crucially important to the reasons.

Two: I actually do use breaks in the documents I type up. They upload right but since I mostly use additional spaces and not god awful ugly lines they don't show properly on ff.net's page. Having never actually read any of my own stuff on ff.net I didn't quite realize how it formatted. Upcoming chapters, since the specific splits will become more important coming up, will have some hideous form of line break.

That or I'm just going to half the lengths and make the story twice as many chapters. Haven't decided yet. But I like the thematic presentation with a Harry perspective and a Voldemort perspective in each chapter.
