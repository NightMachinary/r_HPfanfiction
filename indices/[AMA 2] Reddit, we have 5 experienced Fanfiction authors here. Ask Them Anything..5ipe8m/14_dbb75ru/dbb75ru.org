[[/u/TE7][u/TE7]]

Does Emily have a certain amount of gender dysphoria? Or is her desire for gender ambiguity purely a by product of her desire to dominate and control in a world traditionally run by men? Or am I massively missing the mark in both instances?

I get the feeling she's had to put up with a whole bunch of crap that male Voldy never did. Snape's attempt to undermine her, Crouch's purposeful botching of the ritual to 'make her the way he thinks she should be', etc.

Will this be explored more? Personally, I find it the most fascinating part of the whole fic so far.

Love the fic, btw.
