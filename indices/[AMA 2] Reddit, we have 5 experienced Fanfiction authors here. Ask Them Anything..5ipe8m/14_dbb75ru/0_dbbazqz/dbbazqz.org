i wouldn't call it dysphoria. As Dysphoria implies she wishes she was male. Which she doesn't. She does have to put up with a lot of things that Tom Riddle would have never had to deal with. And that is certainly going to be explored in greater detail.

At the same time, does she think that certain things would have been considerably easier if she was male? Yes. Yes she does. She forces them into the masculine pronouns as a form of dominance. The same reason behind the branding, mostly. To her, it's just another form of control

A large portion of the upcoming chapters involve 1944-1957 Emily Riddle. And I'll say that I find a villain who is just evil because villain to be a very boring concept. So there's a great deal that must be developed here.

I've already had her claim, and I will say readers should take everything she says to Harry with a grain of salt, to Harry that she isn't so much interested in Pureblood superiority as she is Magical Superiority vs Muggle Superiority. And that is a large chunk of hat will be explored in the story.

I find the 'If I was a Man!' female Villain to be boring through. So she's never going to use that aloud as an excuse. But she did grow up during a very interesting time in the Muggle World. Especially in London.
