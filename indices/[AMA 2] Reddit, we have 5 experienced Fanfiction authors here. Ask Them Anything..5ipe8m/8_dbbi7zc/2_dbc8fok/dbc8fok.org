Having an easy word goal. I set my low limit on 500 words a day. Its doable even if I'm tired or not entirely motivated. But motivation is a fickle ally, discipline is much more reliable. And every time Scrivener tells me I got my goal done, I'm stopping (or continuing) with a good feeling of accomplishment.

But that mostly counts for my original novel. With my fanfictions, the way I don't burn out my desire to write is writing whatever I feel like, which fills my hard drive up with /a lot/ of "Chapter1-s". It makes for impossible upload schedules (sorry, btw), but if I wouldn't do it like that I wouldn't write fanfiction at all.
