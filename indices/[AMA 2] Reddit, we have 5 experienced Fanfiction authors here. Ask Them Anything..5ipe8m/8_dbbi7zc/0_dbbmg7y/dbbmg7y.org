I planned for a year before I started updating. Each chapter has been outlined and planned out before I began writing. That really has helped me. It's like a road map. I stop sometimes, take detours and explore other areas, but in the end I know where I'm going. I also don't pressure myself to post a chapter. I just focus on making sure I'm writing every week. I really love writing so I don't feel burned out in the least. This is something that brings me joy. Even when I'm writing a chapter that I'm having difficulty with it's stressful but a good stressful if that makes sense.
