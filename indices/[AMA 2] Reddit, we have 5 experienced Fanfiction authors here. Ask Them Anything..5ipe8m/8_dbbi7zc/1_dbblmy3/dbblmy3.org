This might be one of those question where you don't get a real consensus on the answer, because everyone is wildly different. Case in point, the way I attempt to keep from burning out on a fic is to /not/ plan ahead too much. Writing is as much an adventure for me as it's supposed to be for the readers: the second I know everything that's going to happen in a story is the second I lose interest in putting it to paper. Of course, I'm not advocating a complete lack of planning, but allow yourself some wiggle-room, writing something on-rails can get real stale, real fast.
