Unfortunately, I have no daily ritual. I write if and when I have inspiration to write, which can range from hours to days or even weeks between sessions. So, there are plenty days that I can write in the evening after work, and all familial obligations are done with, that I just don't do so because I can't be arsed to. I realise that sounds pretty bad, but it's just as likely that I'll not be able to sleep that night, get up, and write 3000 words at 3 AM. And it's almost certainly for the best: whenever I write without the inspiration to do so, the product takes a serious turn for the worse and I almost always end up binning whatever rubbish I've written.

I'm certain that sort of flakiness annoys the shit out of my readers, but I'm not one much for those types of rituals, and if I set daily limits to try and keep with, I just end up hating whatever I'm writing at that moment.
