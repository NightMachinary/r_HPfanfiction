A question to all from a curious soul:

Please, describe a normal day of your life when you can do some writing; I'm curious about how do you fit this hobby with other life stuff that we all have to deal with (e.g. jobs, college/uni; partners/family/children; cooking/shopping; etc.); do you have any special rituals when it comes to writing?
