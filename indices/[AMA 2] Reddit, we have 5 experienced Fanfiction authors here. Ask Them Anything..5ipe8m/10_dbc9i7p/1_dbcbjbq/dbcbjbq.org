I usually get up around 7, go to work, get home at ~5pm, get something to eat and then write, play some game or whatever else strikes my fancy at the moment. I write on average for about an hour or until I got my 500 word minimum done. If I'm motivated I continue, but my friends tend to come online then and playing some Civilization or DayZ with them is the better way to end the day, honestly. Weekends are almost exclusively for friends/family/household stuff, so I barely do any writing then (with the exception of some occasional hangover writing binges, as seen on this subreddit).

Rituals... well, I tend to drink either 2 fingers of whiskey, a pint of beer, or a glass of wine during writing. I love eating & drinking good stuff and I love writing. Those two tend to go well with each other.
