Up at six to head to day job. Home around five usually. I do a great deal of freelance ghost writing as well, so I'll check to see if there's anything active that I can make a quick buck on the side with. If I'm super tired some FFXIV or Overwatch. If I'm not I'll sit down and write a thousand words or so. Nothing really ritualistic about it, just when I'm alert enough and have a moment.
