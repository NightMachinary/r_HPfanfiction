Usually, I write on the weekends when I don't work. My husband and I live downtown so there's a lot of restaurants and coffee shops near by. We get up and walk to this adorable cafe where they have great coffee and wine. And we sit there for hours. I write the whole time, and he studies (he's in med-school so he's constantly studying, but on days I want to write we do this together). When I write on days I work I usually get up at 5:30 work out, go to work from 8-5, come home cook dinner, have dinner with my husband, we may watch a show together after if he has time to break away from studying or doesn't have to go to the hospital, and then after that I'll write until 10. I don't get to write everyday, I'm pretty busy a lot of the time and if my husband isn't busy then I obviously want to spend my time with him so we go out or meet up with friends. But I make sure I'm having quality writing time at least once a week. So once a week I make sure I have time to sit down for at least three hours to write with no distractions. Just my laptop, note books, some music, and wine or caffeine.
