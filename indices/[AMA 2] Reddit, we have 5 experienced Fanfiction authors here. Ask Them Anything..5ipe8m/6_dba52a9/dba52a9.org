[[/u/SoulxxBondz][u/SoulxxBondz]] I don't intend to belittle; rather pose a question to all of you. (You being everyone who reads FanFiction..) Why do you enjoy stories which have one character paired against many? Is it entirely sexual in nature? Is it due to indecisiveness? Or do you just like the idea of it? I don't find it wrong, not in the sense of someone deeply ingratiated in religion, yet personally would prefer myself dedicated to a single individual -would you? Perhaps it is selfishness or some such romantic inclination; still, I cannot help wondering how the rest of the community feels...
