I'm currently reading Brandon Sanderson's "The Way of Kings", but in the past year, I've finished Neuromancer, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Death of Ivan Illyich, Doctor Zhivago, and I've been re-reading Sapkowski's Witcher series (mostly to aid my crossover between it and HP), as well as Thomas Bernhard's Gargoyles.
