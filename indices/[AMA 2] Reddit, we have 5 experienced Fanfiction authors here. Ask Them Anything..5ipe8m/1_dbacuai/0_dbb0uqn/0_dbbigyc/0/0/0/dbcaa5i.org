If you mean the fan-translated versions of books in the canon series, like Season of Storms, or others, then yes. The fan-translated versions of Season of Storms and Lady of the Lake were the ones I read first since Lady of the Lake took forever to translate to English and SoS is still doesn't have an official copy. But other stuff, like the story about Geralt's mother and father or the non-canon one about Geralt and Yen's wedding have proven almost impossible to find, so I've not read them.
