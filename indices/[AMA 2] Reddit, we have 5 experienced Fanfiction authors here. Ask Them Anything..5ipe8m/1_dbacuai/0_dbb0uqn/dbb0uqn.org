Probably A Black Comedy for me, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I haven't been a regular reader of fanfiction, like [[/u/TE7]] for years. There's probably quite a few fics out there that I'd like more, but I've been making a conscious effort to read more original fiction, which leaves me little to no time for FF when balanced with my own writing.
