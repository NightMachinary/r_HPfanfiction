I really just love the Sacrifices Arc series by Lightning on Wave. It was one of the first fanfics I ever read too. The funny thing was I didn't know about drarry at the time, and I guess it took me a while to catch on cause it wasn't until the 4th installment when I realized that Harry and Draco were going to get together. It's definitely my favorite though. I'm actually rereading it now.
