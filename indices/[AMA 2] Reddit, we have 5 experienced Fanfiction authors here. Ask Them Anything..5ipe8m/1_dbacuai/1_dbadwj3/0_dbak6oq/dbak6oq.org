I now get why your writing feels so refreshing - you have very little exposure to HP tropes.

Keep not reading I guess :P

Two questions:

a) Are we going to see an update of The Dark in Peace in the forseeable future?

b) Can you tell us a bit about your method of developing characterization? I always get the feeling that your characters are vibrant and dynamic, almost alive, in a sense. Is characterization fully organic and spontaneous for you, or are there techniques you use to develop them? Or something else entirely?
