Fordeable future? No. I was going to finish DiP after I finished Vitam Paramus but then I was conned into writing something with a female villain. So I came up with LdS. It also means I'll have fics set in 4th, 5th, 6th year which seemed like a nice trifecta. I intend to return to it at some point. That point just never really seems to come.

As for characterization. That's a harder question. I do a ton of planning so I know before I even start writing just what their purpose is and how they get there. So I think that helps.

Other than that I guess I just try to make them like people. Give them vices and motives and make them act how people act. I want the average person to think that it wouldn't be bad to join say Vitam Paramus's Harry and Titus for a beer. It's a matter of showing good traits and bad and creating empathy in my mind
