It will involve the trio more. I don't think I could avoid that haha I'm excited for that to come a long. It's going to happen in the second and third book. It took over a year to get the plot line for the first and the second and third are already pretty much planned out. Just need to add more details here and there. My beta actually asked to see the timeline the other month, before he chose to be more in the dark haha I think he was glad he had a beer in hand when he saw it. There's still just so much to write! I feel I'm more motivated in writing now than before. Love is the real motivation I love writing this fic. I've found I just love writing. I never wrote anything before I started this. It's been a real eye opener for me.

My biggest inspiration is JK Rowling and Sarah Maas. I just think their both amazing authors and amazing women. I really hope one day to write my own books, and I feel like writing fan fic helps me improve my writing.

[[/u/denarii]] was not the headmaster at the time. He wasn't a mod either. That all came later. I posted my fic, I had just put up the first 6 chapters and he offered to beta for me. And I'm so glad he did, he's awesome. We've grown pretty close over the years. He even flew across the country to attend my wedding. I'm horrible with grammar, with out him my fic would be a serious mess. He also lets me bounce ideas off him. He's stopped me from making some big mistakes as well. I think what I like the most about him as my beta is he doesn't push me to change things he's very good about not taking my reigns as a writer, but every once in a while he warns me about a cliff up a head and gets me to slow down and think something through. Or notice a jagged rock and pause to fix my mistake. My friend Aleah also is a huge help. She doesn't like Harry Potter, but she's super supportive of my writing and we often talk about my characters and when I get stuck on a chapter that I decided to add in or a plot I want to explore more she will sit on the phone with me while I think it through and give me loads of questions to think about so that there are no plot holes. Or when I can't seem to like the chapter I had originally outlined I usually will write that chapter in two or three versions and she will read all and help me piece together the best of those versions. Mdman1 is still a new beta for me, but he's been really helpful as well.

Main events will stay the same in the plot line, but there will be some big changes from canon. Certain people will live that had died etc. haha I don't know if I will change other pairings though. Still deciding on that one actually.
