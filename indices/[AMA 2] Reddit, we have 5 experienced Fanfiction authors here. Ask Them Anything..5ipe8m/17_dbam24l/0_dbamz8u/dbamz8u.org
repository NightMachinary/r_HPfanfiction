  In The Ilvermorny Champion (Which ironically has won the Best American Harry Potter Fiction Award in the GryffindorTom Online "Gryffie Awards"), you mention that Fleamont was a bit of a anti-Muggleborn. What is your view on his wife, Euphemia and his (Storyline) son Charlus and their views on Muggleborns.

First off, wow, I totally did not know I won an award for the story. THANKS!!!

I suppose I don't have much of a view for Fleamont at all, other than I have a severe dislike for his name. He was just a cameo in my story for a portrait. Maybe I'll flesh it out further in the story, but I don't know the answer to this yet.

  Also, in Harem War, you mention that Ron is having Pansy and her cousin as his concubines. Where do you anticipate going with them? Will he use them in the later battle against the Crestview Alliance?

They're going to be used for his get-rich-quick scheme, and his plans definitely aren't nice. Er... I don't know if he'll use them as soldiers, or not. It is a good idea.
