[[/u/SoulxxBondz]] a couple of questions for you.

In The Ilvermorny Champion (Which ironically has won the Best American Harry Potter Fiction Award in the GryffindorTom Online "Gryffie Awards"), you mention that Fleamont was a bit of a anti-Muggleborn. What is your view on his wife, Euphemia and his (Storyline) son Charlus and their views on Muggleborns.

Also, in Harem War, you mention that Ron is having Pansy and her cousin as his concubines. Where do you anticipate going with them? Will he use them in the later battle against the Crestview Alliance?
