I want to orient me on fantasy authors, such as G.R.R. Martin, Tolkien and Sir Terry Pratchett, but I doubt my English writing reflects that much. I'm good enough, but it is evident that its not my native language. My own writing I would place somewhere between "meh" to "not too bad". But I can't say if that is a realistic view.
