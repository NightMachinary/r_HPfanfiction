I honestly don't really think about what my writing style is. I just write. I don't have any focus on what style I want it to be, or who I want to write like. I just try to make the audience feel what my characters are going through. Or understand why they are acting in a certain way. So when I write I spend a lot time focusing on character development. I don't want to tell you someone is sad, I want you to read the paragraph before and know that what just happened had to have crushed my character despite it not being something that would crush anyone else. And I want you to know because you've read enough about my character that she feels real to you and you can have a sense of her.

I know how I want to write, but I can't honestly say where I am at in regards to it. I don't believe I'll ever think I'm exactly where I want to be, but I do know I'm improving. With every chapter I feel like I get better. I'm sorry I feel like I've given you a poor answer. I suppose the simplest is I write and if elements of writing styles such as post modernism etc. creep in they weren't put there intentionally and I don't focus on thinking about the fact that certain writing elements slip in. I just write to further my story and bring understanding to my characters.
