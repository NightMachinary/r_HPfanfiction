I think I'm some type of odd hybrid of Realism, Modernism and Post-Modernism depending on my mood, if we're discussing literary theory.

I like to think that I write with sort of hybrid of the Realist school and the Modernist school. I tend to depict the banal fairly often, and I try to then lead that into subversion of troupes. A whole lot of this probably doesn't seep into Fanfiction. I'd say my fanfiction tends to fall more into the 'Realism' category, especially with Quiddithc World Cup and Vitam Paramus. But Princess is far more of a Modernist work.
