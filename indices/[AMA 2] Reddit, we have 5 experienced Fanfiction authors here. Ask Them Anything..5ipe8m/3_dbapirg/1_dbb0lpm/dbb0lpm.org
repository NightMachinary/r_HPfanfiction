To be honest, I have no earthly idea what my writing style is. I guess I'm generally dialogue-heavy to action-heavy, but that changes from fic to fix and scene to scene. The fic I've put up as my 'fic to read' is a sort of standard fantasy affair with twists on the genre, but my other fics often rely on unreliable narrators and characters with confusing, almost contradictory goals and beliefs. So, I guess that puts me squarely in the postmodern camp.
