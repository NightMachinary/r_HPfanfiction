I understand no problem. I don't think you could have worded that better.

I can't see Draco dating in this fic. You will find out more reasons why in the second fic, but for now his main reason is his obligation to his family and trying to ensure they survive. Later he has much more obligations and stress. Draco, unfortunately, carried the weight of the world on his shoulders. He's scared and unsure of himself. He doesn't have time to really seek out a relationship. I will say though that if he survives the war and if Graces does too she would want him to find someone. I don't think she would take on any jealousies she would be very happy to see her brother married well and having the comfort of someone else by his side. Especially with all that they are going to go through in the second fic. She's going to want her brother to be happy.

I made up Graces in May of 2012. I specifically remember making her up in the last month of College. And I just started writing things about her, and slowly coming up with the idea for the fic. Then I sat down and made my outline for the fic and wrote out each chapter number and what would happen in that chapter. Then I wrote the first I think 27 or 30 chapters? I can't remember off the top of my head. And started looking for a beta and then started posting chapters in October of 2013. It's been a very long process, but I love it.
