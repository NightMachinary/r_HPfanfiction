I knew at the time Hannah was paired with Neville. I had them go on a date as a little nod of acknowledgement. I didn't feel Hannah and Neville was a good match though for many reasons. I think Neville could have a happy and comfortable life with Hannah, but I wanted something else for him in this. I wanted him to grow and for him to help someone else grow. A couple that makes the other one better that pushes the other outside their comfort zones and makes them improve.

I can imagine Neville as a placid partner with Hannah. He can't be that Graces. Graces is one too wrong a lot of the time as we can see with her ideas about the world and muggle borns and two way too demanding. I mean there is a point where enough is enough and because Graces is all about her way it forces Neville to have a firmer voice in demanding his way as well. Both Neville and Graces have some flaws in their personality and both of them could learn from one another. Neville's life with Graces would be harder, but it would also be better. And the same stands for Graces. If they get a happily ever after ( which I won't say yet if they will there are still many factors that could ruin that for them ) they would be very madly in love and have a very good life that neither could have ever expected. Great question by the way! I loved it.
