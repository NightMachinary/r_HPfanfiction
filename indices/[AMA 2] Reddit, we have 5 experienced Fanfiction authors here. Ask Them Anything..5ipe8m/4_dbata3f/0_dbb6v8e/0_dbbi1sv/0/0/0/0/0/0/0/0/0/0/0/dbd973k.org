I actually like Ron and Hermione as a pairing. Ron has always in the books stood up for Hermione. We saw this when she was called a mud blood and he defended her ;and also when Snape called her a know it all and Ron stood up for her. Ron isn't perfect. That's for sure, but he has many amazing qualities. Amazing qualities that are ignored in the movie. I also want to put out there that when the spiders attached in the second book he made sure the dog got in the car before he himself did. Also, when Hermione was being tortured in DH Ron was losing it. He was in sheer agony over Hermione's pain. Book Ron is so amazing, and I feel like the moves have taken a lot away from that. The movies gave Hermione a lot of Ron's lines. So yeah haha I ship it. I think Hermione could use a funny guy and also Ron in the books had no issue saying how brilliant Hermione was and I think she needs a guy that isn't intimidated by her brains. I think through the books he grew a lot.

I am curious as to why you dislike the pairing though. Maybe I'm missing something.
