I can see that as something that would sway you away from them. But when they did fight Ron seemed to know when it went too far. Like when he was mad at her cause he thought her cat ate his rat and he was being a jerk to her. The argument stopped when she was crying because she didn't think she could find enough information to save buck beak and Ron was the one to mend the friendship she was crying about not knowing how to help Hagrid save buck beak and he was the one that said "You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help." Ron tended to do those things a lot more in the books. When Hermione was hurt or insulted he jumped up to attend to her before anyone else. Yeah he was an idiot in how long it took him to realize she was a girl, but when he did he noticed things about her before anyone else did. When her teeth were changed, what her schedule was, anytime she was out of site he seemed to look for her. I also liked how in the fifth book there was a brief mention of how Hermione asked Ron something and it reminded Harry or Molly appealing to Arthur. I get the arguing thing I just liked watching them grow and I always felt Ron was much more attentive to her than Harry was.
