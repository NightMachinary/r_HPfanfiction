Haha I'll never disagree with rereading the books. I absolutely love them.

He's protective certainly but not really possessive. He's leaning on her more. He's scared. Scared for her and their family, but also terrified for himself. He doesn't desire her in that way, but he does cherish her as a link to his own soul. He's taken the mark and feels branded and soiled. Like his own soul is damned. Graces, in his eyes, is a part of him. And because he kept her from taking the mark he feels like the last bits of his salvation are alive in her. He may have to do evils, but her soul is clean and he did that. She represents to him a happier time of his life and he feels like if he can keep her in such a safe and happy state that a part of him lives through that as well.
