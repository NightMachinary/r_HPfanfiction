Man, if anything makes me feel bad for not updating quickly that does haha. I'm really overjoyed that you do that though.

Writing Neville wasn't too hard. I don't feel like his character was really explored too much in the books so it made it easier for me to just kind of write him as I thought to. I took cues from what we know of him already and just expanded his character from that. An example of this is what we know of his parents and how Neville doesn't like to talk about what happened to them. It was an interesting thing to think about. There is no way that can't impact someone profoundly. ( I also know there is no way it can't impact someone because my grandmother was a paranoid schizophrenic and my mother had to face that as a child.)

As you see in the story line he has a lot of mixed emotions regarding his parents. He loves them, but he doesn't know if he loves them or the idea of them. They've never been able to really be his parents. He sometimes feels he loves them out of only obligation or he just loves the idea of who they are and who they used to be. That to me would be such a difficult thing to live with and Neville's so kind in nature it's no wonder to me that he hates himself for being even thinking such things. He hopes that he just loves them, but at times he's unsure. His grandmother had the memories of who his parents were before the war, and Neville doesn't have that. I really wanted to use his home life as the base of his personality. His shyness, self doubt, insecurities but also his kindness and the way he's so gentle and inviting. I feel his grandmother and parents impacted a lot of him and I always wished it was explored more in the books, so I decided that when I wrote this I wanted to explore that specifically. And as you can see in the fic Graces pushes him past some of his demons that hold him back.

I guess my experience has been really great. I don't have as many ties to keep him perfectly in with the books because there wasn't as much about him in the books as let's say Harry. It gives me a lot more freedom. And I really love writing character development. I have a whole notebook of small personality traits for all my OC and where/ how they got such personality traits.
