Not only was the ending of Princess planned from the beginning, the ending of Princess was the first part of Princess put to page. The rest of Princess was written purely to get to that ending. There was one major difference between the first ending; though, and the ending that was put out.

I've received a, well, lot, of complaints about the ending to Princess. And been accused of things like 'lazy writing' and 'no inspiration' when really the rest of the story existed because I wanted to write that specific chapter.

I actually have a ton of scrapped material for Princess that may or may not get a final look over and edit and wind up posted. For example, I actually wrote out about 2500 words for each of Harry's articles in the second epilogue detailing his time in the cities as a travelogue of sorts. I could probably post another 100k words of things related to Princess that never made the cut.

Although Ff.net constraints mean that no one will ever see Princess exactly how I intended for it to be viewed. The 'epilogue' wasn't really supposed to be an Epilogue. It was supposed to be chapter headers, more or less. But I didn't really like how the serial nature of that would have worked out, nor did I like how ff.net formats it. So really, between chapter 1 and 2 is supposed to be around the first thousand words of the epilogue, and so on until the end. The only real epilogue portion of it would have been Claire Potter's eleventh birthday.

I doubt I'll really write another fic based on a pairing assuming I never return to Tenebrae Vincunt. I'm more interested in a concept or a theme to explore rather than 'pairing' characters. And I've pretty much done the ones that I'm interested in. I don't particularly think Harry would ever really be that interested in Hermione. And I think his relationship with Ginny would play out a lot like how I have it in QWC or DiP.

I would be interested in exploring Luna more. But Luna is weirdly hard to write and I haven't really managed to think of a plot that warrants exploring it more.

I do think that LdS will probably be my last new fic. I'll probably update some combination of TV, DiP and Thaw after it's done. But I said that after I finished Princess, and Vitam Paramus sprung itsself one me, so who knows.
