Haha not at all. I love Luna, I just never thought that Neville and her would make a good couple. Like the idea of them together is nice, because I like them both, but then when I sit down and think of it I feel like one would always be missing something from the other. I think Neville would want a really quiet life. Like we know from what JK has said that he was an auror for a bit but then decided he wanted to teach. I think he was an auror for a while because he felt obligated to help out after the war. I think that in reality he just wanted a quiet life where he could have peace. I can see Neville's perfect date night being ordering in and watching a movie. Where as I feel Luna needs more in her life. I think she has a restless spirit. I see Luna as someone who would want to constantly be traveling and seeking out the new and different things. I believe if Neville and her were married Neville would do what she wanted but always be longing for something more quiet. I also think he wouldn't get Luna and that makes me sad, because I love Luna and I would want her with someone who understood her and could live in her little world. I don't the Neville could ever do that. He's too pragmatic. He's feel are too firmly on the ground.
