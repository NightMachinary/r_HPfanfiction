From what you say it doesn't sound like you should tag either relationship. 90% of the time, people searching pairings want to see what stories contain who they wish to see together at the end. Of you tag any other way it will just feel like a lure, after which you fridge the relationship. And that doesn't help anyone, so it's best just to let the tags reflect that.
