Keep in mind that you might get some bad reviews once those of a brainless variety discover that the pairing isn't what they want it to be. Shippers can be pretty obnoxious.

Lots of authors seem to be afraid of such reviews tho, so they do their best to drive off the haters by pretty much telling how the story is going to go right of the bat and thus removing any suspense or mystery from their story.
