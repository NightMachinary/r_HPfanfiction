Hey, if you aren't cunning, intelligent, or brave, you could still make Hufflepuff.

Either that or Slytherin, of course, but while Slytherin requires blood prejudice, Hufflepuff is more open and inclusive.

Crabbe and Goyle? They could have gone to either Hufflepuff or Slytherin, however, they chose to go to Slytherin ahead of time.
