I cannot figure out which group I would belong in. I can see myself in all of them very easily. It's just so dependent on my mood, sometimes I'm more friendly, sometimes more studious and sometimes more loud and fun and pottermore says I'm a Slytherin which I thought was a little less suited than other houses but then I realized even that fits some of my moods so I'm stuck with no set house.
