House are supposed to fit your values, as well as your personality. If you think about what you value in yourself no matter what, no matter the mood, that might help. For instance, I value creativity, open mindedness, curiosity, exploration, and being authentic to who I am. That fits with ravenclaw.

In the other hand, I don't really value ambition or cunning in myself, so slytherin wouldn't a good fit.
