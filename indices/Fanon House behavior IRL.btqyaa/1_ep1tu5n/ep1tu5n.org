I love how the Slytherins were all

This is an interesting discovery on human behaviour, and it also shows that even though fanon does try and romanticise the houses, the basic ideas are still correct.

Also, YESS! Slytherins not being portrayed as 'I must win so I will cheat.' Thanks. :) (You're serving my evil goals well minion)

Edit: On a side note, I wish fics would say in the summary if they bash Slytherin or Snape, because even if JKR portrayed them that way doesn't mean it's not bashing to give an entire house literally /two/ character traits. Evil, and stupid. And Snape (in the books, the movies less so) was so simple, just â€˜I am evil, and only the protagonist can tell' followed by a crap redemption arc.
