I can give you the classic Marauder era fic but not the baby harry one. At least, not male harry. I know a few female harry ones.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12744735/1/The-Last-Peverell]] -Female harry. Maurader era. James exists. Haven't finished this so chapter54+ is unknown to me

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11626818/1/Threads-Of-Time]] -Female harry. Just after Lily and James die. Helps raise harry alongside Sirius. F!Harry/Sirius

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11540175/1/A-Mishap-and-an-Opportunity]] -Male harry. Marauder era. Tonks is also there with harry.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Traveling-Through-Time/46868/]] Try checking out this. It's a compilation of many of FFN's time travel fics. You might find one you like.

I know a lot more time travel fics though most of them deal with you back to harry's first year.
