Honestly, I was disappointed at how straightforward Grindelwald seemed in Fantastic Beasts.

This guy duelled /Dumbledore in his prime/ to a standstill. He could wield /untold power/. He likely instigated a /world war/. He had the Deathly Hallows. And despite all this awesome power, he basically got his ass handed to him by a couple of stationary Aurors and some random bird in under 15 seconds, just because they wanted the movie to have a happy ending.

Perhaps I've read too much fanfiction, but I expected that confrontation to be a bit more momentous.
