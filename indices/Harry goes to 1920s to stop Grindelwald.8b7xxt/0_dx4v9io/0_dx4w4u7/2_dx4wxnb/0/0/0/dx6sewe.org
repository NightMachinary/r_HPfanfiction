I see what you mean, with Grindelwald's power stemming from his manipulations, but it was pretty explicit that in magical prowess he was /at least/ as good as Dumbledore. Grindelwald's ability to manipulate was another type of power, albeit not one that came at the expense of his duelling ability.

I'm tending towards this being shoehorned in so people don't leave the movie theater without a happy ending. (Regardless, it was shoehorned in terribly, and the battle should have been far more of a conflict.) It is a family movie after all, and doesn't have the same momentum to pull off what HBP did or DH Part 1 with the depressing, sad endings. Perhaps later in the series they'll feel confident enough to insert a good ending regardless of if it's happy or sad.

Who knows - maybe Dumbledore would break him out in the next movie! Now that would be neat.
