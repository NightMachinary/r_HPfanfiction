Well, it sort of fits with him being the kind of wizard who could lose /even though he had the unbeatable Elder Wand/.

You can make it work if you figure that the real reason he was so scary was his ability to manipulate and nudge behind the scenes: if you look at the actual history of the rise of the Nazi party and their initial warlike successes you see a lot of absurd coincidences, people acting wildly out of character and enemy commanders having remarkable rushes of shit to the brains at critical moments.

In real-world history, this was just the normal cake-and-arse-party that history actually is. In the Potterverse, Grindelwald had a fanatical cadre of invisible wizards, all skilled with mind-altering magic, apparating all over the place and keeping the third reich going like one of those juggling acts where the guy is spinning thirty plates, juggling thirteen flaming chainsaws and farting a tune at the same time.

It worked until brute force - the combined industrial and military outputs of the western allies and the Soviet Union - could be brought to bear, at which point the whole elaborate mechanism came crashing down.

And Dumbledore arrives at the last minute to beat a despairing, depressed, beaten Grindelwald and take him into wizarding custody so he doesn't blow the Statute of Secrecy wide open at the Nuremberg Trials...
