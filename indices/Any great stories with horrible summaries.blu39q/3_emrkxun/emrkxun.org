When a friend recommended I read !linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) he had to work very hard to convince me that is was actually worth a read, as neither the name nor description are compelling.

That said, it's one of the only harem stories out there that gives each girl a distinct personality and role, and it's got some very interesting magic and politics. It's also a fun play on a Peggy Sue story in that Harry is not the first person to be sent back in time to fix things. His WBWL brother was sent back first, but is still around in the new timeline wondering how things keep getting so off track.
