Linkffn(the mage and the potions master by shedoc)

Summary does not give any clue to the angst level of a fic where Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort and tortured for several weeks, and is blind when finally rescued. I mean, it ends well, but I had no clue what I was getting into. I read it because I like other fics by the author.

Oh, it is slash, but strictly non-explicit pg-level.

Edit: /blind/, not bling. jfc
