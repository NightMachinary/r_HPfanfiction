Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) The summary describes the first few scenes and nothing of what happens beyond. Sirius raises Harry while on the run, Tonks goes through auror training with Moody, Remus tries to help other victims of Greyback to prevent them from joining him, meanwhile everyone is looking for Harry and kidnapper Sirius. The Malfoys obviously want to exploit the situation for themselves. Umbridge is Umbridge. Oh, and the Serpents Sworn cause trouble.
