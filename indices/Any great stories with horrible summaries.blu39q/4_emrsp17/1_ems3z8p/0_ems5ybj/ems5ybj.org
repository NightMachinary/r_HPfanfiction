Well, its not like the story is abandoned, just yesterday she said the next chapter is around 25% completion. Considering the level of what she puts out, I, and a bunch of people, don't mind having to wait, because we know she'll never stop writing it till its done. So idk, seems like an unecessary jibe to me.
