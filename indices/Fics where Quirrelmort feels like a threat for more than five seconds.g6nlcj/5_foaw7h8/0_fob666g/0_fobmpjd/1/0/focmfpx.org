I think it's the author's justification for magic getting weaker - it's an interdict that makes it impossible to write down powerful magic and makes it only possible to learn from one person to the other. IIRC it contains one of the more clever moments - that is, Slytherin creating his basilisk to skirt the interdict (teach everything to the Basilisk, use the basilisk to transfer knowledge.

I don't really know where it ends up - however, I think it falls from the author's own inspiration/fears and desire to have dangerous knowledge restricted to only the scientists able to discover it.
