Old magic being more powerful/forgotten is a pretty common trope - both in fantasy and in HP fanfictions, so having an explanation for why it might have been lost is not the worst.

In this case I think it's less old magic always being better, and more that dangerous magic needed to be controlled. IDK, I stopped reading the fic once it pivoted to a bad version of Ender's game.

Personally, I like the interpretation that a lot of older magic would be more powerful, more annoying, more dangerous, and more hidden away in various family libraries and oral traditions.
