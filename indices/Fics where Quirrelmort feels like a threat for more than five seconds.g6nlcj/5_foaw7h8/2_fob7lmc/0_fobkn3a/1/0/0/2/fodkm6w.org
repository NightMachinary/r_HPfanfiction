Right, wow, yeah, that's a lot. But say you are just someone who stumbled on purely the fic through a link on this very sub. You read it, taking all the "science" as the same sort of technobabble that Star Trek spouts, and Harry as the sort of humorous "child genius" you find in cartoons like "Dexter's Laboratory".

Partway through you start seeing a lot of references on reddit to how awful this fic and this author and these fans are, so you decide not to go to their website.

Viewed purely through the lens of comparison to other crackfics, it's not bad.
