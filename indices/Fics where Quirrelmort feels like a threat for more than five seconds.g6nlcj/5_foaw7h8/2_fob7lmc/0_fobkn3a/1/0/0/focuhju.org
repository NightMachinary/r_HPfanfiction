I mean, the fans of HPMOR are the type of utilitarians who not only would be more happy to have their bike stolen if it would give more joy to the ones who stole it, but also the type of people who think that if joy was netpositive they would endorse rape and genocide. They claim that their equations would never lead to genocide for example... but Yudkowski has written positive references to rape in Three Worlds Collide, with both future!humans and an alien race firmly believing its right, and the third race being a culture of "Baby Eaters." None of these are portrayed as actually morally wrong
