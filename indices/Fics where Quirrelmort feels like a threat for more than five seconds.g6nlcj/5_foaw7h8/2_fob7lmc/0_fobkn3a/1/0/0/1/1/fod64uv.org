Compromising with positions that are actually evil IS evil. Ty for the downvote brigade. I used to read HPMOR and all his original fiction, but his "Less Wrong Brights" are a bunch of amoral cowards who blindly follow a cult leader who has managed to con people into giving him money despite them all being "skeptics." I like how you point out that eating babies is obviously wrong... but not that rape is wrong. Oh wow, isn't it shocking and edgy that the women are confused that rape is bad? Yudkowsky and his lot are just a bunch of shallow edge lords, I feel bad that I was caught up in it, and I feel bad for everyone who goes along with him
