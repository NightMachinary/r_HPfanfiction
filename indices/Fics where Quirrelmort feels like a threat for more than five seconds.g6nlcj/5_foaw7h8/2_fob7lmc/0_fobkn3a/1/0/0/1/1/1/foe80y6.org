I upvoted and agreed with you. It's not surprising that this place is AGAIN defending rape. It's home to misogynists who desperately justify harems and objectifying women in general. Objectively wrong acts exist and I hate people who try to say "ITS ALL SUBJECTIVE ITS A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW!!!" No! All anyone has to do is see how you react if it's done to YOU, then you'd understand that it's objectively wrong. They sound like my mother trying to justify all of her abuse to me with "I THOUGHT I WAS SHOWING HER LOVE/TRYING TO TEACH HER LESSONS." Just because you think it's good in your own head doesn't mean from the outside it isn't still bad! Anyone sane and moral can see it.
