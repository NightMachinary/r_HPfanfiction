  None of the three species are explicitly called morally evil by the text itself because you're supposed to /know/ that eating babies is wrong---the actual content of the story is about how we might have to compromise with positions that are /actually evil/.

Well, there's that, but IMO there's also a strong element of, "While you're busy condemning evil over there, have you considered how your own actions might be judged as evil by someone with a different perspective? Is there perhaps a beam in your own eye?"

I really like HPMoR's exchange between Harry and Hermione when she's upset that he's still friends with Draco.

#+begin_quote
  "There's history books you haven't read," Harry said quietly. "There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give you a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and -"

  "Stop," she said.

  "- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good clean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built, Hermione, the way people are built to /feel/ inside -" Harry put a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct position, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his head at around the ear level, "- is that they hurt when they see their /friends/ hurting. Someone inside their circle of concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or sometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't /learn/ otherwise. So, no, it does /not/ indicate that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -"

  "If you believe that," she said with her voice unsteady, "if you /can/ believe that, then you're evil. People are always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter what anyone /tells/ you to do, you're the one who does it. Everyone knows that -"

  "/No they don't!/ You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where 'I vas only followink orders' is something /everyone knows/ the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century they would've called it honourable fealty." Harry's voice was rising. "Do you think you're, you're just /genetically/ better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd realize /all on your own/ that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you think you'd /finish/ realizing all that by the first day you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever /told/ Draco he was personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up in. And /despite that,/ it only took him four months to get to the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn falling off a building." Harry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever seen him. "I'm not /finished/ corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I think /he's done pretty well so far/."

Of course, views expressed by Harry are not /necessarily/ the views of the author, but in this case they probably align. However, even if you end up agreeing with Hermione and disagreeing with Harry, it's still a thought-provoking passage. How well do I really understand other people's perspectives and situations?

A piece of fiction that makes you think, laugh, and cry is probably worthwhile reading. HPMoR has a lot of food for thought, a lot of humor, and some very emotionally charged scenes (though whether you actually cry depends on your level of emotional investment in the characters).
