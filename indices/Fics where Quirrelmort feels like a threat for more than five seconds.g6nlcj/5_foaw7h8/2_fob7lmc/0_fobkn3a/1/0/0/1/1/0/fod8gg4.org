I'm not part of whatever downvote brigade you think is happening, but don't let the fact that all of /two whole people/ disliked your comment distract you from that persecution complex. Compromising with evil is indeed evil, sure. But when refusing to compromise means your entire species is destroyed, what else are you supposed to do? Anyway. Yes, rape is wrong, go put that straw back in the barn. The author of HPMOR and Three Worlds Collide made Draco, a kid raised by, as the text describes him, /magical Darth Vader/, obviously a Nazi stand-in, and the story then goes on to destroy his entire world view. Harry is bloody horrified when he realizes Draco wasn't joking.
