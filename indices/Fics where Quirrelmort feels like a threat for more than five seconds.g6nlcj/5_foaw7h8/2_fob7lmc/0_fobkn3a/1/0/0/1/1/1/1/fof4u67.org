That is very much how several members of the crew of the Impossible Possible World reacted when they learned about the aliens who eat their own live and sentient children. They were outraged, indignant, ready to go to war and eradicate such an obvious evil.

And then they met another species that was horrified and outraged at the fact that humans have not re-engineered themselves to eliminate pain and embarrassment and suffering and dishonesty, that humans allow /their children/ to go through traumatic experiences and just consider it part of growing up, and this species resolves to do whatever it takes to protect the children.
