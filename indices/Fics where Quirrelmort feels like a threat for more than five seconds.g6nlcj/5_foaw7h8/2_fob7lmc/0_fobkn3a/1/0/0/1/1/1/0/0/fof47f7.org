I think s/he was referring to the treatment of rape in Three Worlds Collide, in which a future society has normalised non-consensual sex, and people can no longer understand the centuries-old individuals who remember when it was a crime.

IMO anyone who reads it and decides that the story is endorsing rape, though, has rather missed the point. It's all about how different societies have different values and priorities, how one calls "good" what another calls "evil", and how we respond to those value conflicts. The story doesn't really endorse any particular set of values, it's just a thought experiment for better understanding them. Whether the ending was good or bad depends on your perspective and your own values.
