Alright, as a fan of HPMOR I can confidently state that you're talking out your ass. I believe none of those things. Three Worlds Collide had changed fundamentally what sex means to a society, and the author himself said something that amounted to him admitting he didn't execute the idea he was going for with that particularly well. None of the three species are explicitly called morally evil by the text itself because you're supposed to /know/ that eating babies is wrong---the actual content of the story is about how we might have to compromise with positions that are /actually evil/.
