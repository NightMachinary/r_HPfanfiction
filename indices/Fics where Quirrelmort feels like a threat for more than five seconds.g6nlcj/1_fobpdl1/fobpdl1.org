There's a fic I cannot for the life of me remember the name of or the considerable bulk of the plot of, but I very vividly recall the first lesson with its Quirrel when he essentially tried to logic them all into anti-Muggle sentiments with shotguns and pointing out they were weaker and thus more vulnerable to death when encountering magical objects to the point even Hermione was going "Well, yes... um..." and it was really interesting to read.

Quirrel there wasn't really all that magically or martially dangerous in the fic, but he actually lived up to the supposed charm of Voldemort and I thought that was cool. :)
