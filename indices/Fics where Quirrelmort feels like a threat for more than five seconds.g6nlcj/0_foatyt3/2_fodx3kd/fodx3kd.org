I really want to like this, but there are points in the story where it is completely unbelievable to me that Harry wouldn't either kill himself or have someone kill him in order to prevent disasters from having happened. Someone like Moody should have no trouble with that. I get that letting him do that removes some potential sources for dramatic tension and character development, but not doing it feels like handing core characters the idiot ball.
