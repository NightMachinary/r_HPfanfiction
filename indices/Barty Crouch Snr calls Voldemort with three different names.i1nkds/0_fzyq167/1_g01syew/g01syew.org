The world needs more Barty Crouch Sr fanfics.

I want to read about Moody and Sr working together to catch Death Eaters (with Charlus Potter as a fellow Auror because it would be PERFECT) and Jr wanting to be exactly like his father's best friend.

(Until he doesn't --- but by then he knows exactly what Moody would do in every situation. Enough to act exactly like him. Well enough to fool even Dumbledore.)
