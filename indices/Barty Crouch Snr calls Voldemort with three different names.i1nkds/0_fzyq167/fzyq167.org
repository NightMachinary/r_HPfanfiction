Crouch Snr has always been one of my favourite minor characters, he's not nice but he's a complicated figure and an interesting bloke. His son also grips the imagination, as does the love for his wife. I have always been of the opinion that Mrs Crouch is one of the most underrated characters in the series, but that family is messed up from the get go, and I love them for it. He's not a bad person but he's also not likeable in real life, he's just one of those people, you know? Even when he was delirious all he could talk about was how Barty got 12 O.W.Ls, talk about a father who loves his diabolical son. A few seconds later he's killed by said son and transfigured into a bone. I've always wondered whether Barty the Younger was always this fanatical or the time under the Imperius drove him mad as such that the only thing he was devoted to was Voldemort. I also love the parallel between him and Regulus Black (both have good relationships with the family house-elves), among yet other parallels.

As for the different uses of names, isn't Crouch a politician? Maybe he's trying to cater to different people by presenting different images of himself; the man brave enough to call Voldemort by his name, the man who respects others by not frightening them with saying it, and the man who uses the formal title of the Dark Lord. He must have encountered all of these during his work, so it's not far-fetched to assume he doesn't even /have/ a default. It's also interesting if we go back and see which situations exactly did he use the names he spoke. Dark Lord means he must respect him a bit, maybe? Or he's truly afraid, in Bagman's trial people don't really want to let Bagman go to Azkaban and he's trying to assert his power, and during his son's trial, well, it was a big one supposedly (Alice and Frank being beloved members of the community) and he resorted to calling him by the most used formal name. Just a thought.
