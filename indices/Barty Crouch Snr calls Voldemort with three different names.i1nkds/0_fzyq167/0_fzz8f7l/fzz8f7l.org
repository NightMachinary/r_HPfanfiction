Love this comment, very succinctly put!

And about the different names too. I suppose it was like this:

During the trial of death eaters including his son: he's reading the official document where it was govt policy to say 'he who must not be named'.

During Bagman's trial: he's talking to Bagman and the Wizengamot and sees no need to mince his words

After the escape: he's been under a death eater's imperious for months, and we know all DEs call him the dark lord (See Snape calling him the same).
