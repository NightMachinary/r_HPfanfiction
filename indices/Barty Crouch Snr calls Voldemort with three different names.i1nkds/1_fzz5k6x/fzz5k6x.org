I don't believe Crouch would be the type to be afraid of using Voldemort's name, at least during the First War and he uses it when the moment is opportune. However his son's trial was a very sensitive one, not only because his reputation was tarnished but because the crimes of which BCJ was accused were really atrocious and against two highly appreciated members of the community, so it would only make sense that he would be respectful towards those that did not feel comfortable with Voldemort's name.

When Crouch shows up mad in the Forbidden Forest, he's been under the Imperius Curse for a while, likely placed by either his son or Wormtail, who were servants of Voldemort, and as his servants usually refer to him as "the Dark Lord", I would assume that he picked it up from them.
