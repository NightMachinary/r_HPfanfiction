[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], linkao3(7331278): Harry never went to Hogwarts, never met Hagrid, never learned that he is a wizard. The first time he hears about magic is from a bunch of mismatched teens trying to stop a war, while he just wants to get to work on time.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] is a series of one-shots, each based around a different AU concept. of particular relevance are: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]], where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447][the last son]], where Ron is the 'Chosen One'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]], linkffn(11191235): One of the better Slytherin!Harry stories out there. It sets out to build and then subvert the cliches of the genre, and ymmv on how well it achieves this, but it is still a decent story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/8/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What would Slytherin Harry do?]], linkffn(3559907): A couple of snippets from Harry's time at Hogwarts, detailing how he would deal with the various obstacles he faced coming from a very different viewpoint. The last chap or two are odd, but it remains a solid read.
