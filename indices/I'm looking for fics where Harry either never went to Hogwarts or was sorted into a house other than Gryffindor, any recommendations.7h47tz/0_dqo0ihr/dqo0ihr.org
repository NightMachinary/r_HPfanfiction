Beauxbaton: linkffn(12266465) features Harry in Beauxbaton after careful plotting by Dbby. This fic started as a cracking response to something here but sadly it hasn't been updated in a long time.

Drumstrang: linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived by the santi)

Hufflepuff: linkffn(Harry the hufflepuff) and it's sequels are hilarious.

Slytherin: linkffn(Ruthless) is probably my best Slytherin Harry fic. It doesnt deal with the 11 year old politics that is common to this trope.
