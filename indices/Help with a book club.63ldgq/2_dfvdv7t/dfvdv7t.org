It feels very weird and arrogant to rec my own fic for this, but I did write NFO to be as canon compliant as possible and the feedback I've had on it suggests it's a good introduction to fanfic, particularly if your friend feels uneasy about AU. I'll refrain from giving my opinion on DAYD but I like to think my fic fits the tone of the overall series a little more. I also recommend A Call to Arms by My Dear Professor Mcgonagall as an alternative - there's a little more Neville than I write, if I remember correctly, and it is very nicely written. The only downside is that I think Snape is written way too soppily and there's a weird "Ginny looks just like Lily!" thing. If you do decide to go with NFO I would say read it two or three chapters at a time at the start where things are a little slow then one at a time as things pick up when she gets to Hogwarts.

Another good fic you might enjoy as a fanfic starter is linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) which follows Teddy Lupin. It introduces a lot of new characters but does a great job of capturing the warmth of the first few books.
