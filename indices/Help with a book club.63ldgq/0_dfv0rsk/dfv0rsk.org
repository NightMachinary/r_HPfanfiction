Seventh Horcrux is not a newbie fic, as it pokes fun at a lot of common fanfic tropes. Not From Others is commonly recced for new fanficcers, but I haven't read it myself.

Linkffn(cauterize) is a post-war canon compliant highly recommended angst fic, but as it's a oneshot I'd save it to read a week in between longer fics.

Linkffn(3124159) is an awesome comedy fic from Minerva's POV that could have easily happened in canon. Lengthy chapters, so 1 chapter a week.

Linkffn(realizations by wishweaver) is an AU summer after 4th year when Harry gets a new OC family. No bashing of anyone (very unusual for this type of story!) and well written.

Linkffn(my nephew Harry by lucillia) What would have happened if Marge had taken in Dudley and Harry and discovered that Dudley was a bully and Harry was alright? Marge is very like canon, but believes in 'tough love' not meaningless child abuse. Good alternate POV of a minor character.

All of these are complete and suitable for new readers.
