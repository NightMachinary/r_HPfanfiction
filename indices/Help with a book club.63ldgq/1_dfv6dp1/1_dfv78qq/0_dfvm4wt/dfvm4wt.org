The seventh Horcrux was the first fic I ever read. I'd recommend it, purely because it was what made me start reading HP fanfiction in the first place.

I don't remember anything about plot or chapters, because this was like.... 7 years ago. I read nothing but Harry/Ginny for 2 years after that.

She also has a two part series with one of them being Curse of the Damned or something. I'd recommend those two as the next project.

Not from Others would be a bit more advanced reading I would say. I haven't read it yet, but I assume it would require more knowledge of the HP universe and characters to appreciate the story properly.
