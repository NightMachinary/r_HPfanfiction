I think you meant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux by Melinlaleo]], linkffn(2818538), which was an alt-year 7 fic written before DH came out.

It's easily confused with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes]], linkffn(10677106), which came out in 2015 and was a parody.

I would definitely recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] for your book club.

In addition, I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), which is year 6 from Ginny's POV and nicely complements "Not From Others". Furthermore, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] is writing a gigantic postwar series consisting of 80+ short and novel length fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is an excellent story talking about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

--------------

For AU (alternate universe) postwar fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my absolute favorite. In this one, Harry led an uprising against a still corrupt Ministry and pureblood oligarchy.
