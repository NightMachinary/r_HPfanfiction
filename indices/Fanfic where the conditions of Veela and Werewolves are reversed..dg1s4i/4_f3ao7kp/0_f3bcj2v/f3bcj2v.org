Since, in canon, there are only female Veela, or only female Veela who are capable of shifting between bird form and humanoid form (and my headcanon is that male Veela exist only as birds), I imagine that in this world only the male werewolves are capable of the same.

...So there would technically BE no she-were-wolves if they could ONLY exist as magical wolves.
