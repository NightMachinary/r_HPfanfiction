According to the HP Wiki: "Veela have been known to marry wizards ... . Children of these unions are half-Veela, and they will inherit magical ability from their wizarding parent and beauty and charm from their Veela parent." And: "It is unknown whether half-blooded Veela can ... transform into harpy-like creatures as their full-blooded relatives can." I am running with the idea that they cannot transform at all. Therefore: girls with werewolf blood in this prompt scenario would inherit only the seductive properties of werewolves; not any of their physical/transformative attributes.

Interestingly, in the Trivia section of Veela on the Wiki page: "Veela are described as fairy or nymph-like creatures in Slavic mythology ... . They often appear as beautiful women, but are known to morph into swans, snakes, horses, or WOLVES." Wolfy-Veela are apparently a thing.
