I don't think it was expanded on but the story The Goblet's Revenge by duskglow had something like that.

They handed the inheritance test results to the clerk, and after she analyzed them, Harry found that he inherited a few small lines, but nothing huge. He discovered that he was Lord Potter, but that that really didn't mean anything but an inherited wizengamot seat that he couldn't take until he was of age and a few other small benefits. He also discovered that he was distantly related to all four founders, but they told him that nearly everyone in the wizarding world could claim the same.
