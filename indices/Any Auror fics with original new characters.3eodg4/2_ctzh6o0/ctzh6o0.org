I am not sure if it qualifies, but it's not Auror Ron or Auror Harry:

linkffn(Murder Most Horrid) features veteran Auror Bellatrix Black. The auror corps there feels like a cop show's, with diverse characters. Hermione's the love interest of Bellatrix, which is a rocky relationship to start.

I've written an auror duo myself, but they're side characters.
