the two big things that immediately stick out to me is altitude and protection, when youre flying that fast you're going to need to be much higher up than typical flights in order to minimise any obstacles in the way, things like pulling out of dives or turns are orders of magnitude more dangerous and difficult and you will need some kind of spell protection to stop the wizard in question being flattened/thrown off the broom by the compressed air. But in all honesty I dont see too many big roadbumps on the way to mach 1 and beyond
