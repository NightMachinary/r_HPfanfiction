My head canon on why brooms were chosen as flight instruments is that each bristle can be enchanted to produce thrust, so newer faster brooms have smaller bristles so they can fit more. Breaking the sound barrier would require a large amount of thrust so maybe his broom end up looking like a push broom instead of the more traditional design.
