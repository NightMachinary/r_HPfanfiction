This isn't really a difficult problem to solve all things considered. The two principle factors that he would need to solve would be decreasing drag and increasing thrust.

Thankfully broom flight doesn't require any lifting surfaces, so it would be fairly easy to produce a very low drag coefficient with the right shaped shield.

Also thankfully a broom and rider is far less massive than any plane, so even a modest increase in thrust would result in more speed compared to a plane. Whether of course the rider/enchantment/rune array can provide the power for that is up to speculation.

Honestly the only real limit I can see would be the reaction times of the rider. There is a reason why fighter pilots are a rare resource after all.
