I think looking at the magical items/enchanted items list on the wiki might be a good starting point for the canon ones. However, for a fanfic, I think it adds more to it when you come up with some yourself!

A good way to do that, IMO, is to think of a common item in life - and then think about how it could change up to be magical. An easy example there would be the canon newspapers - the magical 'twist' to them is with the moving pictures, but that little change is enough to make it stand out. Another would be quills - having one that automatically writes down what's spoken is another way to make it magical and stand out.

That doesn't have to be functional, either - part of the whimsical feeling from the HP world comes from those sorts of items/magic that /aren't/ functional or the most effective.

But overall, I think you get the most bang for your buck in these sorts of things from those that feel both normal & strange/exotic in the same item.
