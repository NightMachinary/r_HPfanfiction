I always liked Molly's clock. It first shows up in the Chamber of Secrets book, though I'm going to give points to the movie since that's where the hands for each of the Weasley first shows up the OotP book incorporates it later, but in CoS book the clock is more for indicating chores, and only has one hand; can't remember if it shows up anywhere else). In the same chapter, self-shuffling cards are mentioned, so that's neat.
