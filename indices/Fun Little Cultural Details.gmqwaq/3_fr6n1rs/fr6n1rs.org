I know they're not supposed to do magic without wands, but I always appreciated the shot of the wizard stirring his tea with wandless magic while reading a book (prisoner of Azkaban movie, I think? In the leaky cauldron def.). It would be so handy.

That being said, I have so many ideas:

I like it when fics include enchanted hairbrushes. There's a new hair drying brush IRL that looks witchy. Imagine being able to run a brush through your hair and it's perfectly dry and shiny and styled!

Charmable nail polish. Like you paint your nails with the polish and then use your wand to charm it to the color/design you'd like. (Premade nail art designs sold separately).

Hats that keep your hair in perfect condition for when you're flying, potioneering, etc.

Fabric for clothes and upholstery charmed to move, shine, change color, etc.

There's no trash system. You fill up a bin and vanish or burn the contents.

It's also important to remember that in the books it's stated that most people don't like to apparate. I like to imagine different landing spots for brooms in places like Diagon alley.
