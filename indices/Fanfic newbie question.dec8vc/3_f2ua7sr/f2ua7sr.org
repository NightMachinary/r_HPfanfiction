You could go on FanFiction.Net and sort stories by favorites or reviews, this will get you the big fics, though some of those are really divisive. /cough/ HPMOR /cough/ It's a little harder to sort through things on ArchiveOfOurOwn.org, the other really big fic site, though once you know what genres, characters, and themes you like you can more precisely filter.
