I typically use the fanfiction.net app 8/10 times. The other 2/10ths are in browser from this subreddit like everyone else has already said or using fanfic pocket for AO3. For AO3 just sort by kudos and pick your tags that you want and exclude the tags that you don't want to see.

I prefer using fanfiction.net in the browser on my pc to find fics because I think its easier to use, then I either favorite or follow them. After that, I look for them on the corresponding list on my app. Reading on the phone is just an easier alternative in my opinion.

Also, I find it easier to search on fanfiction.net because I typically search by what characters I'm interested in reading currently, so if I'm in a mood to read a Harry/Hermione I'll filter by Favorites and then in Character A put Harry P. and in Character B put Hermione G.

That's it. By searching that way I'll get less specific results though, but I'll also get results for fics involving those two characters I might not have found by restricting my search parameters. For example, I could've tagged the genres Romance and Adventure and it could've filtered out a very interesting story just because it didn't have one of those genres. If I'm wrong on any of that someone please correct me but this is the way I've done it for the last 3 years I've been in the fanfic community.

*Oh, also if you read a fic you really like, check to see what else that author has written!*

Word of advice though, just because a fic has thousands of favorites doesn't mean that it's good or that you'll like it. For example, I won't say HP and the Methods of Rationality is a bad fic, but I couldn't get into it. I didn't like the writing style or the content of the story, but if you ask a random member of this subreddit whether it's good or not it'll probably be a fifty-fifty chance of whether they liked it or not. A lot of my favorite stories have been only 1k follows or even fewer favorites.

Just because a fic doesn't get those front-page numbers does not mean that it is a bad fic or that the other fic is better. It's just a matter of popularity and exposure over time. After you've been in the community for a bit you'll run out of those 15k, 10k, whatever-k, fics and you'll find the authors that you like and honestly if a piece of my written work was read by enough people for one /thousand/ of them to be like "yeah man this is worth my time, I'll follow this" I'd feel like so many damn people just read my story dude. a thousand is a lot of opinions, even if it looks small compared to twenty-thousand.

Anyway, mini-rant over, welcome, have fun, read some fics, this subreddit is pretty damn active so people will always help out here. It's also gotten pretty mellow here so nobody's gonna bite your head off for asking questions and shit.
