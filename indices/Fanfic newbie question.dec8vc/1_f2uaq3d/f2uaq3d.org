Ao3!!! You can use the website ( [[https://archiveofourown.org/]] ) or the unofficial app ("Archive Track Reader", by Alexis Ryan). I find ao3 the easiest fanfic platform to navigate overall. Each author adds tags (fandoms, tropes, pairings, warnings, etc) and it's pretty easy to search and sort through those, once you get the hang of it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][The main HP page, sorted w kudos first]]

You can sort by word count, comments, bookmarks, kudos (favorites), etc, etc, if you go to the column on the right of the screen (on mobile, you hit the grey tab near the top that says "filter").

So, like, if you have a favorite pairing - Harry/Daphne was the example, you could google "harry/daphne ao3" and that gets you straight to that tag. The default sort gives you the most recently updated fics first +which is nice after you've read everything else+, so that's where the filter function comes in handy. If you wanna read something long, filter by word count, if you want most popular, filter by either kudos or bookmarks. (The longest HP fic on ao3 is currently 2.3 million words.)

That was a lot of words for something relatively self explanatory once you see it. I prefer the website to the app (website works well on mobile, too).

(Some people like [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] better, but I find that one harder to get around, so I lurk on reddit for the [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] links and devour ao3 on my own.)
