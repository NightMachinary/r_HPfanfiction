My advice would be to do a google search for Reddit based on what you want to read. For example if you were interested in Harry/ Daphne stories google "best harry/daphne site:[[http://www.reddit.com][www.reddit.com]]"

This should give you quick access to reddit threads with recommendations geared specifically toward what type of story you are interested in.
