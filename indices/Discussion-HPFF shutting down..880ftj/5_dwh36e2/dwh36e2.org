Sad day. Many of my favourites are HPFF originals - Let Perpetual Light, Etc Etc and Life Goes On, Clash, Legend, Madam Minster, Für Das Größere Wohl, Whose am I. There's probably more I can't recall. Fortunately, most of these have been crossposted to other sites (except Legend). But I'm sure there will be plenty of good fic lost unless someone archives it.
