Please add me into this! I was an author on this website. Shot myself in the foot i know for having no backup of my story (i already thought i had it somewhere). I hadn't been on reading or uploading for weeks then found the page was closed. I'm absolutely heartbroken, this story was my life took 10 years to get it to the stage it was in and wasn't even finished. If anyone can help me, please let me know. If not its starting from square one again. Xxx
