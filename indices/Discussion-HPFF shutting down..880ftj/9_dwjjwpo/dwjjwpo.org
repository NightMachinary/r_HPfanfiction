I used to be a member of the forums and know a lot of people that were on staff back in the day. Historically, the owner had indicated that he wasn't comfortable with the idea of porting it during original site shut down scares. He might have very well changed his mind, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I spend my days over on HPfanfictalk now. We've got a transfer tool that's going up this week to help new authors transition to our archive if they want. including review transfers. Most of the members are people from HPFF or tumblr. I've been backing up my favorite stories on pdf, but archiving the site sounds solid too.
