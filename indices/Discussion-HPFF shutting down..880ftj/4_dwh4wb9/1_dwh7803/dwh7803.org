FanFicFare has HPFF as a supported site.

Drag and drop any stories you'd like to save, keep a folder on your hard drive full of backlogged stories.

Alternatively, you can initiate a SiteRip, but that will take a couple days and a good program like DownThemAll or something. I did it once for the Sugar Quill back in the day, but can't remember what I used.
