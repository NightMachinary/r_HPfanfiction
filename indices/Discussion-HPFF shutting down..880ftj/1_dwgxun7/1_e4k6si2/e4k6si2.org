Fanfictionrecommendations.com has now taken over HPFF and is slowly working to rebuild the site but different & better, apparently.

Many of the active HPFF members have moved over to HPFanficTalk.com and it's accompanying archives for stories of all fandoms, as well as original fiction pieces. I'm a member of HPFT and everyone is so lovely, welcoming and kind. The stories are incredible and the reviews many leave are just as personal and detailed. Quite an awesome community to be a part of, if I may say so myself (I can proudly hold the title of first official public story posted to the wonderful HPFT archives).
