Canon Harry is fairly passive. He is there to step in when duty calls, but he does rarely take the initiative (eg he could have simply stunned Malfoy to check his arm for the Dark Mark). He is shown to have a high tolerance for BS (whenever the public opinion is against him and with Umbridge as well).

So even if you have a canon divergence, it will take time for Harry to get rid of that. And most personality changes are gradual, so unless Umbridge pushes him over the edge, he won't be whipping out Crucios as if her name was Carrow. But if you are trying to write that gradual change, it will not be fast enough for most readers' liking.

Yet at the same time, he is functional almost the whole series. He might need the occasional shove from Hermione to get his arse up, but Harry is fairly independent and is tenacious once invested into something (look at the DA or the Horcrux Hunt).

If you are talking about the bedroom, I definitely see Harry as submissive. To me, it looks like Harry would have the weight of the world on his shoulders even after Hogwarts and he would need someone who would just take charge for once in a while, make him temporarily forget about all the shitty parts of the magical world.

We are NOT talking about chastity cages and floggings here, but the kind of power dynamic you rarely see in fanfics because it is too "vanilla" for most authors into D/s.
