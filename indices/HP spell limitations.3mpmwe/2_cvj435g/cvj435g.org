I've spent a fair amount of time thinking of this as well, and I think I've come up with a half decent idea.

Wizards obviously have some sort of limit to the amount of spells they can cast, or magic that they can use in a given amount of time. I've figured that they have a shared HP/Mana/Stamina pool, that is both connected and somewhat independent. A wizard can certainly die while still being able to fight and cast spells, so a critical backstab might reduce their HP to 0 while they still had positive Mana or Stamina. And Harry certainly held on to consciousness until Quirrelmort had been defeated in his first year, so while his Mana and Stamina went to 0, he still had HP remaining.

Any two wizards or spells have a different amount of magic in them, the vast majority of wizards presumably exponentially more magical than the vast majority of spells. There is a sliding scale, and outliers for both categories of course- Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Harry Potter as the most magical and something like Lumos as the very least. One could even think that some awe-inspiring spell like a 'Mountain into a Monster' transfiguration or an acre of Fiendfyre would be more magical than the lower end of wizards, and certainly more than a squib like Argus Filch.

Magical expenditure is affected by skill, and by the size of the Mana pool of the wizard. While Harry may have had a larger MP than McG, were they to cast the exact same transfiguration, it would take McG significantly less magic. Also, it would allow McG to perform larger/more intricate/more impressive feats of transfiguration than Harry, despite his greater magical power.

Its implied that there is a seemingly excessively large amount of food served at Hogwarts, so I presume that using magic takes energy. It burns calories to cast spells, so even if the students have relatively inactive lifestyles, they still need a large amount of food. A wizard probably cannot exhaust himself casting spells until he dies, but would be able to cast until he collapsed and was unable to continue, like if someone out of shape were to just go outside and run. Until they couldn't anymore. I can't imagine any sort of cooldown on anything that doesn't sound absolutely stupid. You couldn't just chain-cast AKs for an hour, it would be like nonstop power-squats with backpack full of bricks. But Dumbledore or Riddle certainly could stand there and unleash breathtaking spectacles significantly larger and more powerful than poor staircase victim Sally-Anne ever could.
