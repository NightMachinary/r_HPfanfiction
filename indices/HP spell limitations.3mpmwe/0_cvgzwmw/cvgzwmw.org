In canon, power or energy (in terms of running out of it or needing a certain amount to cast a spell) is never established.

I believe fanfic uses it a lot as it is a natural check to keep protagonists or antagonists from being too OP. It is the age old fanfic question: What is to stop a Death Eater from casting Avada Kedavra relentlessly as it is unblockable (unless blocked by physical objects and other rare circumstances) and guarantees certain victory? Why would Voldemort or Bellatrix cast anything but Avada Kedavra when dueling?

Requiring a certain amount of power or energy to cast a spell is then a natural check to keep characters from being too overpowered.

Though, I would argue that it makes little thematic sense, in canon, to assume a wizard/witch could cast a spell indefinitely or with no recourse.

JKR's magical system is famously vague and folks such as [[/u/Taure]] have gone to great lengths to prove or debunk certain theories with evidenced cobbled together from canon. Fanfic allows us writers to create our own rules pertaining to magical power and it is up to reader to either believe or disregard the rules established in a fic.
