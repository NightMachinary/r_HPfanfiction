I was implying more that wizards don't have a magical HP counter. This is an overly simplistic example but some fics have it so that casting a spell takes 200 hit points from the wizard's 1000 point pool. There's no evidence in canon for that sort of magical check.

There is some evidence for a poorly defined magical power needed to cast certain spells, including AK. But, JKR's vagueness strikes again as we do not know what this power check is. Snape mentions that it takes nerve and ability to perform the Killing Curse, but what does this /mean/? What does it take to cast Avada Kedavra?

It is never explained in canon, so fanfic writers can sometimes take liberal interpretations of this implied power check in their stories.
