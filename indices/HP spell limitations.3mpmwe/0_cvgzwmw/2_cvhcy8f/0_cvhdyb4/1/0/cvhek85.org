This seems to be exactly the same system as magic points, just with a different name. And it doesn't really fit well with how willpower works in real life. While a person's willpower can vary from time to time, and different people have different strength of will, there's nothing so simple IRL as having a deletable source of will that is expended by performing certain actions. A person who is quitting smoking isn't tapping into some mystical force, they're simply making choices.
