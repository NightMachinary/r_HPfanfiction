I think you're misrepresenting what ego depletion is. It has the word "depletion" in the name, but that doesn't mean that there's a literal finite source of willpower that is reduced by actions. Rather, ego depletion simply refers to the idea that making difficult choices in quick succession gets increasingly hard (see: quitting smoking example).

Further, it doesn't seem relevant here.

"Ego depletion" is largely about behavioural discipline, not about mental focus. This has pretty much zero relevance to magic use. It's a rare spell that involves any mental component at all, and even those that do don't seem to involve self-control.

The only magical concept I can imagine ego depletion playing a role in is occlumency.

Other, similar concepts like mental fatigue are problematic for similar reasons: magic doesn't seem to involve anything that would result in it. Even the spells with a mental component like the Patronus aren't particularly strenuous mentally. You can wallow in past memories all day without getting mentally fatigued. Bored, yes. Fatigued, no. Also, mental fatigue has a lot to do with physical fatigue.
