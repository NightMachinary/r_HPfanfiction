A very good point, but if we were to get into the meta of it, what is to stop Voldemort or Bellatrix (facing anyone other than Dumbledore) to simply cast AK over and over again until all physical objects capable of blocking it are destroyed?

The counter is that you can use other spells to distract him in between AK's or you have the ability to conjure objects indefinitely to block the AK or get the fuck out of dodge when you realize you're facing an AK demon.

Supposing you can defend AK with physical objects or conjurations, would not every duel become a race to who can first cast AK without it being blocked by a physical object? I suppose that is the point of the Killing Curse anyway.

Rambling aside, what I'm trying to say is that if it is a duel to the death - and if Harry and Voldemort exist within the particular fic, then it /must/ be to the death - then it makes for uneventful writing if all it requires is who wins the race to cast the unblocked AK first.

Of course, there are other lethal spells besides the AK, but what I suppose is this: If you, as a Death Eater or MLE, can successfully cast an AK, then all life or death duels should lead to that eventuality. I think this would make for boring writing.

Which is why I think there should be some restraint that exists wherein the user can not infinitely cast AK or whatever spell it may be. Whether that restraint can be implemented in a believable manner is up to the writer, but I feel (which is not to say everyone should feel the same way) it is more compelling and dramatic to have magical restraints as opposed to a battle of who can counter X spell with Y spell until Z happens.
