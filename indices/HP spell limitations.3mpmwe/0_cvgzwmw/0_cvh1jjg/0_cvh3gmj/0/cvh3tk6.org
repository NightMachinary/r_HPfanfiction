What you're describing is basically Voldemort's standard duelling tactic: essentially all he did in his duel against Dumbledore was move around and cast Killing Curses, defending himself between. I don't think that duel was boring to read at all, because of the manoeuvring part of the duel. In fact I feel like it was the pinnacle of magic in the books.

I feel, in general, that HP duels should be quite short and the first party to land a spell wins. So the majority of a duel is trying to put yourself in a position where you can land a single spell. The moment one party has an advantage, the duel is basically over.

With particular regard to Harry, I don't think he would ever use the Killing Curse, regardless of how effective it is.
