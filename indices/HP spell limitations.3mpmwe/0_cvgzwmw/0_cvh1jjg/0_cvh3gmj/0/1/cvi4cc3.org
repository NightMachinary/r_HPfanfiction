I'd like to think he would - but then again: I don't like canon Harry at all (he's a lazy slacker getting by on luck, others helping him (Hermione comes to mind!) and the (sometimes literaly!) sacrifice of others (ok: Sometimes that is because the damned adults - including Dumbledore - keep him in the dark...I'd like to think he would have trained hard if Dumbledore had answered his question in the hospital wing after first year!)) - at least after he has outgrown his juvenile impulses (like hating Slytherins just for being in that school house -.-)
