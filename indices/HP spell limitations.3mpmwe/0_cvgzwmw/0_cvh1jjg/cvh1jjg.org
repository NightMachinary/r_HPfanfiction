The "without limited power, what's to stop a wizard casting the same spell over and over?" question seems to have a natural response that's simply the opposite of the same coin: "without limited power, there's nothing to stop a wizard casting the same /defence/ over and over".

If your first curse failed to penetrate a wizard's defences, then casting the same spell again and again is just going to have the same failed result. This applies equally to the Killing Curse, to which there /are/ defences. Of course the Killing Curse is still incredibly dangerous, which is why Voldemort uses it an awful lot (it's pretty much the only spell he uses as a direct assault), but if you aren't having success with it you're going to have to switch up your strategies to find a way past your opponent's defences -- like any other spell.

We see this in OotP where Voldemort starts using other magic to try to distract Dumbledore and out-manoeuvre him, before once again trying a direct attack in the form of a Killing Curse. If not for Fawkes, it would have succeeded too.

Indeed, thinking about it, there's actually more incentive to spam the same spell at people over and over in a "limited power" world. If there's limited power, then you can spam one spell at people to wear them down and win by having more power than them. That doesn't work in a unlimited power world: if one tactic fails on the first try, the only way you can win is by changing your tactic.
