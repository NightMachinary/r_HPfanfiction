Personally, I don't buy into the theory of some source of power akin to chakra/mana. I do, however, believe that prolonged spell-casting, focus-dependent as it is, is somewhat straining mentally, meaning that whenever you cast a big spell (Patronus or Killing Curse), you tire yourself out mentally just a bit more than if you had cast, let's say, the Disarming Charm.

After all, mustering utter loathing for your opponent or a happy memory would take more focus than simply envisioning the opponent's wand being thrown away.
