  he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned "For Enemies," that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares...Blood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword..."No --" gasped Harry..."No -- I didn't --"...Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done..."I didn't mean it to happen," said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. "I didn't know what that spell did."...He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book?...You know I wouldn't have used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy"

Selections from HBP ch. 24 about Harry's knowledge/use of the spell. He calls it a spell, admits to himself he doesn't know what it does, considers using it on another student to in order to test it and he reacts with utter surprise when it hits Malfoy. He also reiterates that he didn't know what it did when talking with Hermione afterwards. He doesn't say, "yea I knew it would cut him but...". Nary a mention of him knowing /anything/ about what it could do. Harry had come to rely on the HBP's book and just did what was written inside it, without question.
