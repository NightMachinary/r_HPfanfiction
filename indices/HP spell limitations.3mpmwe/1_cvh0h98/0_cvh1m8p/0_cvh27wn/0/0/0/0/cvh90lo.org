I actually do not think he knew. Him knowing, and casting anyway is not canon, or my favorite headcannon, but would be an interesting plot point for a fanfic.

  Why do you presume that Harry would know (what I presume is) Latin?

I don't presume he knows Latin. I suggested that he could have made a basic guess as to the meaning. Why? Because their are probably Latin dictionaries in the library and most of HP spells have a psuedo-Latin origin. Students hear this pseudo-Latin every day, in every class, teachers would be saying things like "can anyone guess what this spell is used for?" or "as the name suggests, this spell is used to...", etc.
