You need to mean the Killing Curse to cast it successfully. We don't know what meaning it involves. We're never told anything about hate or not being able to cast it in self-defence.

As for the disarming charm, there's no evidence that it involves any active mental component at all (i.e. you don't have to think of anything in particular when you cast it).
