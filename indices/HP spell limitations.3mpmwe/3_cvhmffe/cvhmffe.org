i'd bet learning the patronus is exhausting, but once you've used it a few times you probably don't feel a thing anymore. cannon seems to vaguely suggest that education and practice increase how much finesse and power you can put into your spells; and concentration affects how successful each go at a spell is.

as for the killing curse. i assume you'd need to understand it's going to kill and that would be a distraction stopping most people being able to cast it.
