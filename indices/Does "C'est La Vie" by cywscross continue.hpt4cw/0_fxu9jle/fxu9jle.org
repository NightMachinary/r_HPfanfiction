it is so good. I ve reread it a good 20 times. Over the span of the last 1-2 yrs.

I love all the characters... All of them..

It's abandoned for sure. But if cywscross sees this, please know that I will read a continuation even if it comes after 50 years and I have cataracts in my eyes and cannot hold a phone or type on a computer.
