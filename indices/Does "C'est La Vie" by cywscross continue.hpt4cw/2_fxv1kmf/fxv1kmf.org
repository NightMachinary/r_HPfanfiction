Yeah that's one of my favourite fics of all time, I've read it back to back so many times in the past years.

The author does have a tumblr that I have seen updating occasionally (I'm on mobile so I can't link) about all things c'est la vie that has fanart and non-canon fics from them, and the author says that c'est la vie is still technically not dead, but /shrugs/. It's been a long time since the actual fic updated, so I don't have as much hope.
