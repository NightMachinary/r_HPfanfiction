Honestly I think those things happened and Dumbledore allowed them bc.. it's a kids book and they needed to happen, narratively. Obviously if it was real he wouldn't allow that to happen. The consequences of high standards of high school education on the wider workforce of Britain isn't something that exists in Harry's World bc it's a kids book and he's a child and most fans aren't going to care bc they're supposed to be like 9. I think it's just unreasonable to hold the books to the standard that you should be able to derive those wider consequences from what to most kids will be just a teacher being really mean when that's not something that was ever covered or discussed in the books and wasn't meant to be, if you know what I mean? it's just a completely different playing field when it comes to childrens' literature
