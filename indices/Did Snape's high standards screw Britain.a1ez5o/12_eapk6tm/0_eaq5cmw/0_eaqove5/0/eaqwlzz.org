  I just really can't see Dumbledore allowing there to be a serious shortage of healers or aurors due to something so simple which falls under his jurisdiction.

Dumbledore allowed DADA education to fall into a pitiful state without seeming to do much about it. He tolerated the presence of people like Quirrell, Lockhart and Umbridge. He couldn't tell that Moody was Crouch Jr in disguise.

Dumbledore was brilliant in many ways, but I do think the matter of Voldemort/Tom Riddle really drained his energy for many other things. It doesn't surprise me at all if the consequences of Snape's biased teaching and harsh standards were something Dumbledore felt to be addressed later.
