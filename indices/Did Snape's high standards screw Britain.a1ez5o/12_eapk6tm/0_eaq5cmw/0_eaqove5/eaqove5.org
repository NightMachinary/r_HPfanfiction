I just really can't see Dumbledore allowing there to be a serious shortage of healers or aurors due to something so simple which falls under his jurisdiction. he's not evil and it's hsrdly going to cause WW3. It's not as if Snape will walk if Dumbledore tells him to accept EE students into his NEWTS. it just seems a wild claim to extrapolate that. and Lucius might be interested in there being fewer aurors but helping Snape only accept O students to try and narrow them down seems a very convoluted and honestly silly way to do it. and even Lucius Malfoy might need a healer; he'd have no reason to want to cut back on potions students like I really fail to understand that reasoning.. I really think this is just a kids book series and JK gave no thought to the wider ramifications of having a high school teacher with high standards like it just seems petty and a little bizarre to be reading into it in this way
