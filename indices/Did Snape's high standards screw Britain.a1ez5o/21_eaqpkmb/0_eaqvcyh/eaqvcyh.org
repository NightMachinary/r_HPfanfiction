True,but you must ALSO take into account the number of students who were good enough to do NEWT potions but only got EE on the OWLs as well as the students who DID get an O but didn't wantto deal with Snape's shit for another two years.

Let's be honest,Snape was skilled at potions but he was a poor excuse for a teacher.
