A-The books never say one way or the other,but Given the size of Slughorn's class in book 6 we have some insight. B-He didn't,we all know this. C-We can make the assumption,as Snape was still a shitbag when he took over for Lupin AND when he held the DADA post in 6th year. D-Snape was trying to get the DADA post every year.

All we know of Snape's teaching is that he tends to throw the directions on the board,stalk the class and harass people who mess up with vitrol. We know he favors his house and has a reputation of being an asshole to anyone outside Slytherin. Older students have made such comments and we know it's nothing minor because he's frightend his students so bad that he was Longbottom's worst fear at one point.

Occam's razor leads me to believe that unless you got an O despite the questionable teaching and chose to put up with Snape's behavior you missed out on a vital NEWT you need for your career.
