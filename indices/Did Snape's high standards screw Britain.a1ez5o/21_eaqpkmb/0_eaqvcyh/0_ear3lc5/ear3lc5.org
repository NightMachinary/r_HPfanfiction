Ok. But there's no canon evidence that:

A- there was a shortage of people finding jobs that require advanced Potions classes or newts classes.

B-that Snape did this to help Voldemort

C-that Snape was a shitbag to his upper level students. We literally don't know because Harry never sees it.

D-that Snape wasn't trying every year to get out of teaching because he hated it as much as his students.

Posts like OP's just feel like reaching arguments to shit on Snape.
