Did teacher with high expectations keep students with subpar potioneering skills from getting hired at jobs where things can explode and create poisonous gas clouds?

Maybe so.

Sarcasm aside, the idea that one teacher could do any significant detriment to a society where actual adults think that flowered nightgowns are appropriate day wear for the muggles that are all around them all the time is positively ludicrous.

Snape is a dick, but he's a fictional character and nobody seems to shit over McGonagall for being strict.

If anything, Slughorn probably recommended people he liked but who were woefully inept for jobs, so....
