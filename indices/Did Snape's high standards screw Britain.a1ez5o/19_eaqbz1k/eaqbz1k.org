His requirement is only one letter-grade above Mcgonagall's and his subject is more dangerous to students, so I'd say that his requirements are not entirely unreasonable. It is also not unreasonable for a teacher to require a certain grade before allowing students to take an advanced course - remember that the NEWTS are not a required exam like the OWLS and are in fact, optional.

Requiring that students attain a good grade in their subject is a way for Hogwarts teachers to make sure that only students who can cope with the coursework are accepted into their classes - as Mcgonagall explains to Neville when she refuses to allow him into her NEWT-level Transfigurations class.

Additionally, Snape's teaching methods, while unpleasant, were undoubtedly effective since all his students achieved a passing OWL in his subject.

He offers Remedial lessons as well (in OotP he clearly thinks that Malfoy will not question his story that he is giving Harry remedial Potions lessons, and Draco doesn't, which means that at least some students believe that Snape will offer remedial lessons even to a student he is known to despise) so it's not exactly a leap of logic to assume that under normal circumstances (which by Harry's fifth year they certainly were not) Snape would offer remedial lessons to students who would like to take NEWT Potions but don't quite have the marks.
