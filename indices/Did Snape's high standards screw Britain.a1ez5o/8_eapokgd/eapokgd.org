I would assume that if there really wouldn't be enough Healers/ Aurors in the society they would probably just lower the entry requirements at some point and provide more in-house training for the new hires.

It /might/ be that Snape's extreme requirements roughly served to weed out those not committed enough to become Healers/ Aurors anyway.
