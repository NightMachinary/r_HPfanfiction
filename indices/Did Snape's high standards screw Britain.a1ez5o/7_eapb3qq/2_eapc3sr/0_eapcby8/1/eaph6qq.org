In a society where Potions are just as dangerous, varied, and common as spells, it makes perfect sense for them to be competent in identifying, and responding to them. Also having a NEWT is not the same as being a master at them, they aren't potion masters after all. If criminals used chemistry as much as dark wizards would, they'd be expected to at least have a passing grade in chemistry after High School as well.

You've got to stop trying to make Aurors Policemen. Aurors are the military, police, mercenary, etc... of the Wizarding world, not to mention they work in the wizarding world, on cases involving magic. It's like comparing the army to police, they are similar in a lot of respects, but deal with completely different things at the end of the day. Therefore need different training.
