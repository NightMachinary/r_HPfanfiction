I was just going further with the FBI example, obviously we can't find an equivalent topic for everything.

The point some people have made (and which I'm just trying to build on) is that Aurors could easily be organised into teams of specialists. As a Dark-wizard-catching unit I think this makes sense.

In situations like when Sirius was apprehended, a full team of Aurors would have shown up. In this case they should all have advanced defensive/duelling abilities and some of them can have specialist knowledge, such as Potions, curses, artifacts, etc. thereby making up a fully functional team that can deal with different situations.

For smaller cases where only a single Auror or pair would be sent, this could be done by someone whose job is to triage; they are more of a generalist with knowledge of various topics. If they then find they need someone more specialist, they call for backup.
