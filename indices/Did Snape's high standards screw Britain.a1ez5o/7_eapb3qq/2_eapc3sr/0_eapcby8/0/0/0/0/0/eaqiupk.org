There's like 20, maybe 30 Aurors. They're not police, they're police, bodyguards, dark wizard hunters and military at once. It's reasonable to expect them all to be highly qualified.

Potions are pretty much everywhere in the HP world and they can be very dangerous. Sending people without the skills to identify and neutralize them to apprehend dark wizards would be irresponsible.
