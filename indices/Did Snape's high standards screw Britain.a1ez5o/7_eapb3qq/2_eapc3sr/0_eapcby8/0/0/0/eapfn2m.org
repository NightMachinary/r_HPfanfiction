Yes, but the Aurors need to be able to react properly and that means that is beneficial to know potions to be able to neutralise a poison or identify illegal ones.\\
And while potions = chemistry is technically a good equivalence. The fact that Wizards seems to all have a basic understanding of potions which seems to be equal to HS level chemistry at least. It seems to me as if it's not as good. Further on what would you compare Physics with or Biology or Nanotechnology or Electronics?\\
The fact is, we've got a lot more fields to specialise in than Wizards in the HP world does and that hurts such comparisons.
