Aurors are not general law enforcement. They are dark wizard catchers (and occasionally VIP bodyguards).

Magical Britain does not have an equivalent to the police. Each branch of the civil service also enforces the law that it is responsible for. Arthur drafts laws regarding Muggle artefacts and enforces those laws. Civil servants from Creatures conduct hearings and also perform enforcement. Etc.

The closest thing to the police is probably the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.

If you had to make a real life comparison for Aurors, I'd probably classify them as bounty hunters on retainer. They need to know potions because it's an extremely useful branch of magic both for themselves and for the individuals they are trying to catch. They need to understand how to recognise and counter potions than their enemies are using as well as take advantage of potions themselves.
