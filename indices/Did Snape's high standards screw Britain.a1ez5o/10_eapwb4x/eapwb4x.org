Snape's standards had no effect whatsoever on the number of Healers and Aurors during his tenture. Why? Because when we see Harry and Ron take NEWT Potions, they are the only ones who didn't have the appropriate textbook required for the class. There were a total of 12 students in that class, yet two of them lacked the book needed.

What it actually implies is that Harry and Ron were the only students there who had Exceeds Expectations. Everyone else in Slughorn's class earned an Outstanding on their Potions OWL because they already knew they were taking the class and met Snape's standards. Meaning that even after the standards of NEWT Potions were lowered, 10 out of the 12 students taking NEWT Potions were students who already met Snape's standards for an Outstanding. The only students who were actually impacted by Snape's standards in Harry's year were Harry and Ron. The rest of Harry's year either got an Acceptable or lower on their OWLs (which is still lower than Slughorn's standard and the standard for other NEWT subjects), or they were already taking NEWT Potions since they got an Outstanding (i.e. Hermione, Draco, and everyone else in that class except Harry and Ron).

Also, given that there are at least 40 students in Harry's year (since Rowling specifically listed 40 students as a minimum), the fact that 10 students out of 40 students got an Outstanding means that 25% (or one-quarter) of the students in Harry's year met Snape's standard. Let that sink in: 25% of Harry's year achieved the wizarding equivalent of an A or A* on their GCSE Chemistry exam. Its also implied (but not explicitly confimed) that very few students actually failed the Potions OWL, if any at all. Even in the case of Neville, we don't know if he failed the Potions OWL. All we know is that he didn't get an Exceeds Expectations or higher. Same goes with everyone else who didn't take Potions during HBP.

Also, there is another misconception that should be cleared up: NEWT Potions is NOT actually required to become an Auror. McGonagall recommended DADA, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology and Potions as the best subjects to ensure that Harry is qualified enough to pass Auror training. But the actual Auror requirements are just having any 5 NEWTs at Exceeds Expectations or higher. Aurors don't needed Potions or any of the aforementioned subjects. It wouldn't surprise me if many Aurors never even studied DADA at NEWT-level, given Dawlish's incompetence at dealing with Hagrid despite having several other Aurors as back-up. McGonagall mentioning those five subjects as the best subjects to be an Auror would be like saying that you need to study History to become a historian. It isn't actually required, since one could study Journalism, English, Politics, or Law and still acquire the required skills needed for being a historian. However, studying History just makes understanding the job easier than doing a completely unrelated subject (i.e. biology).

*TL;DR: Snape's standards didn't affect Britain at all. Its a common misconception that Snape's teaching standards negatively impacted Magical Britain due to him being an easy character to vilify. Another misconception is the idea that Potions is needed to be an Auror.*
