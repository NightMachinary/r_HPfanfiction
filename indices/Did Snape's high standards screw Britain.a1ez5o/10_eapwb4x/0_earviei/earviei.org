While interesting, some of this is false. You claim Potions and the others were merely recommendations to become an Auror, and that any 5 NEWTs would do. This is incorrect. Harry received 5 OWLs that would get him into the NEWT course (DADA, Transfiguration, Herbology, Charms and Care of Magical Creatures) and yet identified his lack of an "O" in Potions as spelling the death knell to his dream to be an Auror. This shows that, yes, Potions is required as are the others. Otherwise Harry's reaction made no sense, he had the required number of OWLs if what you were saying there was correct. Just look:

  Harry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regret. . . . This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn't, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.

Now for the longer one. You make a big deal about the pass percentage but that doesn't seem to be much in context. In the NEWT DADA class Snape taught, Harry mentions that "at least half the class" could cast a Shield Charm already because Harry taught them in the DA. The exact number isn't mentioned, but the named students in the class (in that chapter anyway) are:

Parvati, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Ernie and Draco.

Now ignoring Draco, we know that means Snape's DA class was at least 16 people (plus Draco). 8 of those at least were taught the Shield Charm by Harry. So that means nearly half the class (ignore the DA members) passed the DADA OWL despite the surely shit teaching that Umbrige did. I'm too lazy to check for anything more precise about the number of students in the DADA class that year (I'd have to comb HBP to see if I missed any), nor to see the other classes, but my basic point is that JKR clearly didn't think through the math on pass rates and high achievers. If Umbridge's non-teaching still managed to get through nearly as many people as Snape (she passed 9, he got 10 prior to Ron & Harry), and more if we counted the DADA members (which would be silly, but I can't get a more accurate number right now), then it surely doesn't count for Snape to have passed about the same number. Her pass rate is either just under or even higher than 25% and that's before the DADA are counted.

But mostly, I think my first response is really relevant because the answer is certain there. Potions and the other subjects are specifically required for those careers.
