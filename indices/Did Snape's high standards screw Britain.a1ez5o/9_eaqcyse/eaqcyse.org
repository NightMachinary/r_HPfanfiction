I think the implications would be much broader. As well as the ones mentioned, I imagine a steady rise in potion prices due to the lack of specialists. And I mean all potions slowly becoming unavailable to larger and larger portions of populations, which unproportionally enriches those who sell them, drives the prices of ingredients down because of reduction in sales and market overflow, and, worst of all, increases the number of accidents related to black market potions of shitty quality and to attempted home-brewing. And that would increase the need for healers, as well.

The ripples terrify me as someone who studies management and economics. If Snape continued teaching for another couple decades, he would have single-handedly driven Magical Britain's law-enforcement, creature breading, ingredient farming (or whatever it's called), medicine, and science (Department of Mysteries, I suppose) sectors into the ground.

Edit: I may have exaggerated a bit)
