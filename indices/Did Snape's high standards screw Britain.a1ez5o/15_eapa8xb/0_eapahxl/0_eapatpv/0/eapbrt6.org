Well.. It's also confirmed that Snape did not take people with an Acceptable in his NEWT classes.. Therefore the odds of someone getting into his class in the first place is miniscule, especially given Snape's obvious biases.

And not everyone aiming for a Potions NEWT is going to get it with the aim of going in to either the Auror or Healer program.. Hence me claiming that Snape has fucked the country in all the years he's been the Hogwarts Potions Teacher..
