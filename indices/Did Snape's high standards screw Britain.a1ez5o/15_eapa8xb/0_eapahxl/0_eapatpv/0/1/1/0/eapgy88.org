Actually, I think it's more that because wizards live so long, that there isn't a shortage. Dumbledore still wore three hats at over 120 years old, and Madame Marchbanks was even older, and still working. It's not unlikely that Healers would continue working up to and over 100 years old. So a fully staffed hospital from 50 years ago would likely still have many of the same staff. The community is too small to demand many healers, and too long-lived to demand a high intake.
