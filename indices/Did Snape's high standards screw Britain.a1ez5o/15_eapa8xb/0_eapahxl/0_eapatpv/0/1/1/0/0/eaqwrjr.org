I think you have an excellent point. Many working professionals we see, including teachers, have a vast age range. No doubt even if Dumbledore had perceived the problem, he would think it was a minor matter that could be addressed later. I think though that the two wars had an effect on certain professions, particularly the aurors. They would have encountered problems due to the aurors who died during the war with no good replacements.
