As someone upthread pointed out, only two of the twelve students in Slughorn's sixth year class didn't have books, which mean that the other ten had already known that they would be taking Potions that year - in other words, at least ten out of the (according to JKR) forty students in Harry's year had achieved an O in Potions. That's a quarter of the year.

And Snape is not the only teacher who doesn't accept students who have an A OWL in his subject - Mcgonagall refuses to accept Neville into her NEWT class with an A because she doesn't believe he'll be able to handle the coursework.
