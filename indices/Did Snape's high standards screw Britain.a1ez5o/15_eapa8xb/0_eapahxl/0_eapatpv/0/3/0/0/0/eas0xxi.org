No, they didn't say anything about A's. The OP is talking about EE grades. It seems obvious that someone who barely passed their OWL shouldn't continue to NEWT level, but an EE should be a decent base of knowledge to continue with. All the other NEWT courses we are shown in canon (Transfiguration and Charms) needed only an EE OWL.
