This is ridiculous. Snape only excepts the best most driven students (the people who got O's at OWL level) aka the people who probably could pass via self study. Why would they bother to have potion NEWT classes if it was so easy that literally anyone can pass it? This stinks of trying to justify Snape's actions.
