It's not canon, but the best fanon explanation I've read for why he's allowed to do this is from Prince of Slytherin, where he says it's not that hard to pass the Potions NEWT by self-study.

  "Honestly, Potter," Snape drawled, "use that brain that you somehow acquired despite sharing genetic material with your father and brother! Since I instituted a policy of only allowing Outstanding students to proceed past Fifth Year in my class, I have never had more than eight students in a given year graduate having completed the two-year NEWTs Potion curriculum. And yet, somehow, fifteen to twenty Hogwarts graduates pass the NEWT Potions exam every year. Now how would you explain this discrepancy?

  Harry blinked. "I would guess ... that the last two years of the Potions class aren't actually necessary to pass the NEWT exam?" he said uncertainly.

  "Of course not!" the Professor snapped. "Do you really think the Headmaster -- to say nothing of the Ministry -- would tolerate a policy put in place by /me/ that significantly reduced the number of applicants eligible to enter the Auror Academy or to apprentice at St. Mungo's? Especially if that policy blatantly favored Slytherins?
