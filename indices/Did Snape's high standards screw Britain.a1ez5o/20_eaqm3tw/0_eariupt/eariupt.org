But Harry (not sure about Ron) presumably did a lot of extra Potions studying. He knew he needed an O in Potions to become an Auror. I'm sure Hermione made him spend extra time on Potions studying.

Also, again, they're not dumb students. They could've taught themselves through Hermione for their OWLs.
