Say that 5 people each year wanted to join the Auror's but only one of them got the grades to go into the NEWT classes. That'd effectively remove 4/5th of the potential Auror's. Now, for simplicity's sake let's do a decade. Meaning we've got a total of 50 students that's wanted to join the aurors but only 10 of them have. Now we have about 5 named Auror's and no number on how many there are. But I'd think there'd at least be 20 of them and not more than a hundred. So either way you look at it another 50 is a boon.\\
Now what would that mean for the war effort? Well for one, more manpower means more operations going on at once. It also means more defensive projects can be done at once as well, as they are likely to be time consuming.
