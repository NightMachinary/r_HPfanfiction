While I understand your point, you are making significant leaps with regards to number assumptions. A couple points:

Point 1:

Just because 5 people wanted to join the Aurors each year, doesn't mean they would all make it, even IF they were allowed into NEWT classes. I would imagine based upon what knowledge we have about the Auror corps, that the application and training process weeds out quite a few potential candidates. This means that another 50 over 10 years is HIGHLY unlikely because that would be a 100% acceptance and auror graduation rate. Looking at real-life numbers for comparison when it comes to similar types of elite units, the reality is of those 50, likely only about 10-15 would actually make it.

To shore up this point further, we do know that via info from Minerva McGonagall and Tonks, that not a single Auror had been taken on by the Ministry of Magic for 3 years prior to 1995. This means that even the few that made it past snape, did not make it into the Aurors. Tonks graduates to full-fledged Auror in 1994 meaning she would have been the last candidate taken on (in 1991)

Point 2:

We know there are a significant number of Aurors because while we only hear 6 named ones or so, there are multiple occasions where we hear about Aurors stationed elsewhere. We can also extrapolate that its unlikely Harry would know every Auror via a connection, and then by looking at how many students are in Hogwarts and realizing there may be homeschooled students or possible foreign applicants, we can make some estimates. Taking this route would lead us to the assumption that the Auror force is likely no less than 50 strong, even after losing many in the first war. Tacking on another 10-15 is unlikely to make much of a difference, especially since its also likely that many of that "possible 50" die in the 10 years we are discussing. Meanwhile, Voldemorts forces are quite larger later on, and he has corrupted some of the Aurors, and has his fingers in the ministry via Malfoy and others. This further weakens the Auror forces.

At the end of the day, even if we were generous with the numbers and said 25, I don't see that making much of a difference in the war itself from what we know about how it goes if for no other reason than Voldemort could have taken a significant number out singlehandedly.
