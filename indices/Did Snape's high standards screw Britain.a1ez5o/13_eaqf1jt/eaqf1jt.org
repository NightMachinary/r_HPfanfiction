It definitely would have led to lower numbers of healers and Aurors.

However, the question is more... was it significant enough to actually play a role in the "war" against Voldemort or not. In my view, the numbers lost would not have been enough to really change anything major in terms of the 2nd Voldemort "war" if you will. I don't forsee enough extra healers or Aurors each year being added over the course of Snape's tenure, if Snape was not teaching, to make a difference in the grand scheme of things.

Might the extra numbers have helped save a few people, or delayed certain things? Perhaps. But at the end of the day, the problems that led to what was occurring within the British Wizarding world (specifically in the last 2 books) would have wiped the slate clean if you will in terms of any effect Snape would have had on the future Magical Britains society long term. A rebuild would have occurred either way.

I guess my point is, It certainly had an effect, but the reality is that effect was not impactful in any significant way to Magical Britain going forward.
