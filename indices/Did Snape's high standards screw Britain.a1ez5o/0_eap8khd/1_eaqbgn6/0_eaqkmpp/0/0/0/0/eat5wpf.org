Because how many Aurors people do remember about? Moody was retired already, Shacklebolt lived through, nobody likes Dawlish anyway, Proudfoot and Savage aren't even given first names (or at least we don't know them), Scrimgeour would have died regardless of how many Aurors they had, Robards just got put on a bus ... and that's all of them, I think?
