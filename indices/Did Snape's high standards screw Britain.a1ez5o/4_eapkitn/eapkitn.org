To counter some of the top comments in this thread: it is well established that canon is written from Harry's perspective, who is not the most impartial of observers. Snape always loathed him -- and that loathing probably impacted his teaching -- but did that really have any effect on the other Houses?

He might have been snappish toward Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, but I don't believe there's any specific notion in canon that he taught them /unwell/. Slytherin, of course, isn't even considered here.

Also, Snape is -- as far as we know -- much better at potions than Slughorn. He is, in fact, a genius potioneer, and the book that he corrected /in his fifth(?) year/ shows this. It is highly likely the students that he favored actually benefited from this and turned out very well qualified.
