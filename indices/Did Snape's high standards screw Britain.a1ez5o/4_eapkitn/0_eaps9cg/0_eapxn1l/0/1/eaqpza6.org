The question you have to ask yourself is whether bad grades would legitimately keep people out of jobs if the jobs were needed and there were not enough people to hire with higher grades.

As far as I can tell, the only employers that Hogwarts has control over is whether they hire someone. If someone got crappy grades and apprenticed and worked hard, I doubt they'd be barred from a job in their chosen field.
