You're right, Harry's account is biased, but we do have some canon info that points to Snape having a negative effect on number of NEWT potions grads. For one, Snape only accepted O students into his NEWTS class while Slughorn and most other professors allowed E students in. This alone would have reduced the number of NEWT potions graduates, thus reducing the employee pool for Healers, Potioneers and Aurors. For another, teaching is its own specialty skill set - being a potions genius does not make Snape a good teacher, so that doesn't actually qualify as an argument.

From a common sense perspective, it doesn't sit right that Hogwarts would have a bad teacher for such an important subject, but with Binns, Trelawny and various DADA profs as examples, Dumbledore's hiring practices do seem to be more about politics and war and less about actual teaching credentials.
