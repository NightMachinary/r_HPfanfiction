Something that we don't have an eye on though is the NEWT pass rate for O level students vs EE level students. If Slughorn accepts 20 students (8 O's and 12 EE's) and then graduates 16 students with 6 O's, 5 EE's, 5 A's and the rest not passing vs Snape accepting 8 O students and graduating 8 students who all receive O on their NEWTS it could be argued that Snape is putting out overall better qualified potion students.

I would also counter myself by saying that it should not be the point of primary/secondary schooling to produce masters of any discipline. That is what professional training and apprenticeships are for.
