When I was applying to nursing school they had a higher gpa requirement for the program than other programs had. It didn't matter if someone was interested in nursing or not, if you didn't have a certain grade as a prerequisite, you were not accepted.

Sure, someone with lower grades may have done well enough to graduate. But historically it was judged that the level of work needed for those students to be successful vs what was lost for the other students wasn't worth it.

I disagree with Snapes methodology (assuming that this was his methodology), but I can understand it. An OWL is considered the qualification to be a Wizard. Having an OWL in potions should mean you can go out and pick up some ingredients and instructions and make the common potions needed by the average wizard. NEWTS are for people who need specialized knowledge for exacting jobs.
