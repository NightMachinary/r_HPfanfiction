  I believe that such an individual would be thrilled to share this knowledge, but most of the students he teaches aren't able to comprehend potions as well as he does or are not motivated enough to (they're "dunderheads") and this irritates him to no reason.

I'm not sure about that - there is a reason a lot of prodigies go into research rather than teaching. Teaching is its own area of interest and being really good at something doesn't automatically make you a good teacher. Lupin is not said to be particularly gifted in any area of magic (more of a jack of all trades) but he's presented as a great teacher. Snape likes research and is interested in teaching DADA - anything about him liking to teach potions is conjecture not supported by existing canon. I love baking and I'm good at it - but I don't want to teach it and actually only like to bake when I have the kitchen to myself without anyone bothering me. I did support myself during uni by tutoring math which I was average at.

Having said that, IF I was Dumbles, I would hire a junior professor to teach the first four years of potions and leave Snape to only teach the older students once they have the basics down.
