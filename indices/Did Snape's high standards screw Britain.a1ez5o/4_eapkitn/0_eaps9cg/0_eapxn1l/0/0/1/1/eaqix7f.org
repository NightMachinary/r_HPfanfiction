Well, I can't help but agree. I've argued extensively that there's little proof Snape's a poor educator to people outside Harry's clique; but conversely, I have to admit there's little proof that he's in any way great.

The idea with Snape teaching the upperlevel-classmen is a good gone. Especially if it would be a specialised course. Sadly, as you pointed out, Dumbledore's decision had precious little to do with education.
