These are good points. I'd specifically agree with the faculty; one of my thoughts was that -- if Snape was indeed causing such harm -- then surely someone from the Board of Governors or the Ministry would have noticed, brought it up to attention...but indeed there are many questionable faculty members, although that's probably since such a topic simply lies outside the scope of the series.

For the O vs. E, it's reasonable to assume that Snape' standards were simply higher. An argument could be made that as potions is such a critical area for healers/aurors (where any mistake could lead to death), Snape wanted to cut away those with lower knowledge as not only would they pose a higher risk to both themselves and others, but it would let him focus on the best and brightest.

It's debatable, of course.

When I think of Snape, however, I always remember the first speech that he gave about potions: "...there is little foolish wand waving here...I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron...the delicate power of liquids...bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."

That is poetic. That is a man who loves his subject, who is, in fact, deeply passionate about it. And this is only underscored by the fact that he's very well versed in other magical areas as well, those that do involve "foolish wand waving" as we see later on, when he's able to successfully fend off McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout at the same time.

I believe that such an individual would be thrilled to share this knowledge, but most of the students he teaches aren't able to comprehend potions as well as he does or are not motivated enough to (they're "dunderheads") and this irritates him to no reason.

So this then leads us to question whether he's an abysmal teacher to students outside of Harry's friend circle. The answer is: we don't know. It's conjecture. What we do know is that he significantly improved many areas of potion-brewing, which would probably pass into the notes and lectures he gave, which probably improves the knowledge students gained.

Additionally, I /would/ argue that the students who make it into his NEWTS class -- the ones who are not "dunderheads" -- would benefit deeply from the secrets he shares, which would turn them into high class professionals.
