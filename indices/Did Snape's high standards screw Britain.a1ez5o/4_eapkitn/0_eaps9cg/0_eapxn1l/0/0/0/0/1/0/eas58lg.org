You raise some good points there. Honestly, it would seem logical to me that potions would be a critical area for healers and aurors both, and I'd expect that a potions NEWT would be required too.

I'd say, however, that the pass percentages are still very pertinent. The fact that teachers like Umbridge and Snape are passing students with O's speaks not to their low qualifications but -- just as you pointed out -- to the independent study of those students. The way I see it, Hogwarts, due to the small teacher-student ratio and the specialisations that students begin to seek in their latter years, highly promotes self-study. As there are no magical universities that we know of, students after Hogwarts get sent straight into the work-force, which means that by year 5, they're already looking at potential careers and that those careers demand. Which means they are motivated to study and excel in the fields they need, while dropping subjects they have no interest in (It would be doubtful, for example, that an Auror would need divination).

So, essentially, what that means is that about 25% of Harry's year feel they /need/ a Potions (or DA) NEWT -- and are consequently motivated enough to seek it.
