  Additionally, I would argue that the students who make it into his NEWTS class -- the ones who are not "dunderheads" -- would benefit deeply from the secrets he shares, which would turn them into high class professionals.

There's something implicit in statements like this that many people may not appreciate. Of course in large countries, with multiple schools and universities, filtering out students of lesser ability is a sign of prestige and distinction. Many American universities publish their acceptance rates, as if to show how exclusive they are. In smaller countries, especially those small enough to only have one university, or even sharing a university with multiple member countries, the priorities are somewhat reversed. They share the priority to identify and reward excellence with the priority to graduate enough qualified individuals to keep governments, hospitals, schools and private businesses running.

Hogwarts, as far as J K Rowling has shown, is the only school in Magical Britain. Snape's potions class is the only potions class. Thus he has the responsibility of not just acting as gatekeeper, but also to see that enough graduate his class to go on to do important work, not just directly related to potions, but beyond it in law enforcement, medicine, etc. To give a real life example, I went to a regional university with multiple member countries. What they did was make it relatively easy to pass a class with a C, but very difficult to get an A (or an O in the magical world). So exceptional pupils are distinguished from mediocre ones by their grades, but are not filtered out as ruthlessly as they would be in a more exclusive university. They don't need every doctor to be a MacGyver, ER superhero, someone needs to be treating colds and broken bones too.

With such a tiny population, I would argue that they have enough problems getting *any* class of professional at all, let alone worrying about getting high class professionals. Slytherin is also the house of pureblood prejudice and favoritism, and Snape displays favoritism towards Slytherins multiple times throughout canon. I have trouble believing someone so partial and biased would have such high minded ideals behind his high standards for NEWTs.

More likely I think is the explanation that he had a natural antipathy for teaching, and so tried to reduce his teaching load whenever possible. Dumbledore's hiring decisions were never made with actual education in mind, so he didn't intervene. That Snape could claim to Voldemort later that he ruined a generation of potential aurors and healers would seem to be a nice bonus.
