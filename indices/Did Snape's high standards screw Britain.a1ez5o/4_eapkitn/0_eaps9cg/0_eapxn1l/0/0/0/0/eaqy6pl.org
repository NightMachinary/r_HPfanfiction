This is a very thought-provoking comment. Admittedly, I did not consider the exclusivity of potions at Hogwarts.

However, there is a fantastic post lower in the thread by [[/u/lunanight][u/lunanight]] pointing out that Snape's acceptance rate into his NEWT classes is actually quite high: 25% of Harry's year. That seems to dispel the notion that Snape was wary of his teaching load; most likely, he simply did not see the need to educate those who were unable to achieve outstanding marks. At this point, especially in the upper classes, the burden of education would lie with the student; after all, Hermione, whom Snape did not favor in the least, managed quite well in potions...why? Because she was willing to put in the time.

Also, he was very eager to each DADA throughout the year, which signifies that he was not averse to the notion of teaching.

Now, don't mistake my words for the argument that Snape was a fantastic teacher. A high part of an educator's role is to motivate the student, make them eager to learn, and we all perfectly know that, in regards to Harry and his classmates, Snape failed at that, and failed miserably.

However, what we don't know is whether he treated the other houses in the same manner. But I've stated my position to that above.
