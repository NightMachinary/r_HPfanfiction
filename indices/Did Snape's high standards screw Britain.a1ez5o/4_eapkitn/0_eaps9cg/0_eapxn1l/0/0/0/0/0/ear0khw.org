I read that comment as well, and it made several excellent points using canon. It is suprising that 25% of Hogwarts students managed an O in their Potions OWL. It does give persuasive evidence that Snape can't be that bad, except I still think it unnecessary that he only accept O students when Mcgonagall accepted EE students.

Transfiguration is also portrayed as a difficult branch of magic and Mcgonagall portrayed as incredibly strict, yet EE students were allowed in the class. It makes me wonder what those students sacrificed to get an O in Potions OWL knowing that that was the NEWT requirement while other subjects were less stringent.

It would be better if we got an idea of the rest of the grades. What story would it tell about Snape if 25% of his students got O's but 50% got P's or worse? If he really just wants to identify and propagate only the best students, then what happens to the rest who are mediocre? I think his treatment of Harry and Ron could be indicative. But now I'm going into speculation and I'll stop before I'm accused of bashing.
