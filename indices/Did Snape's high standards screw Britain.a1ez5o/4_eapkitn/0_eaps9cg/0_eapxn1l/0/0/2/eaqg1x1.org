Plus, and I feel like I say this every time the subject comes up, Snape offers remedial potions lessons often enough that neither Draco nor Lucius Malfoy, nor the Dark Lord, Umbridge or /any other person/ questions his story that Harry is receiving remedial potions lessons in OotP as a cover for the occlumency lessons.

He clearly believes that practically everyone will accept that he is giving extra lessons to a student he hates.

This leads me to believe that under normal circumstances, despite his massive work schedule (seriously have a look at whitehound's meta about how many hours Hogwarts teachers work) Snape might be willing to offer extra tuition to students who want to take Potions at NEWT level but don't quite make the grade.
