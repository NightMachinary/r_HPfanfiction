Well, sure...but the original statement argues that Snape's poor teaching is responsible for a deficit of Healers and Aurors on a nationwide level. I find that to be quite a leap, especially since, as I have stated, canon is written from Harry's perspective.

If you're defending OP's position, then, well, the burden of proof is on you. I'll readily admit I haven't read canon in quite some time, so it's possible I've forgotten details.
