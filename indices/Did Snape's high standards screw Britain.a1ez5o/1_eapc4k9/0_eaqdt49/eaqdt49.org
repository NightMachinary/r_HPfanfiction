there's nothing in cannon indicating that people couldn't register and take NEWTs at the Ministry's Magical Education Department. so even if you didn't take Snape's class you could self-study during/after Hogwarts if you wanted to go into a job that required a potions NEWT.

Even so if you look at hiring practices IRL having a degree is nice and it shows a level of competency in a subject, but if you can demonstrate a similar level of skill through other means (portfolio, past employment, recommendations) you will still be hired, usually with a slightly lower salary compared to someone with a degree but not always.
