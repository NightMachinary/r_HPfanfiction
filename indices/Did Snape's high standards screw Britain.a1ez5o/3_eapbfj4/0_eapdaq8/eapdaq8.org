Molly's failure to get rid of a Boggart doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't know /how/.

It means that under pressure and faced with her worst fear (which is the whole point of Boggarts) she couldn't focus enough to do it. That's not a problem that "better teachers at school level" would automatically fix.
