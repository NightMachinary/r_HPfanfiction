Strange, if you know what your biggest fear is, then you should IMHO not be shocked (many of the students knew! For Ron it was a spider, for Molly it was losing her family, for Harry it was fear itself...if you don't know? Yeah, I bet you'd be shocked for a few seconds, but you soon realize that it isn't going to hurt you (shock you? Yeah! Attack and kill you? No!) so you should be able to cast!)
