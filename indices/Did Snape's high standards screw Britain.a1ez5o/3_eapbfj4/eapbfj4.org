There should be fewer qualified wizards for everything from Britain, thanks to Snape. I think all of the important jobs require OWLs or NEWTs in the subject, even things like curse-breaking (gotta know your potions in case some ancient booby trap gets you!), or magizoology (you'll need antidotes).

Even worse is the fact that since Voldemort cursed the DADA job, there must have been fewer and fewer students getting passing grades in this subject as the quality of teachers dropped. See: Molly Weasley, gifted with household charms and so forth, but unable to banish a boggart, something Ginny learns to do in her second year. If you want to be good at Defense in a post-Voldy curse world, you have to be driven enough to learn it alone. In hindsight, this was really clever of Voldemort. Most people were not qualified to fight against him when the war began.

The board of governors and Dumbledore have a lot to answer for...
