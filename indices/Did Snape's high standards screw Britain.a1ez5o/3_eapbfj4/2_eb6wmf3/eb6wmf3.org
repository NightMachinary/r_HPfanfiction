Agreed, Dumbledore really screwed the pooch here! Either break the curse, or if you can't? Invent another freaking class, call it whatever you want and hire a houself (on rotating basis, so each houself at Hogwarts gets a turn and then we start fresh!) to "teach defense" (this way the curse is appeased and you get students that know what they are doing in the new "defense" class!)
