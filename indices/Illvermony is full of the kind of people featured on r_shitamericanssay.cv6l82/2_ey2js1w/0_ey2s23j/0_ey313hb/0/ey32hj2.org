An AK is a Commie Weapon!

(I think even if the muggleborn has some sort of open carry license, an ak pattern rifle would draw way more attention from cops.)

(On a side note, are there Semi-auto AKs? (+just remembered the dragunov is semi-auto,+ nope just resembles an AK, any others?) The us might have lax gun laws in many ways but we do have an auto weapons ban.) ( I do think I've seen a Dragunov in person before though, that's edit:*/NOT/* a semi-auto AK pattern)
