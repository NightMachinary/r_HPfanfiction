Hold up, you lost me when you brought non-canon sources in. JKR has retconned ludicrous things - you can take her seriously if you like, but i don't think many in this community do.

/In the story/, Dumbledore doesn't know. He never united the Hallows. We never see whether Master of Death is a symbolic or concrete title.

You are fine to /interpret/ Dumbledore's hypothesis as being factual. That's fine. But you don't get to determine what MoD means in terms of the Harry Potter world. Neither does JK "wizards just shit wherever then Vanished it" Rowling.

It would be like if we found a note from Tolkien, written years after LoTR, that the One Ring actually didn't corrupt anyone, Gollum just ate a bad mushroom or something. At some point, the work grows beyond the author.

HP 1-7 doesn't definitively answer the MoD question. If you can show a quote that refutes that /from canon/, I'll happily pay attention. Otherwise, you're just trying to police how other people read the books. That's not a very nice thing to do.
