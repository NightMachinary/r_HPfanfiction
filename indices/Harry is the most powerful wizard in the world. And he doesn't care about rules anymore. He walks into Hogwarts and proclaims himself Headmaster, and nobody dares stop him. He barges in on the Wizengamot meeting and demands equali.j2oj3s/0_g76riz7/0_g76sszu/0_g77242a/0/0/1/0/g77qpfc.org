It's not nebulous at all. Dumbledore is how JKR conveys information about the plot.

  JKR: Absolutely right, I find that all the time in the book, if you need to tell your readers something just put it in her. There are only two characters that you can put it convincingly into their dialogue. One is Hermione, the other is Dumbledore. In both cases you accept, it's plausible that they have, well Dumbledore knows pretty much everything anyway, but that Hermione has read it somewhere. So, she's handy.

I've edited my comments to show which ones were book quotes and which ones were my analysis. I copied a lot from a previous comment.

#+begin_quote
  *Alborz*: What does it mean to be the master of death

  *J.K. Rowling*: As Dumbledore explains, the real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living

  .*J.K. Rowling*:

  *J.K. Rowling*: It is not about striving for immortality, but about accepting mortality.

Like I said, Dumbledore is how JKR conveys world-building. Here is her saying directly that the master of death is about accepting mortality.

Edit: Taking this out to do more research. Largely irrelevant point anyway.
