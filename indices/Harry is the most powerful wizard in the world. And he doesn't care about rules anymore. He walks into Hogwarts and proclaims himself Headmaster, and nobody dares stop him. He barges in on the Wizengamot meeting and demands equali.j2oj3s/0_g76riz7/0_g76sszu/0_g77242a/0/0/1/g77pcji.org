Dumbledore doesn't know. He never had all 3 at once; no one did. Obviously the legend has a lot of speculation, given we know Lovegood and Grindelwald (and previously Dumbledore) believed in it. Dumbledore /assumes/ they were just powerful enchanted objects, but doesn't know for sure.

I don't know what your other quote is from; this is just a largely nebulous issue, like so many others in canon.
