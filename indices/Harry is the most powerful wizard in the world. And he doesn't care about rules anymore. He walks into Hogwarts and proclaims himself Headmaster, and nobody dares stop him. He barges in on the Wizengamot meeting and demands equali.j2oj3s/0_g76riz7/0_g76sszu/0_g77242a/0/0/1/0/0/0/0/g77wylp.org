Art =/= science, for one thing. You can't conduct a reliable and valid experiment, the way we can with vaccines, on a fantasy book series.

We agree, then, that there is nothing in HP canon that proves Dumbledore's theory that MoD is meaningless. The books have DD's opinion, which is never confirmed by someone actually uniting the Hallows.

And again, the story is the story - I don't need to read interviews with authors done 1 hour or 10 years after it is published to know the story.

I'm not even saying you're /wrong/. I am saying your opinion (which is what it is), is not a definitive statement that you took from the books. Let others enjoy the ideas in the books, no need for you to tell them that your interpetation of those ideas is right and they are wrong.
