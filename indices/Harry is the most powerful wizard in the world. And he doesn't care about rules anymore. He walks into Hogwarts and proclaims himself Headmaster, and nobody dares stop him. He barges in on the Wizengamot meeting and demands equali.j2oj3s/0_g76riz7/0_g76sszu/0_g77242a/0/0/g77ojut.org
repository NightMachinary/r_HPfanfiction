  /You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death.  He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying./

Being the true master of death (not the master of death in the fairy tale which is different) is all about accepting that you'll die. Not suddenly gaining immortality and the power to decide who dies and who lives.

The legend is just a legend. It does not confer immortality.

  were the three brothers of the tale,' said Dumbledore, nodding. ‘Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.

They're not perfect objects, and they're still limited by the ultimate rules of HP. You can't bring someone back from the dead. They're flawed objects, reflecting the fact that humans are flawed. They're powerful, the cloak can hide multiple people and has lasted far longer than any other invisibility cloak, but they're not perfect.

  Q: but they exsist in Canon, like the stone at the battle, so the Cloak is true Hallow that even Death was unable to detect....and yet Moody has even more power then Death. wth (what the heck?)

  A: Yes, the objects exist. But they're not created by death. They're created by people.The stone was an attempt to create an object capable of resurrection. It could summon shades but could not truly bring back people.Moody doesn't have more power than death. Moody's enchanted eye is simply superior to Peverell's enchanted invisibility cloak in their contest of concealment and detection.

  the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner.I mean to say, it is not a travelling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it.

These are the special powers of the cloak, which stem from Peverell's enchantments, not because death created it. It's a really good cloak, but it's not infallible and it was not created by death.
