I stick to what Rowling said; wands focus magic and make it more powerful and precise. Powerful wizards can also learn wandless magic and become pretty good at doing complex wandless magic, but overall it's less focused and controlled and there's no indication that it's more powerful than magic with a wand.

I generally prefer what Rowling says over headcanons, since she's the one who created the wizarding world and everything in it.
