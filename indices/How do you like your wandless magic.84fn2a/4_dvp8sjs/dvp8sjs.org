You know what I think would be an interesting take on it? Wandless magic is magic that has no barrier between intent and execution; this makes it very difficult for most people because they just don't see the world that way.

A wand is a tool and your spells a way to declare your intent. It's very formulaic and reliable, impersonal, and most importantly, widely teachable.

Wandless magic on the other hand is literally shaping the world as you see it. You see that feather over there? To "make" it float with wandless magic, you have to see it, almost /be/ it floating. No seperation. It takes a lot of discipline of mind to do something like that which is why a lot of people don't do it. It's also only as precise as your mind, so any large feats of wandless magic require a very creative mind that is completely confident in its ability to shape the world.

I figure that might also be a way to differentiate the "kind" of magic legendary people like Merlin and perhaps the founders used from the average witch or wizard.

edit: Actually, come to think of it, the kind of magic I'm describing is a lot like the "Old" magic (or whatever it was called) in linkffn(By the Divining Light).
