Since I know you mean wandless magic as in "casting spells without a wantd" I like it how enembee talks about it in Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone (chapter 6)

  "But that ritual magic that you showed me earlier was really useful," protested Harry.

  "And if you had been able to use a wand, you could have done it with a single charm. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred it is more practical and expedient to use your wand."

But in general, there is already other wandless magic that people use: Potions, Herbology, flying and so forth. They just tend not to be as direct as using a wand.
