  but more volatile and harder to focus

In my own fic, I basically go about it that way. However, I'm stipulating that outside an unreasonably small percentage of absurdly powerful and gifted wizards (Dumbles & Voldy mostly), one has to pick up wandless magic early in life, and more than likely mastering it beyond trivialities requires a true /need/ to master it. 'Need' as in survival, which matched quite well with the Harry I'm writing, as he's living on the streets. And since educated wizards learn to channel their magical power through wands, most lose the ability to intentionally do meaningful magic without a wand; it sort of atrophies with disuse.

I felt it was a reasonable extrapolation from how accidental magic is portrayed and described in canon. It can produce extraordinarily powerful magic, but it tends to be reactive to strong emotions and external pressures. I decided it would work better on larger scale, less delicate effects since the magic user lacks a way to focus it efficiently, but conversely it can produce much more powerful effects than most would otherwise be capable of using the focusing ability of wands.
