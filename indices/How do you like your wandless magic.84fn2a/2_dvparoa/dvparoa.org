I don't like it. Britain has the greatest wizards in the world in Dumbledore and Riddle. After them is Grindelwald, know what they all have? Wands. Clearly wands are essential to being a great wizard. If they weren't needed we wouldn't see them. Wandless magic is a step up from accidental magic and little more.
