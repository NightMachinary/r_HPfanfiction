A wand is a lever, a tool, a translator, a lens, and a musical instrument. Magic itself is powerful, but not using a wand hinders its greatest execution. Wandless magic is slow, rough, limited, and imprecise. I believe that the advantage of wanded magic is what allowed European wizards to set worldwide policy in the form of the Statute of Secrecy.
