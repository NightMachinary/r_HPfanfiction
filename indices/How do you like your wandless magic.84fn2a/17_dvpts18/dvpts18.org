I like wandless magic, but I hate how most people use it. In my mind, wandless magic should be more powerful than magic with wands, since it isn't hindered by an object or wand movements and incantations, but along the same vein, wandless magic should be incredibly imprecise and unpredictable, barely able to be controlled, making it inferior to magic with wands.
