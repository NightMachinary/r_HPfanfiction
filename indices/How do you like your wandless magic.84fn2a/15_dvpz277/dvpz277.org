I like to think that wandless magic can achieve anything a wand can do but takes much longer to learn for under half the power that you get using a wand.

Basically a wand is a training and power multiplier. Why learn a spell wandless when you can learn 15 other spells in that same amount of time that require a wand?

Before wands you would apprentice to a wizard and learn maybe 1 spell per year if you were good. Why would you need a school when that's about what you can expect from a good apprentice? After wands you're learning 10 or more spells per year it makes sense that with this new level of knowledge being thrown around you would create a center for knowledge and standardize the training.

Wandless magic then becomes more of a convenience thing like how to summon something without needing to grab your wand every time.
