To my mind, affecting something outside of yourself wandlessly takes more focus and effort than using a wand because your wand is already acting as a focus for your magic. So, warming your own hands wandlessly is pretty easy because your hands are an extension of yourself, but warming someone else's hands wandlessly would be much more difficult. This plays a bit into Apparation as it's not clear whether it's wandless or not.

Desire and emotion plays into it as well. In my stories, Harry has gotten pretty good at Vanishing bits of Ginny's clothing (Never to be seen again. Goodbye, favorite jeans!) because he has a strong desire to see them gone.

The material and nature of the object the wizard is acting on comes into play as well. A feather is relatively easy to get to float wandlessly because it already /wants/ to float and fly. Gold on the other hand is very stable and likes being exactly where and what it is, thanks very much, so a wizard will need to work very hard and practice a lot to get it to do anything without the additional help of a wand.

I think that because wandless magic is just that bit harder to use and use well, that most witches and wizards don't bother with it.
