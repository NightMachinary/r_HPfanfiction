I assume you mean wandless spellcasting because things like potions are wandless magic too.

Anyway, I prefer wandless spellcasting to be clearly separated from the wanded one. No casting of the same spells just without wand. Wandless spells also shouldn't be superior to wanded in power. The advantage may lie in the surprise factor, in not needing to have wand in hand, but in general, they should be auxillary.
