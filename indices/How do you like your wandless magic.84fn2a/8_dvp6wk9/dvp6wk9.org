Wandless magic is more imprecise, maybe connected to emotions more (like little children doing some magic when they're angry or frightened). I think much stronger wizards can get away with more complicated spells but it takes a lot of practice and strength, although I don't think that a Killing Curse could be cast without a wand, nonverbal maybe but not wandless. Something simple - day to day spells in household, something more complicated but still simple in its form - yes, but complicated transfiguration of an object? I don't think that could be achieved without a wand. Considering a wand as a tool it channels magic, helps you shape it and use it. Providing a student with a wand from early age, I think it may not prevent them of growing those capabilities but makes it harder for them later in life. Like learning different language, as a child it goes far better than during your adult life (not for everyone of course)
