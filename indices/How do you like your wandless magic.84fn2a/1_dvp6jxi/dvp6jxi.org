I tend to see wandless magic used as shorthand to indicate that a character has remarkable amounts of power and sufficient discipline/focus to use it. The trouble with this is that if the character is the only one with wandless magic in the whole story, it means they're overpowered for the setting, which renders the conflict generally less interesting.

Thus, I absolutely agree that every magical skill, wandless magic included, needs to have limitations, not be some magical McGuffin whose mastery means you automatically win. I don't have a particular requirement for what the price of wandless magic should be, but it should most certainly have one. Since wandless magic isn't specifically taught at Hogwarts, I also like contemporary or Hogwarts-set fics to explain why. Just my personal preference, of course.
