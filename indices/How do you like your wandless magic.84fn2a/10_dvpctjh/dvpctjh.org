I like it to be only for the powerful and only for simple things. I like to think of it as not the same as casting wanded spells.

So even if you can use it you are not casting a lumos or an accio or wingardium leviosa but rather it is unfocused and less useful.\\
You might be able to create light but its just going to be a hazy illuminated area around you.\\
You might be able to pull on things but it is not a long range target spells its more of a line of sight pull (or push) on an area.

Similarly i like stave based magic to be more powerful but less able to do complicated spells but rather to have massive battlefield magic, meteors, fireballs, ice, lightning storms, earthquakes and maybe rituals as well.
