[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is the top fic in this case, but you should have read it already.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), the primary threat was being dealt with efficiently and quickly, but there's a second part to the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][A Crime Fitting the Punishment or Dumbledore's Monster]], linkffn(8854828), is a total bash of Dumbledore's "second chances" philosophy. The time traveling Harry not only killed off the future, but massacred his enemies within a week upon his return without taking out Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]], linkffn(6256154), should hold the record in how fast (12 hours) Harry dispatched Voldemort. While the action scenes are entertaining, I think his course of actions is very stupid: his time travels to 12 hours before Voldemort's graveyard resurrection, but instead of raiding Voldemort's weak homunculus form in Riddle Manor, a fact Harry knew, he resorted to storm heavily warded places such as Malfoy Manor and Azkaban. There is really no need to get all Horcruxes at all before facing off Voldemort, he just had to capture Voldemort, obliviate him back to infancy, dose it with Draught of Living Death, and deliver Voldemort to Dumbledore along with necessary information. Much easier, and much safer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), has Harry dealing with them in two phases. One happened before the school even began as he trapped Voldemort's soul in an object, and the second happened after Year 5 when he killed hundreds of blood purists within a few days. Hermione found out and wasn't happy for a long time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(4740107;7405516), are all examples of finishing them off efficiently and quickly, but they have heavy Weasley involvements.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455), is time travel all the way to 1930s. It's the only fic I know in which Hermione killed Tom in the orphanage instead of raising or shagging him. Unfortunately, there is not a lot you can write if things resolve that easily.

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), resolves the conflict very quickly too, but requires a super Harry who could take on Voldemort one an one.
