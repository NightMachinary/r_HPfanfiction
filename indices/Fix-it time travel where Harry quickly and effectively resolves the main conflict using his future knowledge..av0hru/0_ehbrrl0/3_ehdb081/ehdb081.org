Minor note about The Unforgiving Minute - One problem with doing that is that he doesn't trust Dumbledore to do what's needed. Like killing Harry. I suppose he could do that and deliver baby Voldemort, but I can easily see him not being satisfied leaving it in Dumbledore's hands. Even if that's the more sensible option.
