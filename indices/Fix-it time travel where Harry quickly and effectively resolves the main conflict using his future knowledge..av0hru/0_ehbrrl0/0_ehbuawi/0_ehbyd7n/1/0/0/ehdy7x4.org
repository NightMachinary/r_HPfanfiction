Yeah, what i meant is that with a Self Insert, if the self insert believes he or she is just dead and being in the wizarding world is a fidgment of her or his imagination, then just going along and doing pretty outlandish things to suposedly fictional characters, he or she would not feel guilty, because it would not the REALLY happening , you know?

If it is all make believe, then it really frees you from many responsabilities. You would not say an actor playing a muderer in a play is a murderer in real life...
