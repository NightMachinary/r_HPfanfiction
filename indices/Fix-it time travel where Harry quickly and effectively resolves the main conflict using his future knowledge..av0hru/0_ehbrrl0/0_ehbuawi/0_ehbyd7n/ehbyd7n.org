The only other fic I know in which Voldemort was neutralized through Obliviation is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363).

Since Voldemort was so fond of using Cruciatus, we need a fic in which he got crucioed into insanity, not to the level of his canon insanity where he still has super powers, but to the level of Longbottoms where he completely loses all his powers and reasoning abilities. As far as his wraith form is concerned, it seems to keep the mental state he was last in. Therefore, even if his wraith manages to escape the body, it will remain a confused and harmless spirit for all eternity.

That's another fate this total piece of shit deserves.
