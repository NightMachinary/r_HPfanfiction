I really like your idea for how to dela with Voldy- do you have any fic that does that? I mena, obliviating the guy and giving him to Dumbledore with the right information is great.

and I disagree with the assumption that dispaching Voldy that fast would kill the drama- The Death Eaters would still be there and the fight against magical racism surely was not over. Another Dark Lord-Lady surely would arise- and I would like to see ideas for it.
