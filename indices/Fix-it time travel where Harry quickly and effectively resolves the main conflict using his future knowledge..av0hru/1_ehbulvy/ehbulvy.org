So, this made two fics come to mind for me.

The first, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child to Lead Them]] by White Squirrel is Hermione-centric. Rather than going back to 1991, she goes back to 1981 and has to be taken seriously as a toddler in order to stave off The Bad Things. It's short (30k words) and I quite enjoyed it.

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]] by timunderwood9. There's a lot more, well, planning that goes into Harry's fix-it plan, but when he decides to pull the trigger, oh boy, he certainly takes care of business. Hermione serves as the narrator for most of the story, which if actually a really great way of writing a time-traveler fic - we get to see how the non-time travelers react to his actions. I really liked it. It's also rather short (40k words).

Both of these stories are Harry/Hermione, so if that's a deal breaker for you, oh well. But if you like the parring, or if you're simply not bothered by it, these are quite the treat.
