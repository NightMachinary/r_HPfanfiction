I distinctly remember a fic where Harry goes back in the past because his timeline ended up in some weird universe where the whole world was on the cusp of being destroyed. He returns at the end of DoM and immediately starts ordering people around. Neville (clueless at that point) gets a lot of responsibilities because in Harry's future he is equal in strength to Harry. Drawing a blank on the name though.
