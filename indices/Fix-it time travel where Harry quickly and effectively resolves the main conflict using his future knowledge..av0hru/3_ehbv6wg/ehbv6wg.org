Just remembered another one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]] by Madm05. Hermione goes back in time to the 70's and interacts with James and co. It's from Jame's point of view and continues on after Hermione manages to curb-stomp Voldie. It's a bit more Romance centered than the others I recommended, being both HHr and JP/LE. 25k words.
