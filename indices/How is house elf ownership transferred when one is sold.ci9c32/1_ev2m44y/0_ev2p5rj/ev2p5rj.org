There actually is evidence of the bond being magical, Dumbledore mentions it when he talks about Kreacher.

  "Oh, yes," said Dumbledore. "You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoy's our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. *He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius*. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it."

Though I do believe that a decent amount of indoctrination is involved so they dont betray their master like Kreacher did by misinterpreting the wordings of the orders, and so they view being freed as inherently wrong.

But we know that the bond isn't transferred by informing the Elf about who owns the Property, because in Half-Blood-Prince they actively used the bond to find out who owns the property when nobody knew who owned 12 Grimmauld Place.
