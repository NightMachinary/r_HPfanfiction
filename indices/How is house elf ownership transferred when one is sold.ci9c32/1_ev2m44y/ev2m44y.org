Strictly speaking, I don't believe there is hard canon evidence of an inherently magical House-Elf bond --- it could just as easily be that the rules of obedience and all their arcane special cases like the clothes-thing are just ingrained in Elf mentality, whether culturally or through hereditary knowledge (which we know is a thing in /HP/ magic: consider Parseltongue).

So it could be as easy as the old Master of the House-Elf informing them that it's all legally arranged and now /that/ guy over there is your Master. And the Elf's drive to slavishly obey would transfer to that guy.

Even if one goes with a more directly magical bond, I think it would still work along those lines, because the spellwork, however it worked, would likely be clever enough to know to adjust if the House-Elf in question knows for sure that they have been bought and paid for. /Not/ including provisions for sales and inheritances would be a pretty blatant design flaw that whoever originally designed the bond would have thought of from a mile away.
