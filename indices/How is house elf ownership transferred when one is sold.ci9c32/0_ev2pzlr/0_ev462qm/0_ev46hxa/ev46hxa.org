Dumbledore didn't know if Harry inherited the house, that was the whole point of testing Kreachers obedience.

  "That is generous," said Dumbledore. "We have, however, vacated the

  building temporarily."

  "Why?"

  "Well," said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who

  was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead,

  "Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct

  line, to the next male with the name of 'Black.' Sirius was the very last of the

  line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were

  childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have

  the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has

  been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other

  than a pureblood."

  A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius's mother that

  hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry's

  mind. "I bet there has," he said.

  "Quite," said Dumbledore. "And if such an enchantment exists, then the

  ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius's living

  relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange."

  Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the

  telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange,

  Sirius's killer, inherit his house?

  "No," he said.

  "Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn't get it either," said

  Dumbledore calmly. "The situation is fraught with complications. We do not

  know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for

  example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed

  from Sirius's hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at

  any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have

  clarified the position,"

  "But how are you going to find out if I'm allowed to own it?"

  "Fortunately," said Dumbledore, "there is a simple test."

  ...

  "You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as

  though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, "if you have indeed inherited the

  house, you have also inherited ---"

  ...

  "Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.
