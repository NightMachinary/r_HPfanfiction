The relocation, could be achieved by freeing them and then binding them to a new property. If you look at serfs who also were forced to serve the Person who owned the land they were bound to(legally of course, not magically), they were also able to move to be relocated as long they had permission of both their former lord and the one whose land they were moving to. I could easily see something like this being done with house-elves.
