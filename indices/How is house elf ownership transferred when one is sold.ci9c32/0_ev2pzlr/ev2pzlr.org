I dont think there is much of a transfer done, House-Elves are mentioned as coming as part of big properties like manors and castles and they obey who ever owns the property.

  “Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said George. “But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. *House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house. . . .”* Harry was silent.

They dont seem to magically know who owns the Property though, but the magic still forces them to obey the command of the owner of it, Dumbledore calls the magic a enchantment of their kind.

  "Oh, yes," said Dumbledore. "You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoy's our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. *He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius*. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it."

And he uses it to find out who the owner of 12 Grimmauld Place is when nobody knew if it belonged to Harry or Bellatrix, and they knew that Harry owned it when Kreacher was forced to obey him even though he believed Bellatrix to be his mistress.

  "You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered,

  "if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited ---"

  "Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.

  "Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't!" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears.

  "*Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won't, won't, won't ---"*

  "As you can see, Harry," said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of "wont, won't, won't," "Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership."

and here we see him being forced to obey Harry.

#+begin_quote
  *"Give him an order," said Dumbledore. "If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress."*

  "Won't, won't, won't, WON'T!"

  Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, "Kreacher, shut up!"

  It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.

So if you want to transfer the ownership of the House-Elf you would have to transfer the Property they belong to. They are like Serfs in that regard.
