In line with Steve and the Barkeep, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]] linkffn(8208936) has an unknown Harry interacting with Marvel. Sadly, just as it starts to get good it been left un-updated. It's by the same author as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror][Mirror Mirror]] linkffn(8275548) is also the same (even if it is marked slash, it hasn't yet shown any) and is really excellent with how SHIELD would react to finding out about Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See The Moon]] linkffn(8212843) has a great broken Harry and helping Bruce. Tony is also great in character too. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643484/1/All-Hallows-Eve-New-York][All Hallows Eve New York]] linkffn(8643484) is a fun little humor one shot. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10177155/1/Tricksters-and-Gods][Tricksters and Gods]] linkffn(10177155) is also fun, and worth a read, and has a good sassy Loki!Harry. It's also complete, which is always a good thing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240089/1/Mortem-Cantor][Mortem Cantor]] linkffn(8240089) is a lot of fun, but sadly hasn't been updated in a long time. Harry is boarding on mad scientist and Fury is exasperated. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10835321/1/Behind-the-Shield][Behind the Shield]] linkffn(10835321) is a little AU of Mortem Cantor which is reason alone to read Mortem Cantor. I still giggle when re-reading it. If you don't mind fem!Harry (and really, this fem!Harry still has a backbone, so it's not too bad), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]] linkffn(10524028) is a nice little story, with a great relationship built between Harry and Tony. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/209843][MoD!Harry is Not Amused]] is a great little series of fun one shots in which Harry as Death is very much over the shit that goes on in the marvel universe.
