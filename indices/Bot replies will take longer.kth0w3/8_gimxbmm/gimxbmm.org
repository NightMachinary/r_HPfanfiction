Huh. And I suppose FFN's staff would be disinclined to provide a key to circumvent the protections(especially since the bot's open source).

But then I don't really expect the staff to do anything beyond maintaining the site, most of the time. They never seem to respond to messages or reports. I've reported violations of the rules on the site literally YEARS ago, and still haven't received any response.
