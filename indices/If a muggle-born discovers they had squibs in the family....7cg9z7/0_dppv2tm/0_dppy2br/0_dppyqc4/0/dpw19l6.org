They don't, but they also tend to believe that blood will tell in the end. That was the case with Sirius. In the end, people believed him evil like the rest of his family even though he never got a trail and no one doubted his guilt despite him being innocent. I know that isn't the best example and it doesn't relate to squibs, but I think the downfall of blood purist is that they think one's success is based on the person's blood-status. J.K. Rowling wrote that Half-Bloods would be believed to be half the wizards that pure-bloods are to those that are purists. One can then conclude that purists would attribute a Half-Blood's success to the wizarding blood flowing in their veins and not the muggle side. They may continue to believe this even after it was revealed that that Half-Blood got his skills from the Muggle-Born parent/muggle side of their heritage. Now, take a muggle-born finding out about a squib in their family seven to six generations ago. That muggle-born could try to spin it as him being magical and his mother actually being from a recent line of Half-Blood squibs, or he could claim that he had magic because that pure-blood family created that squib. Basically, it's a case of blood will tell, and no matter how you look at it purists will end up shooting themselves in the foot. The success of this hypothetical Muggle-Born being accepted as a Half-Blood would depend on a number of factors, but the most important factors would probably be: how far removed they are from the squib, the family the squib hailed from & if they're extant/extinct, reliable documentation, and whether that family will accept them(if they're extant). So let's say that Sirius had a squib sister and she had a child and that child was magical. People would have surely heard of that member of the Black family being a squib, so they would recognize that kid as a Half-Blood. So yeah... I guess this is my thorough explanation as to how this situation would play out. Each circumstance would be different and it'd be a case by case basis type of thing.
