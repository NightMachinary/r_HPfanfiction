Probably not the kind of creature fic you are looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][/The Accidental Animagus/]] start off with Harry escaping from the Dursleys by turning into a cat.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423230/1/Amber-and-Emerald][/Amber and Emerald./]] I would suggest skipping this one if you have noose-tight morals. It starts out in second year and Harry has an 'advanced' relationship with Hermione if you catch my meaning.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624252/1/Nocturnal][/Nocturnal./]] Hermione gets turned into a cat, relatively normal relationship with Hermione, Ron and Dumbledore serve as excellent comedy pieces without being bashed.

I just did a search through my bookmarks for the word cat, let me know if you want other stuff and I can give a look.
