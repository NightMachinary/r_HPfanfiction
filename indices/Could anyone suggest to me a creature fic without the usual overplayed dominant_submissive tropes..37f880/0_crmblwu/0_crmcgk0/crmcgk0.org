Veela and werewolf fics are cool. Fics with some Dom/sub relationship elements are fine as long as its something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5827647/1/Veela-Struck][Veela Struck]]and not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10567941/1/Nature-of-the-Beast][nature of the beast]], just compare the opening chapter of both those fics to see what I mean.

I also adore [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10290899/1/Keep-This-Wolf][keep this wolf]].
