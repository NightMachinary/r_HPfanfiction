  With respect, aren't you also projecting onto her, if you're speaking from your own experience? There's no textual evidence that she is straight or gay.

And THAT was my point! I know the media representations you are talking but I also draw from very different experiences, experiences that influence me stronger than those media representations and as a result, and in the absence of JKR establishing any/any not ambivalent hint regarding her relationship status, my projections are completely different from yours.

There is nothing but projections to go on.
