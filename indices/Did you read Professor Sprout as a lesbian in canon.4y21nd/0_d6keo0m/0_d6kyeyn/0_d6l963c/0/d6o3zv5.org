  And to me those traits, not from the media but from personal experience, speak of farmworkers, married farmworkers.

  You are projecting onto her.

With respect, aren't you /also/ projecting onto her, if you're speaking from your own experience? There's no textual evidence that she is straight /or/ gay.

I didn't mean the media as in; media suggests certain things /and so/ I internalize them. It's just well known (at least among the LGBT community) that in many kinds of stories where outright mentioning a character's sexuality was considered inappropriate, hints would be left via hobbies, interests or behaviour. As such we as readers are used to 'decoding' these representations to what may be beneath.
