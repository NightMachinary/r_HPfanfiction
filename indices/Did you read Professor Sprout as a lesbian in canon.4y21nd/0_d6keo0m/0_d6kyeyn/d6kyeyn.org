Well. Its possible that as an LGBT person, I'm more sensitive to and thus aware of characters' possible sexualities, if there's a possibility they might not be straight.

I think I never got the impression that Sprout /was/ straight when reading the books, and as a kid, that was enough. Now that I think about it, it seems statistically unlikely that Hogwarts employs such a proportion of single/unmarried staff!

Sprout is not described as attractive or conventionally feminine. She has a brusque manner of speaking, is quite forthright, and is described as "brisk". She has messy hair and works in a physical job and always has dirty hands. To me as a young LGBT person growing up, a lot of these traits and similar ones in other media were used to hint at a lesbian woman, so it was something I always internalized a little in the back of my mind, I think.
