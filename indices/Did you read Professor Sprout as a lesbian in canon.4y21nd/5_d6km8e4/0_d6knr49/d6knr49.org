Well, perhaps I'm partly influenced by the actress's performance in the films, Miriam Margoyles is herself a lesbian. Sprout in the books is described as 'gruff', I think, she dressed in practical clothes, and her name itself - Sprout - sounds a bit masculine. For myself anyway growing up in a small traditional town, she wasn't like any woman I'd heard of, she seemed different in ways that I now as an adult recognize could be seen as 'coded'.

Having said that, when we read To Kill a Mockingbird in highschool, there was a character like Sprout who was thought of as the picture of Southern femininity. Just depends how the story is told/framed I think. I've always headcanoned as I grew older that she might've been a lesbian, partly based on the impression I first got of her as 'an unusual kind of woman' when I read HP as a kid.

EDIT: Unsure why the downvotes? Only recounting the first impressions of myself as a child. I'm not a homophobic adult in the slightest, I just was ignorant of LGBT people when growing up because their existence wasn't mentioned apart from in hushed tones. I myself am an LGBT person.
