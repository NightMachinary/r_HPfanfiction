Haha I guess that urban lesbian farmers is a stereotype that might be true? But I personally don't know any lesbian farmers, so I never read that into professor sprout's character. Also I live in a really rural part of Hawaii, so maybe not the best measure for the average sexual preferences of female farmers.
