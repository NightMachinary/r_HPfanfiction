We know that Malfoy was on the board until the end of the 92/93 year, and that he was able to coerce the other board members. So presumably they were either rather weak in order for Lucius to coerce them without the Death Eater routine (can't do that if you pretend that you only have been under the Imperius) or that they were usually associated with the pureblood side and that's how Lucius got dirt on them.

And unlike in many fanfics, Augusta Longbottom is not a member.
