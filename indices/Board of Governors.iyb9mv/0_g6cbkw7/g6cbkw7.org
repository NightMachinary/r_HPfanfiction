Generally, any kind of Governing Board has two main functions. Setting a direction for the thing they're governing to go, and making sure it stays on course. There are variations, but that's the main idea for Governors, Trustees, Directors, etc. It's called, appropriately, 'Governance'.

Setting a direction covers stuff like future investment, any changes they wanna make to the organisation, new opportunities to look into, anything they wanna keep doing and double down on, determining policies and practices, etc. It's literally "What do we want to try and do for the next X years?" and it covers everything a school might do. Whatever it is, they have the power to say 'this is what you should do in the future' about it. Whether they do or not is up to the staff themselves, and that's where the checking up bit comes in.

Making sure it stays on course is basically providing someone for the Management Staff that's making decisions (Dumbledore and McG at Hogwarts) to be accountable to, someone that doesn't have a direct interest in the thing and so (supposedly) is less prone to the bias and corruption that comes with having the power to approve or disapprove your own decisions.

Headmaster Dumbledore: I wanna bring the Philosophers Stone to Hogwarts!

Governor Dumbledore: That's a great plan, Big D. I say yes!

I'm sure the issue with having that power is obvious. :D

That does also mean that they'd see virtually everything about the school during their assessment period. There's not much of a concept of Confidentiality at the Board level, since they have to see stuff to evaluate whether it's sticking to the set-direction or not.

In terms of appointment, they're generally elected (group votes) or appointed (Successor, I choose you!). Different governors can be elected by different groups, so you might have one voted in by students, one voted in by staff, one voted in by Dumbledore, one voted in by the Ministry, etc. or they might all be voted in by the Wizengamot, or the Board themselves. Or they could just have to confirm and approve individual nominated successors.

"This guy has said that guy should replace him, do we agree? We do?! Cool. Welcome, Guy B, you in da club now."

In a good board, the members're generally picked to get a range of skills and backgrounds for the Board to draw on when making decisions or checking stuff out (but as with any group politics does play a part, so it's quite understandable that the majority of the board would be crusty Purebloods). So, you might have someone who knows a lot about Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, so that when they review those courses, they can speak with some authority on what improvements might need to be made.

This tends to lead to certain amounts of delegation of tasks - Arithmancy policy might be determined by the Arithmancer on the board, potions by the potioneer, etc - but that's not always the case. They'll usually end up discussing it as a group regardless to get final approvals and such, but the individual policy would be suggested by the appropriate member.

They also might have the ability to review certain opportunities when they come up - particularly those that might impact the school as a whole or even just house-wide. So, if Malfoy had wanted to buy the Slytherin Team brooms, he might've had to run that by the board, so they could approve the school taking the 'gift' and any conditions attached (to see if it matches their school plan and reputation, basically). He could've also bribed them all to accept it regardless, but the presentation of the opportunity would still be a barrier to hurdle.

One thing they usually don't have authority on is making decisions on the day-to-day running of the thing (Operational Decisions). So, if the students decided they wanted regular Yule Balls, they'd go to the Senior Staff and not the Board of Governors. They might have that power if you wanna write it that way, but that does also still fall into the "Dumbledore plan? Dumbledore Yes!" issue I mentioned a few paragraphs back. :D

I've been involved in this sort of thing at a school and charity level, so feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help. :)
