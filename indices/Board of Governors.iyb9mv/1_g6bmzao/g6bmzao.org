Could they be volunteers? I doubt it is a paid post. Maybe they have to volunteer and then voted on by the current board, or have a sponsor currently on the board or teaching?

Perhaps the Board has financial power? Maybe they set the budgets for each subject and/or can award grants for things? That could be fun if you have the teachers competing for limited funding!

Maybe they have to approve all staff appointments? (Not sure how Lupin got through in the case, but it's a nice idea!)

I think the "real" equivalent in British schools also do fundraisers, and attend meetings about Grade Point Averages

Could they be an equivalent of OFSTED and do inspections?

I always got the impression that in canon, the Board didn't do much apart from nod along with all of Dumbledore's decisions (with the exception of Lucius, of course!) So maybe you would have a more "hands-on" Board instead?

Good luck with the writing!
