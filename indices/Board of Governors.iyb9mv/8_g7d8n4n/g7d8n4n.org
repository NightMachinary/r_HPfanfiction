From what I recall in canon: all we know is Lucius Malfoy was a member while his son was in school. He threatened the other members. He was subsequently fired. Importantly-- this sacking had no impact at all whatsoever on his standing with the Minister.

While Albus Dumbledore is headmaster, I honestly don't think the board is able to do much without a unanimous vote which temporarily got Dumbledore out of office. They don't seem to hold much sway over the professors hired, students admitted, or curriculum taught. I would imagine its mostly a formality. People in power get a pat on the back for being admitted. Lucius, who cares for almost nothing aside from his family, was likely a relatively new member. But Dumbledore appoints anyone he wishes to professorships-- a half giant with a third year education, a centaur, a werewolf. The governors have little control over the school.

In my own imagining, the role is given to those who seek it-- over-involved parents like Lucius, perhaps. There may be a House of Lords hereditary aspect as well. It's clearly not a lifelong post if Lucius can get sacked so easily. Lucius Malfoy seems the type of wizard who asks and immediately receives, so if he wanted a role in Draco's schooling, this was the way to get it. It never comes up again though, so it's only relevant when someone is pushy. Even during Umbridge's regime, I don't recall anything about the governors, so they may only have a significant presence when't there's a significant person on the board.

Edit: just pulled out CoS to check, and Lucius says that the appointment or suspension of headmasters is something the governors are in charge of. Do we think they all voted for Snape? Probably a Ministry offshoot-- they're definitely all corrupt.
