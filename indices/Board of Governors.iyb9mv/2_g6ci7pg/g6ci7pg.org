What I wrote for the notes to my current project:

#+begin_quote
  It is said that the Hogwarts Board of Governors was created by the last of the Founders, Helga Hufflepuff, to lend assistance in her twilight years and (perhaps remembering Salazar Slytherin and fearing that another like him might one day arise) to act as a check against the power of her successors. It has also been speculated that she wanted to replicate something of the sharing of authority that existed from the founding of Hogwarts down to the death of Godric Gryffindor (which left Hufflepuff the sole remaining Founder).

  The Board's twelve members were handpicked by Hufflepuff, and each appointed their own successor. In practice this has led to the seats largely being inherited along family lines. Where there is no heir, the Headmaster was responsible for choosing a new member (allowing the Board to both expel members and appoint new ones would clearly lead to abuses of power), but this power was given to the Wizards' Council during the creation of the latter, in exchange for a seat.

  The positions of “Headmaster” and “School governor,” like the institution of Houses, have much to do with the British education system, but most muggleborns get the relationship completely wrong. It isn't muggle schools which inspired Hogwarts, as a quick look at any timeline would make clear, but Hogwarts which (via muggleborn and half-blood students who maintained a connection to the muggle world) inspired certain qualities of muggle British schools.
