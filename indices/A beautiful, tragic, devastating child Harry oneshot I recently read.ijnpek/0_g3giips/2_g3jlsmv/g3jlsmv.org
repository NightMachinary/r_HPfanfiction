So, I just finished this Hello Journal fic! I understand it's not technically finished, but it ends on a note that feels complete. I honestly don't think it could end any other way and still be canon compliant. Both of these fics are so sad! My heart aches for young Harry. I actually think the 2 fics go remarkably well together. I imagine the last half of “Alastair's Cupboard” as the ending to “Hello Journal” as well. /Spoiler/ I would not put it past Vernon to accidentally go too far and beat Harry to death/severe traumatic brain injury after an unfavorable encounter with social services. As grim as that is.
