Unless you're talking about vampires like Marceline in Adventure Time, vampires simply drink blood like we do water. Ergo, the blood goes from their mouth to their stomach and feeds them until it needs to go out by the back entrance. It's, like, ninth grade biology and third-year Defence Against the Dark Arts assuming you follow the British system of education set by the Wizarding Examinations Authority.

Edit: Blood feeds them like any food would. It's canon vampires do not only feed on blood in both Harry Potter and most myths. It doesn't grant them immortality, since they can't age because they've dead.
