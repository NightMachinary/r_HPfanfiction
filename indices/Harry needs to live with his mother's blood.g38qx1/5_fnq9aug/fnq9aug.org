I've seen a variant of this used in a couple of (non-biological-parental) Snape-centric fics -- basically, as childhood friends with Lily, they did a "blood oath" ritual (the thing where you share a tiny amount of blood with someone close to you by a cut), which has no real importance in the plot besides the fact that apparently it counts as him having part of her blood in him and is thus eligible to serve as conduit for the blood wards. Why nobody thought of doing something similar with the very much alive Petunia in the aftermath I don't know, but I guess it would kinda ruin the excuse for Harry and Severus to get close. :P
