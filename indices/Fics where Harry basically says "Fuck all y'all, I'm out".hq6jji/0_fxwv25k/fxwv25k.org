I can't remember the title but there was one where Harry just sorta fucks off to the muggle world... And then remotely starts a revolution. He gets the muggleborns to uprise and they become a secret society hiding in plain sight rather than behind wards. The purebloods are basically left to die. He starts bombarding people with random showers of papers about the truth(I think this is set the summer either before or after fifth year). He hangs up posters. He basically ruins the magical economy. It's amazing.
