Dang, I can't remember the fic but there was one where Harry got wrongfully imprisoned in Azkaban (I know, I know) and when he was let out, he was somehow really powerful, and fucked right off to some tropical island where he spent his time living it up. And then the Order tracked him down and told him he had to kill Voldemort, he was the only one who could, and Harry was forced to make a Vow he would defeat Voldemort. But he didn't say when he would and said he would get around to it in like a couple decades or so. And they had to pay him big, big bucks to get to it early.

What I remember is that for a change, Ron wasn't bashed (but Hermione was, and had married Percy?)
