linkffn(What Does It Take To Make You Walk Away by phoenixgirl26). More of an "I have no idea how to find the horcruxes and how can a student kill Voldemort" start to the story, though.

linkffn(Fine Then! by Alpha-The-Omega). Rather sophomoric. OP!Harry leaves after being convicted over the dementor incident.

linkffn(Too Late to Apologize by JackPotr). Not bad, but not one of my favorites.

linkffn(From the Shadows by MK-ONE). Harry is betrayed, and leaves England to Voldemort. I think it gets silly in the revenge portion of the story.

linkffn(Missing: Presumed Missing? by Seel'vor). When his friends turn on him after the DoM battle, it's the last straw, and Harry leaves. Most of the (unfinished) story involves them trying to get him back.

linkffn(Nobody's Hero by epeefencer). I didn't like the way this started, so I haven't read much of it.

linkffn(You Can Have It All Revised by opopanax). When his friends turn on him after the DoM battle ...

linkffn(Deceptions by WolfMoon). When he's accused of killing Cedric, Harry leaves with Sirius.

linkffn(A Bad Week at the Wizengamot by DisobedienceWriter). After being convicted over the dementor incident, Harry leaves England. Kind of crackish.

linkffn(To Become a Muggle by lifebitten). Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but an excellent story. After the Tournament, Harry decides to give up on magic.
