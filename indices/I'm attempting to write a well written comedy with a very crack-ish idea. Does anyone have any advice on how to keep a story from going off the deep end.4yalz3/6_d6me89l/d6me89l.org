Don't push the story to be tvtropey, as in, use pop-culture references sparingly and if you absolutely have to, stick to universally known/funny things, like Back to the Future or Ghostbusters or something. Try to devise funny jokes based on the world you're creating. One trope might be particularly helpful though, Only Sane Man.

Also, names. Names which are silly in intelligent ways are funny. A name like Dick Johnson is imo funnier than Big Balls Steve, because Dick has two layers: it's the guy's actual name /and/ a dick joke.

Read funny stuff to inspiration. Humor is arguably harder to pull off than drama, tragedy, thriller, or any other genre, especially in writing. It's much easier to do jokes in movies, where you have two entire additional mediums to enhance the jokes on top of dialogue (sound and image). For HP, I recommend A Black Comedy (immature, silly humor, definitely one of the top fics in the fandom, probably the greatest comedy) and Seventh Horcrux (the MC is, imo, a well written comedic character because he kind of inverts the Only Sane Man trope, as in, he's Insane while most of the people surrounding him aren't and it results in some great deadpan jokes).
