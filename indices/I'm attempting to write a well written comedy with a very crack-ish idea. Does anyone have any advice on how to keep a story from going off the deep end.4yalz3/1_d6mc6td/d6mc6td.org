I love the idea, I would love to see more crack-fics of this type. I think one of the problems is most of the fan sites have rules against real people being used? At least that's what I've heard. I guess investigate whatever platform you want to use to publish.

Humor is really subjective, and I almost guarantee that whatever you find funny, someone else will find stupid, so I'd say write whatever is funny to you. One way to keep it from completely devolving is to have your other characters stay in character- try to imagine how they would react to Trump/Ginny's antics, don't just have them go along or get as zany as he he is, at least not at first. You can have one or more characters loosen up over time if you wish.
