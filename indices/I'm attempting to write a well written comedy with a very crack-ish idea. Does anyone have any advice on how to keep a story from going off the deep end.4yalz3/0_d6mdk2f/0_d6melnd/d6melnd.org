Off topic but your potential characterisation of Lockheart got me thinking. What if he took the DADA job as a way to teach himself enough to become competent. He could even plan on working multiple years and working on mastering like 1-3 year material his first year, 4-5 for his second, and 6th and 7th in his third and fourth years teaching.
