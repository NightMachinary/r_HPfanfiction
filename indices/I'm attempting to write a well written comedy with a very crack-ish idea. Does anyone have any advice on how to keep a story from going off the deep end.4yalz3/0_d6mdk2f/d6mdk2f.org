The thing you really need to be careful about it how you write your characters. Crack fics and crapfics typically use very one-dimensional characters.

Take Lockheart for instance. Yes, he goes on and on about fame and bullshit like that, but add some love for adventure, and have him wish that he actually was able to do all the things he wrote and you have a lot more to work with, while still keeping the basis of his character. Perhaps have him work on improving himself so that he can write a book about his own adventures?

You might want to think about adding more than one character as the point of view. The problem is, that a lot of people think that if the protagonist says or thinks something then that is automatically correct, and not just his point of view. You can either try and ignore that or add someone else that disagrees with your character to show that this isn't the case.

Do I like your idea? Short answer is no. Long answer is that I feel that there is potential funny moments in it, but a lot of things that make the premise seem stupid.

I generally don't like the OC fics where the OC has had a previous life and/or knows about this universe. What I do like are fics with OC's that are from that universe, new characters that would fit in.

If you want to go the Trump make Hogwarts great again there really is a very good character to work with: Draco Malfoy. It's basically what his father and him are harping on about. If you then want to add the Diary you might have Draco steal the book from his father before he gives it away because his new best friend convinces him it's a good idea? Perhaps exchange it for a fake, and thereby Ginny Weasley just receiving a free book and nothing else.
