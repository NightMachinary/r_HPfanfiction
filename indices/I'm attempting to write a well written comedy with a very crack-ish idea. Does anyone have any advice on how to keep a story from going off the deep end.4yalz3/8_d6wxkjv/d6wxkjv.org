Terry Pratchett once commented that the key to Discworld is that it isn't funny to the characters. To them, it's home. It's their life. They live it as best they can and feel the same way about that as we do ours.

The same should be in play here. Ron and Percy should react to what their little sister has become. Maybe they're heartbroken, maybe they're scared, maybe they're in denial... They absolutely should now brush it off as "oh, she's just a self-insert".
