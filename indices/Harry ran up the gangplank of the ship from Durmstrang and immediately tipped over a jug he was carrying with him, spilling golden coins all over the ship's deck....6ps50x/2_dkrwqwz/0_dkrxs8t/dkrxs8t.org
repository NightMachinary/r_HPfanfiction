You know, I'm not actually sure. Normally it ends 'so you can [verb] while you [same verb].'

But I can't think of any verbs that would describe something you can do on a ship AND what you can do with some coins. Float? Parley? Sink? Transfer? Bank?

That last one could work. Bank as in tilt a ship, bank as in store money. Bank while you bank.
