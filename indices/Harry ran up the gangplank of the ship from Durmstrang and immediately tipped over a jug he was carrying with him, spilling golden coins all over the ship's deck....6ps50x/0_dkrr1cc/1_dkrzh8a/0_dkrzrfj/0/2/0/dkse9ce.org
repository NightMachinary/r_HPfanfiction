Sometimes I feel like the only person in the world that actually really likes all the POTC films. (Except /Stranger Tides/, that was very meh; I really enjoyed /Salazar's Revenge/, though.) The initial trilogy are the only films I've rewatched as much as HP (although /Now You See Me/ is quickly gaining; fucking love that film) and I can never watch just one of them even if I start with /Dead Man's Chest/ or /At Worlds End/.

That said, thank you for finally mentioning /why/ the later films aren't as well liked as the first. I've spent years seeing people say that DMC and AWE aren't as good as CotBP, but no one ever actually said why and it's been driving me fucking nuts for years.
