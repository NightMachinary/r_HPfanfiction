The first movie is already considered a modern classic by some critics. Its a great movie with great characters.

The following ones were rather "meh". Johnny Depp created a fantastic character with Captain Jack Sparrow, only to make the character a caricature of itself in the sequels. Not to say that the sequels are completely bad, but they surely will never be considered modern classics by anyone.
