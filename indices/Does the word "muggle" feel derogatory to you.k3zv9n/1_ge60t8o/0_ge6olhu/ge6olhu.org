I heard someone say that one word becomes offensive because of the attitude to what the word suggests at, and it's not solved by removing the word. The word is not the problem. It's our idea of what the word means. So we think changing the word changes our attitude, but we just replace the word, and eventually, that becomes offensive or "not as polite". So we keep replacing the words while our attitudes are often not changed.
