To be fair, it was used correctly in this instance.

It means non-magical, which has economic, cultural and social implications stemming from differences between the two societies. Dursleys being so rigid and fundamentally opposed to supernatural, I'd not be surprised if they triggered an 'uncanny valley' effect in Hagrid. After all, physically you can't tell a muggle from wizard... Usually. And then you see the Dursleys, almost robotic.

Add in the look of the house in Privet Drive, compare and contrast with other magical locations... And you basically get a white room in a hospital, possibly a mental one.
