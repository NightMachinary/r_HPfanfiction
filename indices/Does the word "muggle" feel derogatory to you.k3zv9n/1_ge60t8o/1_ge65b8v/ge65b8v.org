Hagrid practically used it as a slur in the first book, though.

The way he explains it makes it sound that "Muggle" stands for "non-magic person that hates magic." He could be referring to Vernon's weight, but that wouldn't make sense about Petunia, who's stick-thin. And he said "like them," no doubt referring to their bad attitude about magic.
