No.

It is a word an insular society uses to call outsiders. As an outsider, I will not hear it unless I am trespassing, so they could call me a Pink Huffalump for all I care. Add to that, Muggle as a word does not have any other meaning than "native non-magical" and is much less of a mouthful.

Besides, if Amish can call every non-Amish "English", regardless of country of origin, ethnicity or anything else... Why could the wizards, whose communities work in a similar enough manner, not? Fair's fair, and since they mostly keep their business away from muggle folks, it's none of mine.
