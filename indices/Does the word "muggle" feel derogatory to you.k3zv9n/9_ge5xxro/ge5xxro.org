I personally don't like the word Muggle. It feels like not human. but then we use wizard and witch words so there isn't much difference.

it would be better if they use non-magical and magical. then use man - woman as describing non magical human's sex; wizard - witch when describing magical human's sex.

Muggle does feel derogatory and otherizing (is that a word?). we often see magical people sayibg muggle as if saying animal, we even see light wizards and witches like Molly, McGonagall, maybe Hagrid saying muggle like that.
