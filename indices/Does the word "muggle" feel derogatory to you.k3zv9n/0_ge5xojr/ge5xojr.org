Tbh mundanes feels more derogatory to me.

non-magicals and mundanes might just be a new phrase people want to try out.

But could also be like you are used to seeing maybe in fic purebloods avoiding using mudblood but say muggle in a derogatory or demeaning way. So prefer using a word you have seen used like that less.
