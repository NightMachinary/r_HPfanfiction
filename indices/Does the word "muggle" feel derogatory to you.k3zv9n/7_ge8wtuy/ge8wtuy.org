I don't find Muggle offensive at all. Maybe i just have a thick skin. Muggle honestly feels a bit like being called a ‘Muppet', which is someone who makes a silly mistake, and there's no real harm in it. Example, my old maths teacher used to say to me ‘Ach yer a muppet' of I'd copied something wrongly. As a few others have pointed out, Muggle comes from Mug, a gullible person, but in my experience, it's never been particularly derogatory. There are much worse words you could use, that have worse implications. It's why i don't like terms like ‘Mundane' or ‘Non-magical' or ‘No-maj';

Where once there were terms that were derogatory in the weakest way, but they were also vaguely affectionate, now it feels cold and clinical, and its worse.

From my own experience,

Its like you can call me a ‘spaz' ‘spastic' ‘autistic' ‘disabled' because I am an Autistic Spastic Diplegic. The words aren't offensive to me. Doesn't mean you should use them as a slur, but they aren't inherently offensive, its all about tone.

Whereas, I would get offended if you called me ‘Handicapped', ‘Crippled' or god forbid the new one that seems to be popular in certain circles ‘differently abled' and not even sure how to feel about the term ‘neurotypical'
