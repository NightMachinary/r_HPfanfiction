I feel that it is normally used when wizards(/witches) are comparing the magical and non-magical, and so for me has become associated with that prejudice in some ways. In the same way that there is the conveyer belt of what is a racist slur, words pick up subtext from the context that they are commonly used in. It also just feels a bit condescending the other 5 billion + (depending on the date) humans in the world have no say in their own name.
