Yes, if only he had the same reluctance with the cursed necklace and poisoned wine. Look, I get your point but let's not beat around the bush, almost 18-year-old Draco Malfoy was not a person that shoukd be allowed to walk free. You are right that he was making a move towards redemption but it was by no means enough. He took the first step towards becoming a normal person but it's a mile long road.

As sad as the situation with child soldiers are, those kids shouldn't be allowed free either, not without a proper re-education. And unlike them, Draco Malfoy has the means to cause damage after his side loses, what with his money and all.

All in all, I was extremely disappointed the Malfoys walked away without a punishment.
