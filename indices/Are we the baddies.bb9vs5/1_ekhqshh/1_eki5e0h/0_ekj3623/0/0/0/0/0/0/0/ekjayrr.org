Have I said anything about how Draco should be allowed to walk free, or considered redeemed? All I am saying is firstly that he was /not/ a born sociopath, and not as evil as he wished he was; and secondly that he /did/ canonically grow out of /some/ of the Death Eater propaganda he'd been raised on.
