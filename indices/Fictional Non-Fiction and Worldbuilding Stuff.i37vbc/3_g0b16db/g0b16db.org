The same person actually runs a blog called Thelethifoldwitch (plus a wandlore blog), and in the same vein there's the postmodernpottercompendium. I think if you also look around a bit you'll find a bit more. I'll link them in a short while.

Edit: links

[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://thelethifoldwitch.tumblr.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjPz_q-jIHrAhXotYsKHa2xCzoQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw3I-7RN4nG2xp5kTkO0FUGZ][thelethifoldwitch]] - snippets of the everyday world of witches and wizards, including some abroad pieces.

[[https://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/explore][postmodernpottercompendium]] - a blog that kind of world builds but through historical pieces? Has written a fanfiction on Ao3, linked through their blog. I haven't personally read it, but [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://archiveofourown.org/works/1575593/chapters/3344900&ved=2ahUKEwjmip_wjoHrAhWPrIsKHfptAAYQFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw0OAtpFU_ZpbEJbgmaCmG9m][here]] you go.

[[https://flourishandblottsstories.tumblr.com/][Flourishandblotts]] - in the same vein as the above.

[[https://amortentiafashion.tumblr.com/][Amortentiafashion]] - Wizarding world fashion, as it says. Not my cup of tea, but others may enjoy it.

[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://departmentsofmysteries.tumblr.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjxn8bBjYHrAhVo-ioKHUuFAE4QFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw0rGXUPbfvGRpwzl-RptjXd][departmentofmysteries]] - fun read, does more to the Unspeakables than any fanfiction I've read before.
