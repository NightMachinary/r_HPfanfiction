There's linkffn(An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley), which is quite good and set as an actual in-world interview in 2008, memorializing the Second War.

The authors of NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series have a spinoff primer on dueling, but it's rather short and I wouldn't read it unless you've finished the series.

There's also a relatively popular fic that's in the form of a scientific paper written by Hermione, but I can't remember the name. Can someone link it?

Lastly, I'm sure there are quite a few takes on the Lockhart adventure books, I haven't delved into that corner of fanfic yet so not sure which ones are good and which ones are not, or how many there are.
