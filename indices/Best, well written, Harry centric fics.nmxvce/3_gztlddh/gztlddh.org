Have you read James Spookie's stuff? I hadn't, and recently binged it, and it's some nice brainless reading material, albeit with somewhat abrupt endings. He has more, but I'm just going to link the longest one lol.

*Browncoat, Green Eyes* is a long crossover with firefly that I've reread several times. Not a fan of Nonjon's other stuff, but this? This I like. And the odd trip to the wiki is sufficient if you aren't familiar with Firefly.

Mad Fairy's *Mischief's Heir* series is another one I've reread multiple times. It starts off with bashing galore and then finds a plot by the end of part one. Afterwards, it's a super fun read about a wizarding space race. Love it to pieces.

*Of a Linear Circle*. The pairing isn't to everyone's taste (not even mine, tbh, as romancing Snape makes me want to vomit), but thankfully the romance is minimal. It's a massively ambitious story and /it's done well./ Part two is my fave, as I've reread it more than the rest, and part *nine* just wrapped up. It's pushing two million words, and will absolutely get there once part ten gets going :D
