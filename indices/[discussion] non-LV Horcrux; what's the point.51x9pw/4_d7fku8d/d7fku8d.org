I'm pretty sure you can't get killed when you have horcrux. Dark Lord's body was destroyed because even more powerful magic was used against him. If James Potter hit him with Avada Kedavra, Dark Lord would probabbly shrug it off and then offed Potter. It's probably rare to get your body destroyed when you die.

Horcrux is an anchor, IMO you can't just keep killing wizard till he runs out of horcruxes, Dark Lord survived that night, he was brought back from the part of soul he had in his body, not from one of the horcruxes.
