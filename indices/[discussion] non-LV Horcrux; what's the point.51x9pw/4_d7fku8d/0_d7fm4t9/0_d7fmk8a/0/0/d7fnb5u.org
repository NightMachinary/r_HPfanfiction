Firstly, you're forgetting the power of wizarding medicine. Secondly, you're assuming that destroying a wizard's body is a simple thing to do. Sure, you have spells for that, but they have spells to defend themselves. And with a wizard like Voldemort, it's probably nigh impossible to defeat him so soundly unless you're on Dumbledore's level or luck out with a rare circumstance, like Harry did.
