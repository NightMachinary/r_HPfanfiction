Intended use of horcrux is to come back with backup body if original is destroyed(there is plothole why it took voldemort 14 years to get body instead having DE to immidiatedly resurrect him.)

While KC immunity could be nice Dumbledore was fool to try collect them all before defeating Voldemort.

While they make him more difficult to neutralize they don't offer that much of protection. Main trick is not to kill horcrux user/letting him suicide. If captured its one could have statue of Voldemort at ministry or keep him permanently dosed with sleeping potion and harmless.
