I'm pretty sure the point of a Horcrux is that it tethers the other pieces of the sole to this realm. So, if you have a horcrux and you're killed, the soul in your body remains on Earth and you can come back. Presumably, you can also come back from any of the horcruxes, though that probably requires more aid as I don't think those soul pieces can move about or even have sentience in the same way.

An obvious distinction between a ghost and the soul remnant from a horcrux is that a ghost has no power and can never return to their body. A disembodied soul tethered to Earth by a horcrux still has some power to it.
