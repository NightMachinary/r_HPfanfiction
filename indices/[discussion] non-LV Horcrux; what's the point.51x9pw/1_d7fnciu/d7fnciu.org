The second part doesn't just “live” in its phylactery, it anchors the piece that was in the original body to stay in our plane. I think JKR tried to implement the concept of “sacred” “soul” from classic abrahamic religions into HP-verse without actually mentioning anything about that concept's source. The result was yet another ill-defined mess: wizards who've lived in this world can leave behind portraits and ghosts of themselves, but neither is considered to be a “real” fragment of their original self for some reason (even though both seem to be passing the turing test, so to speak). Even though magic-able bodies can be created (VD's ritual) or copied (polyjuice) and memories can be transferred, to restore a fully-functional copy of themselves a wizard would have to go through this convoluted process of splitting their “soul”, then (if their original body gets destroyed) use the original fragment of their soul (which they turn into) to possess other animals (including magical humans) or be transported into a new body.

There was this great test that determined your stance on continuity of consciousness (can't find it ATM), and it had questions like “If your body gets destroyed and instantly and perfectly recreated by a teleporter, would you consider the newly created person to be ‘you', or it would still be lacking something that was lost in the process?” The questions there were put better than that, but the point was that people would have different opinions on the matter, and mainly because they had different opinions on the existence and function of souls, and different definitions of their selves.

So, what horcruxes are, in my opinion, is JKR's way of making VD survive as his original self [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling#Religion][while she had the idea of souls as a prime component of her worldview;]] the idea also kinda-leaking into the story as an unmentioned (?)
