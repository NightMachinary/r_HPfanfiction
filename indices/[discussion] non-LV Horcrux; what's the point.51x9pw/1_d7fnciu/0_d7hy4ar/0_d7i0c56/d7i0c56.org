Yes, in that manner at least the diary and the locket could be somewhat defined as living.^{1}

The area-of-effect mind-corrupting properties of at least 2 of the horcruxes make one assume that they're not even dormant and possess some form of awareness about their surroundings. But if they were fully lucid and aware all the time like a regular human, that would not work either, because [[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140514-how-extreme-isolation-warps-minds][the human mind quickly deteriorates in a full isolation.]] So one would either deduce that a horcruxe's consciousness doesn't operate the same way a regular human's does; or that Tom has built some countermeasures for his horcruxes to not become crazier (maybe a VR in the H. for the mind fragments to amuse themselves with, similar to how pensiveness work).

IIRC, There are several stories that deal with these questions in various manners (spoilers, obv):

- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][/Temporal Beacon,/]] the unspeakables place the Diadem on a magical body with no personality (IIRC, obliviated!Lockhart) and it eventually takes roots in it and becomes a copy of VD;
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][/Black Comedy,/]] the Diary accidentally takes roots in Neville, grows into a copy of VD, realizes how unhinged his original soul-piece has become, and starts thwarting original's plans.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][/Thunderstorm,/]] Harry passes through Diary!TMR's shade when it's about to complete usurping Ginny's soul, and that makes the Diary-piece merge with Harry's scar-piece instead, materialising as a 16yo version of TMR. In this story too she's against what her original soul-piece has become, and eventually Harry and she agree to work together to kill the original. Because she's only a fragment of the originally whole soul, she starts withering if\when Harry blocks the connection between him and her via Occlumency.
- in ???, Hermione manages to make the Diary confess that it experiences time as a normal person would --- /while it is being kept open/, so she uses this to torture its sanity until it will agree to share information;
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/the Well Groomed Mind,/]] Harry helps VD merge back with the horxruces he'd created, gradually restoring his sanity;
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/Sacrifices arc,/]] they not only serve as a metaphysical anchor for VD's original soul-piece to stay here, but also act like a balm for his mind when his “magical network” gets damaged by a clever trap attack.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House][/The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House,/]]^{[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/black-knight-harry-potter-au.395017/][(2)]]} Hermione just keeps the Diary to milk it for information, though it seems to be able to still affect Ginny on a distance.

You may also be interested in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future][/the Doc Future trilogy/]] (not related to HP-verse in any way). In this story there's a character that is able to do precisely what you've described: place “seeds” of herself in minds of others so that they will grow into new copies of her in case her original self\mind gets killed\destroyed. Eventually several versions of her come to exist, and she has to deal with “synchronisation problems” between all these versions. One of the better [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_%28science_fiction%29][collective mind]] stories I've seen so far.

^{1} Though here too a Doylist explanation could be given that the Diary was made to behave like that to create the needed plot device and plot catalyst; and the locket's behaviour and the associated plot arc (all the Ron's dramatics) were copied from LoTR's artefact.
