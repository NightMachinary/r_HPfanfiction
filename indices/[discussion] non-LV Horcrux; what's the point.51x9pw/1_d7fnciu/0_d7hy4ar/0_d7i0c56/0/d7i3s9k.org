  But if they were fully lucid and aware all the time like a regular human, that would not work either, because the human mind quickly deteriorates in a full isolation. So one would either deduce that a horcruxe's consciousness doesn't operate the same way a regular human's does; or that Tom has built some countermeasures for his horcruxes to not become crazier (maybe a VR in the H. for the mind fragments to amuse themselves with, similar to how pensiveness work).

OR

Mind and soul are separate and have different requirements.

OR

The Horcrux and however it binds already has a built-in protection mechanism, no innovation needed. It would seem it has to operate this way because who knows how many years it could take to find someone willing to create a body? It took LV almost a decade to run across Quirrell, and that was probably because he was famous enough that Quirrell even thought to go looking for him.

But I'm enjoying your notion that Tom might have given his fragments some kind of amusement to toy with.

Thanks for the summary on all those fics. Some of those sound good! I'm currently watching Battlestar Galactica so I have my fill of collective mind at the moment. :)

Shhhh! Let me cling to my Watsonian delusions (although I secretly agree with your Doylist explanation)!
