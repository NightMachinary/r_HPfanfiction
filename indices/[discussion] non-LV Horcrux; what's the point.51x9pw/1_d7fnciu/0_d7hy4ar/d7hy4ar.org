When I say "live" I'm thinking about how a soul-fragment of TR was imprisoned in the diary and had the apparent ability to "reconstitute" with the right ingredients (in that case by sucking the life force/magic out of another human). Rather like a seed that lays dormant until the right conditions happen.

Because it seemed as though Riddle was on the verge of becoming flesh and blood, I thought all Horcruxes must operate like that on some level. They're a kind of seed housing a piece of the original. Living in the way that a seed is living.

I agree with you about the messiness of portraits and ghosts. I have a horror fic brewing about exploring this concept, and this is partially how my original question relates, trying to best understand the mechanics and motivation.
