A normal ghost can't get back into a body and loses his magic; it can't possess anyone. A Horcruxed man's shade, however, might look superficially like a ghost, but it is able to possess someone (as shown with Voldemort and Quirrel), use their own magic while possessing that someone's body (as shown when Quirrel was able to fly, which was one of Voldie's exclusive powers), /and/ get back into a physical body through any number of methods (including a Philosopher's Stone or the ritual Voldemort uses in Book 4). Though obviously, the latter only works if you've got a minion to do the ritual for you.
