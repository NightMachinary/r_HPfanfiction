Actually I agree with you about the way horcruxes function. That's not the question though. I was trying to discern why one would bother creating a Horcrux in the first place (I was fleshing out motive for a character in a potential fic but felt the concept wasn't making a lot of sense). A typical wizard would probably make only one. Is main the purpose to avoid death? If so, why not make more of an effort to come back as a ghost? Because, we know that the original body can be destroyed and the master soul is left nebulous on earth. Unless one an army of psychos at your beck and call a la LV, the chances of getting bodily restored once in that state are slim. Why go through the pain a trouble of murder and complicated magic when it's just as likely you'll be left floating around earth anyway?
