I'm afraid you completely misunderstand what a Horcrux is supposed to do. The idea is that souls are inherently meant to be whole. Therefore, when you cleave it in half, the halves will pull at each other, craving to be whole again. Therefore, if the "master soul" is about to leave the mortal world and Move On, it will be unable to do so because the other part of the soul will literally anchor it to the mortal plane.

You seem to be under the impression, like many other people, that Hocruxes are "backups". I can't blame you --- this is certainly an obvious hypothesis after seeing Diary Riddle's actions in "Chamber of Secrets". But it it's actually wrong. The fact that the soulpieces inside the Horcruxes can become self-aware and escape their vessel originally was an unintended side-effect, though Voldemort, being the Slytherin he was, weaponized it with the diary.
