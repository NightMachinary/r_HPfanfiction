The point of the Horcrux is that you anchor your soul to the living plane to stop an otherwise inevitable avalanche effect. Ghosts, as far as we know, aren't alive and, heres the kicker, don't have a way to get back to life. Horcrux bound souls have this option. By way of ritual or several other ways (like the diary or the philosophers stone) you can produce or acquire a body to live again.

While simply being a horcrux bound soul is probably even worse than being a ghost, it isn't a desirable state in the first place for the maker of the Horcrux. Nobody who makes a Horcrux wants to stay in that state. Its a failsafe and I'm guessing every sensible wizard or witch making such a thing would organize ways to come in possession of a body before even producing a Horcrux.
