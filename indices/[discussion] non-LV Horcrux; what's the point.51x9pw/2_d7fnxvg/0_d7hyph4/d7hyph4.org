  If you have a horcrux and your body gets destroyed, there are means to get your body back.
#+end_quote

Quite true. But how do you suppose a regular-Joe Dark Wizard goes about getting his body back? His original piece of soul is either floating around on earth (more disembodied than a ghost) or partially departed (depending on one's theory). How does he make sure someone is willing to go through the trouble of getting his body back? Is it likely to happen without a cultic following of LV proportions?

  You can also possess other people, among other things.

The quality of full-on possession is only seen in one Horcrux; the Diary. The Diary appears to have been an anomaly. Which of the other Horcruxes operated at that level?

The Diary was probably the most powerful because LV had already a trial run with his first (the Gaunt ring) and still a significant amount of soul left to fragment compared to his subsequent attempts. He tried to get fancy with it in his hubris, I imagine, and had the ability to do so at the time. No other Horcruxes before or after are shown to have the level of personal ingratiation and possession that the diary demonstrated.

Is it likely that wizards prior to LV (or even after) created Horcruxes at that level of sophistication? I speculate not, since he had the great advantage of making one prior, and it seems that had almost never before happened.

  A ghost has no real power, nor will it ever have any power.

I suppose this depends on how one defines power. How much power does a wizard have as a disembodied Horcrux owner? There is the /potential/ for power, certainly, but it relies on too many 'what ifs' to be useful I think.

"If someone finds my horcrux..." "If someone can recognize what it even does..." "If someone can figure out how to bring me a body..." "If someone is willing do go through a dark and dangerous ritual for me..." "If all this is done in enough time where I currently know people/have connections/can get revenge..."

Returning to the concept of Horcrux possession; the Trio had a significant amount of contact with the Locket. It was able to influence their mood, but we never see it take on the kind of possession the Diary had. Presumably this is is how a typical Horcrux operates.

Compare this to ghosts who are able to have a wider range of interaction with the living. They're able to /talk/ to the living; to me, this is hugely influential. To cajole, persuade, influence... we've seen nothing in canon to indicate that a ghost couldn't be quite the master puppeteer if they so chose.
