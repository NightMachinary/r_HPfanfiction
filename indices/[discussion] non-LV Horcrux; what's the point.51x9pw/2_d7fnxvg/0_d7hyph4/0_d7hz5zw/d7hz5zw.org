  But how do you suppose a regular-Joe Dark Wizard goes about getting his body back?

Why on earth would a regular-Joe Dark Wizard make a horcrux in the first place?

  Is it likely to happen without a cultic following of LV proportions?

What good did Voldemort's entire cult do him? It took the effort of all of one person, in this case Peter Pettigrew. Had Voldemort not been a perfectionist, he would have settled on any ordinary 'enemy' for his resurrection ritual, and would have had a body in a weeks' time.

And I wasn't talking about the possession powers of the Horcrux, I was talking about the possession powers of the main spirit. Voldemort retained the power to possess Quirrell and animals in his spirit form.

  They're able to talk to the living; to me, this is hugely influential.

It is really not. Very few would have given a shit about Voldemort had there not been a chance for him to get his body back. Wormtail certainly wouldn't: he went to Voldemort for protection from his old friends. A bit hard to protect someone if all you can do is /talk/.
