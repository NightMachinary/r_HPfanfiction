  Look how long it took LV. How much longer would it take someone without his fame? There are probably all kinds of wraith souls kicking around for hundreds, if not thousands of years waiting for someone to discover them and have the desire and knowledge to make them a body.

It should probably be easier for someone other than Voldemort. Voldemort's problem was he didn't trust /anyone/ with his secret. No one knew about his horcruxes, not even Bellatrix. After he lost his body, he daren't approach any of his servants because he (correctly) suspected that most of his servants would want nothing to do with him since he was powerless. He didn't trust even Bellatrix in his vulnerable state, though he did trust Barty after he proved his loyalty by trying to find him.

His life would have been much easier had he just trusted one person to be perfectly loyal to him. Dear Bella would have had him up and running in weeks. I image most dark wizards wouldn't have the same level of paranoia as Voldemort, and would trust at least someone with their secret.
