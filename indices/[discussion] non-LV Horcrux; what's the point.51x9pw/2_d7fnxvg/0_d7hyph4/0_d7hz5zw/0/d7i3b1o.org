  Why on earth would a regular-Joe Dark Wizard make a horcrux in the first place?
#+end_quote

I was under the impression that LV was the biggest, baddest thing to happen to the British wizarding world in their recorded history. He's the pinnacle in both his capability for evil and his range of magical ability; this seems to be supported by the fact that he created so many Horcruxes when others only managed one. He sets the bar for a new grade of Dark Wizard.

Anything below that is what I mean by regular-Joe Dark Wizard. Someone still evil and with enormous magical power, but whose Horcrux making abilities are limited to one. Probably those previous Horcrux makers had dedicated personal loyalties ranging from loners to something along the followers of LV. But does that mean /all/ Horcrux makers commanded followers like LV? Probably not, is what I'd guess. That's what I mean by "regular-Joe Dark Wizard".

  What good did Voldemort's entire cult do him?
#+end_quote

I'd think having cult followers increases the odds that you will find one among the number willing to go through a dark, dangerous, difficult and rather thankless task of bodily restoration. In the case of LV, it seems like the concept of cult ultimately worked in his favor.

You made the excellent point reminding me about Pettigrew's motivation behind initiating the bodily re-creation. Not from true devotion did he return, but desperation.

You're right it only takes one to do the ritual. But I think part of LV's power stemmed from the fact that he had built-in followers. When Pettigrew "resurrected" LV, it wasn't just a lone, powerful wizard he was reactivating--it was him plus an entire network.

  And I wasn't talking about the possession powers of the Horcrux, I was talking about the possession powers of the main spirit. Voldemort retained the power to possess Quirrell and animals in his spirit form.
#+end_quote

This is a good point and a piece I was forgetting; the ability for the original soul piece to have limited possession powers increases the odds that it can find someone and communicate its need for them to create a body. Even still, it took nearly a decade for LV to get in touch with someone willing, and that was arguably because he was so famous and powerful he had someone (Quirrell) willing to seek him out. Surely not all Horcrux creators are as famous and powerful?

  Very few would have given a shit about Voldemort had there not been a chance for him to get his body back. Wormtail certainly wouldn't: he went to Voldemort for protection from his old friends.
#+end_quote

I agree with you on this point, but I was referring to people other than Voldemort when I made the statement about ghosts. What is the motivation for creating a Horcrux when there is little guarantee of being brought back bodily? Look how long it took LV. How much longer would it take someone without his fame?

There are probably all kinds of wraith souls kicking around for hundreds, if not thousands of years waiting for someone to discover them and have the desire and knowledge to make them a body.
