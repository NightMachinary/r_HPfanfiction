This is actually a pretty great question, my personal take it this;

Only the strongest and usually darkest of wizards could make a horcrux, thus splitting the soul in two, I don't personally think l this is an even split, let's take Voldemort for example, if the split was constantly 50/50 then by the 7th book would he would have what? 3% in his body, where as 50% in his first horcrux (math might be incorrect too lazy to work it out)

But rather I think creating a horcrux splits a small portion of the soul into the anchor, let's say 1 or 2% just long enough to keep the entire soul linked to the "mortal realm" now I'm using the assumption that "death" is when a soul no longer has a body, in which case the soul no longer sustains itself and completely dies.

Therefore, with at least a little part of the soul safe inside the anchor, no soul can truly die, and the 98% of the soul, will be able to rejoin the original host body, or should that body have been destroyed, or, as the wizard is dark and powerful, could seek out a new host, possession ect.
