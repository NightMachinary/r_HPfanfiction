OP, right off the bat you're starting with the wrong premise. Horcruxes don't allow you to come back from the dead, they prevent you from dying at all. Voldemort wasn't killed in 1981, he was disembodied. Nothing in the HP lore suggests that it's in fact possible to come back from the dead.

Also, I'm not sure if becoming a ghost is a conscious choice. I don't think it's like "I died, well let's become a ghost, shall we?". I think that ghosts just happen sometimes.

What you're missing is that the way Voldemort was disembodied isn't a common occurrence. I want say that having a horcrux makes you "immune" to the Killing Curse, but this seems to clash with canon. In OotP, Voldemort defended himself with his silver shield against what he assumed would have been a Killing Curse, though it can be interpreted as Voldemort simply playing along because he didn't want to show that he was KC-immune to Dumbledore, who Voldemort didn't know was researching horcruxes, or Voldemort simply didn't know if he could just shrug off a KC. In either of those cases, the theory of KC-immunity with horcruxes isn't impossible to fit with canon.
