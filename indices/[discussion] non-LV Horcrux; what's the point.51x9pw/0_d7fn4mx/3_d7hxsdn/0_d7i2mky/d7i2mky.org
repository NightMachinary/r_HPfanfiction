  Which part of what I wrote included that assumption?

The part I quoted at the top of my post.

On the inefficiency of horcruxes, I would argue that the point is not to "not pass into death", but to remain walking, talking, living with the actual living, not the in-between state of ghosthood.

Yes, destruction of the body presents a problem if you don't have a goonsquad, but I reiterate my point on wizarding medicine. It can do a lot. Destroying a wizard's body beyond the point of repairability is something we can't exactly quantify, but we know that it's possible to regrow bones and possibly grow organs or preserve them (brains in DoM). But even in the extreme, it's an extremely distant possibility of regaining the body vs the impossibility of it happening (death/ghosthood). Half an eye is more useful than no eye, or in the land of blind men, the one-eyed man is king, that kind of thing.

  bit of a stretch considering that there exists a Resurrection Stone

Which we know summons ghostlike entities, it doesn't actually resurrect the dead. So I think I'm still solid on that point.

You win on the ghosts.

About the Killing Curse, it continues to have the reputation of being magically unblockable, even though we're explicitly told it was blocked by magic at least twice (both times when Voldemort tried to kill Harry). I see the love sacrifice magic as a rare occurrence, because I think if it was more or less regular instead of a freak incident /which blocked the Killing Curse/ then maybe there'd be caveat with the KC - love sacrifice phenomenon is an effective shield.

I like the interpretation that a horcrux wizard might be unaffected by the KC, because I don't think what destroyed Voldemort's body was just his own deflected spell. Two things: one, the KC is said to leave no mark on the body, second, there was sacrificial magic at work that night. That's why I believe it's possible to say that Voldemort might shrug off a KC if no other magic was involved. And finally, Harry's "death" in the Forest. The KC doesn't seem to be as perfect a murder tool as it's reputed to be. Sure, it's the best there is, but it is open to interpretation.

Lastly, to repeat myself, I don't think a horcrux is a matter of simply not passing on into the Great Beyond, because indeed, why not just become a ghost. I think a horcrux is a matter of remaining firmly embodied in the world of the living, which is well out of reach for a ghost.
