  OP, right off the bat you're starting with the wrong premise. Horcruxes don't allow you to come back from the dead, they prevent you from dying at all.
#+end_quote

Which part of what I wrote included that assumption? I never stated that Horcruxes operate in that manner. You can't "come back" if you were never wholly gone in the first place, which appears to be how the Horcrux functions. Any kind of "resurrection" involving the Horcrux isn't a true "come back from the dead" experience, but rather a kind of fortification of whatever soul piece continues to exist on the mortal realm.

My point is it seems highly inefficient and nearly futile to have gone through the trouble of creating a Horcrux. Once your original sentient body has been killed off, your ambiguous soul remains tethered to the mortal realm by the remaining Horcrux. This is well and good, but unless you can get someone to go through the magic (presumably dark, difficult, and requiring high sacrifice by the avenue we witnessed in the graveyard) to get you a body, you're stuck in this pseudo-limbo.

LV managed to regain a body because he had goons waiting in the wings to do his bidding, but how does your average Evil Wizard manage that task without a #squad? The Horcrux is largely inanimate and unable to give directions. Sure, the diary was an ingenious bit of magic, but it's the only example we see of some kind of ability to give explicit directions and it appears to be an anomaly and possibly a piece of magic only someone like LV was capable of. We don't see that same level of possession and direction with any of the other objects.

  Nothing in the HP lore suggests that it's in fact possible to come back from the dead.
#+end_quote

I agree with your overall sentiment but to say "nothing...suggests" is a bit of a stretch considering that there exists a Resurrection Stone. But that is neither here nor there concerning my original question.

  Also, I'm not sure if becoming a ghost is a conscious choice. I don't think it's like "I died, well let's become a ghost, shall we?". I think that ghosts just happen sometimes.
#+end_quote

Not according to Sir Nicholas who states in OotP /"Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod ... I was afraid of death. I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't have ... Well, that is neither here nor there ... In fact, I am neither here nor there..."/ (from the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/creature/non-corporeal/ghost/][Lexicon]])

So yes, there is some way in which wizards can have a say in if they remain as a ghost.

  What you're missing is that the way Voldemort was disembodied isn't a common occurrence.
#+end_quote

Now this actually relates to my original question.

/Do/ we know that it isn't a common occurrence? It's possible Dumbledore mentioned this somewhere and I'm just forgetting when. If you could provide that reference, that would be helpful.

We know that LV didn't /expect/ any kind of repercussion when he AK-ed Harry, but that seems more to do with the fact that he underestimated the role that any kind of protective blood magic might play.

  I want say that having a horcrux makes you "immune" to the Killing Curse, but this seems to clash with canon.
#+end_quote

I agree completely. It does seem to clash with canon, which is exactly why it doesn't make sense for me to theorize about it.

Horcrux creation doesn't grant you "killing curse" or "Unforgivable" immunity as far as we can see in canon. It doesn't seem grant any immunity. Your physical body is still vulnerable to dying off.

So, once your original sentient body has died off, how does an average Joe Evil Wizard get someone to agree to go through a dark, difficult, dangerous ritual to restore his body? This is presuming the Horcrux doesn't get lost for a millenia in the first place, by which point in time whoever he wanted to dominate or be with is long gone anyway.

So if it's more of a matter of not wanting to pass into the Great Beyond, why not just come back as a ghost?
