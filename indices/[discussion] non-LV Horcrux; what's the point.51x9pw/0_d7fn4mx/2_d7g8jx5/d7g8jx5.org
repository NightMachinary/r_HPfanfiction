  I want say that having a horcrux makes you "immune" to the Killing Curse, but this seems to clash with canon.

If Lord Voldemort is immune to the killing curse then I doubt he would ever find out. He didn't take anyone with him on his journey to immortality.

I think he isn't though, as it was the deflection of the killing curse that injured Voldemort.
