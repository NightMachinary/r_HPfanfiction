I guess I could reword my question as: do we have any reason for believing that besides that it's not disproven? Your paragraph is very ambivalent about whether or not you actually feel that is the most likely scenario or if there is any information that actually supports it. You've just written that there is a single occurrence in which Voldemort defended himself against a killing curse and how that doesn't necessarily disprove the theory.
