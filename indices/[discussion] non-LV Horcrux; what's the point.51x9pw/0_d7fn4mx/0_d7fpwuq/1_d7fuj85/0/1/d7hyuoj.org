Agreed; While we don't know for sure all details covering how a Horcrux works, there are at least two canon examples showing a physical body can be vulnerable to destruction despite being the owner/creator of Horcruxes, and no supporting evidence I can think of that suggests they offer the original body some kind of immunity.
