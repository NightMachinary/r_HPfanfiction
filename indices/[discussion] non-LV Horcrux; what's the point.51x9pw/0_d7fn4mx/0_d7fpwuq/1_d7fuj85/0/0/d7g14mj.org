I meant that it was possible to interpret Voldemort's use of the silver shield and subsequent comment about the Killing Curse as not Voldemort actually having expected the KC. This is the interpretation I personally lead towards, because it then allows for a possibility that having a horcrux makes you immune to the KC, which is an idea that appeals to me.
