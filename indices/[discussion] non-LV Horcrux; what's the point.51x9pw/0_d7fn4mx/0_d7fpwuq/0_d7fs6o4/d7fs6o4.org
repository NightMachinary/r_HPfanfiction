Until we know otherwise it seems safest canon-wise to assume the soul merely stays on Earth somewhere.

However that's incredibly inconvenient. If horcruxes can still allow the destruction of the user's body, why didn't Voldemort have a backup plan enacted sooner? Perhaps he was mistaken about the magic (assumed he couldn't lose his body), but pre-insanity Tom Riddle is shown to be an extremely gifted boy. It doesn't make sense that he would misunderstand a huge Dark Art.

A possibility is that horcruxes prevent the soul from being severed (killing curse or life-threatening injuries) except in the case of love, in line with JKR's theme of "love conquered all", or the Elder Wand, which trumps all other magic. So Tom really could never die/lose his body except to a force he didn't understand (love or ownership of the Elder Wand).
