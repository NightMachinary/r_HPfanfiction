  why didn't Voldemort have a backup plan enacted sooner?

He is by far the most arrogant person in the entirety of Harry Potter canon and we know that he's prone to making less that stellar decisions because of it. He never would have truly considered it likely that anyone would manage to kill him, so the only reason he probably thought he'd ever need a new body would be if his current one was getting too old, too damaged, etc. and needed to be replaced, in which case he could make a new one. The important thing to note about that, is that he would never expect to need a new body with no notice. Furthermore, we don't necessarily know how exactly the soul can be transferred to different bodies. It's possible that it's incredibly difficult or even impossible to do any meaningful work on creating a new body before the need for one arises. He also would have been severely hampered by his own secrecy. He didn't and wouldn't tell anyone about his horcruxes, and he would not have let anyone in on the secret to help or maintain some kind of body or resurrection system before he needed it. Unless it's a relatively easy, simple, and stable process, it's entirely possible that he would have been incapable of doing it on his own even if he wanted to.

  It doesn't make sense that he would misunderstand a huge Dark Art.

I'm inclined to agree with you here, but I'm at least a little skeptical. The man was one of the greatest wizards to ever live, but that doesn't make him infallible. Horcruxes are one of the foulest, least known pieces of magic. There was probably only so much information available because 1) Not many people were going to be willing to carry and sell that information, 2) Many of the people that would know the real details of it wouldn't be the kind of people to go writing books on the subject, and 3) It would be a rare art and little experimentation is likely to have been done after the process was actually performed. Information would likely have been limited enough that it would be entirely possible that he would be mistaken about some of the aspects of the magic.
