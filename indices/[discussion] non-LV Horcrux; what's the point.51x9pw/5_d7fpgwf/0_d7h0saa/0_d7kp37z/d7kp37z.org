Assuming the ritual is the only way to do so. Remember, the Diary told Harry that after he'd drained the life force out of Ginny's body, he'd return in full force. So, it's much like a phylactery but it needs life energy to power the reconstruction process of the body. By the time of GoF, he didn't have a horcrux near enough to anyone for them to feed his soul enough life force to power the reconstruction.
