"Inelegant" is a great way to put it. Your point about trying to get a new body is spot on; It seems nigh impossible that anyone without some kind of cultic following (ie, Voldemort) would be able to get another to carry out the body remaking process once their sentient original body was gone. Just thinking out loud here--for the average evil wizard without an evil posse who only splits their soul once, how do they get someone to carry out their bidding to recreate them a body?
