Not sure what you're looking for. The closest thing in style and tone is probably Victoria Potter.

For other WBWL's I'd recommend Subversion, The Pureblood Pretense, maybe Sarcasm and Slytherin on AO3. All extremely similar in tone, maybe a little less well-executed and all a bit snarkier than Boy Who Lived.

If you're looking for other magical schools, I don't really know many others that do it well, Alexandra Quick maybe but that's quite a different fic. If you're ok with that I'd highly recommend.

If you just want the magical innovation go with Phoenix and the Serpent or NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series, both are great but the latter is complete.
