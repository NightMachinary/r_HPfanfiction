[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820671/1/][All Our Yesterdays]] Is what you're looking for I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]] Slightly less like groundhog day in that the loops:

1. last longer than a day

2. have a variable start and end

  Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. Death is not treated like a slap to the wrist though, less "darn I thought it was going well" more "OH GOD I JUST GOT HIT BY A TRAIN /silently weeps/"
