[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870119/1/][Narcissa's Chance]] - Thrust back in time Harry wants to destroy Voldemort. Narcissa Black wants a better life than marriage to Lucius. Time Traveling Harry Potter goodness. HP/NM HP/BL unrequited HP/MM

[[http://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/A_Time_To_Reflect/index/][A Time To Reflect]] - To prevent a Dark Lord from destroying everything, The Almighty sends Harry back in time - not telling him that he was the one she was saving them from in the first place.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12660172/1/][A Life Twice Lived]] - Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters. Fem!Draco

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/][Stepping Back]] - Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7390178/1/][Multiverse]] - Every once in a while, good crack can brighten your day. If you aren't familiar with this one, I'll elucidate. The multiverse is real, as are the gods. In one particular universe, one of the gods sneezed. This resulted in something being horribly missed, and one Manipulative Old Bastard took advantage. Result? Multiversal Armageddon. Rather than fix it themselves, they con a poor schmuck - Uh... Hero... to remedy the problem by going through a multitude of alternate universes to correct the problem enough to start a propagation wave that will counter the problem.

Said schmuck is one of the many Harry James Potters.

They initially denied his request for the only other survivor of his Second Blood War, up until one of his solutions was to have a nuclear missile smack Hogwarts. They didn't care that it was the middle of summer. *At any rate, they reluctantly agreed to have* *Luna Lovegood* *be his Moral Compass.*

The universe was never the same.

Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
