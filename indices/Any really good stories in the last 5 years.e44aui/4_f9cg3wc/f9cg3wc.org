Hermione/Ron. Ron and Harry get more intense training than usual but nothing completely unrealistic. Voldemort is dark and evil, the Ministry is not dark but goes evil too, Hermione gets into a bad situation and becomes a fugitive from the law. Dumbledore tries to steer the Ministry on a better course while organizing the order. Seamus Finnigan has 'contacts' in Ireland supplying semtex, and that's how you get the title image of Hermione walking away from a massive explosion full of ex Death Eaters.
