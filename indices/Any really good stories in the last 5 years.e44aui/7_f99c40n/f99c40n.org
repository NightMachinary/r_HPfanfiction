Six Pomegranate Seeds linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds]]) and its ongoing sequel Bouquet of Asphodels linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13267404/1/Bouquet-of-Asphodels]]) are two of my favorites.

Something goes wrong during the Battle of Hogwarts. Quasi-reincarnation fic with good reasons to avoid canon divergence. Instead of a complete canon rehash though we get a different perspective on the series by virtue of the POV not being focused on the core cast. The sequel is completely post series and written in very short chapters that are working to tell a very political story.
