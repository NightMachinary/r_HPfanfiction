I remember one [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel][Percy Take The Wheel]] on fanfiction.net

I cant entirely remember what happens but basically there was an explosion at the burrow that kills Molly, puts Arthur in St Mungos and Bill and Charlie cant come home to look after the younger Weasleys, so Percy takes over. He also pretty much adopts Harry for good measure.

Set Harry's 2nd year.

It's been a while since I last read it and I cant remember much else (slow WIP) but wasnt bad.
