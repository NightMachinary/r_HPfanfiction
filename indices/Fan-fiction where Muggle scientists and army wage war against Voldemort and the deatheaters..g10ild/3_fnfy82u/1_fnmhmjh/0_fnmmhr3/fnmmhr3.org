A Voldemort controlled society isn't one that's hidden from Muggles, he's actively attacking and seeking to eliminate them, especially in ways they cannot understand (i.e. Dementors, dark magic in general that they have no counter for, any charm that repels Muggles is simply unstoppable). Guns really have no use here. Kingsley got into the UK Prime Minister's office as a worker, and not a single person in the bureaucracy realized he was a person that didn't exist, according to Muggle records (Kingsley is a pureblood).
