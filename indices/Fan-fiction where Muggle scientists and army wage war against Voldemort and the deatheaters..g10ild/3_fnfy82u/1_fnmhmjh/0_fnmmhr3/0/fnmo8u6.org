You're forgetting that secrecy is an international agreement. If Voldemort kills a few muggles here and there and obliviators cover it up then other countries will want to stay out of it and hope for someone else to deal with it. But if Voldemort threatens to expose magic large scale other countries won't be able to ignore him and the Voldemort war will turn from a local civil war into wizard world war. Assuming that Voldemort knows that he can't take on the entire magical world, the best option is to isolate magical Britain as much as possible.
