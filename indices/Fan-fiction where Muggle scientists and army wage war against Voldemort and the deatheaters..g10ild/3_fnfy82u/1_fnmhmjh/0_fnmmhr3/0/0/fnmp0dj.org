The scenario you present is nonsensical..it's not an assumption to say Voldemort knows he can't take the rest of the magical world on, because we see that he does not even try that in canon. Even with magic exposed, there is literally nothing Muggles can do against even a tepid wizard offensive. Teleporting, mind control they cannot break, enchanted areas they cannot enter or physically interact with (Unplottable places). It's simply impossible, which is why the Muggles are portrayed the way they are. They really haven't got a chance.
