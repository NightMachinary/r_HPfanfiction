This... isn't really true. Wizards have every advantage except for numbers. Complete mind control, memeory erasure, matter alteration, teleportation, control over whether or not Muggles can enter the space they charm, etc. That's why MI-6 has no chance of knowing anything about the cause of the magical catastrophes, because they literally had wizards in the PM's office (it was Kingsley, in this case), protecting him and also allowing them to stop any attempt of what you're talking about. Muggles actually are defenseless against any concerted wizard attack, or even just a determined loner. I know this isn't really what you're asking for (others gave you some), but Muggle wank isn't really reasonable against just what I mentioned above. Atom bombs don't matter when there's no way, for instance, to use them against the wizards without just mostly or only killing Muggles (I don't think it's possible for Muggles to even interact with the space of Diagon Alley without a wizard literally walking them in).
