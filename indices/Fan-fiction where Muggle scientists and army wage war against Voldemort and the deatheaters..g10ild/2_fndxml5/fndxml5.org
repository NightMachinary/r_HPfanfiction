I think the reason a lot of fans don't go for these is that if muggle weapons work so well against wizards the wizards wouldn't last very long. Just from basic firepower and then quite frankly sheer numbers. So while you can find quite a few stories where muggle weapons are used most stories either have wizards use shields that prevent the rounds hitting or explain how the technology fails around magic eg primer won't ignite when struck, etc.

This story has Harry easily handling the third task. Atonement by old-crow
