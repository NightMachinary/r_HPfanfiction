  It's been six years since Harry was left on the Dursleys' doorstep. Sirius is in prison, Remus is friendless, and Pettigrew is secretly in hiding. But some things are meant to be, and Arthur Weasley bumping into a famous Magizoologist is one of those things. Just what events will this meeting set in motion?This story won second place in the Shrieking Shack Society's Marauder Medals 2018 for Best Pairing (Wolfstar)! Thank you all for the continuous support!
