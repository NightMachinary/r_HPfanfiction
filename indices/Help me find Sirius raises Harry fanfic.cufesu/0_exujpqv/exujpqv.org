Recently read this one: mango-melone: The Letter [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11993043/1/The-Letter]]

Sirius and Remus raise Harry with Sirius on the run from Azkaban. The story doesn't treat Dumbledore kindly all the time, but that's because they are temporarily on a different side of a conflicted situation. He's reasonable, so I don't think it bashes. I love how it's told from Harry's point of view.
