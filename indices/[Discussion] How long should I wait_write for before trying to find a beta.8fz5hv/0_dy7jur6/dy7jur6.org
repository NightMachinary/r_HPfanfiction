I'd work out your end goal and a plan to get there first. Right now it seems you haven't got a story, you've got an idea and ideas are flighty. In my opinion, and bare in mind its just an opinion the ending should be one of the first things to write. It doesn't have to be finalised but it gives you something to work towards. Its so easy to write down the first 3-4 chapters while an idea is fresh in your mind as you explore a quirk that you're interested in, not that its easy to write well mind, just having an idea and putting words on a page isn't hard. Without an end goal its really hard to know if your story has mileage, without something to work towards and a decent plan its so easy to go off at a tangent. That tangent can be really interesting to you, it can be quite interesting to read about but once you get there and you're finished with the tangent you realise you're now completely derailed and have no idea how to get the story back where you want. When that happens, once you've written yourself into a corner its really easy to give up and that's a shame if you've worked hard on the rest of it.
