That actually does make a lot of sense. While I think I do have at least /part/ of a story, I will agree that writing more without planning a direction is probable a dumb idea on my part. I just think that having someone else look at what I've got so far, they might be able to give me a different perspective on the thing, and help me come up with something to work towards. I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to offload my problems.

Anyway, I will try and come up with an ending to work towards, as well as a rough plan of how to get there.

Thanks for the comprehensive reply!
