I would definitely recommend figuring out the end. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but knowing where you want to end up can help with long fics and continuity.

Say you have a great idea in one chapter and think that is the general direction you want to go. That's all fine and good until three chapters later where something else happened and you now want to go this direction and have forgotten that vital thing from before that you had started building upon. Believe me, it happens (yes, speaking from personal experience). You are then stuck with several different plot directions and potential plotholes. It's also possible that you end up writing yourself into a corner and you have no way of fixing it without redoing several previous chapters.

Setting up your ending, isn't as constraining as it may sound. You still have the whole story to plan where you can add in twists and surprises- but you now have the end in mind and know where you need to be.
