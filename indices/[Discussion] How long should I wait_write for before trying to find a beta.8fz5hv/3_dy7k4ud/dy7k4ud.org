I'd have the general story worked out before doing anything. This will ensure your writing has direction, that it's going somewhere. This allows you to plan better and to write chapters to get you to where you need to be and avoid writer's block more easily.

As for a beta, I personally waited until I had written a chapter or two published before I picked one up. Probably not the best way to go about it, but on the plus side if you can at least have decent grammar and spelling, you can get away with it for a bit.
