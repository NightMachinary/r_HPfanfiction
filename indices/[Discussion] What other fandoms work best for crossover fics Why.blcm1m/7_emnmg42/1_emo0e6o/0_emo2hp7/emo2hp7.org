Probably the best story and it is not in [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. Summary inside.

​

This one has a similar premise, AU Harry joins a Grail War in Londom.

This one is interesting, Kiritsugo finds Harry before the fourth War and "adopts" him except he goes off to Fuuki leaving Harry to be raised by Jubstacheit von Einzbern. He participates in the fifth war before Hogwarts to support his sister and this is just the Prologue.
