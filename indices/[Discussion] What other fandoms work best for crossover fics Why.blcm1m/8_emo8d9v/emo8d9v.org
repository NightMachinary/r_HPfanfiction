LoTR can work extremely well, or extremely not. It really depends on how you approach it.

If you follow a lot of lore, and thus approach Tolkien's own great magic and inner power of Elves, dragons or things from the elder age you don't have to nerf Harry at all. Generally, I think a crossover works best if the power scales are somewhat comparable - but might operate on a very different scale.

Shadow of Angmar is one of the greatest crossovers I have read.linkffn(11115934)

Mass Effect and Warcraft can work. Surprisingly Twilight can be great, if it's not a horrifically bad shipping fic.

The Forks Massacre linkffn(9625517) is great, for example.

The one thing that I would REALLY want to read, is a solid, good HP/Disney crossover. Disney stories can easily be written as very mature, but it just doesn't happen. There was one(!) good frozen crossover, but I feel there's so much wasted potential. It could also help with the more whimsical tone of canon HP, instead of the grimmer tone many authors chase.
