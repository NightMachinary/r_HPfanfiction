The Witcher works incredibly well, the universe is very well crafted, and the Conjunction of the Spheres allows portals between worlds.

â€‹

Warcraft Universe would also be a good bet, interstellar portals, Burning Legion, Old Gods, and anybody can be an adventurer and do something in here. And the setting is very flexible. Wanna take it very seriously ? You can. Want a joke world ? There are murder hobos, the "heroes" are retards that often cause the problems they must then solve (by killing things until it is solved) and the planet face annihilation every two years.

And the magic system is at the same time quite well defined and very flexible because the details are left in the shadows, so you can play with it however you want.
