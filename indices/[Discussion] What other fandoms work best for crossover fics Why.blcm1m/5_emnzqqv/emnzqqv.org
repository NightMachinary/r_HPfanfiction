Ideally you'd want a universe with a system of magic that's distinct from HP's, developed enough that you can discuss how the systems interact, but ambiguous enough that... well, you can discuss how the systems interact. Characters in the universe should either be compatible enough to make their reactions to Harry and vice versa entertaining or blank slates so that you can do the same.

Homestuck, the Nasuverse, Familiar of Zero, DMC, LotR, Madoka (and similar), Sentai, Code: Geass, most Disney films, comics, Avatar, TES, Riordenverse, Artemis Fowl, Buffy, Sabrina, etc.

Firefly/Serenity doesn't follow most of those rules, which is a great example of the fact that having a good writer is more important than having a compatible universe, as /Green Eyes, Brown Coat/ shows.
