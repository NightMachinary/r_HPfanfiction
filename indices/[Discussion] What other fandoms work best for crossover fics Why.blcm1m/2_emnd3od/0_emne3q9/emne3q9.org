I totally agree with you that there needs to be an even playing field when it comes to battles.

I suppose the reason I like ASOIF fics is because how an author explores the cultural intersections. I'm not a huge action person when it comes to fanfics, I'm one of those Chad's who likes political fics and ASOIF really lends to that. Marvel and LOTR tend to do the same. Honestly most fandoms have a misogynistic assholes so dick measuring contests tend to flow naturally.
