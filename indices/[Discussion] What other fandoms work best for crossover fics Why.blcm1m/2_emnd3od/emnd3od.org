I don't want to see HP magic overpowered to the point where authors have to nerf it to create a challenge. Thus, I don't like the ASOIF world. Our own world sucks too because one person with a wand can take it over pretty quickly.

LOTR works because its magic is different and has power HP magic does not. One Ring is basically a Horcrux.

High powered Sci-fi universes such as Battlestar Galactica, Marvel, Mass Effect, Serenity, Star Gate, Star Wars, and Star Trek all work well as they have powers comparable or exceeding HP magic. Nevertheless, HP Magic is competitive and our characters can make a difference there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), deserves special recommendation as it involves both Harry and Hermione, and changes canons in all affected universes.

As for what crossover could be interesting, Fallout is definitely one. The setting is post apocalyptic so the Wizards don't have to hide anymore and can be a very beneficial force. They do face formidable challenges as their magic may not work well on many of their new enemies (and monsters). Writers have lots of leeways here to develop their world and make necessary adjustments to the balance of power. Unfortunately, there is NOT a single finished crossover between HP and FO based on my knowledge.
