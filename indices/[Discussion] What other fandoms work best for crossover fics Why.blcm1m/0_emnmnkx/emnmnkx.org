Short and sweet but HP/Riordan's books (Percy Jackson etc) are interesting. The issue is that PJO has a rather young active fanbase and you have to hunt for the good fics.

The primary characters are around the same age and have gone through similar life experiences so it's cool to see how they interact with each other.
