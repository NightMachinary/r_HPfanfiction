I'm biased, because it was what got me back into HP fanfiction, but I'd say My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. I'd say that it's a crossover that works mostly in one direction, though, as bringing HP characters into Equestria would not create as interesting situations as vice versa.

There's quite a few fics that have done this already (see [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/197441/harry-potter-crossovers][this collection on fimfiction.net, for instance]]), but most are examples of what not to do in a HP fanfic. There's tons of extremely clich√©d tropes in most of them: apartment trunks and too-friendly goblins and getting Sirius freed before Harry's first day at Hogwarts, to name a few examples.

What they tend to get right, though, is that just about any character from MLP would quickly nestle themselves into friendships with the people around them, and if that includes Harry, they would quickly become a source of affection and support that he needs.

It's also fairly easy to figure out how they would react to various events, as there's a lot of source material by now (on the 9th season at the moment, with a movie and a spin-off series, plus the comics and books), and the characters are mostly well-written, with multiple facets (though Flanderization set in early and has gotten worse over time).

A few other points why I consider the crossover to be a good match:

- There's canon or easy-to-rationalize crossover mechanics: The Crystal Mirror that transports and transforms ponies into a (more or less) human universe and closes after a few days; Discord, the Spirit of Chaos who would think it would be great enjoyment to see what would happen; the odd dimensional portal or magic accident that can trap someone in the other dimension.

- The magic systems are fairly comparable, though if you bring in the top tier casters from Equestria, expect them to quickly rise to power and trash the story as a result. As long as they're reasonably written, any other pony should be in the mid-range of the HP power scale, with the exception that they would likely become very skilled with spells related to their special talent.

- The fish-out-of-water theme from the first books would be easily applicable to a pony from a magical dimension where nature doesn't work, the technology level is 1950s at best, and danger is common but comes with kids gloves.

- MLP characters would consider the Wizarding world to be really irrational, but bring their own brand of craziness to the table.
