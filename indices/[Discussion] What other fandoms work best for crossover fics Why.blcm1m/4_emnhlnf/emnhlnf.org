So this is my humble opinion, and almost certainly a biased one at that.

​

I think fandoms where magic or the fantastical exist already work best. Obviously my own bias includes Star Wars (like the you tube video about the death star design, Jedi are basically Space Wizards! ^_^). But whereas my fic has magic and the force as one and the same, just used different... a completely different and totally valid (and awesome) look is Tsu Doh Nimh's The Havoc Side of the Force ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]] ) where his magic is completely different and is anathema to the Jedi.

​

Comics also have a basis in magic too. Marvel has Dr. Strange and co. DC has Zatanna, Dr. Fate, the greek gods etc. Image has Spawn and Darkness and such. Fantasy series such as LoTR and GoT work exceptionally well, though they can be a struggle to write in, at least in my head. ( At least LoTR, I don't actually know GoT. Not a fan of ASOIAF.

​

Places without magic per-se also work if Harry's trying to keep his magic a secret.

​

Places where Harry's form of magic doesn't work is also okay, if he has to learn to use something different. Or if his own magic has a unique interaction with that setting's magic. There was a Belgariad Crossover that had a ton of potential where Harry's magic worked but it drove everyone nuts so they trained him on his.

​

The only places I struggle to see it, are places where magic is so narrowly defined. Magic by it's nature is flexible and can fit in different arenas. A setting like D&D... probably wouldn't ever be one I wrote in since magic is so rigidly defined (by necessity) that it would be more about the mechanics than it would be about an actual story.
