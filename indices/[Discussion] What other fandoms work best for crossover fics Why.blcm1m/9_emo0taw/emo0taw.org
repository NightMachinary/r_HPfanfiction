If I am being forced to give my opinion, the best crossovers right now are your Marvel/HP crossovers. This is mainly due to the attention that the MCU has given the fandoms.

The inheritance Cycle should translate beautifully towards Harry Potter, as long as the Ancient Language (the magic system of the series) is able to interact with HP Magic.

There are others as well; Mentioned by Kathrynd Star Wars has some wonderful additions to the fandom, one I am currently reading is linkffn(12497548). Now there is an issue with crossing over with Star Wars, Star Trek, battle star galactica, stargate, etc. That issue is the emphasis on technical advancement, which if we are staying true to canon HP, poses a major issue as any tech going into Hogwarts shouldn't be working, at least effectively.

There are a few fandoms I do not allow myself to read if they are crossed over with Harry Potter. The most obvious is Dragonball Z/ One Punchman/ etc where the emphasis is close combat that eventually grows to planet busting levels. This form of combat does not suit the Harry Potter Meta where conflict is rarely ever solved by power, but by knowledge of how to get the most bang for your buck. The other fandom I avoid is Naruto. This is primarily for the reason that Kakashi from Part 1 of Naruto should be more than enough to handle even Albus Dumbledore, due to how radically different the combat ideals are. In Harry Potter one of the most terrible things you can do is kill, torture or control others. In Naruto there is an entire branch of the damn military that does all of those. Not a good crossover.

One that I would like to see but havent seen done well at all would be an Avatar the Last AirBender cross over. The outputs of energy would be similar, with a good wizard being on par with most masters of each of the bending arts, at least in combative potential. Fire is still a very strong thing to fight against, and a wizard would be unable to shield forever. Apparation would be broken, but then again, that can easily be fixed in a decent fic.
