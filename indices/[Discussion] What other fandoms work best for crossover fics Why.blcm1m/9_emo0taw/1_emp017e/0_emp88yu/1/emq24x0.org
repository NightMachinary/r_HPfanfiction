I'm annoyed that we haven't met Doctor Strange, and yet events from Black Phanter is already happened. It will be interesting how HP Wizards reacts that there's another wizarding society hiding on earth.

And I still hope Ressurection Stone is the Soul Stone, with them being created by Death and all.
