Crossovers I've enjoyed:

Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider)

Well, canon Bill already raids tombs in Egypt. Adding in Petunia as badass squib archeologist works quite well.

Linkffn(Raptor by sakurademonalchemist)

Instead of Norbert, Hagrid's egg contains a velociraptor who got stolen from Isla Nublar. Jurassic Park works really well since it's also happening around 1993.

Linkffn(The Lightsaber)

Harry uses magic to make a lightsaber and learns to use the Force. Crossover with Star Wars without any actual characters or locations, just people trying to imitate it.

Linkffn(The Very Best by BrilliantLady)

Harry creates Pok√©mon. Like The Lightsaber, it's people trying to imitate something they saw in muggle fiction with magic, so it's not a true crossover. Still works.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage)

Harry Stark, adopted son of Tony Stark. It works... Somewhat.

Linkao3(Mischief's Heir)

Harry adopted by MCU pre-Thor Loki. It also works as wizards are just one of many groups of people with strange abilities.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Regulus has to work with the part of the MI6 that knows about magic to track down death eaters hiding in the muggle world. James Bond crossover.

Linkffn(One Punch Wizard)

Harry raised by One Punch Man. Not really balanced at all.
