ASOIAF, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Star Wars, Code Geass, Youjo Senki, Spice and Wolf, Percy Jackson, and the Marvel universe are all good crossovers that can work well with HP imo. All of them feature either magic, or technology that can fit well in a magical setting, and a great cast of characters that you can craft a story around.
