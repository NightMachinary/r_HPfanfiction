Look, the best crossover settings are ones where you have several factors involved:

Connection friendliness; settings where crossing over doesn't present too many problems. Rwby is a good example here: seemingly homogenous language, culture, advanced tech and plenty of reasons your crossover protags has at their disposal to explain how they slid through the cracks as it were. In addition, the enemies have scaling threat levels attached to them where you can pick & choose which foes your protags face.

Easy for a character from virtually any setting to slip in, as it were.

Compare and contrast with Warhammer 40k, a setting where your protag's best guarantee of survival is to side with the Catholic Space Nazis, every single enemy is either OP or a master of manipulation, you expose your very soul to Hell every time you perform magic and everything's out to kill you, the vast majority of your new allies included.

I mean sure, if you can convincingly write a protags that's perfectly happy to sit in a trench and shoot at insects with a lasrifle for a decade or more, that's great. Protags like Harry Potter would probably top out at five minutes in terms of life expectancy in that world though.

Detailed settings, clear crossover points: Simply put, the more we know about how both sides of the cross work, the easier it is to integrate them. Also, periods where your protags can step into the crossover story without immediately dying is definitely a good idea.

Example: Familiar of Zero. Detailed setting, simple magic system, clear cut political and socio-economic trigger points. Easy , easy, easy.

Counter example: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (the movie). Nebulous and surreal, actually writing something for that rather than the book or the game (of which I know of ONE crossover worth mentioning thanks to Theanna The White) is either and exercise in world-building, a waste of time or both.

Easily avoidable stations of canon: because nobody wants a rehash, having a story where you're able to just throw the script out of the window or just have your protags do something completely different while the plot happens elsewhere is key here. And it helps if said plot features clearly defined moments and places that can be entirely avoided by the protags without threatening to derail the whole storyline.

Example: Hogwarts. Bumming around the castle and having adventures while the plot happens to other people is easy; just avoid contact with the Golden Trio at all costs and you'll be okay for six out of the seven books.

Counter example: Star Wars: the clone wars. Bumming around a galaxy in the middle of a civil war without backup gets your protags ganked. Sticking to Jedi, Clones or the CIS for protection is the way to go to avoid messy dismemberment or being shot by a laser cannon.

Characters with loads of interactions with everything: the more we know about a person, the easier it is to figure out how they'd react to certain situations. Do I really need to explain why this is a good thing to have in a crossover character?

Example: Harry Dresden. The entire series is from his perspective. You can't get more into a character's head than that.

Counter example: Sherlock Holmes. Any Holmes. Jesus that man's hard to write.

And that's it folks.
