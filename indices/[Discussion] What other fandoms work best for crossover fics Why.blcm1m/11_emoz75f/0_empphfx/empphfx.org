Yeah FMA does work pretty well. The Colours of the World is probably my favorite too, but yeah a lot of the ones I've read are sort of similar(Truth sends one or more FMA characters to HP verse on a mission). I like the premise so that doesn't really bother me. The Scientist's Lament is pretty good too and updates occasionally, though I find the author's decision to have the Elric Brothers have accents kind of annoying to read.
