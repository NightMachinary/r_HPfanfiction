It was really popular when I was about 12 and fanfic was starting to take off for fics (almost exclusively self insert/mary sues who were the love interest for Draco/Fred/Harry/Sirius/whoever the author who was usually a preteen/ teen girl happened to fancy).

The now defunct quizilla was full of them.
