Yes. At least in fanfiction. 1st person is REALLY hard to pull off as a writer and so far I have not found a single fanfiction that manages it. And I have been reading fanfiction for over 18 years.

But in normal literature I don't really have a problem with it since the writer usually knows what they are doing.
