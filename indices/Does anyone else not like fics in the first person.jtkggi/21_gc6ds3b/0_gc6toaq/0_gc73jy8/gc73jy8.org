Me personally I have less of a problem w/ first person in places where the source material is in first person as well

Or if it's stuff where first person is kinda expected (like epistolary - I'm actually a pretty big fan of epistolary fic)

And ofc, if the writing/author/premise is good enough, I tend to be willing to at least give it a try

For some weird reason I'm actually a pretty big fan of second person (not reader fic though - I don't read reader fic - I mean second person where the â€˜you' is an actual canon character)

I dunno, it just has this aesthetic and weird intimacy and understanding to it - it's just a pretty cool POV to read stuff in!
