I feel the same way. For some reason even though I don't mind books written in first person at all (e.g. Hunger Games, Percy Jackson), I can't stand first person fic. I literally clicked out of a highly recommended fic after the first paragraph when I saw "I." I've tried it again but still couldn't get past the first person.

I don't get people who say they don't notice. Like, how is it unnoticeable? I'm not /trying/ to get fixated on the POV; it's practically slapping me in the face.
