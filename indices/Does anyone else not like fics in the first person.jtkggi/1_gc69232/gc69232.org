I don't dislike first person itself per se, I rather enjoy a lot of stories in first person myself, but I do very much acknowledge that first person is far harder to write well and most times, the fic would be better written in third person. It's not that there's anything intrinsically better about third person, in my eyes, just that it's easier to write than first.
