1st Person gets more difficult (and less effective) the more viewpoints you add. Two or three is probably the upper limit before things get muddled. Most stories that would /require/ tons of POVs wouldn't be written in 1st Person, anyway. In my story, I keep only use Harry's POV, so I don't have to worry about all that. Here's a link if you're interested.
