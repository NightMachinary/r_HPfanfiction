Hey! 1st Person POV (hp fanfic) writer, here. Beyond it being the perspective I feel most comfortable with, I love 1st Person because of how direct the reader's link is with the interiority of the character. The focus is different --- the scale of the story, I mean. Totally get why it wouldn't be someone's cup of tea, though. Especially since most HP fanfiction writers prefer 3rd Person Limited :)
