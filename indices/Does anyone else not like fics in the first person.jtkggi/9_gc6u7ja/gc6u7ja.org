I once hated the first person point of view, but nowadays I actually like it very much if it's written well. It opens interesting possibilities for the unreliable narrator, for example. I find it funny when the narrator's voice has a distinct tone. It can be sarcastic, condescending, biased etc., making it clear that it is the main character's person seeping into the narration. It can make the story more immersive than the third person point of view, because a distinct narrator's voice just doesn't fit the third person.

I'm currently writing a story in first person, but I'm planning of making a third person version and publishing it on another site once the story is finished. It's quite sad that readers don't give a story a chance for reasons like this.
