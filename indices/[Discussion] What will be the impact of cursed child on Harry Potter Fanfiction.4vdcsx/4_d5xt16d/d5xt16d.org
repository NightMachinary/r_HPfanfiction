When the spoilers first started leaking I was horrified. I honestly felt betrayed by the scale of the retcons necessary. I thought it might be th end of my participation in the fandom, never mind the fan fiction works I had in progress.

But then I realized that as much as I despised /this/ story what it *did* do was render any and all AUs possible/valid. By retconning the lore on time turners it made anything as likely to happen as anything else.

So for all I loathe and despise every story and plot detail I have heard I am still inspired by the floodgates of possibility it opens.
