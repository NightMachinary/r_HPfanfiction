I've read the summery of Cursed Child and to me it sounded like a fic. Slightly longer and more complicated but definitely similar to the ones I have read about the next generation.

There will probably more Bellatrix/Voldemort now that it is confirmed. Plus writers will maybe make the personalities of Rose, Albus and Scorpius more similar to those in CC.

I think the impact won't be big seeing as most people seem to hate it (as far as I have seen). Most don't even consider it canon.
