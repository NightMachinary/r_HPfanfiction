  Most don't even consider it canon.

Which doesn't surprise me. I mean, yeah, sure, Rowling-approved; but written by someone else, and violates one of the rules of that created world, a rule that Madame Rowling herself talked about.

And with that, it might as well have been called “Harry Potter: The Play: Official Fanfiction: Return to the Future: Cursed Child”. And yes, the title is supposed to be half a joke and half a mockery. As I hadn't the possibility of watching the play, for those who did I hope that at least the effects were decent.
