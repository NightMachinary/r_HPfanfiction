Not much on this sub, given how people responded back then: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4nihhp/effects_of_cursed_child_on_fanfics_major_spoilers/]]

But in the general fandom, I do expect many writers to pick up things mentioned in the Play. Scorpius will become a fan favorite, and tons of Scorose and Scorbus fluff fics will appear.
