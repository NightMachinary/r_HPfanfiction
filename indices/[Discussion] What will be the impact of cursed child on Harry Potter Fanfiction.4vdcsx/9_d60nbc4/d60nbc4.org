I hope and pray that it brings some long retired authors out of retirement whether they enjoyed CC or not. I hope it will bring infrequent writers back to being more active in writing again. I think I may cry tears of joy if Miranda Flairgold or Jbern or even S. S. Idget update their stories. So many great stories abandoned waiting for their author's to return. That's what I've wished for since I heard CC and Fantastic Beasts would be coming out, I doubt it will come true, but a guy can wish.
