In a word, yes.

The way I look at it, fanfic is to canon as canon is to real life.

In "original" fiction like the HP novels, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated relative to real life. In [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml]["earthfic"]] in particular, we expect the story to be something that /actually could happen/ in reality as we know it. In sci-fi or fantasy, we expect internal consistency, and for the elements that could not be found in reality as we know it (such as magic wands) to be justified---to contribute to the story. For those elements that aren't explicitly magical, we sill expect realism relative to real life: for example, we expect wizards to act like people.

Now, in fanfic, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated /relative to canon/. Therefore, deviations from canon setting and characters are analogous to "unrealistic" elements in "original" fiction: they need to be justified, either in that they contribute the story or in that they are necessary for internal consistency with deviations that do.

Another way to look at it is that a story has a Suspension of Disbelief Budget, and every inconsistency---internal or external---spends from that budget. In "original" fiction, external consistency is relative to real life, but in fanfic, it's relative to the canon. (If one change logically implies others, there is no double-spending, however.) The bigger the SoD spend, the more it needs to buy for the story to justify itself.

For example, take the premise of Hermione being sorted into Slytherin. Given her character and the traits that Slytherin nominally wants, it's not unbelievable, so there is little SoD cost. But then, if it turns out that the fic also features a Manipulative!Dumbledore or Nice!Accepting!Slytherins or BloodPurist!Bully!Gryffindors, the fic is now taking place in a very different world from canon, and there is a lot of disbelief to suspend.
