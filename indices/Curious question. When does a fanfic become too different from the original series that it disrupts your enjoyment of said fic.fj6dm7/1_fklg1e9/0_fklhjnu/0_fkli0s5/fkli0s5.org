I'm sorry but I don't think I would enjoy a story were Albus Dumbleodre and Severus Snape are teaching balette or some other dances. And what psychological horror is there gonna be? It will probably not be better than the horror I could read in some published contemporary Horror novel. I read Harry Potter fanfictions because of the general world (Magic with Wands, Hogwarts, The Ministry) and the characters. One of those things seem to be completely butchered in your example.
