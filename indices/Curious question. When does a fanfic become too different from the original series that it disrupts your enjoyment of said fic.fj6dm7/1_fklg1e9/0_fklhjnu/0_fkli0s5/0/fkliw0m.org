Trust me, I was just as put off by the 'dance school' idea until I eventually tried reading it. The horror is similar in tone and themes to /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)][Black Swan]]/ but tied into the plot and characters of the Harry Potter series. Instead of '/Swan Lake/' the characters are rehearsing for a world renowned ballet titled 'A Prophecy', and more people than just the main character seem to lose their grasp on reality as the story develops.

  I read Harry Potter fanfictions because of the general world (Magic with Wands, Hogwarts, The Ministry) and the characters.

Ah, so your preferences are more specific than your initial comment made it seem. To each their own.
