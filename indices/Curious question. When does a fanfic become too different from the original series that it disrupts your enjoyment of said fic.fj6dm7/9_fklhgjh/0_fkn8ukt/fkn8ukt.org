Do you hold that stance to all fandoms or just certain ones? DC comics has a multiverse of many alternative realities so its perfectly understandable that you could have a universe with a powerless Clark kent that works alongside his boyfriend Jimmy Olsen to expose Business woman Lois Lane

so if True Blood or HP established alternative realities would you still feel the same way ?
