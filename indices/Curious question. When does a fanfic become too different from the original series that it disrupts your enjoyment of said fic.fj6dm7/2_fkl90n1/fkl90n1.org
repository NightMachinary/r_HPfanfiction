I have no objection to reading all sorts of different versions of the HP universe. However I do get distracted by things happening in Muggle Britain that wouldn't really happen. Harry finding a snake in the garden, for example. We don't live in a tropical climate, and there are only a few species of snake native to Britain, none of which generally live in suburbia. :-) People do keep pet snakes, so if it was explained away as an escaped pet then fair enough. In terms of Harry versions, I tend to turn off from stories where he's either super powerful or willing to commit crimes galore - this just feels too far from the 'correct' Harry.
