Wards, Lord Potter, Harry is a Black, "reaching out with his magic," super powerful Harry and weird character behaviour.

When /all/ that stuff is in one fic? I'm out. At least now. I have, after all, read all of HPMOR which is... um, definitely all that stuff except maybe the reaching out with magic (been a while since I read it... not going to re-read it).

I've read some pretty divergent things, if I'm being honest but usually there's something there. Take The Granger Principle and most of the other things I've read by [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] where there can be very big differences but usually the characters feel mostly the same. And then there's the various other dimension/time travel ones I've looked into... that's usually a pretty big deviation but these fics (in my experience) don't usually dive into all that stuff. Wards, sure, and maybe Dorea/Charlus (instead of Fleamont/Euphemia) but the rest, no? Harry still typically remains mostly ordinary.

I think it mostly comes down to whether or not an idea annoys me. There was this one fic, can't remember which now (and while I hope it was one I finished I suspect it may have been Of a Linear Circle which I clocked out of because it looked like Snarry), where (iirc) the DADA professor asks the class about wards. The pupils then mention that wards are Real and the DADA professor is like "nope! anything you call a ward is just some other kind of spell and none of them do the same sorts of things so why bother talking about wards". I hate wards so I loved that. But wards aren't, alone, a decisive factor.

I will say... if it's canon compliant or offering something I like, I'm much more tolerant of quality problems. But most of the canon compliant stuff I've read is, to my mind, well written.

EDIT: I'm seeing people (in the comments) who don't like non-magical AUs. I'm totally cool with them. Not sure I'd read a muggle Dramione, though. If the character feels like what a muggle Harry Potter is like I'll keep going. Read one the other day actually... Harry was the son of someone famous (in context, it's a spoiler who), Ginny was a (reitired) boxer. Obviously, The Granger Principle has muggle Harry and Ron involved a lot (but still has a lot of magic). There have been others but they've all stuck to canon pairings as far as I remember. So, it's a bit like the same crew, different boat if we're using the Theseus' ship metaphor.

Hell, I was even reading a Ginny loses her magic fic and wishing she didn't get it back at the end. Not to be mean to Ginny, but because I liked her dynamic with Harry. There was another fic which did the same thing with Harry... sort of... and I was interested in seeing where that went too.
