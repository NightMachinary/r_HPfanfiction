My feelings are, if the rules of the universe are consistent from the beginning, I can get on board as long as it's well written. For example, if the first chapter of the story establishes that your version of the HP universe delves into arcane/H.P. Lovecraft style magic and demons, while it's not my cup of tea I'll be on board as long as the story is gripping.

However, if you present the rules of the story's universe as similar to cannon, and then suddenly in chapter 20 we find out Harry is actually part Fae, well then I'm out.
