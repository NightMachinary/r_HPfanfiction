Generally, so long as the plot doesn't mean that characters are dropping the idiot ball or forgetting their internal logic patterns more than canon (eg. tying up a man they know can get smaller by turning into a rat whenever he likes) and actually explains its changes (eg. redemption for Snape/Draco to make them grow into no-longer-reprehensible-bitter/arrogant-Magical-Nazis) then I'm fine with whatever.

Basically, if there's an explanation and it's not too full of people buggering up and making overly unthinking mistakes, then I'll likely be okay with something. So long as it's then interesting or fun to read, I'll probably enjoy it.

For instance, one of my favourite fics is basically absolutely not Harry Potter in any way beyond the names of people and the things they shout at one another while waving wands - Wastelands of Time by Joe - and it has basically no resemblance to the original series whatsoever, but it explains the changes quite well throughout its plot (side note - Some people have reviewed that some of the twists and turns aren't easy to keep up with, so anyone reading this that then goes to read Wastelands, be warned in advance). Equally, a fic I can't remember the name of has Harry basically becoming a Pureblood Bigot with no explanation or growth or change whatsoever. It's the clap-on, clap-off of casual racism. If there'd been growth towards racism (eg. Him developing those feelings of hatred towards the Dursleys and then a Bigot playing off of that to bring him into the fold), it could've been something I'd enjoy.
