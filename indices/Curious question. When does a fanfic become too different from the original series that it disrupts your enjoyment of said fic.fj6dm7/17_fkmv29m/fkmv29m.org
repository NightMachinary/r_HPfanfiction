Tbh i don't mind OOC characters with a purpose or AUs, but one thing that really annoys me is when people change years, birthdays and names that are known (like Snape's birthday being in 13 October instead of 9 January). Also when they make Harry too angsty or downright aggressive because i think it's very out of character. Extreme Ron bashing is nasty too because c'mon, he's not THAT bad. Dumbledore being extra manipulative/too nice is a put-off as well.

So i guess i have no problem with AUs but i would prefer the characters to at least resemble their canon selves.. Like i love character growth but you have to keep the essence.
