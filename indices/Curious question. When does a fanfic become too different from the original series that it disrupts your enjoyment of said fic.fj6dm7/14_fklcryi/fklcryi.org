I'm a rarity here, but I prefer to stick pretty closely to canon compliancy. Very occasionally there is an AU fic that will capture my interest for a bit, but I've never really stuck with one and completed it - I just have such a block over "but that didn't happen" or "that would never happen". I do realise that is a very personal preference though and have a great deal of respect for many AU writers who bring so much to the fandom.
