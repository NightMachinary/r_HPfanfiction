For me its the setting. You can change characters, tou can change plot, but if you replace every part of the setting with a whole new one, it just kills it for me. The magic of Harry potter is in it's setting, chamging that to the point of having an entirely new setting? At that point just write your own book. You clearly have the ability. So yeah, not a fan of full on AU's.
