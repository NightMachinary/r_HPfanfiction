I don't mind seeing anything as long as it makes sense within the story.i don't mind multiple lordship fanfics and if they are tied up with a harem. They would have to justify it in it's story like keeping lordship lines going and/or weaking Harry's family down the line.(assuming the family drifts further apart through the generations). Basically a big voting block for what 2 generations?( Harry's gen and kids maybe)

For manipulate X and Y stories the story has to make sense also. Manipulate Dumbledore probably wouldn't have a marriage contract signed between Harry and Ginny. A manipulative Molly may create one behind Dumbledores back. If Ron,Molly and Dumbledore are Manipulating Harry I highly doubt it's for the same reason. Ron for example is usually painted as wanting to use Harry to propel himself over his Family. Molly's manipulation of Harry seems to be either acting as stooge for Dumbledore or wanting harry to marry Ginny.(to get his money) Dumbledore usually is the one in charge. He may set the meeting with the Weasley up. This is done for a variety of reasons ranging giving Harry a place to run to in the summer (Weasley family seen generally light and under Dumbledore control) to Dumbledore trying to actually give Harry some stability. Going over the 3 very basic ideas I came up with none of them where able to go well together. Ron wouldn't want Ginny to marry Harry because he may lose his spot as a go to person. If anything this Ron maybe more pro Hermione and Harry. If Harry has a Lordship(s) (if it's one of those fics) Ron is the guy who you talk to for a meeting with Harry. Ron would want that spot to be something important. Ron would probably want Harry to marry a pureblood tied to British wizarding politics.(Maybe a reason he went after the Patalis during Yule ball) Molly usual main focus on these stories is to either being a overstepping mother(I know what's best for them) to someone wanting to enrich her family. Molly's ideas are the most likely not inline with Dumbledore and this case Ron also. In this 3 way triangle of manipulation Molly has the weakest side.(if something goes down it'll probably be a failed dosing attempt) Dumbledore probably wouldn't have to manipulate Harry directly. There could be Manipulative Hermione but only after the troll incident. Dumbledore could give her a "job" of keeping a eye on Harry and Ron. We know even cannon that she followed Dumbledores order for no contact with Harry in order of the Phoenix. She may feel following orders from Dumbledore the right thing to do.
