It's an interesting question...for me it's all about the tone that is set near the beginning. If I know what I'm in for within the first few chapters and am enjoying it than I am good to go.

The disappointments for me are fics that set a tone and a world and then scope creep sets in. It then just keeps dialing everything up so the characters and plot development in the final chapters are nothing like the beginning. A good example of this for me is Hope by Jeconais. The characterisations are great and the idea of the veela bond and the Harry/Gabrielle relationship is developed wonderfully. However, as the chapters go on Harry's power seems to grow and grow until by the end he is literally the second coming of Merlin. That and the moustache twirling evilness and incompetence of Dumbledore/Snape/Draco take away from the tone set in the first half of the story. I really love the first 75% of the story but it loses me after that.
