The only AUs I was completely unable to stomach were the ones where not only does 'Harry' act like a completely different character, but he also changes his name to some edge-lord style thing and inevitable changes his own looks, until eventually we are left with a complete OC who is no longer called or even looks like Harry and doesn't even go to Hogwarts or do HP style magic. Yeah I'm talking about that shitty fic where he goes to some fuck off wank fest school in Canada and learns all the OC magics possible and really it's not a Harry Potter fanfic at all so why the hell does the author call it one? Really pissed me off when I realised that no, it wasnt Harry Potter at all in any way, and no there wouldn't be an Hogwarts, and no there wouldn't even be any hogwarts style magic.
