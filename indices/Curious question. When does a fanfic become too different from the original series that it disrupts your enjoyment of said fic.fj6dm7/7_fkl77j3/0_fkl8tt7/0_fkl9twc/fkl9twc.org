I don't mind if characters are ooc, as long as there's good backstory explanation, like some of the Harry not in gryff stories show how isolated he was growing up and that changes how he develops, turning him into a completely different person.

Whereas bad examples are like molly suddenly deciding that none of her children should marry muggles! They'll b taint the magic of the family! It's just out of no where with no good reason for it
