So this is really specific, but there was this one fic that focused a lot on Harry learning latin and it was just so cool. It hasn't updated since like 2015 though, of course. Basically fics that focus on very specific aspects of something, I might call them aesthetic fics, that pic one thing eg. latin, and sort of write the entire story around it.

Basically I'll go for anything super specific, it doesn't have to include any of the main characters. Give me the life of a recently graduated Hogwarts student opening a cafe in Diagon. Give me a pureblood wife with a passion for magical history. give me the techie Ravenclaw who spends his years working on trying to recreate technological advancements with magic.

Stories that pick one thing and focus their entire story about it.
