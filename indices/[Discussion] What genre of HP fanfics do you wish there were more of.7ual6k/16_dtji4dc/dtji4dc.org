I want some proper wizard wank where they are not /hiding/ from muggles, but rather the muggle world is actually a small preserve and the world is much bigger than muggles think.

In a similar vein I'd like to see HP as a proper high magic setting with out just ripping something else off. Maybe Apollo finds a wizard city on the moon or something.
