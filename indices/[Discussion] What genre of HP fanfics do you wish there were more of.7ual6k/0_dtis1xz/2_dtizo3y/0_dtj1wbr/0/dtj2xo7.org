Yeah, I refuse to use Pottermore, never liked it, probably never will. I agree with you, though, that the Harry, Hermione and Ron you read about in the books wouldn't have gotten to the top of the Ministry the way they did according to JKR. You need some very cunning plot and a nose for opportunities for that.
