Is it online already?

I think they should have mostly weeded out those miscreants within 2 years after the Battle. Harry became the youngest Head Auror at age 27 (2007), so that would indicate an extremely successful career up to that point.

I would expand [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-final-live-report][Rita Skeeter attacking the DA at Quidditch World Cup]] into a full blown conspiracy, which resulted in a second wave of purges:

- Why did Rita Skeeter suddenly find the courage to attack them? She was obviously bribed by some still influential members of the 'Old Families' and hostile foreign interests. Their goal was to exploit Ginny Potter's volatile temper and provoke her into attacking Rita Skeeter publicly. They thought they could discredit the Potters and weaken their positions.
- But they miscalculated. They first underestimated Ginny's popularity: resistance leader, war hero, star athlete, popular reporter, and sex symbol, whose popularity far outshone that of Rita Skeeter, who was really only popular with the old crowd such as Muriel Prewett.
- Next, they never anticipated the ruthless counterattacks by the Ministry and the DA alumni. Instead of staying on the defensive, the Kingsley administration brought out their own supporters en masse to denounce that 'slanderous Rita'. It dug out Rita's old dirt in promoting Voldemort propaganda; it brought forth Rita's past victims to go after her publicly; it riled up past Voldemort victims to recall horrors of 'The Year of Darkness'.
- Prompted by an agitated populace, DMLE, under Hermione and Harry, arrested Rita Skeeter and chief editor of the Daily Prophet Barnabus Cuffe, and began investigations into potential collusions between Daily Prophet and Voldemort. Veritaserum interrogations yielded that Cuffe was a closet Blood Purist who extensively supported Voldemort's agenda. He was charged and convicted of high treason and sentenced to life in Azkaban. Rita Skeeter admitted under interrogation that she was bribed and supported by certain subversive forces.
- What followed next could be called the 2nd Great Purge, in which dozens more Voldemort sympathizers were arrested, convicted, heavily fined, and sentenced to long prison terms. Lee Jordan took over as the chief editor of the Daily Prophet.

Finally, I want to point out that Harry and Co never paid much attention to laws and rules when they interfered with their goals/objectives. Hermione especially, only used laws to reign in others while routinely pissing on them herself.

If they were to make it to the top of that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic (according to JKR), they would no longer be your adorable innocent children or naive teenagers, but battle hardened warriors and brilliant politicians.
