Shameless self promotion, but the new fic I'm writing is in part about Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley (and Ron) 13 years after the war ended, and a theme is that they've worked together to purge the old guard out and remove the blood-purity and cruel traditions from the institution. I think I read a thread here a while back where people talked about Kingsley and Harry working together to be this new progressive political force, and I was intrigued. It's an interesting and not too unrealistic concept.
