This is my take on postwar:

After the Battle, the Ministry's own force was basically decimated. Voldemort pretty much drafted everyone from the Ministry for the final battle, even including then Minister Thickness. In the 2nd part of the Battle, Voldemort bought Narcissa's lie, became overconfident, and led his entire army into a death trap. Caught in a pincer movement by the original defenders, Slughorn's reinforcement, Centaurs, House-Elves, and Thestrals, everyone Death Eater, Snatcher, Ministry minion, and Giant was either killed or captured.

The Ministry's own reputation was also in tatters, after falling to two coups/revolutions within 10 months. It would become a laughing stock, a joke in any country/society. It NEEDED someone like Harry Potter to lend its credibility and rebuild its military, because after the Battle, the DA and the Order were magical Britain's ONLY credible and organized armed forces, and they ANSWERED to Harry. So, a major conclusion here is that the center of power in immediate aftermath of the Battle had shifted to them.

Apart from Kingsley and McGonagall, the Order by this time was pretty much the Weasleys. There was also the DA to consider, in which Neville and Ginny held very significant influence.

I don't think there would be mercy for the Death Eaters after the Battle. McGonagall had no problem with Harry crucioing Amycus Carrow, and she was willing to kill Slughorn even before the Battle.

Weasleys were a hot tempered and bloodthirsty bunch to begin with, and would be downright pissed after losing Fred and learning what had happened to Ginny at Hogwarts.

That left Kingsley, whom we knew actually little other than he was a capable fighter and administrator. Many fics had him giving Voldemort's Ministry collaborators a free pass, but I honestly doubted this considering how much he was promoting the DA.

I expect the DA to be the most bloodthirsty and vindictive group after being tortured all year and then losing so many friends. Kingsley inviting this group to take over Magical Britain's security forces led me to believe that Kingsley himself was also taking a hardline approach. However, offering leniency to the Malfoys showed they were still sensible enough to take a divide and conquer strategy against Voldemort remnants.

Harry should be truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, would organize themselves and demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers.

They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant amount of baddies remained out there, and their own hold on power was tenuous at best. They knew they COULDN'T AFFORD to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

That's why I think their decision to send Harry and Ron into auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional demands. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls widen their influences at Hogwarts.

After so much trauma and suffering, it should be very clear that their generation would adopt a mindset of "NEVER AGAIN"! Given Ministry's abysmal record in protecting them, they were NOT going to give its corrupt and cowardly bureaucrats any more free reigns. This generation would be taking things into THEIR OWN HANDS.
