Unapologetic muggle wank where someone goes full spark and uses sufficiently analyzed magic to create bonkers things like mecha, lazor cannonz, FTL, teleporters, space ships, and SPACE MARINES to not only curb stomp Voldemort but grind the magical world into the dust then scrape the remnants together and go on to conquer the stars.

And also some where Michael Carpenter or Uther the Lightbringer show up and teach Harry to be a paladin and use the righteous might of God/The Holy Light to smite the evildoers. And make sure Harry has either one of the Swords of the Cross, the Ashbringer, or a really sweet hammer.
