Longer war fics, AU after OotP, where the war doesn't end until Harry's at least 20, where Dumbledore either doesn't hoard all the info or doesn't have enough control to, and the whole war doesn't revolve around a fragile thread of Dumbledore-manipulations.

I've seen fics where this is assumed to be a backstory, but not where the potential of OotP is developed into a broader plot--at least, not completed fics. While books 6 and 7 are interesting, I felt they narrowed the scope too much, and that branching out from there gives authors more scope. Though the author of Divided and Entwined is great, I'd like other ambitious authors' takes too.
