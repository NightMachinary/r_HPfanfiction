I also want to see better written stories exploring this theme.

But it is to easy to make it uninteresting, because immortality removes many ways to create a decent flow in stories involving action or suspense.

It makes all interactions that can lead to Physical conflict lesser and makes it much more important to create better dialogue, since you can't 'kill' an immortal.

You have to solve *all* conflicts with this character through dialogue or ways that are not explained as simply "A Wizard did it using never before seen magic that seals the entity it hits in a different dimension".
