Master of Death Harry.

This concept is criminally underutilised. It's a fascinating subject to explore and I'm frankly baffled that not many writers do so.

It can be anything you want, whether from simple immortality all the way to Harry becoming the literal Grim Reaper.

In my headcanon being MoD means you are immortal but not in the sense that your physical body cannot die, like Voldemort wanted but that your soul is immortal and will never move on.

Instead the soul gets reborn into a new host every time the previous host dies, retains its memories as well as the ability to call on the Hallows when needed.

A fantastic gateway for all sorts of crossover shenanigans.
