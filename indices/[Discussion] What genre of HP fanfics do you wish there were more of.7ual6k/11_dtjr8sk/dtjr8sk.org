Adventures in the magical world fics.

A type of fic where Harry doesnt aspire to be an auror after Hogwarts, but to go on full blown D&D magical adventures.

I want to see some fics where combat is a strong focus, where finding magically hidden lands and battling powerful creatures to save villages are the norm. I want high fantasy hidden from the modern muggle world (until it eventually comes smashing together).

I would also love more general !badass Harry action movie/ anime style fics.

I cant get enough martial artist Harry fics. Give me even more fics where lost and hidden battlemagics and combat techniques are discovered and scenes are filled with high octane world shaking spells and devestating physical strikes.

I like fanfiction, including the stuff that goes really far off the rails from canon. I love crossovers because they usually feature much more direct non spell slinging combat. Pretty much i live off of high octane magic. I know it used to be more popular and you used to find more decently written examples. I kind of want a revival of that time. I dont find much interesting in politcal or world building fics, i just want action, action, Harry/Luna love, and more action.
