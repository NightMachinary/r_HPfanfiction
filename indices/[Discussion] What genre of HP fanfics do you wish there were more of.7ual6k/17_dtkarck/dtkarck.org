I guess the genre would be.. Old Man Potter fics? Or maybe, Dumbledore!Harry?

I want a fic where it at least starts from the next generation or so's perspective. Maybe someone like Teddy, but probably his son. Or maybe even Teddy's grandson.

There's a new Dark Lord rising. S/He seems to be Voldemort's match and more. Things are looking grim.

In comes the Old Guard. Led by a Dumbledore2.0-esque Harry and his "lieutenants", the remaining DA members. They may be in semi-retirement, but the old wizards and witches are the most dangerous.

They come come down on the terrorists like the wrath of God.

Then we get to see the new generation's reaction. Like, they heard stories about how Grandpa, Auntie Angelina and Great Uncle Nev were hardcore when they were younger, but /damn/.
