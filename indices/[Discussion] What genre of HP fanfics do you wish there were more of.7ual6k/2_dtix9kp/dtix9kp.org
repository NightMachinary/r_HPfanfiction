I suppose I like political stories, but really, I think, what I like is seeing something broken down into its parts and made more efficient.

Stories that involve Harry Potter becoming headmaster, for instance, and increasing the productivity and atmosphere in the school. Or stories where the government is cleaned up of corruption and wasteful spending.

I think this is why I so much enjoy stories that involve someone going back in time. Typically (or, rather, ideally) they handle things much more efficiently, since they have an idea of how things are going to happen.
