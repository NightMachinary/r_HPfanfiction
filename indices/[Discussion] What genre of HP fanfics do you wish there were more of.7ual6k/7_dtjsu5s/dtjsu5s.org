I honestly feel like there aren't enough mystery fics (original or left unresolved in Canon). It's especially weird since the series is all about mysteries. And on a side note, I haven't really seen many Ron time travel fics which I would be interested in reading.

Another area I feel is lacking are fics with competent adults who take threats dangers very seriously and do investigations and. The best fic I've seen handle that is Petrification Proliferation. The last area I feel is lacking are students of different religions at Hogwarts.

Almost every fic I've seen dealing with religion became some mouthpiece for the author to promote it. Is it so much to ask for a good take on Muslim/ Jewish/ Hindu students in the magic world and see what their life is like?
