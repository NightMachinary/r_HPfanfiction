Slice of Life Harmony. Give me the snapshots how a Harry/Hermione relationship would look like ten years down the road. I have read more than enough proclamations of undying love from 15-year-old teens, give me a fic that shows how they spent a day out with the kids or how Harry is actually a stay at home dad (I remember an awesome one-shot with that premise).

Or even just a random date of an established relationship. Just something wholesome without a metric ton of angst.
