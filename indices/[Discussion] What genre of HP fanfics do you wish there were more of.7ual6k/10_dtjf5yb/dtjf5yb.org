Stories where people DON'T take Harry seriously when he's 11 and let him change the flawed wizard society through the power of common sense XD

But serious, I'd love to see a story where Harry (or even better, Hermione) fails to change things that are obviously wrong in the Wizarding World because nobody takes them seriously/the people in power are competent and want to remain in power
