When browsing through the comments I couldn't find any such reviews though. Maybe they came later on? Or maybe it was just a writer's block? At the end of the day it doesn't matter since it's the author's right to remove their own story. There should be no shame in not wanting to continue a story or having a prolonged writer's block. I mean, does anyone even take the "lost my hard drive" excuse seriously?

It was a good story though, despite its grammatical flaws.
