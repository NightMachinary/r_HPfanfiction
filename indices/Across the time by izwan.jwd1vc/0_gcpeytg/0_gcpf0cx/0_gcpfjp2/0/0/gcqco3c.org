No idea, then. That's what they cited in the last AN update though. Maybe they were curating reviews and just deleted the dickish ones. You're right though, it doesn't really matter either way - author's prerogative to do whatever they wish with their story. :)

And I do take it seriously, personally - I've had those kind of apocalyptically bad technical issues before. Though the worst of the last big one of those I had was losing my uni essays. I don't think I've ever had to rewrite so fast in my life. :)
