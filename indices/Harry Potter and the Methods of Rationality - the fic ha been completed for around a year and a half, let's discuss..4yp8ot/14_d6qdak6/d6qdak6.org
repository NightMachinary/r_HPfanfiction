:END:

It became terrible towards the ending. Harmoiny was turned into a mere plot device nothing more than a trophy a way to motivate Harry. The ending was bullshit as Tom fell into the classic mistake of monologing and gloading. And the fact the harmoiny did not die was bullshit and felt like a hamfisted effort to undo the damage he had done to the character, but the way it was portraid felt childish and forced.
