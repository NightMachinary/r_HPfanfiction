I read the entire work, and honestly, i found it boring, uninteresting and a BOTHER to read. I am an extremely intelligent person, and several of the things that Harry mentions I had to look up for context. While fine for some, I hated it. I agree about how Harry must have a foil. However MOR didnt provide that. Sure Voldemort is intelligent, moreso than in canon, but the author doesnt give me that feeling of "Harry might actually lose this." It just isnt there. That is my biggest measuring stick for genius/prodigy/super/OP stories, be it Naruto Harry Potter ect.
