Perhaps in the sense that he did exactly what he said he would do:

“So you're saying I need to make my traps less obvious? ... I can work on that.” (ch. 20)

--------------

/“... we sset up imposstor to imperssonate Dark Lord. ...You are kidnapped from Hogwartss ... Dark Lord announcess that he hass at long lasst regained physical form, after wandering as sspirit for yearss ...Casstss Killing Cursse at you, you block, watcherss ssee Dark Lord explode---”/

/Could write different sscript for play, if you wissh.”/ (ch. 65)

--------------

/“Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate imprissonment. You will losse patience long before sseventh year, perhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall plan accordingly."/ (ch. 66)

Foreshadowing? Red herring? I don't know! :)
