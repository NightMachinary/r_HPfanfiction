As a rule of thumb, I don't think anyone should ever declare "I am an extremely intelligent person," without some modicum of evidence behind that. I'm not saying you're not, but it definitely will color people's perceptions of you. And it's a claim that can't really be verified, so it's useless in discussing.

I think the biggest thing that helped suspend my disbelief was knowing that Voldemort was there the entire time, befriending Harry. Despite how smart Harry thinks he is, his mentor and confidant throughout the book is his villain. This is something that other people, including Hermione, notice and Harry outright ignores. The vastness of Harry's stupidity and arrogance when it comes to Quirrellmort suspended my disbelief that the book may end with Voldemort winning in some sense.
