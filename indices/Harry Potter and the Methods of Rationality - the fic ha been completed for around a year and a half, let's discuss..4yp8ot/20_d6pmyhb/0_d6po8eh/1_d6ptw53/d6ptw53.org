I don't Need evidence to point out that the references made during HPMOR are not possible to understand without background info. I admit, I should have given evidence of percieved intelligence, however I have a feeling that doing so would have cause someone to comment with "that does not make the story bad". Which it does not; however it does make it unenjoyable to me. In fanfiction I should not have to google what is being sprouted every other chapter. Especially as a student, who uses fanfiction to escape his mundane life.

I personally feel that the disbelief wasn't possible. That is just me however.
