There was a question over on another fanfic sub (wormfanfic, for those of you who are wondering), which led to me explaining why I'm not particularly fond of HPMOR:

From an objective standpoint, it's well-written for a fanfic. However, in many ways it comes off as rather disrespectful to the series. For easy readability, I'll put this in bulletpoints too.

- Many of the themes of Harry Potter has been thrown out the window, and instead replaced with the author's personal viewpoints.

- The author has said that he based Harry's knowledge (and thus, to a certain extent, his personality) off of himself as an 18-year old. This means that his Harry /doesn't feel like Harry at all/. Of the fanfic fandoms I read, Worm is the only one where SIs are "accepted", and while Harry is often interpreted in many, /many/ different ways in HP fics, LessWrong doesn't even seem to bother trying to emulate Harry, instead, as said before, just shaping "Harry" in his own image. I've seen the term TINO (Taylor in name only) mentioned with regard to Worm fics, and HPMOR is certainly a case of Harry in name only.

- The author uses some tricks, if that's the right word, to make it seem as if his viewpoints are the "correct" ones. I'll reference something that happens somewhat around midway in the story here, so if you plan on reading it, you might want to skip this. [[#s][spoiler]]

- Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. That's Harry's full name in the fic. It's a knee-jerk reaction, sure, but the HP fanfic fandom has... issues with Harry's name being made overly fancy. Part of this is that a great, great amount of Harry Potter fics are utterly terrible, and one of the stock "badfics" is that Harry finds out that he's the heir to numerous families, typically those of the founders, as well as a few ones the author thought would be neat. Oh, and let's make him Merlin's descendant too, while we're at it! Due to this, most of the well-read, if that word can be applied to fanfics, readers will be very, very leery of Harry having a hyphenated last name.

- HPMOR treats magic as some enigma that can be solved through scientific methods. Trying to delve deeper into magic is something I love seeing done well. Black Pawn (currently found over on SB), and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (found at darklordpotter) are shining examples of this, in my opinion. Magic is treated with respect, with the characters spending much of their time researching or experimenting with magic, trying to gain a deeper understanding of the mysteries of magic. HPMOR, while it has some interesting thoughts, does not do this well. LessWrong brings in scientific principles, and makes the utilization of them lead to discoveries of magic.

- HJPEV is often made seem smart by making other characters appear dumb. An example is Harry meeting Hermione in the train. It's in chapter 8, and since it's their first interaction, I don't feel the need to put it in a spoiler, so go ahead and skip the rest of this paragraph. "... With your encyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, ..." This implies that Hermione is less intelligent than HJPEV. What happens after that is that Hermione does what HJPEV himself calls a textbook scientific analysis, but fails to test for negatives. Keep in mind, this Hermione isn't canon Hermione, but rather one that's been made smarter as well. I have seen a Harry that's smarter than Hermione pulled off well, but it's very, very hard to do properly, as it will often just look like an intellectual version of the Word Effect.

- The characters are all wildly OOC. I don't think that there's a single authentic 11-year old in the story, and the adults should not take the main cast remotely as seriously as they do. As I remarked in my original post, the first HP books were written for children, which meant that the staff stepping in and solving the problems would hardly have sold much. However, for a writer who prides himself on "rationality", such a thing should not have happened. Age the main cast up to 16, or better yet, 18, instead of having 11- and 12-year old children behaving way older than they are, and being taken seriously by the staff.

There are other things as well. I'm sure that many [[/r/HPfanfiction/]] would love the opportunity to rant about it (with myself falling into that category), so if you'd like more, a quick post over there would likely get you even more.
