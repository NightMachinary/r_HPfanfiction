It'll be easier to keep track of things if I address your bulletpoints, so here we go. Keep in mind that I wasn't the most diligent reader of MoR, I was hate-reading the last third, like watching a trainwreck, hoping that everyone on board would die. Some things may have gone over my head.

CHARACTERIZATION

One can say that there was a lot of characterization because of the sheer size of MoR, but I prefer quality over quantity. The only character I can think of who has an arc is Draco.

Harry starts out an extremely arrogant, unlikeable prick and though he stumbles, he ends up in the same place at the end, having gone in a circle. He's still arrogant, thinks he knows what's best better than everyone else and is still planning to realize his plans for widely available immortality, which is a terrible idea for reasons which his ultra-logical mind ignores or doesn't seem to perceive. He just decides that nobody ever dying anymore is automatially the correct course of action logically, morally and in good in every other way.

Hermione becomes Harry's partner, but I don't see a change. Whereas Harry is supposed to be a kind of "if the villain was a good guy" character, Hermione is the epitome of goodness and purity and those traits are amplified by the end, which can be said to be a character arc if you really want to, but I don't.

Other characters are consistent in the way that they don't change, no matter what happens. They stay static. For me personally, the only character who was sort of interesting was Quirrellmort, but this was still bogged down by MoR's general long-widedness, which drowned everything else.

The character voices kind of blend in the moments when the rationality kicks in, because then everyone turns into a rational drone spouting lectures at the reader and that's most of the fic, so...

EFFORT

Yeah, okay, I agree on that. It's a lot of misdirected effort though.

SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

We're gonna have to agree to vehemently disagree here. This is something I simply don't want in a fic. Don't confuse this for me saying that I'm against all forms of magical research - I'm against applying real-world "muggle" science to magic. Magic can absolutely have its own rules. I'm all for Transfiguration Principles, but when you add rules of thermodynamics to the mix, I nope out.

POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

And what does it matter if, in the end, Voldemort still does the stupid thing and hands Harry back his wand instead of just killing him on the spot? Voldemort, the super-rational, super-logical, forward-planning supervillain let Harry hold his wand while he was making a decision instead of forcing Harry to make a decision while naked and unarmed. Essentially, MoR's Voldemort became so smart that he outsmarted the author and the result is that the author was left behind and included this particular flaw in Voldemort's otherwise foolproof plan.

LACK OF ROMANCE

As if that's an accomplishment in a first-year fic. They're freaking eleven.

RATIONALITY

You don't need the above for the story to be "written to be explicitly not stupid." It's one of the problems with the fic. It adopts the stance that rationality is the only correct worldview and anything else is stupid, or at least More Wrongâ„¢.

WRITING

We have different opinions of what constitutes good technical writing. For me, it's not just a lack of mistakes. I disagree that MoR flows well. The rationality lectures leave the pacing an equivalent to a botched abortion, there's rampant wall'o'texting and more than once, by the time I got to the end of whatever tangent the author went off on, I had forgotten what had happened immediately before it.

PRESENCE OF ALL CANON ELEMENTS

This can be said about any fic written after DH was published, so MoR doesn't stand out here. You are right that JK made some things up as she went along and not all of them were good ideas, but isn't that kind of what writers do?

ORIGINALITY

Not untrue, but the presence of those elements drowns in the infinite muddy bog of rationality lectures. And personally, I wasn't a fan of some changes, like dementors being avatars of death instead of depression and fear.

SOAP-BOXING

Nothing to add here, the very term "soap-boxing" says it all.

BEGINNING SUCKS

I'd say that the first few chapters are the best the story has to offer. It's like funny crack and then you realize you're being lectured and it's only downhill from there.

THE WAY PROTAG IS WRITTEN SUCKS

Yeah, I agree.

PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

Harry is the author's version of Garry Stu in the sense that his rationality is better than everyone else's and intellectual giants like Dumbledore and Voldemort are ultimately dumber than Harry, "proving" that wizards are dumb and muggle science and rationality is the bestest.

CANON DECONSTRUCTION

Deconstruct canon all you want, but the author of MoR was an incredibly arrogant pillock about this. To quote Taure, he doesn't just say "dementors are avatars of death and not fear/depression", he says "dementors MUST be avatars of death, the idea that they're avatars of fear/depression is obviously dumb". The author wipes his ass with canon in a way that leaves a bad taste.

PACING

Saying that MoR has some pacing issues is like saying that Titanic was a slight hiccup. Pacing-wise, MoR is an absolute disaster, which ties into the core problem with it. It wants to be a story and a rationality textbook at the same time, which the author isn't a good enough writer to pull off and as such it fails at both.

I said this before and I'll say it again: MoR is the only fic in the fandom I genuinely hate (also because of the author, who's proved to be a complete prick) and wish it didn't exist. I think it's had a net negative effect on the fandom.
