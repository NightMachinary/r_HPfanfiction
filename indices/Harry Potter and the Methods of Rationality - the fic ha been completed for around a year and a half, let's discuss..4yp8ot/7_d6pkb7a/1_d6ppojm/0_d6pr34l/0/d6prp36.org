CHARACTERIZATION

Harry actually does acknowledge all of those points. Harry's logic is that defeating death is the greatest enemy, and if death can be defeated, other issues can be defeated as well. Harry surmises that the greatest existential threat is the heat death of the universe, something that he has no idea how to deal with. All other threats he believe can be solved in time with magic. I think this is perfectly reasonably, especially as the process of turning the population immortal is slow, and is only acting on a specific demographic of a few million people (Harry isn't giving muggles immortality from the get go, for much the same reasons you pointed out.) Just as a point of order, these issues are certainly addressed in the fic. If Harry can prevent the death of life, then what is the risk of overpopulation or any other issue you bring up? The entire threat of overpopulation is scarcity of resources, leading to death by famine... which Harry can stop by giving people immortality. Death is the root issue, and now that he has solved that, other less vital issues can be addressed. I fail to see the problem here.

SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

Perhaps we should agree to disagree. Literally the only major departures from canon are 1.) Voldemort is a genius and 2.) Dumbledore has read ever prophecy. Any other change in the story arises from those two events. There are no changes to Rowling's logic or the way that magic operates. The author rationalizes some new forms of magic that arise from deep questioning of Rowling's logic, but in my opinion, this is fair game. And considering that he could have easily just done away with her magic system entirely since he intended to write such a long fiction, I believe that this demonstrates some respect for Rowling's work.

POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

The basilisk is an actor that Voldemort has no reason to distrust, very much unlike Harry. And you are wrong on that Azkaban - Harry does the magic, and summarizes a quick explanation (leaving out details) to Voldemort. Voldemort is weak at this point, recovering from being knocked unconscious by Harry.

RATIONALITY

I completely agree that a story doesn't need to be about teaching or learning anything to not be stupid. As other users have pointed out, this story does serve as a great primer for rationality and this story was certainly written to introduce more people to rationality, but that isn't a requirement for a non-stupid story. I enjoy this story because it isn't stupid. And it is also a primer on rationality. I also think that believable characters should follow a form of logic that one can follow, even if it's not as explicit as in this story. I don't like when I read stories where plot happens because characters ignore obvious ideas. Your audience should not be able to think "why didn't they just do this, because it's easier?" To stress: you do not need to be a story about rationality to be a smart story. This story is a smart story about rationality, however.

ORIGINALITY

I disagree, simply said. I think the argument between Harry and Dumbledore is fairly civil, even if Harry is arrogant which is consistent with his character.

PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

Agree to disagree. There are many rational voices in this story that could be said to be a mouthpiece of the author. That you choose to latch onto the most arrogant is your decision, but I don't think it's at all reflective of the truth.

I think you should also take note that Harry is not always right, not even half the time. He's wrong FREQUENTLY.
