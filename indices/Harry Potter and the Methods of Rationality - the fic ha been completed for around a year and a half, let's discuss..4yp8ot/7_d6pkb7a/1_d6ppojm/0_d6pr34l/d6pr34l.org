RE: CHARACTERIZATION

Your points on Draco, McGonagall and Hermione make sense to me, because I don't remember the fic all that well (because the overblown wordcount and lecturing greatly diminish its remembrance value) and it seems like you have a better recollection of those things than I do.

#+begin_quote
  You mention that Harry passing out immortality is a terrible idea. Why, exactly? I totally buy into Harry's philosophy at the end. If we can agree that death is bad, then it is morally good if death can be avoided for all people. If it is easy to grant immortality to people, then why not?
#+end_quote

Because if you're operating on pure logic, you must eventually confront the question of logistics. If no dies, what about the human population? What about the planet? If you want to use magic to colonize other planets, how do you do it, potentially on a massive scale? How do you stop overpopulation? Simply "freeze" humanity in current state, by making everyone immortal and sterilizing them? Or do you just forbid procreation? There are entire industries that depend on people dying, getting older and sick, new people being born. Immortality fundamentally changes humankind, in ways that Harry never once acknowledges. This could be attributed to him being eleven years old, but everywhere else Harry is the author's mouthpiece for rationality, so why not here?

RE: SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

#+begin_quote
  I view Rowling and HPMOR to be two sides of the same coin - Rowling's canon is a canon in which the reader never becomes aware of any of the magical mechanisms going on, while HPMOR is an exploration into what mechanisms must be going on in Rowling's canon.
#+end_quote

If you're a reasonably intelligent person, you can surmise some of the rules of magic from HP canon, even if they're not stated explicitly. Some /are/ stated explicitly. What MoR does isn't "getting to the bottom" of canon magic, it's inventing rules that the author believes must be "at the bottom" and dismissing or changing canon to fit his interpretation. Now, I have no problems with changing canon, it's a part of what fanfiction is about, but no other fic does it in the way MoR does it, i.e. with a level of pretentiousness that cannon be expressed within the confines of all the human languages combined.

RE: POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

#+begin_quote
  First off, I don't think this is case of Eliezer writing himself in a hole and making Voldemort stupid intentionally to make Harry win.
#+end_quote

I absolutely do think so.

#+begin_quote
  The rationalization behind Harry having his wand is that Voldemort asked Harry to show him secrets of magic, *which Harry must have a wand to do.*
#+end_quote

No, he doesn't. The basilisk didn't a wand to reveal the lost secrets of magic to Voldemort. And correct me if I'm wrong, but during the escape from Azkaban, didn't Harry explain to Voldemort one of his epiphanies about Transfiguration, which allowed Voldemort to make the rocket broom? If my recollection is correct, then Voldemort could have just ordered Harry to explain to him the secrets of magic that Harry had discovered, no wand needed.

RE: LACK OF ROMANCE

Okay, that is a fair point. You're right on this one.

RE: RATIONALITY

#+begin_quote
  I did not say you needed rationality for the story to not be written stupidly. To that point, though, what other worldview adopts evidence-based questioning and utilizing scientific methodology to get to the "right answer?"
#+end_quote

I wasn't clear enough with what I meant by "story not written stupidly". A story doesn't need to be a lecture, or a textbook, it doesn't need to be attempting to teach the reader anything at all to not be a stupidly written story. There are textbooks for that. What I meant by not stupidly written more or less translates to a well-written story. A. /STORY./ Not a 600k word lecture on rationality. A story doesn't need to promote any kind of worldview. What You Leave Behind is what I consider to be a not stupidly written story. I like to think my own fic is not a stupidly written story. So, it doesn't matter if there's any other worldview that looks for the "right answer", because this is simply not a factor for me when looking for a not stupidly written story. Including or not including a promotion of a certain worldview isn't what I pay attention to when looking for good fics. I look at characters, plot, conflict and if they're good or not. You know, stuff that fiction is made of.

RE: PRESENCE OF CANON ELEMENTS

As with the romance thing, you have a point.

RE: ORIGINALITY

#+begin_quote
  Dementors being an avatar of death instead of depression or fear is well-enough explained that I like it. The change is that Dementors are indirectly avatars of depression or fear because they are directly avatars of death, which all people who don't believe in souls (should) fear.
#+end_quote

It's not that it's not explained, it's about the manner in which it was explained, which involved shitting all over canon in the most obnoxious way possible.

RE: PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

#+begin_quote
  Also, the author doesn't say that dementors MUST be avatars of death - Harry does. The author writes arguments between Dumbledore and Harry, with Harry's arrogance coming out strongly. But this is not Eliezer speaking, as he has said in his author's notes since.
#+end_quote

I don't know where I could find a more transparent example of the protagonist being the author's mouthpiece/self-insert and therefore the reliable narrator who's always right. It absolutely is the author speaking. His refutation does not erase how obvious it is in the 600k words he wrote.
