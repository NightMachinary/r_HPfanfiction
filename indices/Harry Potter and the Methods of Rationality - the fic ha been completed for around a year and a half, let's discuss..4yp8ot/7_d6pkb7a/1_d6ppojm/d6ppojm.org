I'll respond in kind to the bullet points you've posted. Thank you for taking the time to write such a lengthy and well-thought out rebuttal to everything that I posted. Posts like yours are exactly what I desired when I made this thread - challenge my beliefs, and allow me a forum to defend them otherwise. First off, a note: I believe you hate HPMOR with a greater intensity than I like it, so I don't have any intention of changing your mind. Hopefully, through this discussion we both gain some food for thought, though.

CHARACTERIZATION

Draco and McGonagall both experience the most dramatic character shift throughout the book. Draco you've already mentioned, so I won't bother to expound. It's hard to say that McGonagall is the same, static character as she was at the beginning. McGonagall changes throughout the story, from an old teacher embedded in her role as a teacher, into a more open-minded person. The entire "Roles" arc seemed to be somewhat directed at her character specifically, breaking her roles when it conflicted with her values.

Harry starts out extremely arrogant, outright dismissing characters such as Ron because of their stupidity and claiming superiority over all magical things. Over time, he becomes a much warmer person to those around him and by the end of the fic is much more aware of his own stupidity. He had a few monologues toward the end conveying this very thing. It is his stupidity that gets Hermione killed. It is his stupidity that loses Dumbledore to time. Neither of these things are lost on Harry. Voldemort was only such a threat at the end simply because of how arrogant Harry was and how much he was willing to bias his mind against Voldemort.

You mention that Harry passing out immortality is a terrible idea. Why, exactly? I totally buy into Harry's philosophy at the end. If we can agree that death is bad, then it is morally good if death can be avoided for all people. If it is easy to grant immortality to people, then why not?

Hermione's character changes from a willing participant and sidekick to Harry's actions to a more self-focused, mindful person. She does not want to simply be a part of Harry's story and over time realizes that she wants to be her own person. It's not about her going from "good" to "really good."

Other characters are worth mentioning, but I'll save that for a future reply so that we can focus on what I've already brought up.

SCIENTIFIC MAGIC

I found the exploration of science and magic to be less about interweaving Muggle magical principles like the Laws of Thermodynamics and Transfiguration Principles and more about applying the scientific method to magic. Observing, questioning, testing, updating beliefs. Harry asks "why?" and "how?" to most magical things and tries to come to some conclusion. I agree we may just see totally differently on this, though, but I believe that all forms of magic in fiction should have some underlying logic to them. The reader may not be aware of the logic, but the author should have some idea of what's going on. Look at the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf operates in highly mysterious ways, governed by a set of rules the reader never becomes aware of. The rules do exist, though, as Tolkien has demonstrated in his later letters. I view Rowling and HPMOR to be two sides of the same coin - Rowling's canon is a canon in which the reader never becomes aware of any of the magical mechanisms going on, while HPMOR is an exploration into what mechanisms must be going on in Rowling's canon. I phrased this in a different post in a similar way, but in this way, HPMOR is a love letter to Rowling's canon. It embraces the magic wholeheartedly and merely asks "why?" until it gets to the bottom of it.

POWERED HERO/VILLAIN

Well, this is something we may end up disagreeing on as well, though I understand where you're coming from. First off, I don't think this is case of Eliezer writing himself in a hole and making Voldemort stupid intentionally to make Harry win. The author has stated that this scene was planned from the beginning, which I wholeheartedly believe given that it is foreshadowed in the very first chapter. The rationalization behind Harry having his wand is that Voldemort asked Harry to show him secrets of magic, which Harry must have a wand to do. Voldemort has Harry completely surrounded at thirty-some odd wandpoints. Voldemort is arrogant, and believes he knows most of all there is to know of magic. This is why Harry is only able to defeat him with magic that Voldemort is completely unaware of. The story could have easily had Harry request his wand to show some magic, and then do the partial transfiguration... the outcome is the same.

LACK OF ROMANCE

My bullet-point list is written in the context of other Harry Potter fictions. It is not at all out of question for fanfiction to show romantic interactions between eleven year olds. This may be a minor point of praise, but it's worth mentioning.

RATIONALITY

I did not say you needed rationality for the story to not be written stupidly. To that point, though, what other worldview adopts evidence-based questioning and utilizing scientific methodology to get to the "right answer?" It's worth mentioning that this "worldview," as you describe it, is what is used by any scientist ever attempting to learn something about the world.

WRITING

Not much I can refute here, this seems to be mostly a taste difference.

PRESENCE OF CANON ELEMENTS

Okay, this can be said of any fic written after DH, but that doesn't mean it can't be said for HPMOR. I'm merely stating what I liked about this fic. I also don't think Rowling is in the wrong for making things up as she goes along, as I say in my OP.

ORIGINALITY

Dementors being an avatar of death instead of depression or fear is well-enough explained that I like it. The change is that Dementors are indirectly avatars of depression or fear because they are directly avatars of death, which all people who don't believe in souls (should) fear.

PROTAG IS ALWAYS RIGHT

This is the biggest point of contention between us, and I think this is where your hate-reading shows the most (no offense meant). Harry is explicitly NOT smarter than Voldemort or Dumbledore. The entire story is a story of how Voldemort is constantly beating Harry effortlessly because Harry is so blind to him. Harry is wrong in every instance when it comes to Dumbledore, ultimately resulting in Dumbledore's 'death.' The end of the story makes a point to prove that Dumbledore, though seemingly acting irrationally, was the "bestest" at getting it right.

Also, the author doesn't say that dementors MUST be avatars of death - Harry does. The author writes arguments between Dumbledore and Harry, with Harry's arrogance coming out strongly. But this is not Eliezer speaking, as he has said in his author's notes since.
