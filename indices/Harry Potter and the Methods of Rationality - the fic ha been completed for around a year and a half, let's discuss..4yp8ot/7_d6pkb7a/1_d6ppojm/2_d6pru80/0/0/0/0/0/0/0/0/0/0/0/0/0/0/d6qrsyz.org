epistemic rationality is certainly devoid of emotion.

Instrumental rationality is not.

Did you miss where I described two definitions of rationality and their differences?

Edit: Let me clarify further. A scientist does not investigate based on emotion. I do not think with my feelings when I'm observing a biological process. However, a rational person DOES think with their emotions somewhat when evaluating what job opportunity to pursue.
