I focused on maths specifically in regard to your statement "logic without emotion is illogical." You didn't say "rationality without emotion is illogical." If you had, I would have agreed with you.

You say that rationality is applying logic to life, and I'm going to go ahead and assume you mean "without emotion." Correct me if I'm wrong. That's not what rationality is, really. That's part of it, but rationality certainly includes emotions. There are two definitions of rationality that the HPMOR story operates on: instrumental and epistemic rationality. Epistemic rationality means updating your beliefs based on evidence, to believe the most true thing possible. If the sky is blue, I want to believe the sky is blue. If the sky is not blue, I want not to believe the sky is blue. This is the definition of rationality that motivates scientific research. Yes, it is fair to say that this definition of rationality is devoid of emotion, because emotions don't necessarily best reflect the real world. This definition of rationality doesn't make judgments based on subjective factors such as your life values.

What I'm getting at here is more the other definition, instrumental rationality. This means "achieving your values." It simply means steering your life by doing actions that seek to best achieve your values. I think you have a misunderstanding about some things, so I'll show by example a completely rational thought process involving emotion:

"I really enjoy walking through nature. It makes me feel better about my fitness, because I feel good when I walk several miles. It makes me feel more connected to the Earth, which is a satisfying feeling. For other reasons I can't quite articulate, being in nature makes me happy. Therefore, I should steer my life to increase the number of opportunities I have to hike. Perhaps, I should consider a career as a Park Ranger. Or, maybe it is better to consider a career that is high-paying to benefit other avenues of my life, while dedicating my weekends to nature hikes. This is something that I have to make a decision about that involves evaluating my personal value system."
