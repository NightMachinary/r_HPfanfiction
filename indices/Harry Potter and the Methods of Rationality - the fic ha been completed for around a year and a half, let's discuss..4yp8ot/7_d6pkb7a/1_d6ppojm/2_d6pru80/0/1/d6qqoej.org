Rationality is, in a sense, an extreme. It /is/ the most optimal way of making decisions. And you're correct, in that it places our logic and reason above emotion - but that is not childish - if anything, it is a sign of maturity.

Rationality isn't going to be the most "emotionally serving" worldview, as it requires the strength of will to temper our feelings with cold logic. It doesn't claim to be the most enjoyable philosophy, either. It simply claims to be the most optimal (for accomplishing your goals).

Ironically, if "enjoying life" and "experiencing emotion" are primary or even important goals for you, rationality is very simple to tune for that purpose.
