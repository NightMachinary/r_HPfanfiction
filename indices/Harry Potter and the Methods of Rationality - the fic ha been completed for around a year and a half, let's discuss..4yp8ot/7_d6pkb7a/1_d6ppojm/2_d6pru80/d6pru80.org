I don't see the problem people have with rationality. By /definition/, other worldviews /are/ More Wrong (logically speaking).

There's a reason that the same principles rationality proposes are taught in AI courses as the most optimal and correct way of thought.

Transhumanism is simply an extension, in part, motivated by a desire to not die.

Ironically, people (for some reason) approach both philosophies like they're fundamentally irrational. It's frustrating, because wanting to enhance the human condition is only natural. We've been doing it for millennia: we're already transhumanist! But you attach the word "transhumanist" to the philosophy, and people freak out, like it's suddenly voodoo magic.

And rationality can be decomposed to hard mathematics - it, by definition, is the most optimal mode of thought.
