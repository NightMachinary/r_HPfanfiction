as I stated later in the thread, my comment was full of venom. It is true however. At no point in that summary, is an untrue word said. However, I dont think that I was clear in my earlier comments about my feelings toward the fic. I loathe HPMoR. I loathe its writting, its characterization, its sheer arrogance. To me, it takes one of my only companions in my childhood, shits on it, then tries to feed it to me. That is why I have such venom in that summary. Is it unfair? probably. Is it bias in a way that it probably shouldnt be? absolutely. Is it true? yes.
