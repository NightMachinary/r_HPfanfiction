Exactly, this fic is loathed by a lot of people for an obscure reason that have more to do with the way they receive it than its actually qualities and weaknesses. I mean, there are people out there that doesn't like the story for good reasons, but it's not the majority.

I personally fail to see the arrogance of the story, for example. All I see is the arrogance of some of the characters (Harry,Voldemort...).

You see, I've read HP in my childhood and I'm sure I enjoyed it just as much as you, and I just don't see the same things as you in it. To me it's a clever and enjoyable that's not perfect in any way and which could use a rewrite or to but is in the top tier of HP fanfics in terms of sheer fun. I don't care that the characters are ooc, that the magic hasn't much in common with canon magic or that Harry doesn't like the snitch. It doesn't run it for me.

As I said, this story rubs some people the wrong way for some reason. But it doesn't have much to do with its actual qualities and faults. Your summary really doesn't do it justice though. And you even fail to mention any of its actual faults.
