  Harry is supper smart, and bias towards Muggle science methods. As a result he attempts to rationalize Magic. This pisses off alot of people, who Harry showcases that he is more intelligent than. Harry befriends Draco, partners with Hermione. Voldemort returns. Voldemort then is proven to be smarter than Harry, but is stupid in the end due to being a wizard thinker. Harry wins. story over. There you go. the entire story in less than a fucking paragraph. I just saved you a week of your life.

That's a very unfair way to present it. This story is one of those that are treated with the most unfairness. And it's author. Yudkowski is really upfront in his goals with this story, if you didn't want to read a tract about the author's beliefs, then you should've read someone else. You knew from the start what you were getting yourself into.

I liked this story, I sometime have the impression that I didn't read the same hpmor than some people. This story seems to rub some people the wrong way for some reason.
