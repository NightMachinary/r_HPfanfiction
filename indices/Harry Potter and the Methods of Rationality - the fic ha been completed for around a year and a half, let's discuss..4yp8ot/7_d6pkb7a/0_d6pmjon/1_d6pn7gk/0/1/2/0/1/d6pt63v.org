True. I liked the Patronus a lot, although I can also see why it was off-putting to others. In terms of dissecting it, the fact that there's a reason why nobody spreads the knowledge around and that Harry's not the first person to discover the secret of Dementors was very original. The AK having a 'mirror' of that was also nice.
