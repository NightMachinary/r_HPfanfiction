Okay, I guess we should agree to disagree. A fanfiction by nature is changing the sequence of events from Rowling's canon. I don't understand why disagreeing with her metaphor and inserting his own is at all a faux pas. Perhaps the canon is much more sacred to you than me, but I do love the original books... I waited in line at midnight for the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th release growing up.
