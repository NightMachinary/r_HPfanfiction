  Harry simply discovers some underlying mechanisms that tie it together

A big plot point is that he doesn't. Magic explicitly /doesn't/ make sense, even after he tries to experiment with it. He's able to do one thing that other people can't, which is partial transfiguration, and that's because he /visualises/ the world differently. His attempts to 'tame' magic ultimately fail, and his best guess as to where it came from is that someone built a supertechnological machine that somehow does everything.
