Hm, interesting. Thanks for the explanation, I'll not jump to conclusions about people's strength of imaginations so quickly in the future. That does sound imaginative, and I guess there are obviously a lot of different ways of being imaginative. I think I'm being prejudice (which I don't want to be) because it seems this fic is bastardizing everything /I/ loved about about the books. Clearly this author loves the books if he's going to write such a long fan fiction, but I think what he and I liked about the books are very very different things, and it seems what I consider "the point" of the books, he's gone and said "that was stupid, and I'm fixing it here".

I think that's why I get the impression he looks down on parts of the books. I know you say it's a love letter, but I can't help get the impression (and again, I've never read it, so it's only an impression, and obviously you would know better, which is why I'm interested in your thoughts) that it's also the opposite?

Perhaps... perhaps a love letter to the story, but not the world-building, then? What are your thoughts on that? And please don't hesitate to tell me I'm still being prejudice, if I am, I want it pointed out.

And disclaimer, I'm glad not everyone thinks the same way about the books. I don't mean to say he or you or anyone should think like me. The fact that people who love the books still respond differently makes me think they're even more impressive, rather than less impressive.
