  The entire premise is that the wizarding world has had no need for science because magic has been able to meet all of its needs, so an *enlightenment never reached the wizarding world*. The muggle world required technology to advance, which requires science, which requires asking and learning.

This is the core of the argument.

Wizards have magic, therefore don't need science, which is so sad for wizards, because their ignorance of science makes them unenlightened, unlike muggles, who have been enlightened by science.

From the very first chapter, MoR establishes one of the points it's pushing: wizards are dumb. Wizards need the scientific method to stop being dumb. The fact that wizards don't know about brain damage, or didn't go to the moon, proves that they are dumb and science is their salvation from their ignorance.

See, I don't think wizards are dumb. I think wizards are just as smart as muggles, only in a different way, because their society evolved differently due to presence of magic. Wizards can literally break the laws of physics, have instant teleportation and can cheat death and all those things have been around longer than modern muggle science.

Wizards. Do. Not. Need. An. Enlightenment. But EY thinks they do and he wrote a fanfic about it.
