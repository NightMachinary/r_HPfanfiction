MoR posits that wizards are unenlightened, which is a different thing than saying they are dumb.

  See, I don't think wizards are dumb. I think wizards are just as smart as muggles, only in a different way, because their society evolved differently due to presence of magic. Wizards can literally break the laws of physics, have instant teleportation and can cheat death and all those things have been around longer than modern muggle science.

That is one of the points. Wizards AREN'T dumb. Harry is often wrong about wizards because he assumes they are in some aspects. Wizards are incredibly intelligent when it comes to performing magic and surviving with magic. Because they don't need enlightenment, they don't need to experiment and ask questions of their magic. But why hate a fiction just because it does?

This fic's entire premise can be summarized as "what would happen if a person versed in enlightenment ideals becomes a wizard?" There is no harm in that. I'm not sure why you rally so strongly against it. Wizards obviously do not need an enlightenment to last as long as they have, which is part of the point. What the enlightenment could bring to wizards is more powerful magics and better treatment of their fellow man... which may be something they don't need, but could certainly use.
