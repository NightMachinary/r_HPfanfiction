That sounds exactly like magic!bashing to me, to be honest. It's giving magic no credit.

To me it's clear witches and wizards study magic the same way Muggles study science. How does the author explain the Department of Mysteries if not a giant research lab to understand how things work? How does he explain Snape inventing his own spells? Does he think the witches and wizards just say higgeldy piggeldy with a stick until something happens?

I understand if readers complain that /we/ don't get the facts about how magic works, because I agree, it's not there, but it's painfully clear to me the /characters/ in the book understand magic. /The entire plot is dependent on Dumbledore's superior understanding of how magic works/. I can't even emphasis that enough. There literally would be no series if Dumbledore did not have an incredibly deep and intimate understanding of what makes the world and magic tick.

That's what I mean by the author seeming to bastardize what I hold dear in the books and lacking imagination because he's failing to grasp there is logic to the magic.

Not saying I don't like rational magic either, I've read plenty of fantasy books that have that sort of magic and it's great. But the idea of writing a fan fiction to "correct the book's magic" is the thing that gets me. If he just wrote it to have fun, and doesn't really mind how the book does it, then I'll eat my words, but considering everyone, including yourself, says he's very preachy, then I'm guessing he has strong opinions about what the books are "lacking".
