Only what you said in simply not true, because the author doesn't stop at Harry using what he knows to understand what he doesn't. MoR is a one-of-a-kind fic: magic!bashing. It's not just that science is applied to magic, it's that Harry's "scientific magic" is implicitly said to be better than the wizarding interpretation of magic. It's not a love letter to canon, it's a giant middle finger.
