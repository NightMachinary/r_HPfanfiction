There is absolutely no magic!bashing in HPMOR. That is a ridiculous thing to suggest in a story that is about understanding magic. The entire premise is that the wizarding world has had no need for science because magic has been able to meet all of its needs, so an enlightenment never reached the wizarding world. The muggle world required technology to advance, which requires science, which requires asking and learning. Harry is a child of the enlightenment, and all he offers the magical world is a different perspective. He is very often wrong. His only crime is asking "why?" to magical phenomenon, a question that wizards have not needed to ask. It is a love letter because the magic is consistent - to me, the story reads very much like Eliezer's explanation of how Rowling's magic can make sense. How could that be a giant middle finger?
