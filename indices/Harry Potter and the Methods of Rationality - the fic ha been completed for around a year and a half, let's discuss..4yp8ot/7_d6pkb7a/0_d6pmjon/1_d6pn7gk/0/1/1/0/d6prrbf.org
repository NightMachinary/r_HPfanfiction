You're just... wrong. There are entire chapters where Harry writes down numbered lists of hypotheses and then tests them. The most transparent example of this is the blood magic chapter with Draco. Harry is constantly testing the boundaries of magic. There is an entire arc about Hermione being pissed that Harry is "doing science" with Draco and not Hermione. This criticism is just blatantly unfounded, no offense meant.
