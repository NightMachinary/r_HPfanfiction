I am paraphrasing an argument from an physicist [[http://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/][here]]. His complaint was that too much of things that harry assumed way too much and didnt really act like a scientist mch at all, besides the experiment with Draco and Hermione thing.

Harry straight out assumed things like Souls don't exist. He uses the same arguments creationists use to assume Atlantis must of existed to create some mechanism fior magic, with some genetic marker. His two biggest accomplishments, his patronus and partial transifiguration, are not due to careful researtch, experimentation, observation of the world and trying to find some theory. No they are the result of him thinking really hard and fnding the answer.

His review is very thourough, I would reccomend a read of it. HPMOR is wrong about a lot of the scientific, and philosophic concepts it introduces, and this author is informed enough to point out the outright wrong ideas Yudkowsky presents.
