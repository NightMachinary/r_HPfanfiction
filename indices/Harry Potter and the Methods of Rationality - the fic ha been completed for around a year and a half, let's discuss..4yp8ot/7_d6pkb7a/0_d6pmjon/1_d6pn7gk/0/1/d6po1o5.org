I think the author has a very vivid imagination. HPMOR isn't really about Muggle science entering the wizarding world so much as it's about a protagonist using the scientific method to explore magical phenomenon. It's about Harry seeing magic and asking, "How does this work?" and challenging preconceived notions of magic. In this way, I feel that it's much more of a love letter to canon than it first appears, because it keeps most things consistent from canon. Harry simply discovers some underlying mechanisms that tie it together and use that knowledge to become better at magic than he would have otherwise.
