I'm going to respond to your response by bullets/quotes as well

#+begin_quote
  Harry starts out an extremely arrogant, unlikeable prick and though he stumbles, he ends up in the same place at the end, having gone in a circle. He's still arrogant, thinks he knows what's best better than everyone else and is still planning to realize his plans for widely available immortality, which is a terrible idea for reasons which his ultra-logical mind ignores or doesn't seem to perceive. He just decides that nobody ever dying anymore is automatially the correct course of action logically, morally and in good in every other way.
#+end_quote

Actually, Harry starts off as amazed and wide-eyed as he is discovering the world, he becomes more arrogant as he sees himself better than the world he discovers, and ends up humbled by his mistakes. One of the last scenes is him realizing he was about to do something that could have destroyed the world just because it seemed right to him. Also, immortality for everyone isn't an irrational thing from his pov when there are extraterrestrial colonies and virtually infinite resources. Morally it's just your opinion vs his.

  Hermione arc
#+end_quote

Hermione's arc was going from her canon character, to an echo of HPMOR-Harry, to her fully realized self. Her story focused on her feeling left out and second best to others. At first, this was due to her being nerdy before Hogwarts, then it was her feeling stuck as Harry's assistant when she tried to actually prove her worth, and in the finale she found herself as a fully realized protagonist in her own story. She was finally the 'hero' she wanted to be.

  Quirrelmort's Arc
#+end_quote

Of course he's going to stay the same. If a few kids being near him would change his character then he wouldn't be Quirrellmort. His arc happened long before this story. Might as well ask for Dumbledore's arc in the canon.

#+begin_quote
  Scientific magic
#+end_quote

Well that's, like, your opinion man. The point is applying science, or at least the scientific method, to magic in a world where most people wouldn't even think about it. They do find out that magic has it's own rules and also the whole point of them mentioning the laws of thermodynamics is to say they don't apply.

  Powered villain
#+end_quote

yea you right

#+begin_quote
  Rationality
#+end_quote

The characters promoting a view does not mean that view is correct. Harry, despite being a total rationalist, is proven wrong and makes a lot of mistakes. Quirellmort does as well. The point is that rationalism is only right when you have all the pieces. If you try to apply it without knowing all of the angles then you aren't really making an informed decision.

#+begin_quote
  Writing
#+end_quote

I agree, the lectures can go on a bit. But I enjoyed them enough that they didn't bother me personally.

#+begin_quote
  Soap-boxing
#+end_quote

hell yes

#+begin_quote
  Beginning Sucks
#+end_quote

Sort of. The beginning is much more low key and happy. I felt like the best parts were (if you were to divide the story into fourths) the 2nd and 4th parts; after Harry stopped being all wide-eyed and amazed, skipped the whole heroine arc, and post Hermione death/azkaban breakout.

  The Way Protag is Written
#+end_quote

He's written fine, you just don't like him. Which is fine, it's just not a cause of bad writing

#+begin_quote
  Canon Deconstruction
#+end_quote

To focus on dementors; how else are you supposed to present a different interpretation in an AU from the pov of your characters? If the author had posted the thought on a message board I'm sure it would have been phrased as just their interpretation but in the context of a story it only works if it's the 'truth' of that universe.

And while this is just my opinion; fuck the canon, the canon blows. Half the things in it aren't thought out or expanded and it becomes exponentially more obvious that Rowling didn't have any real plan even after the first several books. I'm for anyone tearing up that crap and making something that works better for their fic.

#+begin_quote
  Pacing
#+end_quote

Yea it has issues with pacing. I agree. Those same section dividers I listed could have each been from entirely different fics based on pacing alone. It's a problem.
