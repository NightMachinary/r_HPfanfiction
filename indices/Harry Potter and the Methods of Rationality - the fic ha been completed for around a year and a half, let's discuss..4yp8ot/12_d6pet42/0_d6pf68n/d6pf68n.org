Most discussion threads exist before the completion of the story. And as I said, most threads are years old. Perhaps more have read it and haven't had a chance to discuss it. Perhaps opinions have changed over time, or with the completion of it. Certainly this subreddit is low traffic enough where a thread like this isn't at all harmful. If you don't want to contribute, you don't have to.

There is a subreddit for HPMOR where everyone is likely to be a huge fan. As I made clear in my post, I'm interested in discussion which is much less interesting if everyone is of one mind. There is a subreddit dedicate to Harry Potter fanfiction as well, and I've decided that this thread most appropriately belongs there.
