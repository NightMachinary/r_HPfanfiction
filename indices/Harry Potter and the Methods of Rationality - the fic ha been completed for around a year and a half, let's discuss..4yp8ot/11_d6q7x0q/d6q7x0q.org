  Harry's genius is unbecoming of someone so young,

See, this is my problem with all of the other characters. While Harry's behavior is explained, there's no reason why Hermione, Draco, Neville, and seemingly the rest of the heroine SPEW are acting so much more mature and intelligent. This is a flaw with most fanfiction with 10-12 year olds but it goes a step too far here. I can ignore it, but I'm not picturing them at at age, I'm picturing them being at least in their third year.
