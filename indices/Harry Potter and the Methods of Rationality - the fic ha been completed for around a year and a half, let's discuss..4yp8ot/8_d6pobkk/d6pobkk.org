So, I liked HPMoR. It's by no means perfect, but there's a lot of great moments. Harry himself is the weakest link, the author's pretentiousness coming through in Harry. Still, it explores a lot of interesting ideas. Harry sending himself a note to /not/ fuck around with time travel is one of my favorite moments in any HP fanfiction.

Outside of Harry's occasional "I'm so smart" rants, the wars were definitely the worst parts. Writing large-scale battles is hard enough for experienced writers, and even the most well-written battles still struggle in text. The medium is just not suitable for depicting a battle on that scale. The guy made a good three or four dozen anime references throughout (Puella Magi Madoka Magica is even suggested to be HPMoR canon), I dunno why he didn't go one step further and turn the wars into teamed duelling contests from every shounen ever. It makes far more sense in-universe and is far easier to write. You really have to try to make those boring. That said, it didn't serve much of a purpose, so changing the format would only make it more interesting, not more important.

Speaking of boring, HPMoR has its downtime, but it never gets /too/ bad with it. One of the hardest parts about writing fics closely examining magic is that it gets very dull, very fast. It's very easy to end up writing paragraphs of the magical equivalent of technobabble, which will put your readers to sleep long before you get to the point. However, if you don't spend enough time on it, whatever goal you're trying to accomplish will be unbelievable. HPMoR leans more towards the technobabble side of things, but you know exactly what you're getting into when you start reading, so I'm willing to give it a free pass on that. Otherwise, it either tries to have fun with its idea, or it tries to turn them into horrible killing devices. Either works for me.

One thing I think isn't brought up nearly enough is how close the story became to a deconstruction of fanfiction tropes, seemingly on accident. Harry starts off as an insufferable twat self-insert, constantly inventing new magic while acting as the moral arbiter of the wizarding world. This is not (solely) due to bad writing, but the entire purpose of the fic. It's intentional, because Harry needs to be that way to explore the ideas the author wanted to explore. However, it all comes back to bite him in the ass at some point. As the story shifts from "fucking around with magic" to "saving the world from a machiavellian evil", it doesn't pretend like Harry's nonsense didn't happen. Rather, it embraces it and forges on, the story no longer being so forgiving of the author's idea of a perfect Harry. It sort of undoes it all in the finale, but that's really just playing Harry's intelligence straight again. A proper deconstruction probably wouldn't have made all of Harry's miracles possible, but since they were, you have to use them or you fail at your original premise.

I think the fic suffers from the closest thing to "mainstream syndrome" a fic can have. It's actually good, but its popularity has led to more vocal critics than it would otherwise have. If every fic even half as good as HPMoR got the same treatment, there wouldn't be enough space on the internet to hold the complaints.

As a side note I couldn't fit in anywhere else:

  Lack of sex, romance, angst.

I don't think HPMoR gets enough credit for this either. It has romance /elements/, but it has fun with it. Hell, even the books struggle with this. It seems like most people writing romance forget that, at some point, real love is supposed to be fun. In fiction, most of the time you mirror this by pairing the romantic elements with comedy elements. HPMoR accomplishes the goal by making Harry's outlook on romance "I'm 12 and what is this". It barely qualifies as a minor part of the story, but it does work to keep the mood light when it needs to.
