  I think the fic suffers from the closest thing to "mainstream syndrome" a fic can have. It's actually good, but its popularity has led to more vocal critics than it would otherwise have. If every fic even half as good as HPMoR got the same treatment, there wouldn't be enough space on the internet to hold the complaints.

And let us not forget the author's attitude about ... many things, as that certainly hadn't helped it with this particular problem. It didn't sour things for me because I didn't really care about the author's weirder whims, but some of the hate towards it does come from that too. Which only highlights your point more, in the end.
