My first 25 chapters theory is something I gained from reading through the many threads already discussing it, where most people agree that they could not get through the intro which is very critical on Rowling's canon. Your mileage may vary, obviously I don't intend for it to be a golden rule of thumb. You're allowed to dislike the story if you've read further, but many people stop at that point.
