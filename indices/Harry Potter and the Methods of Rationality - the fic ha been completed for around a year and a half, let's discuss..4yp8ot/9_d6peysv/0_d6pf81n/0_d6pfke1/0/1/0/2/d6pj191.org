I had had enough around chapter 38 (it's been quite a while, so I can't remember precisely why) and quit, so that doesn't fit the first 25 chapters theory. I would agree with the pacing problem more than anything else, although I felt that the author, at least, got more arrogant as the story went on, not less, and that also may have contributed to my inability to continue.
