Fics like 'The Real Us' by Seel'vor, 'In This World and the Next' by robst, 'Alexandra Potter' by Taure, and 'HPMoR' aren't really interested in telling a story. Instead, they try to serve as forums for the author's long-winded thoughts about the characters, silly views on magical theory, or meta-commentary about the fandom as a whole.

IMO they'd be better off as insane forum posts instead of serious attempts at writing a story.
