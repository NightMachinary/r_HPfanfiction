The first hint that I would have issues with the fic was when the supposedly rational adult, when confronted with magic, didn't react rationally but went into full blown denial.

The second hint that I would have issues with the fic was when I realised that the title of the fic was literally true and that the supposedly rational main character was anything but. Instead of rational thoughts and actions he pusued a mindless, religious devotion to only the tools, to the methods of rationality. In ritualistic rote he fervently kept applying them without plan or understanding.

I did not bother to wait for a third hint.
