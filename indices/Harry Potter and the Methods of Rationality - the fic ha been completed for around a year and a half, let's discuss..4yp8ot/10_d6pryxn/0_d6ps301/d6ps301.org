1.) Harry's father is highly skeptical of magic until he sees it before his eyes, which is the rational thing to do. He is in denial when his wife tells him of magic, which is the rational thing to do. Incredible claims require incredible evidence. Harry's father does not deny magic after being levitated.

2.) Harry's devotion to his "methods of rationality" as tools is part of the flaws of his character that create conflict in the story. He is not a perfect rationalist, and is not written to be.
