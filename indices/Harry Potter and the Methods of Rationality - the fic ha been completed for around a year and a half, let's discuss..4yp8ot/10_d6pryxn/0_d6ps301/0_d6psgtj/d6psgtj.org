  1.) Harry's father is highly skeptical of magic until he sees it before his eyes, which is the rational thing to do. He is in denial when his wife tells him of magic, which is the rational thing to do. Incredible claims require incredible evidence. Harry's father does not deny magic after being levitated.
#+end_quote

Scepticism is not the issue. The issue is that he kept in denial even after witnessing the effects. Not "something happened, there is some explanation for it, I just don't have it right now" but full-blown refusal to admit something he witnessed with is own eyes.

  2.) Harry's devotion to his "methods of rationality" as tools is part of the flaws of his character that create conflict in the story. He is not a perfect rationalist, and is not written to be.

Not a perfect rationalist? He was a full-blown unthinking worshipper. He wouldn't know a rational thought if it bit him in the arse. The tools were the ONLY thing about rationality that he had any connection to and even those he kept misapplying because he understood nothing about them.
