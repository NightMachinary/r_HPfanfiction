1.) Please reread the first few chapters. You simply must have misread the first few chapters. He is not in denial after witnessing the effects. He does not refuse to admit it happened. This is factually incorrect. He is uncomfortable with it because it is so weird and challenging to his worldview, but he accepts it. There is no argument from Harry's father against it. Harry's father even helps him find Platform 9 3/4.

2.) Again, this is part of Harry's character and is literally a huge part of the plot. This story is about Harry's growth as a rationalist, from an arrogant guy who thinks he's right and gets most things wrong to finally becoming much more rational by the end.
