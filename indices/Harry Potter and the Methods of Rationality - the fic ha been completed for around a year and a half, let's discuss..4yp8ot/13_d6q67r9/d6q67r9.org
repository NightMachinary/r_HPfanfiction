My opinion of HPMOR has evolved since i finally finished it about a year ago. The first time I read it the first few chapters were a hilarious and brilliant breath of fresh air, and then it devolved into a scientific and philosophical analogy that I wasn't able to follow due to the change in tone.

I quit after the first few chapter but since it was a massive deal in the FF universe I decided to try again. Here are some of my overall thoughts:

PROS:

-It's unique compared to the tired tropes and pairing of the fandom so it allows the reader to take a step back and enjoy the fandom all over again.

-It allows for more than a passive somewhat forgettable read, because we read so many fanfictions somewhat passively we can't always appreciate them. HPMOR is one of those epics that stands out amongst the hundreds of one-shots, ficlets, drabbles, and mediocre fics out there.

-You can revisit and find something new.

CONS(these are mostly personal reflections):

-It's a tiring read, after reading the first half it slowly becomes more difficult and exhausting trying to follow what the author is "teaching you".

-The pacing and the unrelenting contradictions in the story can make it confusing to follow, especially if like me your not someone who knows all that much about rational thinking.

-It's very long and the ending doesn't really pay off, it's been a while but I remember thinking how anti-climactic the ending was making the tiring last quarter of the story seem even more bothersome.

-Most of what is considered an in-depth take on magic doesn't hold up and in the end is more of a negative in the narrative than a positive, certain instances like transfiguring a wand, make even less sense even after it's explained.

To me there are too many negative's aspects to ignore and I don't think it's a fic for everyone. In the end I found the beginning interesting and different, however it's more troublesome and irritating to read than anything else and it ends up being not worth the confusion and contradiction. This is, however, just my opinion and I am not of the opinion that everyone will agree with me.
