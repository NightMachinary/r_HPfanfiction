One of my biggest problems is that most characters are totally OOC. Since the story makes a big deal of how Harry's upbringing made him a differsnt person, it rather defeats the point for everyone else to be different while presumably keeping the same background. Also, often the characters are made purposefully dense in order to emphasize the /brilliance/ of Harry. Hagrid is the worst example of this. HPMOR has us believe Hagrid is completely mentally impaired. I mean, he's no genius in canon, but c'mon.
