It's...well, it's essentially Atlas Shrugged, with Harry Potter instead of trains and Yudkowsky's views instead of Objectivism.

It's not something written because someone wanted to entertain people, or create a legitimately good work, or because they liked Harry Potter - it's something written with the /very/ blatant purpose of self-promotion / soapboxing, by someone who openly doesn't even like Harry Potter. The author has absolutely no respect for the source material and definitely chose it because it provided the largest possible audience.

And, well, it worked. The fanfiction community is constantly desperate for anything written by someone with the ability to write at a 12th grade level that includes characters with familiar names, so, despite the idea looking ludicrous at face value, it worked. His online presence shot up over it. The notability challenges on his wikipedia page stopped happening once newspaper articles started being written about his fanfiction.

Maybe motives shouldn't matter, I mean, that's a completely valid view to hold, but it's also just /not good./ If it were an original work, that hadn't been written to manipulate an easily-used community in order to aggrandize a person, it'd just be one of a handful of other extremely preachy attempts at original fiction no one but his cult of personality has read, sitting on his blog - which, in all likelihood, would have a much smaller readerbase than it does today.

TL;DR: The stated purpose of the story is to teach you about how to think properly. The actual purpose of this story is to make people know Yudkowsky's name. It really only succeeds at one of those.
