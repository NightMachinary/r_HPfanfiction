So I'm late to the pajama party.

I absolutely /hated/ it. And that sucks because as I was reading it I thought it was pretty good. It showed me a few things that I still notice coming up in my thoughts even though its been years since I read it. But when I finished the story I felt like the author lied to me.

He promised me at the beginning a Harry Potter that uses science and magic together. He started with a refreshingly new character who was a total prick but who was a lot of fun to read. Having an arrogant hero was just plain fun after so many -"What? /Me/? I'm just a ____. Are you sure you've got the right person?"-characters.

The author also said it was going to be very straight forward, that you were gonna be able to figure things out from clues that were dropped in the story. And at the end it was another story of Dumbledores manipulation and ridiculous answers to all of the great questions that were brought up.

Another thing that */really/* bugged me was how Harry beat Voldemort in the end. There was such a huge hole, I can't believe I haven't seen it referenced before.

.

OK, so, in the finial fight, Harry is surrounded by Death Eaters and the author gives us a deadline to figure it out or we get another ending(I think? I don't remember much but I remember being pissed off) and Harry transfigures the tip of his want into one long strand carbon fiber(?) to beat them all. But remember how he killed the troll when Hermionie died? Harry stabbed his want into the trolls skull and transfigured acid into its brain. When he pulled the wand out he noticed that the core was sticking out of the tip. Can he just transfigure the wand all the way down or what?

I feel like I'm too emotionally invested in this, but it had so much potential, I was so ready for a Harry that knew and applied muggle science and actually tried to figure out the Whys of the magical world that the let down just really pissed me off.
