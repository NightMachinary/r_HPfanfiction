Those "learning moments" were exactly what turned me off. I got to about chapter five where Harry was explaining the fundamental attribution error and rolled my eyes. Sure, not everyone knows this stuff, but for anyone who has an interest in sociology this is very basic. I stumbled across the term in 7th grade during my figuring out people phase. The way it was presented felt, arrogant. I tried a few more chapters but I didn't feel like I was reading a story, I felt like I was having concepts thrown at me for no reason at all. The wizarding world is in the dark, but to have an 11 year old straight up lecture a teacher is just cringeworthy.
