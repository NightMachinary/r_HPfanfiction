That pretty much sums it up. I think the writing in HPMoR is high quality on the written level and that the story is refreshing and impressively detailed.

I also first read it as a teenager first exploring transhumanist/'rationalist' thought, so I didn't mind all of that; the plot reasons for Harry being that way even made it all make narrative sense in the end.

But as a pure HP fanfiction story it's obviously not what most readers are there for.
