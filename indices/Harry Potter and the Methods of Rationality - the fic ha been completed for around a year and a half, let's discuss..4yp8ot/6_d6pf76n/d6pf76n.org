I actually didn't hate this story. Kind of liked it (heresy, I know!).

But I approached it as a sort of primer on rationality, at a time when I was exploring the philosophical idea of transhumanism. I feel that HPMoR /excellently/ explained these ideas in "story-format." I do feel that it provided some level of insight.

I would not have enjoyed this fic nearly as much if I did not continue reading out of a desire to explore transhumanism and rationality.

Other reasons:

- It felt original and imaginative

- Main character was not stupid, but not always correct either

- Had a few epiphanies

- I'm also a sucker for Ender's Game-type stories

I can totally see why people wouldn't like this from a purely fanfic point of view. If you come at this fic with a fundamentally different worldview, you'll probably hate having the ideas shoved in your face. However, if you're curious about a novel and exciting new philosophy, I think I could recommend this.
