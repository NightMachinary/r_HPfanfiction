Me three, I guess! I found it incredibly fun and refreshing. I love it when authors work within constraints, and writing to try to make Harry Potter's magic self-consistent and not game-breaking is an incredible constraint indeed. I liked that it made fun of canon in a way that only someone who really loved it could. Occasionally I found it powerful and insightful. It's one of the first fics that really engaged me, the fic I always used to recommend to get my rl friends into fanfiction, and I've always felt a bit down that it didn't seem like people on this sub saw the good qualities it had.

But, on the other hand, there was a lot of sloppy writing. Harry acting like a supergenius is not explained, obviously, by "adopted dad was a physicist". I suspended my disbelief on my first few readthroughs because I felt like it was just a handwavy way to tell the story he wanted. Obviously Harry's character can be a bit offputting though, given how far from canon it is, and that it was eventually revealed to have a Watsonian reason behind it felt stupid, because it was a solution to a mystery that was never actually set up as a mystery by the text.

The other main problem, of course, is that Voldemort was so smart as to be unbeatable, and had to be holding multiple idiot balls AND villain balls to get the story to end. Going, of course, the original spirit of the thing in the first place.

As a final note, I don't know why I wrote this as a reply to your comment, yargle, but I did and thus it's going to stay that way.
