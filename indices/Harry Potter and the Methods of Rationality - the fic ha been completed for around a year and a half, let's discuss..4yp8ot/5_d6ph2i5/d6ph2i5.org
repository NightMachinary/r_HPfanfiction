I disagree with you in that I loved the beginning of the fic, but later I felt like the author got sort of arrogant with the popularity it got and stalled a bit, and I'm not getting into that disastrous 'pick your own ending' he tried to implement. Otherwise it's a pretty good fic, if only for it's originality.
