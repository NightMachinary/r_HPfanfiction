Also on the bad:

- Hermione's the story's chew toy. Not quite fridged, but close. It's a terrible trope but the author still went there.
- The story wavers between crack and serious with abandon.
- There are a bunch of references scattered throughout to other series and to canon. That tends to break people out of the story.
