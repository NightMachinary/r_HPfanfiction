I love it. Its a deconstruction/affectionate parody. I think people get very caught up on the author and take it too seriously and overly defend canon/the rest of the fandom.

I also live in the UK and I think that the way HPMOR is written appeals to the way Brits affectionately criticise things. In the US criticism seems to be taken more seriously as something to rail against or push back at. Ultimately; it doesn't matter how bright MOR!Harry is because he's a fictional character in a world where everything else is logically consistent. There definitely are bright children out there if you're concerned about realism - they just tend not to be protagonists of these kinds of stories - or most kinds of stories; because who would they appeal to when most kids aren't? Aimed at mass markets anyway. By contrast, Artemis Fowl is another character popular in the UK who's a child genius. I don't know to what extent railing against smart!Harry is anti intellectualism.
