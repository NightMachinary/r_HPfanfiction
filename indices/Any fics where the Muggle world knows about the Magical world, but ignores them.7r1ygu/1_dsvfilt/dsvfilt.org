It was Magical world that forced it's people to observe statue of secrecy. In a logical, sane and rational world that would mean that magical world feels the need to protect the secret of their existence.

Why? I don't know. Logically it could be argued that they were probably afraid. Why? Magical world is really not that powerful.

On side note: Canon implied that muggle authorities were aware of magical world.

Another note: It's caked ministry of magic. I don't know about you but the world I live in usually don't have independent ministries. They are always part of government. Logically it can be said that minister of magic was part of cabinet under Prime Minister of Britain.

Anyway, have fun with you wizard wank.
