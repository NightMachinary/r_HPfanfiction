Yes, this is within canon. The British PM is aware of the Ministry, Chapter 2 of HBP deals with that conversation. Which is why I posted this as a fic request. Not just the Muggle authorities, but it's common knowledge that there exists a magical society. Wizards would not be hidden or have Muggle repellent charms or anything, but Muggles avoid obviously magical places anyways because they don't want to mess with wizard. Perhaps some history where the Muggles attempt to show force, but are utterly and easily decimated by a small wizarding force. Wizards don't go out of the way to squash Muggles, just like a human would not ordinarily go out of their way to squash ants.

Hmm. Sounds interesting... I suck at writing but I could give this a shot.
