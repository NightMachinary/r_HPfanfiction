  If two werewolves mate at the full moon, in their animal forms, something very strange happens.[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf#cite_note-PM-3][[3]]] The result of their mating, which has only ever occurred twice throughout history, has been a pack of wolf cubs --- actual [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wolf][wolf]] cubs --- who grow to become very beautiful wolves and can only be distinguished from true wolves by their near-human intelligence.[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf#cite_note-PM-3][[3]]]

it works with werewolves so I would assume its possible for Animagus's to do so as well.

perhaps something similar happens, and you end up with very intelligent offspring of the same species as the Animagus
