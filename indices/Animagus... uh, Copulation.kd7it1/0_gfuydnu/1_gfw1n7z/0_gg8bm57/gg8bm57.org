Just me being an palaeontology nerd, but dire wolves, /Canis dirus/ evolved in North America approximately 125 000 years ago, and modern humans reached the Americas approximately 16 500 years ago. /C. dirus/ was pretty much the size of a large grey wolf, /C. lupus/, but with the strongest jaws in genus /Canis/, presumably for hunting megafauna like ground sloths, mammoths, or mastodon.

The description of wolves born to werewolves seems to fit better with descriptions of the wolf who fed Romulus and Remus or the wolves who raised Mowgli.
