It depends on the mother. Does her magic recognize the fertilized egg as part of her body, something to shift along with her, or as a separate entity hitching a ride?

IRL pregnancy, the actual implantation of the embryo, doesn't happen for a few days. So, we've got conception: sperm combines with ovum, resulting in a free floating zygote. The little pre-embryo saunters down to the uterus and about day 5 it connects and makes an umbilical cord. At that point, it becomes an embryo and the mother becomes pregnant. Before now, the mother's body had nothing to do with its passenger.

In an Animagus, that uterus is gonna change. So the little cat pre-embryo is gonna try to connect to a human uterus.

I suppose it's possible, with magic, to say that a shapeshifter's uterus might recognize the cat as the same species and adjust to match. The umbilical cord could be human at one end and cat at the other. Equally possible, the pre-embryo might recognize a human uterus and use magic to shift itself into human form. Or you could say that when the mother shifted form, the "magic field" shifted everything within her even if it wasn't part of her.

But my guess is, the uterus is gonna ignore it. Completely wrong species, bub, nothing to see here. The Animagus would have a period like normal, flushing the cat conceptus out along with it, and would never notice anything different.
