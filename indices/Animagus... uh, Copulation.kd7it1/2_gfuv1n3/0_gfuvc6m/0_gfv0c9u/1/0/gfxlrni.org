And now I'm imagining a horror story where it turns out that the real reason for the animagus registry is so the ministry can track down and capture anyone with a "desirable" animagus form to force them to breed familiars.

McGonagall is still free because she was either a willing participant or bartered for her freedom, but either way, she was placed at Hogwarts to encourage more students to become animagi.

And Trevor keeps trying to escape because he wants to set his parents free, or something.

Anyway, thanks for ruining my morning.
