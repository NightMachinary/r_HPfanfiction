That's a good point! Yeah, for worldbuilding it's much better just to say they're sterile... but it's so much more interesting if they're not, haha. Personally, I like to think the bird would be a bird (as in, not an animagus) but with a human mind, if the egg was fertile and not abandoned.

EDIT: I realize a bird with a human mind is NOT a good thing and would most definitely be a torturous existence, so yeah, sterility is good.
