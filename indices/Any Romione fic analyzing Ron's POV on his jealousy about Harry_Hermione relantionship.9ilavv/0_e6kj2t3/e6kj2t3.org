Well, my story "Divided and Entwined" might come close to your request, during the part where Hermione is torn between the two, and Ron's not feeling too optimistic about his chances. It was originally planned as a Harry/Hermione story, but as the relationships developed during the writing, Ron came out on top, so to speak.
