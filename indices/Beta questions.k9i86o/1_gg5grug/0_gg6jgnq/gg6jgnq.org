That'd be amazing! I really appreciate the offer! I don't have that much written out so far, and since I haven't written in quite some time I feel like it's going slowly (but steadily) and I'm not quite ready to share anything I've actually written YET. I can probably blame Christmas stress a bit as well, it's a strange Christmas this year.

But I could PM you and explain my basic idea of this fic and if you're still interested in helping me when the time is there, I'll just turn to you again? ðŸ˜ƒ
