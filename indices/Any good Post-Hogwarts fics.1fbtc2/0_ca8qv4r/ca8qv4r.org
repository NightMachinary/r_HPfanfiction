Here are my personal favorites:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to Live Again]] by seeker68. This is one of the best-written, most canon-compliant post-Hogwarts fics I've ever come across. It is complete. It has an awesome sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=264951][31 Bottles]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War]] by Mrs_Granger. Maybe not quite as well-written as Learning to Live Again, but the plot is more interesting. It is complete. It has an amazing and very long sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][The Onset of Autumn]] by sand_dollar. A neat take on Harry, Ron and Hermione moving on with their careers after the war. Story is complete and has a sequel called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][If Spring Ever Comes]].

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304679][Evolution]] by sophie_hatter. This one is more of a love story focused on Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione. It is still a work in progress. Full disclosure, I beta read for this one. Personally, I think it's brilliant.
