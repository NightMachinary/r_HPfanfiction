[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6446][Shadow Walks]]- HP meets the multiverse theory, incredible well thought out read.

Rare example of using this entire Multiverse thing beyond "I want AU that technically is not an AU".

It sits in Angst/Romance but I would classify it as Adventure/Romance - there is angst (at start), there is properly used fluff and incredibly satisfying ending.

Also, certain small ideas that alone make this worthy reading (like this tidbit about certain robber).
