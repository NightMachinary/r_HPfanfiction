Adjacent to that, there is one fic I remember seeing where Harry wishes himself away from the Dursleys and somehow ends up with Sirius in Azkaban. The Dementors don't care and the house-elves are considered too unimportant by wizards to ever be listened to should they reveal the secret of Harry's residence there.

I don't remember what happens when he gets his Hogwarts letter, though.
