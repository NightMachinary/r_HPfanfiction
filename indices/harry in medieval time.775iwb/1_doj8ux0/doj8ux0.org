  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

This story is a great story , and the "Merlin"-arc (Chapters 4-7, "Forging a legend") is perfect for you. You can read that arc alone if you want to, but I can recommend the whole story completely. Yes, it's fem!Harry, but that isn't the focus of the story and doesn't distract from it too much.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

This story includes the founders-time, but it doesn't /only/ play in it. It isn't nearly as good ALJH, but it's... okay.
