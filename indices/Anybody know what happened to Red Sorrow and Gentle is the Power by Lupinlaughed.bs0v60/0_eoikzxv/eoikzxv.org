Was that the fic where Harry had a sister called Ariel who was raised by Snape?

I remember dropping that fic because everyone was so stupid it made me angry. I think it was somewhere after the Horcrux Diary plot, where every character was mad at everyone else due to forced miscommunications. It was well written, but the amount of teenage drama and angst was less like Harry Potter and more like a CW TV show.
