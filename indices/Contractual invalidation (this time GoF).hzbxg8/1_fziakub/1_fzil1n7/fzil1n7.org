  “No, I am afraid, you are not, Harry, but I am also certain that Harry Potter and possibly some his friends, will have no problem to get accepted in any foreign school. Try to talk with Madame Maxime. Miss Granger speaks fluently French, doesn't she? Or if you want to keep yourself in the English-speaking school, any school in America or Australia will gladly accept you, I am certain.”
