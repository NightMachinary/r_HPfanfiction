I mean isn't the cup many centuries old? Thus there's no way that you don't have to put in the school names yourself (as the chosen parties might change every year), and since we know you can only have one participant per group (how the cup fundamentally works), then we know that harry must be in a separate group that isn't Hogwarts.
