I was reading this really satisfying short story where Harry realized in the magical world as long as somebody's name was signed on a contract they had to abide by it. So then he made up a bunch of contracts for the death eaters and Voldemort saying that they couldn't perform certain violent behaviors and stuff. And then when they broke the contract they had no idea he signed them up for they lost their magic and died. I wish I could remember the name. Probably have it bookmarked somewhere but good luck finding it I've got a couple thousand bookmarked probably
