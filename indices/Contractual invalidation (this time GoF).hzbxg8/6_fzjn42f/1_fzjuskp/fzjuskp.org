I believe the story Can't Have It Both Ways by RobSt tried to explore that. I'm a minor so I couldn't put myself into a magical contract. And then when he was told he had to compete. Well since the competitors have to be "of age" then that means you are declaring me "of age" so i'm now considered an adult/emancipated. Well they then said no you're a minor he went back to point 1.
