I've hated that trope since I read something pointing out that the age restriction was 100% unrelated to the Goblet. The Goblet picks anyone, it doesn't care; it's just that people under 17 weren't supposed to be entered this time.

I think the analogy that was used was a liquor store. If a 12 year old somehow managed to buy alcohol, would that make them an adult because they did an adults-only thing? No, it just means someone broke the rules.
