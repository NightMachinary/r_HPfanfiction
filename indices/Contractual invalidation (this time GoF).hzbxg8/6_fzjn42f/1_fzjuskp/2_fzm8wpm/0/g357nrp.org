More like, if several political leaders including the head of OSHA/HSE ordered a 14yo to operate an industrial meat grinder even though safety regulations say the operator must be an adult due to the risk of chopping your own fingers off. The meat grinder doesn't have the power to declare the kid an adult; the politicians are the ones requiring adult responsibilities of a child.

Still not a judge in family court ruling emancipation, but there could easily be political and legal fallout, and I should think any halfway competent lawyer would be able to argue that none of those politicians should be allowed to make decisions affecting the child.
