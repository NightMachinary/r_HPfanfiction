At least one fanfiction explored the idea that it was the /person/ who entered the name who was caught in the contract, not the /name/ of a different person. It ends up with fake Moody losing his magic (and life?) when Harry doesn't compete.

It's a horrible idea ripe for abuse. Why not enter Tom Riddle in the tournament? I recently read a fanfiction that had Voldemort polyjuiced as one of the competitors after he got caught in the contract.
