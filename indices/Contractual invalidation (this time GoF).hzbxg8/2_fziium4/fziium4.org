Well while BC Jr was "only" speculating it is probably what he did. You have to think what would be easier. Confunding the Goblet that there are 4 schools that it needs to pick champions for and submitting Harry as the only contestant of that school. Or confunding the goblet that it needs to pick a second champion from only Hogwarts and that second champion has to be Harry?

I think the former would be a much easier task.
