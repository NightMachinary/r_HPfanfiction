Me being a spoilsport:

One thing I think people miss is that magical contracts don't follow Common Law - the Cup said he's got to participate, so that;s that. You can't appeal the ruling and the contract cannot be voided by a judge. If it did follow common law the fact that Harry didin't personally put his name in the cup would do it.

In other words, it's a geas, not a legal document.

Now, you can play the 'exact wording' game with geases - so the lack of discussion about the meaning of "participate" annoys me a little. Why can't Harry just show up to the challenge and forfeit? Or whatever the minimum is.

Harry's got some pride, but he's not /that/ proud, and he's certainly had enough of the spotlight for one lifetime already.
