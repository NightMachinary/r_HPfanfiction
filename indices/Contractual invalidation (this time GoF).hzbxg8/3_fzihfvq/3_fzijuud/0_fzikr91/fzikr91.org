The geas exists outside the being the created it - destroying the cup wouldn't affect the geas.

He acceptance or refusal is irrelevant - it's a geas, it's /imposed by magic/.

It's a lot closer to an Unbreakable Vow than a muggle contract, but it's even closer to a curse imposed by a fae than anything else.

So you have to think in terms of fae magic, which means there are exact words that describe what Harry needs to do (somewhere) and the meanings can be twisted as much as you like to munchkin your way around it. (A common law contract can have implied meanings/contextual definitions - ie if I was contracted to cut your lawn I can't just instruct it to stop acting, but that could work with a geas.)
