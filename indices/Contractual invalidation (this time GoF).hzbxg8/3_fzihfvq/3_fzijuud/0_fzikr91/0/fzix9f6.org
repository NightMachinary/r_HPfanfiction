  In other words, it's a geas, not a legal document.

  the lack of discussion about the meaning of "participate" annoys me a little. Why can't Harry just show up to the challenge and forfeit? Or whatever the minimum is.

Geases usually take the end result into account. If you forfeit, then you aren't competing. If you're going to lose, you have to come by your loss honestly.
