Fleur tried her best and was unable to continue. She didn't intend to forfeit the tournament, she was just unable to progress. She came by her loss honestly. Same with the other competitors.

Harry couldn't forfeit because he's 'not qualified,' he'd have to at least give it a try. Furthermore, you think the other schools would be cool with intentionally giving Harry an easier time?
