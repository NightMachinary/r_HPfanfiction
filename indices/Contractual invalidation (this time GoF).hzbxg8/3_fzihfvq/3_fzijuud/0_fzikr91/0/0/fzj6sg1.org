Except in the second task, Fleur forfeits due to being attacked by Grindylows. In the third, it's stated that they can forfeit by sending up red sparks if they are hurt or can't get past an obstacle. So why not have Harry enter each task, and forfeit because he's not qualified to get past the obstacles in his way? Alternatively, in the first task each Champion has to go against a different dragon, and each dragon is a different level of dangerous. So make Harry's tasks less dangerous than the others, then have him forfeit during the third task at the first sign of danger.
