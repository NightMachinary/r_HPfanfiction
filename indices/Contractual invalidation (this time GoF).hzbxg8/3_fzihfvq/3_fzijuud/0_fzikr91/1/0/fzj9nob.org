Geases never care if the target is willing in classical mythology - some fae just says "you may never eat dog meat, but so long as you don't you get the strength of ten men." And that's now the rules for you.

There is consideration (the legal concept) - the geas has to give you something good (in Harry's case the right to participate) - but there isn't offer and acceptance.

I would love to see a fanfic really explore this, though. I may need to write it myself to make it happen.
