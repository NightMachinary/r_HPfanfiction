I think the books are missing a definition of "magical contract", at any rate. The penalty of a breach is never stated either.

At the risk of playing semantics: It's possible enough that it's a legal matter, not a magical one, and the "magical" adjective refers to the fact that it's a contract /about/ magic, not one enforced by it. In that case, all that "bound to compete" means is that he'd be breaking the rules of the TriWiz-Tournament.

Of course, all of this makes the plot hole only bigger, but it's not as if it wasn't there to begin with, so eh.
