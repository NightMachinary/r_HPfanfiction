... That is precisely why it's a plothole. It doesn't appear /there/.

But we know contracts can be broken generally. Marietta does it, for instance. The penalty is the sneak pimples. Even an Unbreakable Vow can be broken -- it's just that the penalty is death.

So if this thing is harmless (or even legal consequences only) in its penalty like the DA contract, the question is why breaking it never comes up, but if on the other hand it's more like the Unbreakable Vow, the question is why it's so easy for a third party to arrange such a binding contract.

Also, my point is not to come up with speculative answers to this question. Filling in plotholes (almost) always works, the point is that this question is there in the first place.
