I define "plot hole" as something that is past an arbitrary line on a scale of "making sense using in-story logic".

In this particular case, if we are told "Harry is bound to compete", but have otherwise been told and shown you can break contracts, /and/ assume that neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor the rest of the candidates actually want Harry to compete, then there is a deficit in the motivation: Why is he not just breaking the contract?

The less the consequences, the more it doesn't make sense that he competes. But on the other hand, the bigger the consequences, the bigger the issue for the general world-building if some third party can enter a contract for you without your knowledge.

The easiest way to fix this would be to get rid of the idea that Harry doesn't want to compete, by the way. If he was happy enough to be entered into the tournament, it wouldn't matter how binding "binding" was.
