My favorite CedCanon is that he's the result of an affair between his mom (Lydia in Harry Diggory, so that's what I call her in my head) and Sirius. His dad is kind of a schlubby twit and Cedric seems smart and attractive, and I know it's fanon but I like the idea of Sirius banging everyone he could. I guess I also just kind of find cuckoldry interesting.

As evidence that Amos Diggory is a first-class moron:

  “You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of [Winky]. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.

  “Hey --- that's mine!” he said. Everyone in the clearing looked at him.

  “Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.

  “That's my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”

  “You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. “Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?”

I wanted him to be a main character for an idea I had a while ago so I collected everything we know about him in canon, and there's this, and there's him being a douche to Harry about Cedric beating him at Quidditch and ignoring Cedric's explanation about the Dementors, and then there's his being somewhat gracious after Cedric dies but not publicly supporting Harry in any way against Fudge.
