If you're into crossovers I suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11230962/1/Son-of-the-archer][Son of the archer]] by Melancholy's Sunshine. This series is a HP and MCU crossover, but the story focuses on the two most underrated characters in their respective franchises. The fic really gives Ron and Clint more character development. linkffn(11230962) Status: Complete
