linkffn(Australia by MsBinns) - post war canon compliant romance/angst between Ron and Hermione told from Ron's perspective as they travel to Australia to fetch Hermione's parents. Not everyone's cup of tea but its fairly well written and the travelling the world aspect is fun. Also contains one of my favourite OCs in fanfiction.
