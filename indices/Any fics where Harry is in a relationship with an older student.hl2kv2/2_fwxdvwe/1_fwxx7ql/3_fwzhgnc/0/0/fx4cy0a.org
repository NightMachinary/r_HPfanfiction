I don't recall what exactly Ron did, other than getting into a fist fight with Harry because he(Harry) was being a moody stressed out desperate teenager and Ron was also being a moody teenager, from there Hermione accidently(she cast a banishing spell but was too nervous/inexperienced it broke the wand on the wall) broke Harry's wand and he basically cut off all ties with them.

Then Katie also acted like a stupid teenager and Harry basically abandoned Gryffindor as a whole for a time.

As for Dumbledore? I don't remember him being evil just so controlling that Harry went out of his way to avoid him(Chamber of Secrets, Fleur,etc...), Harry also ascribed all kinds of motivations on Dumbledore that ended up just being ineptitude, ignorance and neglect instead of any evil, manipulative reasons. Dumbledore did think Harry had to die because of the scarcrux though, but he was open for alternatives.

Most of the fic Harry only trusts three people at all, Salazar's Portrait, Fleur and IIRC Sirius.

I know the fic is tropey and sometimes too dramatic, but I like the detail, some interactions, the ritualistic magic, how they characterized Fleur and Harry(most of it), how Harry solved the scarcrux problem, I didn't like that Harry was too edgy at times(I do not forgive, I do not forget) but that was basically explained by him being an actual edgy teenager, he did get better.
