For smut Ao3 but for good HP stories I go to ffn. AO3 system for subscribing is better than FFN and I also like the warnings on the side. What I also like in theory about A03 is that is makes it easier to find similar stories through the tags and the bookmarks of other people. But some people tag really weird and have about 60 tags to a 10 word summary... Also sometimes tags are just are like maybe I will do this, I don't know yet
