I prefer AO3 by a mile. I hopped straight from LJ to AO3 and never used FFN to any significant degree, so I find its search function hopelessly inadequate in comparison to AO3's tags and have a really hard time finding interesting stories there. I also prefer the design and ease of uploading at AO3.

A lot of people complain about over-tagging on AO3, but it doesn't bother me much. I just scroll past if the tag list gets too long. My only major annoyance with AO3 is that I wish there was a way to mark primary vs secondary characters and ships, since there are a few ships I like that appear commonly as background pairings for other ships and it can be annoying having to filter out those to find stories that are actually about the ship I'm looking for. However, the new otp:true filter has made that much easier.
