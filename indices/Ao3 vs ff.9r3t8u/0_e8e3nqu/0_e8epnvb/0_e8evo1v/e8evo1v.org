It's actually quite simple, but there are many authors who abuse the system to get more exposure by spamming tags, especially characters and relationships. You have plenty of stories tagged with "Harry/background character" when they have one offscreen kiss or are referenced once in chapter 35.

When I exclude stories with Snape on FFN, that removes those where he is an important character. When I exclude him on AO3, that blocks every story which includes a potion class. The other issue comes from multiple relationships. When you exclude "Draco Malfoy/ Hermione Granger" and "Hermione Granger/Severus Snape", that does not block "Draco Malfoy/Severus Snape/Hermione Granger" for some reason.
