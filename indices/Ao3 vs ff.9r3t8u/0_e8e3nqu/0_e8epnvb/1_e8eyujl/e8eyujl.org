Well I mainly use it to find specific tropes that I am interested in. I was bewildered at first too but when you get used to it, it's actually super helpful.

*How to filter:*

I'll google or type into the search bar "Harry Potter", which will make stories that have "Harry Potter" in their *title* turn up. Obviously I'm not looking for stories named "Harry Potter", but this is a quick way for me to access the "Harry Potter" *fandom tag* that shows up under the title of the story. I click on that and the site transports me to a page filled with stories with "Harry Potter" as the fandom, sorted by *date updated*. On the side there is a box with *filters*. I usually go sort by kudos, and add whichever relationships and tags I am looking for, eg. Harry Potter/Tom Riddle under relationships and BAMF!Harry under additional tags.

*How to read tags:*

The title and author show up first.

Under that is the fandom. There may be multiple

Then, in *bold,* warnings. In *grey highlight,* pairings. In regular text, additional tags. Usually tropes. Some authors will put silly tags that aren't meant to help people find this story but to explain other tags or make small comments. All tags are also links that can help find other fics with the same tags.

Then the summary, and under that, story stats (length, kudos, hits, comments, etc)

Hope this helps!
