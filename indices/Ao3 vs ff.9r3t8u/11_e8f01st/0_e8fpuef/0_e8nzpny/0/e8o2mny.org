On the kindle it leaves a massive margin on the left and has a weird paragraph structure. I'm still (after several years) undecided as to whether the chapter bookmarks (which epub has but mobi doesn't) is worth the weird formatting.

On the other hand Fanficfare does beautiful epubs so I guess that's okay...
