I use fanficfare too, so yeah, the native AO3 epub format is not an issue for me.

Interestingly, as AO3 does not actively try to hinder downloads, fanficfare is faster by an order of magnitude when downloading from AO3 in comparison with the artificial throttle that is needed to download from ffnet.
