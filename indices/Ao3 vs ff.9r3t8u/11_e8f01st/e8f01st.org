AO3, hands down. Better options for customising my experience, no advertising, epub downloadable by default, no advertising, kudos and comments, no advertising, subscribing and *un*subscribing notification directly from the story page, series support, better editing support for authors.

There's no question, except that there is a lot more (legacy) wordage on ffnet.

And did I mention no advertising?
