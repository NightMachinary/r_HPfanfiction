I prefer ao3 for most of the reasons articulated by callmesalticidae. I'd add that I like how easy ao3 makes it to make tiny edits as opposed to ffn, with all the exporting and whatnot. It's just a few extra steps, but a few I'd rather not have to take them when I realize I forgot an apostrophe.

The quality of feedback that I get on ao3 tends to be better. I've seen great comments on other stories on ffn -- and I've gotten some really helpful comments there as well -- but the vast majority are from people begging for updates, comments that are painfully misspelled/grammatically incorrect to the point that I don't know what they say or, the most common, comments like "loved this chapter!" Those last are nice enough, really, but I tend to have better true critics on ao3 (and, for what it's worth, I don't write slash.)

I do despise the over-tagging on ao3. If there's more than a handful, I usually just scroll on past.
