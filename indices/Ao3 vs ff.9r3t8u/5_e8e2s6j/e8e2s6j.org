Archive of Our Own, hands down:

- Easy to upload or edit stories

- Limited html formatting so you can include links, art, strange fonts, and more.

- I don't tag my stories as extensively as others do, but tags are useful as both an author and a reader, and some people have such a knack for it that they make their tags a delight to read.

- By the fans, for the fans

- I can bookmark stories that aren't on Ao3

- I can set some bookmarks to "private"

- Easy to download stories in multiple formats

- Replies to comments become part of a thread so that you can see the whole conversation

- Ability to sequence stories as part of a series

- The mods are responsive.

Downsides:

- No default way to get rid of tags if you don't like them

- No PMs, just comments on stories
