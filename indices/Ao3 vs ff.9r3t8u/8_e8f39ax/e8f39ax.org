For Harry Potter, easily FF.N. Largely this is just because the beginning of FF.N happened to coincide with the first explosion of Potter fic, and so since more old stories were there, more new stories showed up. Yes, there are a lot of terribly written stories amidst all this, but between favorite lists, filtering, and communities I've never found it difficult to find something good and precisely to my tastes.

Meanwhile AO3-- which I don't dislike--- is going to have a more limited selection, much of it kinky and explicit. Nothing wrong with kinky and explicit per se, but there are very few popular HP couples I actually like, so gen fic is more my speed for this fandom.

And the walls of tags on AO3 are annoying. To be fair, not nearly as annoying as when FF.N refuses to get its house in order upon being infected with malicious code...
