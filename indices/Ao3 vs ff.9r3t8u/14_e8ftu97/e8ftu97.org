I use both, but by and large I tend to stick with FF. I don't care if the fic I'm reading has any graphics or the author wants to use a different font, I'm just there to read. And in theory the tagging on Ao3 should help you find exactly what you are looking for, more often I'm just sorting through exactly what I don't want because people abuse the tagging system. So for me it's just easier to stick to FF where I have the basic tagging that's not as overused.

I've got fics on both, and I will say the upside Ao3 has is the ability to quickly introduce fandoms. After a few episodes of a new show, or a few days post-release of games/movies/books there's already a main tag for it.
