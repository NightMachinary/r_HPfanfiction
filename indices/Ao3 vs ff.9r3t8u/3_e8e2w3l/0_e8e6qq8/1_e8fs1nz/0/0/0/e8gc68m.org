I agree that excluding so many pairings is cumbersome, but it's at least better than FFN which only allows the reader to exclude one pairing at a time and doesn't have any options to exclude slash, multi, harem, gender bender, etc. Seems like we currently have a choice between "it's cumbersome, but you can get the results you want with enough effort" and "getting the results you want is not an option."
