I can definitely see how FFN's tag format would be better suited to people interested a specific pairing.

I sort-of have the opposite problem. I'm looking for fics with a specific character, and on FFN that character tag typically gets used as part of pairings and tropes that I'm not interested in. Also, FFN's search ends up missing a lot of stories where the character isn't even tagged because they are an enemy rather than a love interest. In those cases the more versatile tagging and exclusion options of Ao3 are better suited to my needs.
