I'm not sure that's an accurate representation. If I want a pairing on FFN, I can find it. Because the amount of listable characters is limited, people are forced to put the ones that actually matters in the story. Ao3 allows so many that 95% of people put everyone and every relationship there so I have little clue if the characters or relationships are even relevant to the story.

Like constraints force straightforwardness which helps. My issue with Ao3 isn't so much slash and harems as it is that those stories inevitably list what I'm interested in. But it's most often nested in a story which mostly involves elements I have no interest in but the author had no self control. That's something that never happens to me on FFN. For all its issues, I can usually find the sort of thing I want as far as searching goes.

Lemme give an example. Say I want to read a Harry/Hermione story (my usual). Well ok, I pop that in (just checked on Ao3) and 6 results on the first search page list it as part of a massive character/relationship list. I just find it unhelpful and makes me not want to waste my time checking if that pairing is actually a prominent focus. It's not impossible to find, and I recently got into a number of stories there, but I admit it's excessive freedom of tagging irritates me. :/
