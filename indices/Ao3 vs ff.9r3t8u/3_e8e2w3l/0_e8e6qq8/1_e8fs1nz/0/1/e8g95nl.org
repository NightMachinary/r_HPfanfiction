And then you miss the stories that mention Harry having a nightmare where he thinks about kissing Draco, but is otherwise is a completely non-Harry/Draco story because 90% of the stories are overtagged to hell.

And then you find Harry/Draco stories anyway because the author also tagged it "Harry/Draco/<character>" (whether it's due to an actual threesome or a situation similar to my first paragraph doesn't really matter)

I'll be honest, I LOVE the idea of Ao3 and it's tagging system, but it's users make it an absolute hell to use. My exclude tags shouldn't need 1000 filters just to get to a baseline similar to FFN filtering.
