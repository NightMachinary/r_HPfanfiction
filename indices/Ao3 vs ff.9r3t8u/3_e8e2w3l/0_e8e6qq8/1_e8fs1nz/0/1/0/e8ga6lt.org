  Harry having a nightmare where he thinks about kissing Draco, but is otherwise is a completely non-Harry/Draco story
#+end_quote

Are there any fics in which Harry has smutty dreams about someone and /doesn't/ end up having smutty personal encounters with them later on?

But joking aside, I agree that the freeform tagging system on Ao3 is a nightmare. When I search for fics on there I usually end up excluding 20 or more tags, which tends to be very cumbersome. I wish there were some sort of cabal in charge of approving tags, that way authors wouldn't use them like twitter hashtags.

But I still find Ao3's system more useful than the limited tagging on FFN, which has character tagging but no tagging for common tropes (creature inheritance, vampires, gender-bending, etc.) Those are the kinds of things that I want to exclude from my searches, so when I search FFN I almost always use Scryer instead.
