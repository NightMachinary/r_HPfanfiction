I prefer ffnet despite its flaws. On AO3 it's hardly possible to find a decent fic. I always have the feeling that Malfoy Jr is sneaking up to me trying to stick his non-magical wand into my rear side. He's everywhere, no matter what search pattern you're using. I only go to AO3 if I have a specific story recommendation.
