More or less my view as well. Ao3's biggest issue with the search is its undeniable that most people over tag stories. It leaves utterly ridiculous and unhelpful search results because everyone and their mother are listed and given a relationship. And that's to say nothing of the genre and trope tags...

It's just unnecessary. It would be an easy fix too. Just remove custom tags and replace them with hard coded options, limit the number of listable characters and such, and if more are needed just hide them in a collapseable "Added Details" spoiler.
