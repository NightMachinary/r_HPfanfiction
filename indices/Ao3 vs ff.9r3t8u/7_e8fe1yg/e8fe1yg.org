My personal opinion is that as fanfiction frameworks /both/ FFN and AO3 are equally frustrating to use if for different reasons. What matters most and defines a choice for most ppl is the content which for these sites is way more didferent than their UI intricacies.

Personally, I equally loathe search on both of them. I have written my own layer over FFN's search (because I prefer ffn's /content/ ) that solves all my issues and I am very happy using that and if I never see FFN's search again I would be perfectly happy.
