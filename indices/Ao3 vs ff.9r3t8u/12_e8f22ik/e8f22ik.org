FFN frustrates me what with its tiny staff and thus effectively zero responsiveness from the staff (and the admin, only one guy), is therefore slow to react to serious issues like the current one.

At the same time, FFN is simple in design and in use. No stupid shit. Its search and tagging are more on the barebones side, but I vastly prefer that to AO3's retarded tagging system. You can target a search on FFN. AO3 will always spit out a wall of overtagged mess. FFN has no gimmicks: upload your story, receive feedback. Plus it's the YT of fanfic hosting (yes, I know it's older than YT), it has the advantage of a huge audience.
