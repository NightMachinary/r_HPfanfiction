Back in the day, I posted only on curated archives (Checkmated and Simply Undeniable), so when I started posting again, I didn't quite know where to go. I looked at FFN and was put off by the no explicit content rule, so I went with AO3 which had to such rules. Eventually I also started posting to FFN, but I haven't changed any of my content. If it gets pulled down, then so be it.

I find that posting to AO3 is easier. FFN with having to upload a document and then link that document and then and then and then is just too cumbersome and annoying. Also, FFN removes certain bits of formatting, something I didn't discover until I'd posted my 39-chapter work in its entirety and deleted the associated documents. Yes, I know there aren't any scene separators, but I honestly can't be arsed to reupload all of those documents and make one little change. If it bothers you that much, read it on AO3.
