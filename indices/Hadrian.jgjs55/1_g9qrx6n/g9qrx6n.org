Hadrian is a Roman name like lots of names in canon (Severus, Minerva, Luna etc) and it also ties in with the use of Latin in Harry Potter. Usually when a writer wants to imply an old history of (pureblood) magic or mysterious powers they use Hadrian, the name Harry is just too ordinary. Like there a lots of people named Tom, there are also lots of people named Harry.

To be honest, Harrold sounds like an old man's name to me, not the name of a child but I'm fine it. I think James Evans is a bit on the nose for a pseudonym but there is nothing really abhorrent about it.

Personally I despise when writers give him a name that doesn't start with an "h" (It is kind of quintessential for me even though it is a bit illogical, any other letter and it might as well be just an OC), is just something really obnoxious (I've seen Hyppolyta once in a fem!harry fic and that was her real name) or really American (Someone used Sean once and I laughed out loud and immediately closed the fic)
