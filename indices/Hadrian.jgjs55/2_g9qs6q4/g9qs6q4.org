I use Moon+ Reader Pro on my phone to read fics and it has a Name Replacement feature, so I generally change Harry's name whenever the writer renames him as something too annoying. Except, Hadrians are generally super annoying and keep trying to get everyone to call them Hadrian, so I keep ending up with sentences like, "Harry! My dear boy!" "My name is Lord Harry Et Cetera, Et Cetera, Et Cetera, not Harry, Fumbleboor! I don't have to listen to you!"

Edit: typos.
