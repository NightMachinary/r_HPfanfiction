Hadrian was a very cool alternative for Harry. Like it was stated earlier, people felt Harry was too simple, or common or more of a nickname.

And of the alternatives, when I started reading fanfic, there was Harrison and Harold, both of which kind of paled in comparison with Hadrian.

It's a Roman name, it's the name of an emperor, and it attached a certain level of prestige to the character when they used it. Plus it has the added advantage of being old, as in not an old man name, but an old name which purebloods are likely to use.

However like the general trope, it has been overused and now it's kind of lame, but I'm pretty sure it's attractive for people who are just getting into fanfic now.

At this point I'm not in favour of name changes in general but few authors agree with me so I just ignore it and go. However if I read a fic where he has more than 4 names, I drop it.
