I don't get the dislike of ordinary common name.

As if a name means anything when it comes to a person.

Some extremely obscure authors wrote a thing about it in a play that absolutely no one had ever read, seen or even heard about. And absolutely no stories had been inspired by said play.

So, I guess I'm not that surprised that people didn't learn that a name is just a name and that....hm say a rose would smell as sweet by any other name. (Rose is an example taken totally and completely randomly, of course).
