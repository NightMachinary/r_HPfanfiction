Nothing wrong in that at all. In my own fic I've just left his name as Harry.

The people who opt for Hadrian etc etc. generally also use names like Nightshade, Drake or use Greek words that mean light, justice, darkness, death etc for weapons.

Nothing wrong in either. It's just preferences of the author, which is cool, cause again, fanfic.
