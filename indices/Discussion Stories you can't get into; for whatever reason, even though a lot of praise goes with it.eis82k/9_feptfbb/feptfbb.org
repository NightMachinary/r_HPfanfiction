Covered Spoilers are minor, Explained in the first few chapters, typical bashing tropes or self explanatory!!! But are covered in case its on someones TBR.

Three to a backstep. I even read 50 out of the 55 chapters but when they got to the point of fixing the ministry after defeating Voldemort I just dropped it. I disliked how Daphne told them about her rape. ESPECIALLY just right after it happened. I liked that she told them, just not how it was done. I was sexually molested (though not to the point of rape and then getting f*cking murdered) and wouldn't let anyone touch me for days afterward. And though every experience is different it seemed a bit unrealistic (and yes I recognize that its fiction) I know the author tried and handled it really well most of the way it was just the beginning that ticked me off. The Soulbonds were alright but I wasnt a fan of the stages and how they were developed and the bashing was repetitive. The angels showing up at random intervals kinda felt like mediocre character development, poor plotting, and a way to further the plot without having to deal with the fallout from the parents (speaking of! How the parents were suddenly ok with it after they showed up was not my favorite. them getting to trust harry should have been a big thig but they handed over their daughters like useless paper. Sirius being a lord and all political was actually kinda good (i mean he /is/ a Black) and i loved amelia bones and augusta longbottom for the most part. What killed it was the boring day to day school that felt repetitive and way too detailed. It mostly served to create more bashing and fill up a word count. Snape was okay-ly done in this but luna was well handled. The fact that even after the staff was flushed from potions and still sided with ol' Dumbles the majority of the time irked me (looking at you Minnie) and that McGonnagal didnt tell harry about the potions even after he inadvertently helped her discover such, made me want to pull my hair out. Harry being good at some things that he had no explanation for being good at killed me. I did enjoy the Hermione/Daphne aspects of the story and probably would have enjoyed the entire thing more If harry had been left out or replaced with neville. Though I did know the pairing going in and have read some good fic with said pairing, the characters were very OOC at times and them having sex was mentioned so much to the point feeling like wish fulfillment and making me frustrated (said sex is not graphic but it seemed to be mentioned a lot for a story not focused primarily on said aspect. the characters dont seem like they would do it so often (in canon or this fic) but they were altered in a weird way so it would fit.) There are many more issues and good points and while I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this story, I remains one of my least favorites and will likely never be finished by me. (even if its only 5 chapters to complete it)
