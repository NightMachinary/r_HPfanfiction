  cringe-worthy grandstanding (which is just as bad when Harry does it)

That's actually the only reason I wouldn't describe this fic as a Hermione-wank: It's a pervasive problem of poor characterization and badly written dialogue throughout the first 27 chapters (which is as far as I managed to read before giving up). That same one-sided grandstanding pops up in any scene where the author tried to make one character look cool in comparison to another, and the author does it with plenty of other characters besides just Hermione and Harry.

On the topic of the potions: that's one of the primary elements of world-building in the fic that struck me as completely absurd. It just doesn't jive with the cultural setting of the wizarding world that they would use potions to program all of their kids with knowledge Matrix-style.
