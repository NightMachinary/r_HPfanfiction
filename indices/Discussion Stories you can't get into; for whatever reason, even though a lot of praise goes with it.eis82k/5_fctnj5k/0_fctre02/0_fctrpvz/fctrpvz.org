*Hermione wank*

  "Granger!" he bellowed as soon as he was through the passageway. "Gryffindors are supposed to stick together! What the hell do you mean by calling me a 'braying ass' in front of the whole class? And in Snivellus's class at that!"

  "Oh, I'm sorry, Potter," she said sweetly. "I'm only a humble Muggleborn still in awe of the wonders of the magical world. And when I see a braying ass magically disguised as a Hogwarts student, I CAN'T HELP POINTING IT OUT!"

  "Why you little...! What were you so upset about anyway?! It's just house points! Nobody here cares about that except Little Miss Know-It-All!"

  Hermione's eyes flashed dangerously, and she whipped out her wand. Startled, Jim fumbled for his own, but Hermione simply turned and walked to the stairs leading up to the dorms. There, she pointed her wand up each staircase and, to everyone's astonishment, shot off a series of loud popping fireworks before yelling "ALL PREFECTS TO THE COMMON ROOM FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING!"

  Three hours and ten minutes later...

  Harry stared slack-jawed at Hermione as Neville finished his tale. No wonder Jim had seemed so subdued as he left the Headmaster's office. "I hope you won't think it forward of me, Hermione, but will you marry me?"

  "Back off, Potter," said Neville with mock gruffness. "I saw her first."

Aside from that sort of cringe-worthy grandstanding (which is just as bad when Harry does it), there is a general "division of labour" wherein Hermione is the "magic one" and Harry is the "law, politics and leadership one".

I'm interested in reading about a magically talented Harry who can do things for himself, not one whose expertise is essentially outsourcing.

*Muggle wank*

  Any potions other than the ones for literacy and numeracy had to be purchased privately and at significant cost. There were lots of options for language potions, but only a few for natural sciences. The most popular one, designed for people who wanted to pursue studies in alchemy, gave the drinker a complete understanding of the field of Muggle chemistry ... as it was understood in 1893. The physics potion was so out of date that it was actually counterproductive, leading the unwary drinker to think that fires were caused by burning phlogiston and that vacuums were actually full of ether.

For the avoidance of doubt, this falls into Muggle wank because:

1. It states that Muggle scientific knowledge (rather than magical knowledge) is useful/necessary for success in a magical field of study.

2. It implies that Muggles have a better understanding of an area of magic than wizards do.

Where the area of magic in question is alchemy.
