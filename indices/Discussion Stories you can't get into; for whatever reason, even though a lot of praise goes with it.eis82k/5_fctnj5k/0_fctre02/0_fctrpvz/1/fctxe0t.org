Man, you must really, /really/, hate the The Arithmancer series.

Of all the things to dislike about PoS, I would never have picked those. Admittedly, the opening 10 or so chapters are the weakest. It's only better from there, 2nd year especially picks up.

The Hermione bit I understand, it always felt out of place, compared to the character she becomes.

However, If I squint, I still can't see the Muggle Wank. It has been a while since I read that passage, so I may be wrong. All it is, is a potion that grants the taker knowledge. It only requires modernising. That is, from 1893 content. to 1991? That doesn't feel like Muggle Wank to me.

If you were going to pick a scene that fit your criteria. I would have chosen Andromeda, and her mental health issues
