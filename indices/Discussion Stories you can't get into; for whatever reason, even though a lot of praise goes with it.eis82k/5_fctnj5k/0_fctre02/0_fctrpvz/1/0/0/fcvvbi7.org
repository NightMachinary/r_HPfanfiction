That is essentially what is happening in PoS. Not even close to the same level of in depth use, but, similar concepts. Lily dose something interesting with Transfiguration and Chemistry. Still it's funny, you can't read PoS for Hermione wank. I can't read the Arithmancer for the same reason.

Opposite sides of the fence. But I guess that's the point of this thread.
