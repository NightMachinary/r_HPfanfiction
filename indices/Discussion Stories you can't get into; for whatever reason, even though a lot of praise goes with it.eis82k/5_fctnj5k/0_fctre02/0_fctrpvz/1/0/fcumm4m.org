I like the Arithmancer because it's not /muggle/ wank, it's /maths/ wank. The person who wrote it and its sequels knew what they were talking about, and it shows. Even though I personally didn't understand many of the esotheric mathematical concepts like fractals (at least not in a mathematical sense, I do know what a fractal is) and such, I still loved it because I could google it and the concept would make sense for what it's used for in the story.

The second part of this is how it's used in the story - Hermione doesn't use a laptop and a cellphone and shout about how great muggle tech is, she uses some aspects of mathematics which were discovered by muggles (but not unknown to wizards) to do something interesting.
