I had the same doubts with 'Easier than falling asleep' but the lack of horcruxes/story is what drew me in. I was just really curious about what was going to happen. The Harry in this fic is very different from a lot of the other ones I read and Sirius and his relationship with Harry is also somewhat unique. I think this is one you read for the character dynamics. There is an interesting plot line with Voldemort outside the horcruxes but that comes later.

There are also some beautiful lines in here. I definitely need to go back and see if something else inspired them, but there are times I have to stop and sit on a line.
