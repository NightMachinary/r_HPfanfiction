HPMoR and Harry Crow - I'm sure I don't need to explain them.

Easier than falling asleep by JacobApples - chapter 1 has a lot copy-pasted from books 4 and 7, and it just highlights how much better the canon writing is. In addition to that, with all horcruxes destroyed in chapter 1, I don't understand how there's going to be an interesting story with what's left.

Magicks of the arcane by Eilyfe - it felt like wish fulfilment, which doesn't at all interest me.

Divided and Entwined by Starfox5 - this is different because I actually loved the story at first, and couldn't put it down for 20-30 chapters, but it just started feeling like a slog and I ended up giving up at about chapter 35. It's well written and interesting, but I think the story would have been more effective if it were slightly shorter. I know Starfox is active on this subreddit, so if you read this, I have nothing against your writing, I just couldn't finish this one.
