HPMoR is a big one for me too. I loved it at first, and it was actually what first drew me into reading fanfiction, but the tone and nature of the story gradually changed to the point where I felt like I'd been bait-and-switched: It starts out a humorous exploration of magic from a scientific mindset, then increasingly tosses that aside, swapping humor out for darkness and the exploration of magic for politics and intrigue.

To some degree, I almost wish the author had abandoned it a few chapters in rather than add such a disappointing turn.
