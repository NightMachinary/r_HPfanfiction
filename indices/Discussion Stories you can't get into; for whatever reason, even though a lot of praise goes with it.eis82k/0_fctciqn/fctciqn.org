This might be beating a dead horse by now but, A Black Comedy and Wastelands of Time are two that have never grabbed me.

I'd actually be intrigued to see how they were received immediately after release as they're two that I've always perceived as maybe /gaining/ a huge following rather than locking one down right away.

As to why they're not my thing, I guess I'm not generally a fan of adult-in-a-kid's-body stories - at least ones that go in to romance or hint at it - it gets into squicky territory for me easily. About the only one I've read and enjoyed is Hermione time travel fic Six Pomegranate Seeds which I was recommended on here recently. & additionally, while otherwise well-written... both of those fics time to time come across like the author has never envisaged a woman in their lives as a human person, which throws me straight out of the -verse the story's taking place in. Things that could maybe be fixed by a beta!
