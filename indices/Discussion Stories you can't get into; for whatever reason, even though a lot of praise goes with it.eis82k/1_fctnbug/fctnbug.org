The Firebird trilogy. I see it recommended here quite a few times, and tried getting into it twice. Never make it passed the first few chapters. I usually love AUs and heavily prefer them over canon-compliant worlds and stories but this one just feels so... I dont know, off. I just dont enjoy reading it at all.
