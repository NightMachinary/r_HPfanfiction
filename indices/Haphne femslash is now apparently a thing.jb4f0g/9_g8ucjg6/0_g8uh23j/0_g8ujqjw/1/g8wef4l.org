  Like, I know what heteronormative means, I just don't know why it's a tag you need
#+end_quote

lol yeah i think i should thin out the tags.

i added it because the initial chapters are about Iris dealing with assuming she's into boys exclusively. but tbh given how those span only like 6k words i should probably remove it.

  Heteronormativity seems pretty pervasive unless you're into some serious AU shit.
#+end_quote

in this AU I figure the wizarding world is a lot less bothered by gay stuff than the muggle world - but Iris has been socialized in a primarily muggle context and will impart those conditions onto the wizarding world.

i think the wizarding world's attitudes would be more akin to an evolved form of the classical world's attitudes towards homosexuality. and presumably organized religion has never played a factor in the history of the wizarding world, which i think would change the attitudes towards homosexuality too.

  potential irony
#+end_quote

i hope it wasnt too ironic. i try to mix it with some genuine metamodernist attitudes. i'm not really sure what the result is at this point tbh lol.
