Oh, right, oops. I guess it's just because Iris never even considered the thought of being into girls until it was told to her. That's heteronormativity, just assuming one is straight with no thought to any other sexuality.

And yeah, it's a cute fic. Read a few chapters of it already. The author kind of captures Rowling's charm sometimes. I think it's kind of an unironic but also ironic mockery of Slytherin/Daphne tropes.
