  I think it's kind of an unironic but also ironic mockery of Slytherin/Daphne tropes.
#+end_quote

i sort of wanted to take everything at its surface / logical extreme.

like in the later chapters I'll have Daphne reveal herself as the literal ice queen. (think elsa).

draft:

#+begin_quote
  “I have a --- well --- a condition,” Daphne said. “A chronic illness.”

  “Noooo,” Iris moaned. [she is drunk]

  Daphne smiled. “Iris, relax, I'm not dying. Anyway, I have a --- problem --- with snow.”

  Green eyes peered incessantly at her.

  “And with ice. It's not a secret, really, but it's very limiting.”

  “Are you a snow werewolf?” Iris asked earnestly

  “What?” Daphne laughed. “A snow werewolf! Do you mean a yeti, Iris? No, I'm not a yeti, what gave you that harebrained idea?”

  “My father had a friend who had a little problem,” Iris said. “He was a werewolf.”

  Daphne laughed. “A /little/ problem? Iris, that is a bit of an understatement. Well, yes, I suppose we can say I have a little problem. It's why I can't drink firewhiskey, or why my hands are always so cold --- it's why ice magic comes so --- naturally --- to me. It's part blood malediction, and --- well --- part some greengrass ancestor introducing ...” Daphne stilled off.

  “Well, I don't --- I'm not used to revealing this part,” Daphne sighed. “We had an ancestor who was an arctic explorer, and --- I suppose you know the extinct Snow fay? Father thinks... that... well, they... copulated ---”

  “They fucked a snow elf!?”

  “Iris.”

  “Sorry, sorry. So what else does that mean, other than you being all --- cold and stuff?” Iris said, waving a hand of her daphne's ... stuff... body.... (Boobs, Iris' drunk brain supplied unhelpfully.)

  Daphne smiled grimly. “You don't think it makes me disgusting, not being quite fully human?”

  Iris scrunched up her face. “What? Why would you say such a thing about yourself? You're not disgusting, Daphne, you're... opposite.. gusting.”

  “I am so charmed, Iris. Your words - they go straight to my heart. They speak to me.”

  Iris rolled her eyes. “You know what I mean. Don't give me that pureblood supreme nonsense. You're great. Definitely not gusting.”

  “It's not pureblood supremacy, Iris, it's --- more comparable to anti-werewolf bigotry. And it's not like I agree with it, but I do keep the arctic ancestor part hidden, very few people know it.”

  “No secret werewolf bigotry is allowed in this shack!” Iris declared.

  “Indeed, Iris?” Daphne said, quite confused. “Anyway, as for your original question... well, I could fill two scrolls. I need to be careful when drinking, in case I turn the liquid in question to ice. I was at a soiree when I was younger, got passed a crystal glass and - the champagne turned to ice. Most of society believes it to be a blood curse, so it wasn't embarrassing, but still, I was about to enjoy my first glass of alcohol.”

  “What do the other purebloods think of it, exactly?”

  “Well, they think I'm some kind of great sorceress in training.”

  “Because you turn your champagne to ice?”

  “I hate hot showers, which often causes great disparities with my roommate Pansy Parkinson, for her showers are practically scaldingly warm. It's disgusting.”

  “That's the spirit!” Iris said. “It's Pansy Parkinson that's disgusting!”

  Daphne smiled.

  “Oh --- I love ice cream. Vanilla, all of it. We have lots of magical ice cream in the manor. I'd love to show you one day --- assuming we don't split as acquaintances due to some great upcoming argument,” Daphne said, and took a drink.

  “I'd like that, too. I mean, to show you my godparents' house --- not the argument,” Iris said with eloquence.

  Daphne grinned.

  “Oh, and I can do this.”

  Daphne opened her palm; and a beautiful crystalline flower of ice was growing out of it.

  “Woah,” Iris said, impressed.

  The flower continued to grow, but then Daphne closed her palm.

  “Can I touch your flower?”

  Daphne blushed immoderately, but Iris did not catch her own innuendo, for she was too wasted.

  A few seconds later, she opened her palm again. The flower had turned into a tiny sparrow of ice, which sang a few notes and took flight around the ceiling of the shack.

  “What!” Iris laughed “That's amazing!”

  “You know, fire magics come naturally to me. Maybe we're like yin and yang. Or maybe I'm going to melt you down and kill you,” Iris said philosophically.

  “How horrid,” Daphne whispered. “I don't think you would be able to, you know,” she said, moving closer.

  “Be able to what?”

  “Melt me,” Daphne said softly, closer still.

  Iris rolled over laughing. “Melt me!”

  “What?” Daphne said.

  “You're so corny! Is your life a movie!?”

  “A moo-way?”

  “Oh, it's a muggle thing --- Wait, you bitch, you know what a movie is! You can't listen to Tupac and not know what a movie is! I'll kill you.”
