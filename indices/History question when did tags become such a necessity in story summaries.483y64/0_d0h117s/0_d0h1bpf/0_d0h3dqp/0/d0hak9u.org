I'm glad that ff.net only allows four characters to be tagged. There's a lot of stories on AO3 that have like half the characters listed even though they play some tiny little part in the fic. The summary tags that people use, especially on FF.net are quite useful, often more than the summary itself.

Random side note, how do you set a pairing to be a pairing on FF.net when you're writing a fic? I can tag the characters, I just don't know how to denote them as a couple.
