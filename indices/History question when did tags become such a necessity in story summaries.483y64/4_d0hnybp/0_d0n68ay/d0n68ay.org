It's the author that sometimes use excessive tags. Sometimes search page entries have one line summary and then ten lines of tags.

A more better solution is allow authors to add atmost 5 tags or something like that. So they don't push their fics in other search criterion. eg. if it's Harry!Multi, you don't have to add another 11 tags listing every single character Harry bones.
