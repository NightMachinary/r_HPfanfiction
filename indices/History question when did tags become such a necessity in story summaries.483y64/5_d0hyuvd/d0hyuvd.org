Hmm, on sites that do allow actually tagging the tags can be useful for determining if the story might be something you will want to read, assuming that the stories actually are tagged properly. But it is not a necessity of any sort, really, it's just convenient /if/ it works the way it should.

For sites that do not have anything of this sort, however, in most cases the tags are simply inelegantly-looking clutter.

And, as controversial as that may make me sound, the overuse of tags is something we got because a part of the society is ... well, deteriorating mentally, and at a higher rate than we'd expect them to; it's as if the part of their brains responsible for common sense was replaced by a gismo that goes “oh, have to tag it, otherwise you'll die” at every single thing.
