The exclamation point thing was definitely around in the early 2000s. I started reading fanfic 2001 or so, and while my memory of the Fanon culture is a little hazy for the first year or so, I'm pretty sure adjective!character was well established (though less universal) by 2003 at least. It seemed to come from the LJ community, and was pretty popular with the Draco slash crowd. Leatherpants!Draco was a popular description for Cassandra Claire's stuff, as well as the horde of imitators.

What /does/ seem to be new is the use of run together ship names (Drarry, Jilly, etc). Back then it would just be H/D, H/H, H/R, etc, with some other rather stupid names for ships, like H/Hr was "Pumpkin Pie" (Harmony is much more recent) and R/H was "The Good Ship" (though of course H/H folks didn't call it that). "Snarry" is an old term, though.
