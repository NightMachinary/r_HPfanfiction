Depends on the story/author. There's three tiers. If I trudged through your fic just to finish what's there of it, I'll probably never return to it. But if the story was memorable: I'll read the next update for it (though if it's been so long I can't remember what's going on, I won't continue following updates. Caveat is if you keep updating and I "rediscover" the fic later, which has happened to me a bunch of times). The last tier is for the author/stories was I /love./ One of my favorite authors has a story she hasn't updated since 2013, and she's recently said that while the fic isn't her first priority she promises to update eventually, and I'm still totally eagerly awaiting the next chapter.

TL;DR: if your story's top notch, take as long as you need
