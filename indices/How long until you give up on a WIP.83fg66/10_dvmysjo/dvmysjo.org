I honestly aim to read stories that are either complete or abandoned. I rarely read WIP. I realize that is not what authors want to hear, but it's the honest truth.

When I read something, I read the whole story in one go. And then I start the next. As long as I am aware that a story is abandoned before I start it, having that expectation in mind, I will read them.

Stories that have been updated within 6 months are bookmarked. If they pass the 6 month mark, then I may consider reading them. Stories that are updated after I read them are tagged. It might be a year or more before I return to them, because if I read an update, it's because I'm rereading the entire story.

(Edit) I will however follow a really good story indefinitely. If an author has a habit of long gaps between updates, it can be worth it to keep an eye out. I don't believe I've ever unfollowed a story.
