Depends on how often was it updated before.

But usually, I consider everything that has more than six-month break "hiatus", and one year "dead" unless author states otherwise.

Still, I never remove such fics from "follows". Why would I? They may get an update after all. Just recently Toaru fic that I've read years ago updated and finished.
