It completely depends on the author's update schedule. I follow a few stories that only update every few months, so when they haven't updated in a while, I know it's not that unusual. But if the story is updated regularly, and there's a couple month long wait for a new chapter, then I'll give up hope.

I don't think I've ever actually unfollowed or unsubscribed to a story that I was interested in however.
