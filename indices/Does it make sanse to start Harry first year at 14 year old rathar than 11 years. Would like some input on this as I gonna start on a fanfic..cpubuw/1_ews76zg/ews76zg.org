I don't usually like it when fanfics change Hogwarts' starting age. It just feels wrong to me.

Honestly, 11 or 14 wouldn't really make much of a difference in his politicking ability anyway. Sure, in early modern history - when the wizarding world seems to diverge from the muggle world - you could get emancipated and become a ruler at 15, but those kids were trained to become rulers from a very young age.

The only way you could really make Harry a convincing politician at ~15 is to have him grow up as the heir of a pureblood family and start learning politics at about 7 years old and be uncommonly talented at it.
