According to Rowling in PoA (and who knows wether she has thought about it or not), the moon has to be visible. When the gang comes out of the Whomping Willow on their way to the castle Remus only starts to transform when the moon becomes visible behind the clouds.

Now I bet that's a mistake on Rowling's part, because a logical conclusion would then be that anyone infected with lycantrophy can just stay indoors with the curtains shut and that would be the end of it.
