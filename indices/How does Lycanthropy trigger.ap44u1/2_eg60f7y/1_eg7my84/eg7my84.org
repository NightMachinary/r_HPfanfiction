There was a similar scene in Teen Wolf. Werewolfs were confined to a closed space for several months, so they couldn't see the moon. It resulted in them going feral.

Of course werewolfs over there are different to HP, but I think a similar idea could apply here. They would, for example, get sick if they haven't shifted in more than a month.
