With the timezones, if you could start traveling in the evening just before sunset, travel west so that you'll end up back where you started 12 hours later after circumnavigating the earth once, you would be skipping the night.

This strategy would require the Werewolves to travel at mach 2.6 for 12 hours every full moon night. This is possible with muggle technology (just barely in the capabilities of the SR-71 blackbird spy plane) so it should be possible with magic too. Just enchant a bus to fly like Arthur Weasleys car, but faster.

Or you could portkey to America, then Asia and back. Would work too.

Personally I really like the idea of a magic hypersonic flying bus that takes all the Werewolves around the world each full moon. Imagine meeting someone in a bar, asking them about their job, and they answer "oh, it's pretty simple, I just fly a bunch of werewolves around the world in a hypersonic flying bus once every month during the full moon".
