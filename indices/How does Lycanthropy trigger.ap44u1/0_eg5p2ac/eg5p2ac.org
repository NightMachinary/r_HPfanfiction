The headcanon I've used in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/ (which has its own "solving Lycanthropy" sequence) is that it's triggered by the full moon, but only after the sun has set --- whether moonlight is touching you or not (if that were so you could just lock yourself in an opaque room for the night and be done with it). Time travel would work, except it doesn't, because Time-Turners only take you to the past, not the future. Switching timezones /might/ work, but it'd be a pretty hectic life, if I've got my numbers right.
