Rowling did it both ways because, children's books with more symbolism than semantics. Lycanthropy was supposed to symbolize HIV.

​

Remus transforms after the moon comes out from the clouds. "A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight."

​

But, they also say that he used to be taken to the Shack to transform back when he was a student, why would he transform in there? I'm assuming Dumbledore didn't lead an already transformed puppy wolf Lupin to the shack at night on a leash.

​

So, room for interpretation on whether you need to see the moon or not. It was also said that Lupin always looked sick in the days leading up to the full moon, assuming he didn't gaze on the partial moon on those days either, it meant that the waxing of the moon had an effect on him through stone walls.

​

Timezone change might work, but for it to be meaningful, rather than racing the moon, gotta jump to the other side of the planet and back twice a day, I'd assume.

​

Not sure about the pole thing. Don't they have a moon there? I don't have time to read up on this atm, but here's something I found that might help?
