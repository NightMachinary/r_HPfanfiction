Fun fact. Canonically the only one who calls himself Lord is the /self-styled/ Lord Voldemort.

All the rest are at best Head of Their Families.

I don't recall anyone in book or movie to have claimed peerage of any kind except Tom Riddle, and it was more in the sense of being a Dark Lord, than having a title.

My theory is that this comes from Naruto's fanfiction where canon translation translates the Head of a clan as Lord(or anyone with the honorific -sama), it came from there.
