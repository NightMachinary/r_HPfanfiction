If it's not tagged as canon, and is tagged as characters are ooc, then it's fine. In my opinion I think for most readers, if it looks Like Harry Potter, and is named Harry Potter then that's enough for it to be considered Harry Potter in fanfiction. If that author made money from their fic, I can guarantee JK would sue them, and their defense couldn't be "Well your honor it may look like Harry and be named Harry, but it doesn't act like Harry, therefore it's not Harry."
