So they take their titles from the Muggle World, use it in the Wizarding World, but deny the connection to the Muggle one? I can definitely see purebloods doing that.

I don't recall the convention but canonically it's Most Ancient and Noble House of Black and in Harry's case it's the Noble House of Potter, so I guess you get points and different moniker for how old you can trace the lineage.

That Sacred 28 stuff while canon is complete nonsense made by a bigoted guy whose criteria is "Who doesn't like Muggles" with a bit of "Who I don't want to piss off", so that means any serious consideration would ignore it.

Peerage in the UK has gone through a /lot/ of changes in the last centuries, most of the hereditary titles have lost any real power and their seats are democratic now AFAIK. And the title of Lord can be used in a myriad of ways, normally it includes Earl, Baron and I think Viscount, anything higher is Count and then a Duke(that IIRC must belong to the Royal Family). You can buy some of those old titles from families though, for a large fee I think, but it won't give you any real power unless you bough land with it. I also don't think with today's society it would be a good idea go around demanding to be referred to as aristocracy.

Sorry, rant over, did some research about peerage and inheritance for a fic and fell into a rabbit hole that lead me to understand a lot better UK's govt and especially how confusing their laws are(think they've been added and amended for the last millennia or so), it totally lends credence for those fics where solicitors dig old laws and throw at each other until one sticks.
