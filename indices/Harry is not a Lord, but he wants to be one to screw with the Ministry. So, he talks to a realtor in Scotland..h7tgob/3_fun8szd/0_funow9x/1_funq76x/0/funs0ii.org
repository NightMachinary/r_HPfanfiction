There is no Noble house of Potter, that's fanon.. And we are not sure if Black's are noble just that they call themselves one, but the idea I had was that they got their titles long ago, and those titles are muggle ones, they didn't take them, as they already had them...

Actually I think you cannot buy, like you can kind of (would call it more of a scam if someone sold theirs, as you cannot transfer them), but no other nobility would think of you as noble, and Monarch might not think you are one (most likely wouldn't as you wouldn't be), and for nobility that is the important one. Even more to those in countries where there needs to be an equal marriage, to keep the titles, say Russian's tsar's couldn't marry anyone who was lower classs than them (there are more to this but hard to explain), or they could lose the title, same with their children or counsins etc, they couldn't become tsar after the current died, if they married someone of lower class.. Same was going on in Germany and some other places, though not Britain, but the nobility there still married these nobles from places where there had to be equal marriage so it was somewhat important to them as well. (historically)

And there are actually non-royal Dukes in Britain (only males can inherit them so they might die out if they don't have any boys, or go abeyand), though still their real titles, new ones are only given to Royalty, but there are people who are Duke who are not part of the Royal family.
