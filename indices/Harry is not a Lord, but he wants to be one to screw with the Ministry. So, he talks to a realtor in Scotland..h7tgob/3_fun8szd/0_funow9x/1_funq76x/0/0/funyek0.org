That's true, sorry got carried by fanon again, i remembered a family tree like the Black one from Pottermore and it had the Noble House of Potter written at the top. But I couldn't find it.

Yeah, I remember people selling titles from several countries, but it was mostly a novelty for rich people to have and other nobles with comissioned/given titles wouldn't care for them.

Thanks for the explanation, I am a bit familiar with that, like how before WWI most of the royals in Europe were cousins or something because of Queen Victoria(it was even said if she was alive she could have stopped it)

Thanks for that list, I was looking for something like that, I now see where I was mistakem, well back to Wikipedia.

Still we could avoid all that trouble and just say these noble titles came from Arthur and Camelot and that they are pertaining to the magical world, so they simply don't recognize or don't overlap with the Muggle Peerage.
