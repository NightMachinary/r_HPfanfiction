I personally like to think that they would be muggle titles, as that is only one that makes sense to me, and I like to think that say British monach is also the ruler of The British wizarding World, which is why they have Minister of Magic (he would also have a seat in the Parlament, but it would have been kept as speacial kind or heredity title etc for muggle eyes, even though in reality it's chosen by wizards in someway, but for muggles it has different name and they think it's either specialty thing or a heriedity one etc)

And you need to take in account that Arthur and Camelot would have been hundreds of years before statue of secrecy and thus before statue of secrecy all wizards and muggles would have been under the muggle monarch.. I like to think that either all Royalty are magical (how else would they conquer big areas and hold them and like the reason why they studied at home, they truly went to Hogwarts, same reason why they often marry other nobles, they married other wizards, and in modern day when they marry regural people, they marry either muggles or muggle-borns, which in olden days wasn't a thing that other wizards looked lÂ´kindly at, which is why they often married nobility, though I think British monarch married normal people as well so..) or they all had and still have a court wizard..
