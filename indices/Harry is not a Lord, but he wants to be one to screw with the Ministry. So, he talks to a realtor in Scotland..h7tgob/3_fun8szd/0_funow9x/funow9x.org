Well Black family call's themselves Noble family (unless I rememebr wrong), so I always like to think that they would really be nobility, but for the lols be it that yes they are nobles, but they are muggle nobility (as only eay they can be nobility is through a say Monarch etc), having it in family from before statue of secrecy (though I still believe Queen knows everything about magical world, same with some of the British Royal family).

So Black's being nobles is something they talk about in sense, but never really talk about how it's a muggle thing, purposfully ignoring that part, but making it about their purity, even though it's muggle title they have..
