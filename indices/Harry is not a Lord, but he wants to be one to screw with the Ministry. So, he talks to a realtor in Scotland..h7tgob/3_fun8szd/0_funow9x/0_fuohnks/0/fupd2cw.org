Yes I also belive Mafoy's really would be nobility but try to ignore it.. For Black I know it was Sirius joking (this all was just about what if scenario) but it would be funny if the people who where so pureblood this or that, where truly a muggle nobility, maybe that was the joke Sirius made, Blacks may be super pure-blooded but we still are muggle nobles or something..
