Sirius refers to them as noble and ancient once as a joke. There is a chapter in OotP called that, but it's the one that shows how the family and their home is in ruins.

If we want to use canon, then the extra info on the Malfoys tell us they were pals with muggle royalty and ended up becoming muggle landed gentry centuries ago. They hide this history, for the same reasons you state, and aren't proud of their muggle titles. It explains their mansion, though.
