AU with a lot of world building in a world fairly different than canon. In addition to Harry being Harriet, Riddle decides to go for a Diplomatic Victory instead of a Domination Victory which substantially changes the plot a lot. Also in this while she is a girl, she has to pretend to be her male cousin as that's the only way she can go to Hogwarts as they only accept Purebloods. Basically Harriet wants to be a potions master, but is supposed to go to school in america which has a shitty potions program, while Snape isn't awful at teaching in this so Hogwarts is good for learning potions. And her cousin, Sirius' OC son, really wants to be a healer. America has a top notch healer program and Hogwarts doesn't even really offer healing classes, but Sirius is insistent on him going to Hogwarts. So they secretly swap. Which is a serious crime in Magical Britain because the society is even more discriminatory than canon from Riddle being super influential in politics. Premise sounds odd, but the story is really good.

Naruto crossover, Vernon is even shittier than normal so Jasmine somehow trans-dimensional apparates to the Naruto universe in a bout of accidental magic. Will eventually have her in England, but that hasn't happened yet. So far story has only covered Naruto stuff so be aware of that if you like/don't like Naruto FF.

This one of my favorite fics, but it is really hard to describe. Basically the main character, Lily, is an incarnation of death because death's price for the hallows was to inhabit one of the peverells ancestors so it could experience being sort of human. She encounters and befriends the horcrux in her head who she calls wizard lenin as his conducting a revolution reminds her of the communist revolution in Russia. And when she accidentally temporarily dies(since she's death she can just come back so it isn't permanent) in the first chapter she meets and talks to a version of canon harry in purgatory who she also befriends. He was apparently also an incarnation of death for his own universe, but didn't realize till after canon so canon played out normally for him. After the heat death of his original universe he went wandering and meets Lily. Technically she is ridiculously OP as she is immortal and slightly omnipotent. However her personality and general lack of giving a shit about most things somewhat handicaps her so this doesn't make the story boring. And she still encounters problems that are difficult to overcome, they just aren't difficult because of strength reasons but for other reasons.
