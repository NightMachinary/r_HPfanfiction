Overpowered, by definition, is something entirely else. Sure, she's really freaking powerful for a 14-year-old. That comes with a price though. Samedi is not really a lenient master, so she has to excel. If she was overpowered she would've stomped Voldemort and half of Wizarding Britian already, especially seeing how we're 3 parts in.
