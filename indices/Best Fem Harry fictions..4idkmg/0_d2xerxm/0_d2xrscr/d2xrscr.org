She can do wandless & wordless magic, she can fly, she can turn into a cat, she has a familiar, she knows blood magic & voodoo, she killed a dragon, she made a zombie, and she already knows about horcruxes she even killed Nagini when she first met Voldemort. I'd say that's pretty over powered for a 14+ year old.
