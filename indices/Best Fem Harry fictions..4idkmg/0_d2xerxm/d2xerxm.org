linkffn(9860311) It's one of the more original stories I have read. The updates are sporadic but it is well worth the read. As for Princess of the Blacks, I wouldn't really count Jen as OP. She wouldn't stand a chance against Dumbledore/Voldemort and some of the more experienced aurors. She only seems so OP because she usually hangs around school kids.
