Not exactly the same, but I do remember one fic where harry tries to go all indy and dumbledore takes him to see the ministry-run school in diagon alley and sees that everyone is drugged to their gills on emotional suppressants because accidental magic is /dangerous/ and frequently lethal as the child gets older and teenage hormones kick in. And even with the suppressants sometimes students go pop and there's really nothing anyone can do about it.

Hogwarts is one of the premiere magic schools in the world because of unreplicatable anti-accidental magic spells woven into the castle. Hogwarts is one of the few places on earth where accidental magic simply /doesn't happen./ And thus the students can be human before they become fully qualified wizards who can control their accidental magic.
