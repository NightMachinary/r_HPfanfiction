I don't know a fic where this happened with indy!Harry, but there is a crossover fic with Mass Effect, where Dumbledore shows Liara a ministry run school. I think it hasn't got an update in long while and I'm not even sure that the reason he shows it to her is the same, but this comment slightly reminded me of that. I think it was called something along the lines of "Blue Magic"
