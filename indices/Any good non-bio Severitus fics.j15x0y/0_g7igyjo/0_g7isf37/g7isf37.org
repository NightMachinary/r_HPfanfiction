Thank you so much for your reply! That's so funny, O Mine Enemy is one of the ones I keep rereading! I'm not sure if you've already read these if you've read O Mine Enemy but the ones I keep going back to are Crime and Punishment by mlocatis on ffnet, but they're on AO3 under melolcatsi if you have a preference (their other on-going fic, Snape's Promise and the completed Mors Certa, Hora Incerta are also very good). That Awful Boy and it's on-going sequel, the Pauper Prince by paracosim on AO3 are amazing! TAB is the fic that got me into Severitus. It's probably my favorite Snape centric fanfic of all time, can't recommend it enough! Word Up by ValidEgo on ffnet has a really interesting beginning and plot but it's also unfortunately not been updated since 2007, so if that kinda thing bothers you I would avoid that one. I know I said I don't read Snily as a rule of thumb but Never Say Remember by Malora on ffnet is so good that I read it anyways! Where the Heart is by silver_fish on AO3 is a very sweet one shot if you like reading those. I'm sorry for only putting the name and author of the fics and not the links but I'm not sure how to embed them in here without creating 5 of those link comments and I figured that would be a bit much. Happy reading!
