When you're ignorant of the possibility of being bi or gay or anything queer just because you love a woman you don't get to say "you just tossed everything away to see what you want" anywhere else than at your own person.

Of course Snape is queer-coded. Remus literally teaching Neville to dress a man as a woman to humiliate him (painting him as transphobic) and Snape wearing his mother's clothes only to be mocked by Petunia are strong clues to Snape suffering his affiliations with femininity.
