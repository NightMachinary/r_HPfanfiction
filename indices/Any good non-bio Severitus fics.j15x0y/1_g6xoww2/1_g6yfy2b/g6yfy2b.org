hey friend, this is actually a very nuanced conversation that I doubt I'm going to convey very well through a few comments on Reddit. If you're actually curious as to how Snape could be considered queer coded, I have several links to some more in depth explanations than I myself could probably provide you. All of that to say, there are tons of different readings that someone could have of the books, having different interpretations of a character is expected. I can read Snape as queer and you can read him as heterosexual, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm also going to say that I'm a queer women so this isn't about me trying to justify my yaoi ships or anything... Here are the links I talked about:

But if you don't read them, the basic spiel is there is no canonical evidence that he was IN love with Lily, there's none and even if he was that doesn't mean he couldn't be queer, bi/pan people exist. JKR rather heavily relied on western villain coding and stereotyping when writing Snape in order to create that whole red herring affect that lasted until The Prince's Tale. Western ideals of what villains look like or act like are often queer coded or ethnic coded and JKR is no less guilty of that in Harry Potter. Saying that, I don't, and many other people don't, think Snape's queer coding was intentional or that JKR wrote him as a queer man, but simply wrote to stereotypes without considering all of the implications. Just the entire thing with JKR putting him in women's clothing several times throughout the books, he's the only male character that this is done to. The whole implication of Sirius calling him Malfoy's lapdog.So forth and so on, I did say that I'm not the best at articulating this argument and that your best bet was those links. I'd be more than happy to continue to talk about this, if this comment was in good faith and you're actually curious about how you could read Snape through a queer lens. Hope you enjoy the rest of your day or night,
