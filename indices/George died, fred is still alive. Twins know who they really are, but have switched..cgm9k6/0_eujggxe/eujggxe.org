Aww man no, that would be horrible and pointless because ultimately we still got only one of The Twins left and then this brilliant fan-theory I read also gets the shove.

When George lost an ear, I knew Fred was doomed. Why? All the Weasley names except for Ron are either the names of a British king or queen or an Arthurian name (and Ron brings Harry into the family, and there have been 8 â€˜Harry's on the throne; nine if you are a die-hard Jacobite).
