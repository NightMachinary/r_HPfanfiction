How is this a fault of the story? Unless they impact Dumbledore's own goals, Dumbledore being apathetic to Harry's actions and situation to the point of neglect is his canon behavior toward Harry. It is the most glaring problem of the series, especially after GOF when Rowling tried, and failed spectacularly, to explain why Harry was always put or left in abusive or dangerous situations as a child.
