Could potentially work by Dumbledore playing on the ideology of Grindlewald, could point out how much magical blood has been spilled in Riddle's pointless and hypocritical pursuit of Pure Blood Society & how much of the Magical World has been lost as a result

Given Gellert is well known for his belief in Magical Superiority, the idea that this arrogant upstart has not only taken his title but also perverted Gellert's own ideology to gain more followers in a crusade based on hypocrisy that is only crippling the Magical World and destroying their way of life would definitely be seen as an insult to both himself and what he views as his legacy, possibly an insult that Gellert could not ignore

Gellert is also often seen as a Warrior type figure in most topics that I have seen mention him, as a result I could also see this as a potential "die forgotten and alone or on your feet fighting for your beliefs" type of choice for him too,

a last blaze of glory so to speak, and who better to see it through with then his greatest friend/rival/foe and the man that he (once) may have loved
