Even as the owls soared through the air to deliver the news, even as the ministry flunkies congratulated each other, as Cornelius Fudge helped himself to some expensive wine and raised a glass in toast, the consequences of their actions were already happening elsewhere. Not a single one of them ever spared a thought as to why Dumbledore never wore his badge of honour.
