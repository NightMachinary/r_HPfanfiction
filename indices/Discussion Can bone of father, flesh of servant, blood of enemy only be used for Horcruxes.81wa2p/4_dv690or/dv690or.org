I have a story with a ghost potter in it that is waiting on Harry to make a golem for him to use. I debated the idea of them seeing this spell in action and usiNg the ritual to reenshrine him in a body. Still debating it. I think I already have stated that potters cremate their bodies so they can't be used as inferis but his skull and his father's skull still exist in the story so i can use the bone of father bit easily.
