My headcanon is that no, it works for anyone, for reasons given by others in the thread.

My further headcanon is that the ritual can be done either on summer solstice or on one of the equinoxes. If done on an equinox, it restores the user to a healthy state, including damage from Dark curses, with the exception of things that were voluntarily sacrificed. (So, for example, the Weasley twin's ear would be restored, but not Pettigrew's hand.) If done on the summer solstice, it restores the user to a healthy state as above /and/ deages them into their prime.
