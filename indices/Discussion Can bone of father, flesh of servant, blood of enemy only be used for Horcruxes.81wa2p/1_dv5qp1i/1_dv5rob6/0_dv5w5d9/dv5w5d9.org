  Voldemort had a serpent-like appearance before he was resurrected by Wormtail. In HBP, Harry sees a scene from Dumbledore's Pensieve where Tom Riddle applies for the DADA position, and he has become noticeably less human since the previous memories Harry has seen.

Also at the end of OotP, Fudge and the other interlopers immediately recognize Voldemort.
