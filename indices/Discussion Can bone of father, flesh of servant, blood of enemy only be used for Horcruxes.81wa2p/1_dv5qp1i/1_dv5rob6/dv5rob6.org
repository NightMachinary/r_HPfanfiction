Voldemort had a serpent-like appearance before he was resurrected by Wormtail. In HBP, Harry sees a scene from Dumbledore's Pensieve where Tom Riddle applies for the DADA position, and he has become noticeably less human since the previous memories Harry has seen.

I don't know if making Horcruxes automatically makes you look like a snake, or if it's more the case that it turns you into whatever you are on the inside. It could be that if someone made Horcruxes due to greed, for instance, they would end up looking more like a pig.
