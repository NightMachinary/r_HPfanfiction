Daphne is often portrayed as a neutral pureblood -- doesn't support Voldemort or Dumbledore. This gives the story the opportunity to let Harry break free from the canon plot/manipulative Dumbs/etc. and pursue a strategy which includes politics/finance/diplomacy/etc. (because, you know, real wars are about logistics). Sirius and Amelia Bones can also fulfill this role in some fics, but Daphne offers more of a partnership while Sirius and Amelia in these fics are more patrons. As a Slytherin it's not a great stretch if she's willing to support Harry in being more aggressive with his enemies. There just aren't that many children in Harry's age group who can fulfill this role (Neville? Susan Bones? not really) so fanon Daphne fills this need.
