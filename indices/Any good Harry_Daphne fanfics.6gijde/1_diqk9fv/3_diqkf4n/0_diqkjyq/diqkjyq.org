Well, I discuss it briefly more down in the comment chain. I like the fact she is not Gryffindor, not a Weasley, not a friend, not 3-4 years older (which is quite a bit at Hogwarts age) and the Slytherin-Gryffindor tension I think could be interestingly done though I doubt it ever will be.

And why Daphne as compared to any of the other Slytherin girls? Pansy's a bitch, Millicent seems to be a female Goyle/Crabbe and I like her name better than Tracey Davis.
