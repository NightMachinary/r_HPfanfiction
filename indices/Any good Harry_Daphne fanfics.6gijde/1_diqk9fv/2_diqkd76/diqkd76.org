HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Thanks for the stories and the laughs. I just hope all that Marriage contract bullshit would go down the drain at times and the sudden Super Harry is very, very annoying. There's basically no point in having a story with Super Harry who can snap his fingers and solve everyone's problems, literally.
