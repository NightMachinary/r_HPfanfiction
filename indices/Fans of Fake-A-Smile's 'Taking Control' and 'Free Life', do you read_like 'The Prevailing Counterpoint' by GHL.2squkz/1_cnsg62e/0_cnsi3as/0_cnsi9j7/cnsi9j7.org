From what I remember about reading Taking Control (Like 8 years ago when I was a teen), it was good at the time, but I can see how it might seem juvenile as an adult. There's definitely a ton of fics I've tried to re-read recently (in my mid 20s), but they're just unreadable. When I was 14 years old I was able to look past a lot of things that are unbearable now.

I've actually been considering re-reading Taking Control, as I followed it during it's original run, but never actually finished. If I do, I'll report back here with my thoughts on it.
