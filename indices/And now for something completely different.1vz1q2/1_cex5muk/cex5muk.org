I have yet to see [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=224105][Harry Potter and the Other Path]] recommended here. About 400k words, covers 7 years, some very original ideas. Starts off as a rather light-hearted, fun-to-read fic with some strangely unexplained deviations from canon, but explanations are made as it gets darker. Book 7, and, to a lesser degree, the 2nd half of book 6 feel a little rushed, but it's *definitely* worth reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/19/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] is a very well-written Harry-in-Slytherin fic. Incomplete, but updating regularly with no signs of stopping. At 200k words, it's long enough to be worth getting into. It uses a 1 chapter for year one, 2 chapters for year 2, 3 chapters for year 3 and so on format (with very long chapters), so it ends up spending a lot more time on the later years, despite covering 6.5 so far. Definitely recommend.
