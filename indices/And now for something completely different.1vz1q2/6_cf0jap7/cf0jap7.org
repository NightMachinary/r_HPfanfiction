This one has been rec'd here once or twice, but I rarely see it, and it's great: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run by Toujours Padfoot]] - it's about the village of the dead and events that happen therein...really original concept, incredible world-building, engaging and fast-paced plot, a good dose of many canon characters - it's a great read.
