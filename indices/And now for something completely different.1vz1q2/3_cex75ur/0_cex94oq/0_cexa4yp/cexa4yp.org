Pros: It has some great scenes, a few hilarious bits, comes to a logical and satisfying conclusion. I've read it more than once all the way through, though it's been a while.

Cons: Harry/Hermione, so there may be some anti-Weasley sentiment (I can't remember); the little girl is a bit disturbing and eventually powerful, so there's hints of Sue-ishness and as a kind of Oni, she comes packaged with Japanese cultural references which annoy some people.
