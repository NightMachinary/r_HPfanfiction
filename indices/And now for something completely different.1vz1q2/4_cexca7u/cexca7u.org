How about [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/Making_The_Last_Move/][Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux]] by Full Pensieve? I don't recall its being recommended here. 260k words, complete, solid writing by the /original/ "Indy!Harry" writer (though this story doesn't really fall into that category). Harry/Hermione.
