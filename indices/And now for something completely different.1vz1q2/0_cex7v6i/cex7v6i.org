A challenge. I like it. Let's see if I can find something you haven't read. I'm gonna skip Wastelands and The Lie I've Lived. those are pretty common.

*Takes place during the school years:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and The Forests of Valbone]]

Harry is shaken by events in the Chamber of Secrets, makes a few hasty decisions and winds up in a magical forest with the Sorting Hat as his only companion. The entire story takes place the summer of second year.

One of the best stories I've read. Harry's too late to save Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. This story follows how that changes events and the characters themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] Things get weird the summer after Sirius dies. I don't remember much about this except that I thought it was really good.

*Stuff that doesn't take place during the books but are worth reading anyways:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/18/Ambient][Ambient]]

Takes place in a bleak future. Harry with an insane Romilda Vane as a companion. Long and full of action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]]

Neville is The Boy Who Lived. It does a decent job with the premise and I enjoyed it.

*Ones that might have already been recced to you:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived]] Basically, it's a Harry grew up with a family story done right.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] Time travel with a side of horror thrown in. Dark, but a good story so far.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head. I'll update if I find anything else. Let me know if this was helpful.
