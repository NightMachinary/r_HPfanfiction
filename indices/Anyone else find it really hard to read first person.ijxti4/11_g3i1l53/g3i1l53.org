To me, it makes sense only if the main character is telling his story TO someone. Is he trying to impress his mates at the pub? Is he filing a police report? Explaining to his boss why he was late to work? Writing a Dear John letter? First person makes sense for situations like that. The situation determines how the main character speaks.

Otherwise, why is this person talking to me? He doesn't even know me. Is he trying to show off how cool he is or trying to avoid detention?
