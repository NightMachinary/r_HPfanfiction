It's kind of always felt incredibly rushed to me? While being condensed into this short frame of time that's difficult to follow and frustrating to read. To be fair, I know that it's also really difficult to keep track of all of it when you're writing in first, but.

I've also noticed that things usually tend to become a lot more straight forward, too. Sometimes painfully so. There's a lot less room for description, and any of the other characters during Big Events. You can't slip in a lot of details that you otherwise could. Ones that would complicate it but still serve to improve it when it's something the character wouldn't notice then and there. Or process. So it kind of just... Falls flat, a lot of the time?

There's a lot of limits in that style, and it can be done well, but I think the amount of people who messed up kind of turned a lot of people away from reading it, too.
