I don't have a problem with first person narrative, but it's very rare to see decent authors making use of it. Mostly because there's rarely a need unless you're writing a SI, and 99.99% od SI stories are utter shit.

In fact, I can't actually think of any decent first person fic in this fandom, but I know some in other fandoms.
