As someone who's 134k words into an unpublished first person fic, I hope not!

As a reader, I've never really thought about it. I'm pretty quick to bail on a fic that doesn't engage me no matter what POV it's in. If a story is good, it doesn't matter to me. Some stories just need to be told in first person. Like mine, for example! I wrote the first chapter in third person and it just didn't work.
