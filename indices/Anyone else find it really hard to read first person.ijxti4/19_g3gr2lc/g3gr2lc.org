Sometimes. For some stories, integral parts of the story need to be told from 1st, like in Wastelands or tlil. It can also be annoyingly repetitive saying things like "they knew this" or "they said that" in order to give information. But if the world is affecting the mc, then 3rd is the best approach. It can give the reader important info that would otherwise be unincluded due to the pov. But when the info comes from the character, 1st is almost a must. It can go into great detail about info that would be inaccessible or awkwardly included if it was in 3rd. Of course, when the writing is subpar, I find it easier to stomach if it's in 3rd lol.
