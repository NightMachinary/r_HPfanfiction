First person in fanfiction can get problematic because as a reader, I already feel like I know the characters before reading a single word of the story--and most of us have slightly different Harrys and Hermiones and Dracos and Dumbledores in our minds. As soon as I start reading from one of those characters' POVs and it isn't exactly what or how I expect them to think, it throws me. If the author does the internal voice well, then I can get drawn in, but that's extremely difficult. Things can feel out of character very quickly in first person.

Third person is far more forgiving. I can still hold onto some of my preconceived notions of the characters, while the author changes my perception little-by-little instead of all-at-once.
