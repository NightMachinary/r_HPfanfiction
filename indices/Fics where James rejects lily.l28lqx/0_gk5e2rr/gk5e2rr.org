It's a pretty common theme with James/Lily fics.

Lily can get paired with Sirius, Remus, Snape, Slughorn (smut), Time traveling Harry but James is almost always paired with Lily.

In fics that they do get together, Lily can have a nice, understanding, fulfilling relationship before dating James but all the girls James date are sluts, bimbos and really James doesn't like any of these girls he's only dating them to get Lily jealous.
