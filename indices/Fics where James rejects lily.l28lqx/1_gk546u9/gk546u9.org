This one is a quite popular Jily fic! I absolutely adore it, it's has a perfect balance of drama and humour about basically what you described.

James asks Lily out a million times and just when she realizes she might like him, he gives up and stops asking. James is pretty upset and vows to let her go so he's determinedly not picking up on any clues she drops so Lily has to get over her pride and figure out a way to ask him! Highly recommend it.
