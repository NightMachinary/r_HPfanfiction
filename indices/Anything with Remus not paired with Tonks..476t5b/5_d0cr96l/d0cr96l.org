Well, the best Remus/Hermione time travel fic I've read is linkffn(8619724)

There's also a whole slew of wonderfully written and generally brilliant Remus/Sirius fics out there. I imagine you're probably familiar with The Shoebox Project, but if not, that's where you should start. It's phenomenal and totally believable.

For a brief, terrifying moment, Remus found that he hated every last one of them. They were bastards and they had no idea and he hated them.‚Äù
