I've always believed that the original SAO was only bad because the author was not prepared for the light novel and show to be as popular as it was Which is why he started writing the progressive novels to explore the story more. If you watch the later versions such as Gun Gale Alternative or The Alicization Arc it gets so much better but The less said about the Alfheim Arc the better
