Ehh, if it was unprepared you would expect it to be better to start and then go downhill once the popularity picked up. Happens in a lot of shows, not here.

The characters are horrible. Kirito is basically a flawless OP character. He starts out on what might have been heading to the "Learn the importance of teamwork" or maybe "Realize he is a big fish in a small pond", but instead everything is played bland.

The rest are (somehow) worse. Despite interesting setups, they quickly devolve into plot devices to advance the power-fantasy which is Kirito.

More importantly, the supporting characters are actively disappointments. Asuna is the big one, she starts off looking like maybe a strong female character, independent and willing to go her own path, In a few episodes she is demoted to simply being something for Kirito to chase, and then soon after that she basically becomes Princess Peach, put in danger for the hero to safe. Or in the second arc, simply be captured the whole damn arc.

The rest of the cast simply serves to show Kirito getting everything. The harem is completely unnecessary and makes no sense in the world setting.

Hell there was so many interesting ideas the story completely ignored: How do people handle actually living in a gender-imbalanced society (nope, we need to give the main character a Harem), do people try to form governments or actually research the problem, what about people who accept the condition. what kind of tragedy is happening outside the virtual world, How about motives beyond simply trying to escape?

And not to even go into the horrible motivations for the subsequent arcs. Like how is this not the most highly regulated industry in the world after the first arc? And the super-weak 'serial killer running around killing when people die in game' plot.

It was such a train wreck. I honestly wouldn't have minded as much if it was a shitty show with shitty character development and shitty worldbuilding. Thing is, it had decent worldbuilding, the setup was neat and thought obviously went into it. And it was wasted on a story that somehow had characters worse than cardboard cutout characters.
