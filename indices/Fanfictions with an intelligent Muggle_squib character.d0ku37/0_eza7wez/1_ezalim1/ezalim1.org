I have been [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][critical with story]] as well, but still I think it is one of the best fanfic stories I know about and most of my criticism grew out of the frustration, because I think it is one of few stories which are almost good enough to break through the barrier to be really good story even outside of the fanfic universe. Yes, „James and Me“ is very nice as well, except both these stories (as 90 % of all fanfic stories) would get help by rather savage trimming. Especially Strangers have very slow start (there is so much tea drunk and biscuits eaten, that one has tendency to fall asleep), but “James and Me” could use some trimming as well (in the middle, those bike trips are slowing down the story a bit). And unfortunately, it seems to me the author gave up on HP fanfiction stories after all these years and he know writes [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3328948/1/Winter-Journeys][original fantasy]]. Which is really pity, I would really love to see the conclusion of Anna and James relationship (I have already dreamed about couple of ones, but I wouldn't to make a follow-up for such good writer as Northumbrian).
