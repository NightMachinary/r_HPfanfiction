Strangers at Drakeshaugh is pretty good, with a Muggle woman, Jaqueline "Jaqui" Charlton, whose family befriend Harry, Ginny and their children. Mind you, the story has a pretty disappointing ending... but the sequel, James and Me, picks up years later and focuses on Jaqui's now grown-up daughter Anna, as she meets James Sirius Potter again for the first time in ages... and that story looks like it's heading places that are a LOT more promising.
