More seriously, I think it depends on the artisan. I imagine a lot of the magical effects to imitate mundane ones unless intended otherwise: e.g. magically chopped wood is as if it were struck by an invisible, perfect axe, etc. So any "traditional" artisan will improve old designs with magic, but not change them. I imagine the more progressive designs to be over the top and eccentric, and therefore only suited to a niche audience.

In my very slowly developing AU, understanding is paramount to the quality of a spell. So a carpenter who knows the muggle techniques will be able to repeat those feats using magic, whereas someone without that innate understanding will create crude facsimiles of the real thing.

TL;DR

Yes, I do think they use nails. Even though there are purely magical alternatives.
