To piggy back of some other answers, I would assume yes they use nails but generally just attach them with magic instead of using tools. For example when someone wants to build a house, they'd get all the wood and nails/screws/whatever and magically put them in place. I can't see them using sticking charms on the boards when building the frame since either a finite or time could erode the charms.

I may be remembering incorrectly but doesn't Mr Weasley have fun playing with a hammer sometime during the books? So I just see it as they just don't use tools.
