Cannon does try for an 'out of date' feel instead of a 'completely different' feel. I guess you could say they are up to date to a point where they didn't need new advances because of magic.

But even 17th century building had a lot of domain knowledge that is not taught at Hogwarts. No wood shop here!. So there is a blank about how that is handled. Obviously they don't go learn from muggles. Maybe an apprentice system?
