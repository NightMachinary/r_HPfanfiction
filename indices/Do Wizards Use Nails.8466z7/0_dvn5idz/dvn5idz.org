Magic in the HP world tends not to replace physical things but rather enhance them.

For example, heating is mostly achieved by conjuring fires rather than directly heating things with Charms.

Another example is that "illusions" are not common - wizards who want to change the appearance of a thing will generally Transfigure it, changing the thing's actual physical composition.

This isn't a hard limit - we see what might be described as a warming Charm in HBP, and there are definitely Charms which create illusions (e.g. disillusionment Charm). Rather it seems to be a matter of habit and culture.
