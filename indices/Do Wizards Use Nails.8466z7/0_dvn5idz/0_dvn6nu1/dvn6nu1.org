It is also the nature of charms to be limited to objects.

  Fred swept the hat on to his head, beaming. For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished.

  Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.

  “And off again!” shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.

  “How do those hats work, then?” said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely. “I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object... I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though.”

When Potter-verse creates a (lasting) enchanted objects, it is the object that is enchanted and behaves magically. The object is not merely a token to project a magical effect. The clearest example in canon of this is the invisibly cloak. An invisibly cloak works by being invisible. Wrap yourself in it and you become invisible yourself. Compare this to defining invisibility object in mythology: the Ring of Gyges and its fiction counterparts such as the One Ring. Such rings project invisibility beyond the object itself in a very un Potter like way.
