Well, that is interesting because in the regular world, nails are used to affix things like that because they are handy, but they are generally created for their role in construction. You could imagine the wizarding world being strange enough to go make nails just to nail messages to things.

But it might indicate they have access to nails that are used in construction.

I also note cannon has a few axe's and other tools around, suggesting wizards do use them to chop trees and the like..
