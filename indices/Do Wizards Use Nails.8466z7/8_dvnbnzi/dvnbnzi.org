That's a good question and one of the things that I wish JKR had been more explicit about, even though it really only matters to those of use who write fan fiction! You raise a good point with the grout--I believe the basement kitchen floor of Number 12 is described as "stone-flagged" which indicates discrete stone tiles held together with some sort of medium. Why not just make it all of one piece?

In one of my stories I mention the California Architect Julia Morgan. She designed and built Hearst Castle and many other structures in California that have withstood the test of time and earthquakes. How? Simple--she was a witch and used strengthening spells in the concrete!
