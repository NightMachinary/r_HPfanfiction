Well, the books don't exactly describe the wizarding work as being radically different, so of course the movies didn't spend a bunch of money to diverge from that.

That being said, it does seem that having magic would fundamentally change your principals. For instance, we use flat boards because of ease of creation and transport, curved surfaces are largely not used in part because of the cost of creating them. Would you expect greater use of curved surfaces in a magical world?
