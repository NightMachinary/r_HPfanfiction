Considering that everything in Diagon Alley is warped looking I would say definitely yes.

The ability to shrink objects and teleport places would allow for cheap instant transport of basically anything. I bet they also have magic to instantly cure wood instead of having to let fresh lumber dry for a year or more. Their magic might even cause a tree to grow into the shape it needs to be rather than actually worked by hand.
