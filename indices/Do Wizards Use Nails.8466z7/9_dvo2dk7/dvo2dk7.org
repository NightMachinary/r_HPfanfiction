Certain builders and companies would probably use Nails, the risk in using Sticking Charms even 'Permanent' ones is that anything that feeds on magic, can undo the spell or other wise could interfere with the stable spell could cause the entire structure to fail. Nails are cheap and easy way to insure that that shotty sticking charm doesn't cause the entire house to collapse.
