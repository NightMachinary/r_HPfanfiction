I'm a Severitus person, and I feel like my faves aren't what everyone else's faves are on Reddit (I love Snape mentor fics, and I like more gen fics than most people), but I just want to say that I'm sorry that this has been such a shit week for you. I stick mostly to Snape so I'm not down on Remus/Sirius fics as much but I'm sure there are people here who can recommend that.

I hope you find some good fics and that it helps make whatever horrible shit that's going on right now better. Hopefully, whatever is going on, it will pass.
