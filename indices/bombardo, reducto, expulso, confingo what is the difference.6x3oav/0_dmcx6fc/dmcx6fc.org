Bombardo is a rather loud spell of destruction, which can be inferred from the name (as well as it's mentioning during /Cursed Child/). Unclear whether charm, hex, jinx or curse.

The Reductor Curse blasts solid objects out of the caster's way. So, by nature, not necessarily destructive though could probably be used that way. And is a curse, which sets it apart from charms, transfigurations, hexes, jinxes, etc. Also seems to have the ability to /reduce/ something to it's end state (as in that table during a D.A. meeting during /OotP/).

Expulso: Blows shit up. Unclear whether charm or hex/jinx/curse.

The Blasting Curse (Confringo): Blows shit up. This leads me to believe that Expulso is not a curse.

This is all the information that I could sift out of the hp-lexicon. And now you asked for headcanons on this.

Let's start off with something in canon that isn't obvious: There are multiple magical ways to achieve a specific effect. For instance, you learn in Charms how to make objects dance and move (ie, become animate). Animation is a topic that also falls under Transfiguration. Another example is the Severing Charm (Diffindo) and the Sectumsempra Curse. Both can cut people (no idea if Sectumsempra can cut objects or not). So does the fact that they produce the same effect mean they are the same piece of magic? *No*. The subjects are differentiated not by effect (Transfiguration as an umbrella course and not separated into Form-Changing, animation, conjuration, vanishing, etc) but by the means through which the effect is brought into being. This is all clear from canon.

So my headcanon? Who cares which one you use as long as you are internally consistent. You can have them all have the same effect with all being curses, you can have them all have the same effect with them being different types of magic or you can have them all have different effects. Doesn't matter which route you go with /as long as you are consistent in doing so./

Internal consistency is king.
