  For instance, you learn in Charms how to make objects dance and move (ie, become animate). Animation is a topic that also falls under Transfiguration.

I would think in those cases, the charms are making the thing bob around, like someone picked it up and bounced it around. Transfiguration would make it truly animated, with its parts actually bending and flexing, even those parts that are otherwise stiff and inflexible like a table leg.
