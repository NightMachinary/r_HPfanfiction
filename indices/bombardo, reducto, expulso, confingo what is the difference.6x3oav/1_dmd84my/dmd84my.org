As dumb as it may sound, but I treat the array of explosion curses a lot like different rounds for a tank. You have sabot AT rounds, HE rounds, AP rounds,... Depending on what you choose you will do different amount of damage to different targets.

Reducto and Bombarda are a bit similar in what they do, in that they both destroy solid objects. Reducto blasts an object into pulver. Bombarda makes a big fat hole in it, or rips it apart. Use Reducto against a wall and you won't have a good outcome - thats what Bombarda is for. Use Bombarda against a single objects and you may be hit by the ensuring shrapnel.

Expulso and Confringo are the two types of "AP" rounds in the magical arsenal. I treat Expulso as the HEAP round. It strikes, explodes, and depending on how close you are to the effect, you may end up being hurt. Confringo however, does nothing if it doesn't hit a human, but if it does the effect is much, much worse.
