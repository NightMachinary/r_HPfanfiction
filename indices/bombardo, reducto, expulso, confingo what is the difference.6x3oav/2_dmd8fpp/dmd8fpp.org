As I understand, 'expulso' is the banishing curse used to propel things/people away from you with a bludger-like force that looks blue in appearance. Bombarda/Maxima causes an explosion like a mine, Reducto is used to turn your target into ashes and is more precise. I assume from the movies that Confringo is a more explosive and fireball-y.
