  I would call it more of a redemption fic

Why does everyone love those Death Eater redemptions? The only way I would read this is if Hermione goes on some sort of a rage-fueled revenge spree and stomps Nott's guts out. The premise sure sounds interesting but I don't want to read about Hermione developing a Stockholm syndrome and making excuses for Nott.
