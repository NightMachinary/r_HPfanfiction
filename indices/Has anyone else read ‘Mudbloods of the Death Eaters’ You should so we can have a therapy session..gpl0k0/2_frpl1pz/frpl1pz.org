I have. I disagree and think it's pretty bad. The premise isn't exactly original and the plot is clearly an entirely contrived manner for Hermione to get with "redeemed slytherin". Writing is mechanically fine, sure, but there's more to a good fic than grammar. Characterization was fine, but unrealistic. I find it doubtful that every death eater is either secretly a guilt-ridden regretful man waiting to be turned by hot captive or a complete raging psychopath (not the correct term, I'm aware).

Though I don't deny that the author can probably write good smut if he (or she) puts their mind to it, the writing of the combat, war itself, and other aspects unrelated to Hermione and Nott's burgeoning relationship was mediocre at best. I think it could be recommended for those seeking unconventional relationships but as a fic exploring humanity? I don't think so.
