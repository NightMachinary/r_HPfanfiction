I really like your reasoning hear though I don't know most of the stories you suggested even though I've read near a hundred, I assume they fall well in line with how you described them.

On the other hand, I don't know that canon-compliant need to be one of the first ones suggested. The very first fanfic I read was HPMOR and that got me hooked, I would argue that a story being well written and not getting too crazy in terms of wild canon divergence is best to start with. It needs to stick around Hogwarts and it should include a lot of known characters instead of going off into the writer's OC world.

Also, I 100% agree with you on the smut and shipping. You don't want to introduce someone to fanfiction like that, it would be like showing hentai or something really raunchy to someone to get them into anime, it really doesn't make sense.
