I would probably start off with well written, canon-compliant oneshots, such as linkffn(Cauterize; Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard; The Wendell that Wasn't; The Last Straw - Oneshot; The Fire Omens)

Then, I would go for oneshots that show a twist, an element of AU: linkffn(Geminio; The Greatest Minister of Magic; Antithesis)

From there, I would recommend canonical divergences, such as linkffn(Forging the Sword; On the Way to Greatness) although it might be better with complete fics at first. By this point, I would also start introducing some common tropes, such as time/dimension travel, dark!Harry, and so forth.

Finally, I would introduce 'milder' AU fics, such as linkffn(What You Leave Behind; The Changeling) and then later, full AU stories like linkffn(The Skitterleap; By the Divining Light; Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I)

Generally, I would advise against linking smut, at least at the beginning, since fanfiction already has a bad stigma. I would also recommend against shipping stories and EWE, as that may turn off readers who really enjoyed the canon.

Or you could just show them the glory that is linkffn(HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)

TL;DR: Start off with canon-compliant short stories and progressively introduce more aspects of fanfiction with well-written stories.
