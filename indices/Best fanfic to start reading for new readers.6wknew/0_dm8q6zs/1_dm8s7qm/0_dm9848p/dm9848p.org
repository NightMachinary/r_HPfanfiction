Cauterize that was mentioned would be a really good place to start then, one of my favourite one shots

Sadly enough though, a lot of good ones are not completed like forging the sword etc. So I do recommend those that are completed

If you're looking for some comedy or crack, I recommend A Black Comedy, and the Seventh Hocrux

Other completed works I recommend are

Serpent and the mirror

The many deaths of harry potter by shayneT

The unforgiving minute

E: Blindness - not completed, I forgot oops

A life of smoke and silvered glass on AO3 is a fantastic Snape one-shot
