If your friend loves the original Series (plot, pairings, characters), better start off with Canon compliant fics. I suggest reading stories by certain authors such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]].

The first fic I finished reading was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867). Its writing is really good, and has almost a Canon like feel.
