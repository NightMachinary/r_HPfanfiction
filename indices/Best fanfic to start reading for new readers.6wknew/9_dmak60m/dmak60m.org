My first anime was Naruto and I loved it. I probably would not have been able to if I'd been familiar with too many of the tropes though, so it's really good as a first anime but not necessarily as a tenth or hundredth.

In the same vein it might be good to start with something epic that suffers from a slight overdose of trope usage. They won't know it's cliched the first time they encounter it right?

I would recommend something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the jungle]] By Jbern.

Or even my own first fanfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord]]. That one had me hoked like In wouldn't believe, but I don't think it would have been the same to read it now.
