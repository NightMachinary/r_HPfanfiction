I think HPMOR is the worst fanfic to get people started on. It results in tons and tons of people thinking it is the best fanfic ever, despite a large portion of them literally having not read a single other fanfic.

One might find it safest to start with canon compliant fics, but I kind of disagree there as well. I feel like that tends to get people too comfortable to stray out of that zone and find something a bit more AU. That only really applies to if you're recommending a fic to someone. If someone is trying to explore fanfic on their own, they will find what they want, like I started with canon compliant fics, wanting to know what happened after year 7 but before the Epilogue. That's what different than someone handing me a fic.

So, I usually recommend A Black Comedy as a first fic. It's got humor, action, and is well written.
