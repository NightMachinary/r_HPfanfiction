I love quidditch! I just wish it was played without seekers and with time periods. Of course I feel that what I've done to make it engaging kind of ignores the rules of the game. But it's competition! So I'll just shut my mouth and hope no one calls me on it!

I'm glad you think so. VP exists largely as me proving a point to a friend that such a story can exist in realistic confines without something forcing the relationship along. It's been a bit odd to write, because I don't usually write female characters that start off, and stay, as weak as Gabrielle has up until this point. And I shirked part of the plan a bit because I felt it was hindering the story. But I think it's going to turn out how I want so that's always good.

I feel like I've kind of played Daphne to death. She appears in everything i've done, usually as some sort of love interest. And while I love the idea of a playful, unattached female that helps Harry out I feel like what I could do with it would likely become stale. She'll probably appear in whatever else I do and she has a few moments left in VP still upcoming. And a large portion of DiP as well.

That's really a question that, at this time, I feel like I probably won't approach again. But I wouldn't necessarily rule it out. I did say when I started out that I'd never write a story that featured Harry and Gabrielle, so things obviously change.

The closest thing I'd probably do, though, is something closer to an addition to Princess. There's a lot with Princess that got cut from the final product for a variety of reasons. And the story would look a lot different if it wasn't published within the constraints of ff.net. So I have a lot of half-done Harry/Daphne material in there. It's more likely I'd polish and post some of the extras there than anything new.
