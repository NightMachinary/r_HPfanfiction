Hello! I just recently finished reading all of your stories and I've really enjoyed them a great deal. You did something I didn't think was possible and made me care about quidditch. the way you write is realistic and believable, but also very engaging.

I'm loving ever line of Vitam Paramus. I've never been the biggest fan of Harry/Gabrielle, but everyone in it is written so well and the relationships feel so natural, it really is incredibly well done.

That being said, I'd have to say that Pureblood Princess is probably my favorite, for many of the same reasons. Your plots unfold slowly, but in stead of dragging, they allow the characters and the narrative to grow in a measured, thoughtful way, and finding good Harry/Daphne stories is always a challenge. Any chance you'll do any more Harry/Daphne stories in the future?
