Yes. I already am out of ideas of what to write about in the Harry Potter world. The three non-complete stories I have posted are at least planned out in their entirety, but I'm not sure if I'll have anything new after that. Of course, Vitam Paramus came mostly out of nowhere.

I honestly don't read a lot of fanfiction, so there may be plenty of things that deal with concepts I find under explored that I'm just not familiar with.

That being said; I think the 'Pureblood' agenda is too often glossed over as an inherently evil concept. Yes, in the novels it is pretty much presented that way, but I think it could make an interesting story if a writer came up with a realistic way to present how the Purebloods aren't necessarily evil. Give them human emotions and feelings and a cause for their opinions. Attempt to make the readers understand their logic, and emphasize, at least to a degree, with it, rather than writing them off as evil and wrong.

There's a very complicated story to be written deal with 'Muggle born' vs 'half blood' vs 'pure blood' and the societal implications with each. Make it about politics where everyone is a little bit right and a little bit wrong. Of course, you'd need an exceptionally well-crafted villain motivated by things other than a faux-believed superiority and killing all of the other segments. But I think there's a story in there somewhere.

As a whole I think the 'life of a witch or wizard' is under explored. In the canon it seems that most people go to Hogwarts, work for the government, get married at 21 and have a bunch of kids. I'm more intrigued by just what people are doing with their lives. There has to be more to a society than a couple of shops in London and a giant government entity. I also think the ramifications of the influx of muggle-born people is under explored. It usually comes off too much as 'magic for everything' when as a society we tend to focus on constant improvement. I think something where magic and technology are starting to weave into the wizards life could be entertaining. I mean, Television fascinated Albert Einstein, why do we assume Wizards wouldn't be interested to some degree?

Personally I really want to write another story that takes place at Hogwarts. But every time I try to think of an idea that I feel would make an interesting story I come up short.
