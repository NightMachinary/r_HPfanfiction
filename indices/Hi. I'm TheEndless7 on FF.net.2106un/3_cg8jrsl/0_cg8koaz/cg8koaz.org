I struggle with writing believable children. Even Harry in Letters is rightly criticized as being too mature for his age. So it would be really hard for me to write something that took place in the earlier years. I feel like I can write 16+ fairly well, but I find under that to be odd.

I'd kind of like to write something in book 3, but I doubt I ever will. Really, I find four and six the most entertaining for fanfiction purposes. And since I've done things there already, it's hard for me to go back to those books and come up with ideas that are original. Tenebrae Vincunt will cover Harry's seventh year at Hogwarts in some detail.

I'm not really big on sequels. I plan things to be able to stand by themselves for the most part. Which means there's usually not enough plot room for a sequel that is anything more than fluffy scenes of characters moving on. DiP, I suppose, would have the most actual room for a sequel once it's done, as the sequel could simply be another case. But with something like Letters the whole main Harry Potter plot is wrapped up by the end of it, so I'm not really left with something to write about.

Oddly enough, Princess was originally planned with a sequel that shifted the focus from Daphne to Astoria and followed Harry on the Horcrux hunt. But when I re-planned the story after chapter 3 I made Astoria a great deal shallower and decided it didn't make sense.
