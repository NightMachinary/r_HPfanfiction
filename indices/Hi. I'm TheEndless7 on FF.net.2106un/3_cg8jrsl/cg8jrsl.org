I have read just 2 of your stories, Letters and Pureblood Princess. I like them both I have to say it was the former which brought me into fanfiction again after 3 years. It's really well written and has good depth to the story. The question on my mind is if you ever plan to write a different take on early years of canon? Or maybe continue any of your current stories in different directions as sequel?
