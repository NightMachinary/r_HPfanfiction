No. 'Next-Gen' to me is awkward. I have too hard of a time believing that everyone got married, stayed happily married, and had a bunch of kids. The closest thing I'll ever come to a next gen fic is what I've done with the main characters living in their twenties and exploring that transition from school-adulthood. And honestly I feel like I'd just lose track of some of the characters and ages and the entire thing would be some sort of mess. I tend to shy away from subjects I think I'd fail at.

The other two questions are fairly subjective and can be affected by a variety of outside influences.

In an hour I can write up to around a quarter of a chapter in good circumstances. That's about five pages of single-spaced word document. I'd say I probably average around 1-2 pages in an hour. Dialogue is easier for me than prose, so dialogue is typically quicker. But there's always points when in an hour, I'll write two sentences and want to hang myself. It happens, it's the nature of the beast.

I counteract that with very good planning, so when I get to the writing portion it's easier. But it's not always a foolproof plan.

A day? Depends on the day. Sometimes I'm at a point where I'm lucky if I can spend 45 minutes to an hour on a chapter. Sometimes I get to sit down and spend five-six hours writing. I'd say on average a chapter, planning, writing, editing, takes about 30 hours of work. Some take more, some take less, and sometimes it takes me three months to find those thirty hours.
