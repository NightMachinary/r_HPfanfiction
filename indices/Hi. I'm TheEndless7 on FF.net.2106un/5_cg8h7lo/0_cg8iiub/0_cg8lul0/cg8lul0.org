I don't know if I find it too believable either, but I personally think it's the best for exploring daily Wizarding life as well as relationships. There's so much room to work with, and no Voldemort you have to stick in, unless you want to. I feel like it's one of the only things that's not done to death.

That's great that you can write that much in a day. I think the most I can do is maybe three hours and that's completely non-continuous. Maybe an hour continuous writing is enough for me, and I feel done. How much do you plan a chapter?
