At the start of the story I outline what I want the entire thing to be about. I then break that outline down into specific orders and parts and separate them by how I think they'll play out best when presented together.

I then write a one page summary of of each chapter, focusing on what will happen in the chapter and how characters will react to it. I revisit those summaries as I make my way through the story. But typically that one page frame stays pretty close. So the actual writing of the chapter becomes more the specific semantics of the themes I've already laid out.
