Hey, it's me. You know, that guy you constantly talk to on FF. I get to brag here that I'm a regular correspondent right? :P

Endless, I can't believe you did this. I'd be willing to bet that you will spend a good majority of your time explaining to everybody here how much you hate Letters, or, if conversations get longer, start debating random topics like the Afghanistan War (which I still don't totally agree with).

Anyways, I've asked the majority of my questions on FF already, but I do have one more. I'm fairly sure that published authors have blogs that aren't too different from this. So, what exactly is your beta testing?
