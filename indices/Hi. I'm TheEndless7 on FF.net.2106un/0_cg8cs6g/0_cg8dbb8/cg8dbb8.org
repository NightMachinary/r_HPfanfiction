In reverse order:

1. Not really, no. In my non fanfiction writing I tend to focus more on realism and the world as a whole. I love big cities and tend to focus original work in those settings. I'm fascinated by the 'modern world' and like to focus my efforts there. Oddly enough, this is something I don't really get to do in fanfiction.

2. I'm not sure it's particularly possible to answer that question. Inspiration can come from just about anywhere. If I get an idea, I usually write it down. Then I'll sit there and write points on what that idea could mean, or turn into. And somewhere along the line that turns into a story.

On the flip side, though, sometimes it's just a stray thought. I thought 'I want to see if I can write a story that is really multiple stories going on at once' and planned out The Quidditch World Cup. My wanting to see if I could do that came from Mary Shelley's excessive use of frame narratives in Frankenstein. So I suppose in a roundabout way, QWC was inspired by Frankenstein.

1. I'm a really passive writer when it comes to a question like that. I put forth pretty much no effort in self-promotion (one of the reasons why I suggested my beta get someone else for this). But here goes. I try to write entertaining, realistic stories. In the fanfiction I focus on realism in the context of a magical world. If that's something that intrigues you, then I think you'll like some of my stuff. If it doesn't, then you probably won't.\\

But I write largely to entertain. Yes, there are some stories where I'm trying to get at a larger point or make a commentary on something. But really my stories exist to be entertaining. My goal is to write something that will probably only take 6-8 hours to get through, and will be amusing and real.

I don't know if you'd consider that self-depreciating. But it's honest. I'm not trying to change the literary world. I'm not trying to have any sort of grand effect on 'the fanfiction community. My goal for me is to get feedback on my writing. Yes, in each story I'm working on something specific to take to original work, and posting it is a way for me to see if others think it's working or not. But really, I just hope people are amused by what amount to looks into what 'life' in a magical world at odds with modernity would mean. To accomplish my goals, I need people to read so I can receive feedback. To get people to read I have to present a polished, and entertaining product. So it exists, as a whole, to be entertaining for the reader.

I don't think that quite answers your first question. I'll think about it more and see if I come back to it.
