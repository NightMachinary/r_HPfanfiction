Thank you for the quick reply. That was a nice insight into the mind of a writer. I would like to add (what I forgot) that I enjoy your stories :)

I agree with what you said, and would like to add that Snape, at least according to JKR, being a teacher was forced by Dumbledore (he needed Snape around... Snape obviously didn't enjoy it), and I think the source of a lot of Snape's bitterness and anger was that he never got a chance to do something for himself in his adult life.
