JKR did say that the only reason Snape taught was because Dumbledore needed him there. Anti-social, vituperative and brilliant is just about the worst combination for teaching teens... think House teaching middle-school kids biology instead of working as a doctor. He could do it, very well, but everyone involved would absolutely hate it.

Ron and Harry got an E in potions when tested by outside officials, so Snape was obviously competent, but he also taught at least 24 hours a week, graded around 1000 essays a week, had duties as head of house, detentions to observe, and patrols at night; he would not have had free time unless you count summer and Christmas breaks.
