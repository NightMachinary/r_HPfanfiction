That's such a terrible thing to do to kids though. I have a hard time believing it would fly for over a decade. I'll buy that he'd rather be teaching another class, but forcing him to be a teacher is just a poor situation all around.

He didn't need him around enough to lock him in the castle year round. I'd like to think Dumbledore is smart enough to know that someone that actually flat out hates teaching is a terrible teacher.

I'd rather view him as harsh, 'old-school' and a bit of a dick but still capable and competent than completely incompetent and uninterested.
