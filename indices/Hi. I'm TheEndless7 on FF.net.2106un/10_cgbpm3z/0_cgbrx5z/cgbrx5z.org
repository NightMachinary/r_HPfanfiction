I only have one story where Sirius plays any bit of a role, and it's on the fringe at best. I don't have any story that features Snape. He has a line in Princess where he's kind of a dick, but that's purely because I think he's one of those teachers who is kind of a dick, but can use that to motivate students.

Honestly neither of the characters particularly interest me as a writer. But that's just me. If I had to discuss it I'd say that James and Sirius probably were bullies and if I wrote about them in school they wouldn't be particularly nice people.

I don't think Snape became Snape because he was bullied though. I think that, and what little we get from Lily's commentary in a memory, he probably gave it back a good deal. And we certainly see the roots of 'pureblood bigotry' even when he's just talking with Lily before Hogwarts. I'd agree he's more complicated than that.

I don't; however, think that spying makes him 'the bravest man I've known' and Rowling's attempts at vindication came across too heavy handed. I think he's better left in a gray area of wasted opportunity and missed dreams. Deep down, I think he knows he could have had a happy life with Miss Evans had he been a bit of a better person growing up. It took him too long to realize that what he was being faulted for, were really his own faults, and by that point it was too late.

And I don't think Snape's 'hatred' of Harry comes from any from of hatred of James. In fact, he's perfectly passive on James's death. I think it comes more from Harry representing everything that Snape could have had (Loving wife, family) had he been better. Harry is a physical manifestation of his own failures as a human being and he does not know how to cope with that. I mean Snape desperately wants to see Harry as James, but Harry is not the boisterous, charismatic bully leading around a pack of students. He's the introvert with few friends. Harry is far closer to what we know of Snape than what we know of James. And I think that hurts all the more.

If I had to answer the question more bluntly I'd say it's likely because it's harder to write a three-dimensional character. It's easier to have 'good vs evil' and to make teenagers miniature clones of death eaters and then another side thwarting them. People want the characters they perceive as 'good' to be wholly good. So anyone associated with Harry must be a saint. And so the Marauders are saints. You'd then need a villain and Snape is the logical possibility.

It boils down to that writer probably doesn't want to believe any fault in Harry or Harry's family. I don't want to say that's bad writing, but at the very least it's inexperienced writing that makes everything more one dimensional than it should be. It's an easy way out that's typically more 'fun' for the writer doing it because they don't want to focus on the real world ramifications of character actions. There's nothing inherently wrong with that in Fanfiction. In fact, that's arguably the point of fanfiction, but it can leave some readers, as yourself, with a bad taste in their mouth.

I hate to think of the type of responses that people that 'bash' the marauders or 'praise' Snape get. I know I've been review yelled at for having characters do things that aren't as perfect as the audience would like and can only imagine how bad it could get. Of course, with the serial nature of fanfiction they can't simply turn the page and look for the motivation.

Kinda rambled there. Hope that sort of at least provided some insight.
