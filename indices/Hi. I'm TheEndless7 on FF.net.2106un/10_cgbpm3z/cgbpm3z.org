I have a question to fan fiction writers, and you specifically, because this pains me a great deal as Sirius Black and Severus Snape are my favorite characters:

Why is it that in nearly all stories, either the Marauders or Snape get horrible treatment by the writers?

Snape is either a combination of pathetic and evil or the misunerstood superman, and on the flipside, the Marauders can do no wrong or are a bunch of violent thugs in every story I read. Lupin admitted that the Marauders went too far and he knew they did wrong yet never stopped him, James stopped hexing people for fun only in his seventh year, and Sirius was deeply troubled and vindictive... while Snape was the stereotypical story of the disenfranchised and bullied turning to racist ideology for a sense of empowerment and while became utterly loyal to the other side, yet bitterness and anger defined him until his death.

It hurts me that (nearly) the only time Sirius and Snape are treated well is in slash stories where they get involved (on a personal more note: eww).
