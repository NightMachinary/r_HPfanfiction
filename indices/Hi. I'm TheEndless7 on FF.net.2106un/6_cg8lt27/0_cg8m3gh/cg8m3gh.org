Why not?

He's just an original character that was needed to fit a few purposes in Letters that kind of grew on me. I both like the name Titus and the name Button. It fit in with the exceptionally poorly executed F1 theme in Letters. It amuses me that people have asked me where he appears in Canon when he does not.

I use a lot of the same characters in Fanfiction because they're little more than names and it's easier than constantly coming up with original names It's kind of cheating, and I won't do it in original works, but here it works. Eva (Eve) Larson, Sophie Sinclair, and Jason Williams all appear in at least three of my works as well.

Titus, in my more 'adult' works just winds up as a 'adult' friend to Harry. A sort of entity where he can be a twenty-something in peace and not worry about what happened in the past. He's a separation from the 'Hogwarts friends' where Harry doesn't have to meet those expectations anymore....if that makes sense.
