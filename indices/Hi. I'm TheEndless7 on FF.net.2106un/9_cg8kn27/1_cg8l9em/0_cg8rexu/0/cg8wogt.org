DiP is sort of a Luna story. Sort of not. I don't know if I can write a legitimate Luna. I took a cop out world-wearly route with a very depressed girl in QWC, and I don't know if it would work well in another setting.

If I did plan another story that took place in Hogwarts, Luna would probably be heavily involved. But it's something that I haven't really thought too much about at this point.
