So when I went to reply I hit your name rather than reply and had your post history and I gotta say. I'd keep Gio. I don't trust Alex Gordon and always thought Gio was a beast. Gordon is 30, and his OPS has dropped rather a lot in the last two seasons. Gio is gonna get you 200 innings, k 200 guys, and have an era in the low 3s. He could win 20 with some luck. I'd keep Gio.

Moore's a good talent, but he's less proven than Gio and he's never gone nearly the innings Gio has in the last four seasons.

I doubt I'll ever write a H/HR. I don't really like Hermione as a whole and I feel that Harry would grow apart from that after a while. So I can't see me writing a story that puts the two of them together in any meaningful way. I also prefer a sort of 'trio!friendship' type dynamic for all three of them anyway. I only have Ron/Hermione together in some post Hogwarts things because it allows me to say it's sort of Canon compliant.
