The name sounds familiar and the familiarity is usually something I only recognize from reviews considering how little reading I do. But you do bring up very accurate points. Still, traffic stat wise, Letters received almost double the hits as Princess did when they were posted. And Princess was almost double what VP is now.

What do I gain from this? Write stories about Harry sleeping with a hot French girl while at Hogwarts if you're interested in reviews!
