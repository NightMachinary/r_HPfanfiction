Review counts are not the best indicator any more. Especially if you post regularly or irregularly. Most readers tend to read the whole thing and then "maybe" leave a (Post more please) review at the end; or a summary of their feelings on the story as a whole.

I try to pay attention to traffic stats on ffn instead, and remind myself that I'm writing FOR ME mostly. Because HPFF is dying and I've read most of the GOOD and COMPLETE stuff.

I'm pretty sure I've read your stuff before, but I never kept a log (wish I had). Next time I am not writing, I'll give your stuff a shot to remind myself.
