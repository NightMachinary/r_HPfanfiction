Well hey, when you do I hope you enjoy it.

Fanfiction is sort of oddly decentralized. I don't know if I'd consider myself that popular or acclaimed. I'm a relative newcomer compared to many that write it. And there's certainly more talked about stuff than my own, and stories with over twice the reviews. I think it's just a matter of everyone's own taste.
