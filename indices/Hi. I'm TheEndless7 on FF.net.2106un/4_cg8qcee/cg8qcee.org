What's odd about the fanfiction community is how decentralized it is -- I've been reading for years and have almost certainly encountered your work at some point but for some reason have never read it or remembered it. But everyone on this subreddit seems fairly familiar with you/Letters. I wonder if I take for granted that /my/ favorite fic writers are popular and acclaimed.

Anyway, next time I feel inclined to binge through some fanfiction I'll start with your work.
