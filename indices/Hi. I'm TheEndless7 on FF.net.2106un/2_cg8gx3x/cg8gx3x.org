I absolutely love Letters! I still read it every once in a while. I really think it's one of the best Harry/Fleur fics, it's very real and believable.

Which story of yours are you most proud of?

Is there a story or concept you are really excited about writing about but can't seem to flesh it out properly?

What is the thing a lot, or even some, writers do that absolutely infuriates you?

For some reason every time I read the words, "X character's eyebrows shot up in surprise", or something to that effect. For some reason it just seems so over used to the point where it doesn't make sense for people to have that strong of a reaction to often times the simplest of things.
