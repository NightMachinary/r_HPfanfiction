Thanks for reading.

The Pureblood Princess by far. There's a lot about Letters that I don't like and feel I could have done better. And I think I stylistically limited myself too much in QWC. I went in saying '6 chapters, 10,000 words a piece' and left out pretty much half of what should have been the story.

Princess was an exercise in something I'd never really done before, and I ended up really liking how it turned out. It was just a plus that I got PMs from teenage boys flirting with me because they thought I was both sixteen and female at the end! ...wait...that came out creepier than I thought.

As a whole I liked how I felt that it seemed more like actual school and more like life. I feel like I developed the relationship in it in a pretty good, realistic teenage way. I liked how Daphne's compartmentalization of her relationships came off, and I liked the running cyclical, duality, theme that went through the entire story.

There's parts of Vitam Paramus I'm really proud of to this point. But I'll reserve judgment on that until I've finished it because a lot there hinges on the ending.

I'm certainly not one to comment on repeated writing ticks. My characters smirk, smile, laugh, and shrug just about every other line of dialogue. I'm working on it, I promise! So that would be hypocritical of me.

The only thing that will really turn me off from reading something is if there's just a blatant disregard for presentation, IE lack of paragraphs, things not punctuated right, visual stuff mostly.

Concept wise I really wish the 'super!Harry' thing would just go away. Or at least for the author's that do it to realize that there's no point in a super-powerful main character unless the villain is equally powerful, or more powerful. Superman is really boring without Lex Luthor.

I honestly don't read a lot of fanfiction. I don't have a whole lot of free time and in what I do I prefer to write rather than read. So my 'favorites' come from a very select list and if there's something I exclude it's probably pretty much because I haven't read it. But I'd have to say pretty much anything by Jbern. Particularly Bungle in the Jungle.

I'm a pretty mellow reader though. I'll typically read anything and as long as the grammar is readable I'll enjoy it. I'm sure there's probably fanfics out there I should read. But when my options are write chapter 21 of VP or read something. I'm going to write every single time. Selfish of me, I guess.

As for a story concept I can't flesh out properly? Tenebrae Vincunt. I've written chapter two five times and it's never managed to be worthy of posting. There's a lot I want to do with T.V (some of which may even be in a previous response here >.>) that I can't seem to get down in a way that will make sense.
