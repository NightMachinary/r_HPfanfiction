That's partially my point. As something quick and entertaining, they certainly serve a purpose. But for a longer, more thought out story, everything becomes sort of pointless if it's just 'let's wait around for Harry to fix it.'

I mean we all know Harry's going to win in the end. But at least place that doubt for me. Make me think that maybe, just maybe, this villain can beat him. Really, have the villain win a couple of times throughout the story. Then, at the end, have Harry triumph. That makes a much better story than a superhero checklist. More fun to write in my humble opinion, too.
