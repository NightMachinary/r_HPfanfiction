Abused kids rarely want to stand out because they've had it reinforced that attention always leads to something bad happening.

You can try to read it as "ah hah, now the obsession with the appearance of normality is on the other foot, ironically" but it's really just him trying to avoid attention that's always been negative. He'd literally rather deal with another troll than have to face everyone in the hall suddenly looking at him, regardless of why they're doing it, because in his mind it's /always/ negative.

It's not unlike how Harry goes from getting in trouble for upstaging Dudley at school (which, I know, not that hard) and thus being at least a moderately okay student, to perpetually trying to hide his academics behind /Ron's/ as soon as he gets to Hogwarts, no matter how excited he was to learn magic. He's afraid of being rejected if he does better, because that's what he's been shown will happen.

And while Ron's not the best student, half his problem is being given a worn-out non-matched wand and having never set foot inside an actual school with curriculum before being shipped to Hogwarts and expected to independently research and write essays with no further instruction. Harry has neither of those problems holding him back, the only excuse for him to do just as poorly is because he's /trying/ to.
