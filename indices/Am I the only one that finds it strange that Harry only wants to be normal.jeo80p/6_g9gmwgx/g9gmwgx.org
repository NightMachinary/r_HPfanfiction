It's not strange, for Harry to want to be normal, he grew up with the Dursley's, after all. And they strived for being normal (which in turn, made them not normal)

Plus, year after year, at Hogwarts, crazy stuff happened, that no one should go through. It'd make sense, he'd want some normalcy in his life.
