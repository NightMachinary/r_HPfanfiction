Harry doesn't want to be 'normal'. He doesn't like being famous because of something that happened to him as a baby. I don't think he minds people recognising him for his own achievements - he's happy to be known as a good Seeker, for example.

He just doesn't like being 'the Boy-Who-Lived' because it reminds him that his parents were murdered and he had to grow up with muggles who hate magic and don't seem to like him overly much either.

I think his main issue is that he doesn't want anyone to put him on a pedestal, he doesn't want to be seen as some sort of messianic figure because in his own mind he's just doing what anyone else would do in his situation. I think in many ways Harry sees himself as just an ordinary bloke forced to do strange things, but everyone else sees him as an extraordinary figure on the level of ancient heroes and mythological figures.
