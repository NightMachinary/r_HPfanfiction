That's precisely why. At a subconcious level, Harry still seeks their approval. Some kids would want to be as far from "normal" as possible yes, but Harry is not one of them.

Then there's Hogwarts, Harry finds out he's a Wizard. Great. Then he finds out he's famous, some people want to worship him, others would happily see him dead. There's even an undead asshole specifically gunning for Harry. Not so great. Even as a Wizard he stands out. If he were "normal" none of this would happen(to him). If he were normal, chances are he'd have his parents, more siblings, his godfather, etc. I for one can't blame him.
