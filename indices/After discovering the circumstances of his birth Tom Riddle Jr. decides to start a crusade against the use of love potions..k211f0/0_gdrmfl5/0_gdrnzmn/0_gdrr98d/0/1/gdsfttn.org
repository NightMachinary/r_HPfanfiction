  It has been an unending source of frustration that Dumbledore didn't see a troubled child raised in a shit environment and instead saw Son of Satan in 11 year old Tom Riddle. What a terrible message to send to readers: once you're bad, you're always going to be bad, there's no hope for you.

This sort of thing is why I find the Evil Dumbledore trope as it is usually written so unappealing. What need have you of thefts from vaults and plots to be the next merlin when there's perfectly-portrayed Banal Evil like this right there on the page where JKR wrote it?
