See often Evil Dumbledore is like a bashing thing. And that's why I don't like it. I don't hate Dumbledore either but I do see alot of potential in antagonist Dumbledore or villain Dumbledore if you continue to keep him in character and its not bashing. Haven't really read anything like that but I do like the concept. Because he is in a position to be a really interesting antagonist.
