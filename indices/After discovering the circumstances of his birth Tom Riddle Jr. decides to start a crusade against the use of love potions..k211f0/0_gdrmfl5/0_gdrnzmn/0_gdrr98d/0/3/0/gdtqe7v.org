I don't buy the argument that someone born in a different time should be excused for a lack of compassion. People have literally always been the same drama-filled, anxiety-prone, foolish-in-love, compassionate human beings since before written history. A dickhead has always been a dickhead. Dumbledore was a total judgmental dick to a child.
