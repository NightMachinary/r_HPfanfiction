This particularly interesting since we hold up Harry as a complete opposite because his parents loved him. But he didn't get much love from 18 months until almost 12 (when he met the Weasleys or maybe later). I always imagine he had major work to do to become a well-adjusted adult himself. Some day I'll write the fic.
