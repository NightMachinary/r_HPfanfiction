Ya I think the implication is Riddle also didn't really find friends in school not any real friends any way. Which if Slytherin had a culture of pro blood purity back then makes sense. He was as far as he knew half blood . He was pretty sure his mom was a muggle and he had no recognizable last name. Its kinda weird to me that he ended up a blood purist. Why support a belief system that is designed to be bad to people like you? Why would you instead not be bitter about being treated as worse than the pure bloods who you aren't recognized as to begin with?

Woulda made much more sense if he was pure blood tbh and was recognized as such.
