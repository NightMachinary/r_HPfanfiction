It has been an unending source of frustration that Dumbledore didn't see a troubled child raised in a shit environment and instead saw Son of Satan in 11 year old Tom Riddle. What a terrible message to send to readers: once you're bad, you're always going to be bad, there's no hope for you.

I'm a sucker for time travel fics where Tom gets raised by people who give him a chance to /not/ keep going down that destructive path; I love exploring the idea of what a little positive reinforcement from early on would've done instead of the same suspicion and distaste he'd been viewed with his whole life.
