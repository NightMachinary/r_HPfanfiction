I have always been a fan of Tom not particularly caring about pureblood ideology, but instead deciding to use the purebloods as an easy way to gain power and a backing.

For a Tom that grew to despise purebloods this would make sense in that he could use the purebloods to destroy their own society, and even if he did not particularly care about purebloods and their traditions, it is still an easy way for power.

This would still make sense for a Tom that wanted to get rid of Love Potions. For this plan to realistically work it would be best to completely burn the culture and society to ground and rebuild it from there. A culture like the Wizarding one is long lived with the traditions deeply ingrained into the society. Because of that, that choice to change things peacefully from the 'good-side' would be seen as the risky and non-effective choice from a person like Tom.
