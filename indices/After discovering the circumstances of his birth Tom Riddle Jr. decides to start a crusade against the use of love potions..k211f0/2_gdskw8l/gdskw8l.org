"You stand at the death stone of a man. A man that was violated in the worst way imaginable. A man that was forced to love, love his tormentor. A man, who fathered me, unwillingly, unhappily."

Harry watched Voldemort closely, his anger dimming away into a smidgeon of curiousity.

"I was given life by a witch so desperate for a man, she stooped to the lowest of depths known to the Wizarding World. A love potion. Salazar Slytherin would have rather cut his own neck than see his seed rot so much."

Voldemort kept pacing back and forth. Pettigrew flailed around in the graveyard, his throat hoarse from screaming, blood flowing from the untreated stump of what remained of his left arm.

Harry was stuck in the stone statue, his wand safely in the robes of his enemy.

"And so, Harry Potter, I refused." Voldemort looked Harry in the eyes, and his head started pounding in pain. "I refused to accept this cruel world. A world that would allow me to exist. And so, I changed." He breathed in. His slit tongue tasted the air, slithered around on his face and finally retreated into his mouth.

He summoned his wand from his robes and gave it a whirl. "Arvada Kedavra!"

Pettigrew stopped twitching.

He laughed. "Oh, my control remains. Thank Salazar!"

He then turned and again faced his foe. "Harry Potter. Thrice I have offered you peace. And thrice you have spat on its face. I don't take rejections lightly. But I am willing to give you this one chance."

He walked upto the statue holding Harry, brought his wand close to Harry's neck, and whispered, "There is more than one way to break a man's heart, you understand that, don't you? Are you willing to let your friends be killed? Oh, I can only imagine how toturous of an end it must be, days or months under the Cruciatus Curse. Can you see your friends suffer that?"

Harry's anger came back with a vengeance. "You maniac!"

"Oh I can already see it. Doesn't dear Lucius have a son in Hogwarts? How easy it would be, a little Imperius Curse here, a little Amortentia there. You friends would walk to their death on their own free will."

He laughed again, turned and started walking away.

"Your own father suffered due to this, this love potion," Harry screamed, "How can you use them?"

"For all their faults, Muggles give some ingenious words of wisdom. 'A soldier stabs just as well with the enemy's sword.' they say. And I, Harry, am a soldier." He dissaparated away.
