He wasn't a prankster at all, and one thing I really hate in fanfiction is when Sirius 'falls over laughing' at Harry pulling such an amazing prank on Malfoy or something by... getting better marks than him.

That being said, when it is done properly, it can be a great lighthearted addition to a story to make it funnier. The prime examples of this are Nonjon's works, primarily A Black Comedy but also Brown Coat, Green Eyes to some degree.
