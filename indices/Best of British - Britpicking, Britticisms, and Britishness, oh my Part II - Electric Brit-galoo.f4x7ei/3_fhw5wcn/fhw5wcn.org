In general I assume that the dropping of "to" in expressions like "write to me" is an American habit, but I may as well check this.

Also, OP, did you play Tapuwai at a British school? I assumed before you'd simply had a Northern teacher but now I'm wondering if Tapuwai is more widespread than I thought.
