I did, though not overly regularly. I've never been formally educated outside the English schooling system. But really, It was more of a "Siiiiiir! We're bored of rounders, let's do something fun!" sort of event. I've no idea where he picked the game up, but we never asked. He was a bit young to have travelled overmuch, but I suppose he could've done a summer camp or something and seen it then. No confirmed idea though.

To be honest, I have no actual idea if he was Northern-born, or if he was just taught English by someone with a ridiculously pronounced Northern accent - we never really discussed his point of origin.

It's a bit of an iffy question here (or at least it was in my experience back in the late 2000s, feel free to weigh in, other English folk) since we've had long periods of immigration and someone who might look Asian or African or Polynesian or whatever other Cosmetic Stereotyped Association could've been born in Birmingham for all you know - an experience I've definitely defended locally-born friends from before a good eight or nine times? (That "Go back home!" line people always shout always makes me laugh at the inanity, because for all the yelling-person knows that's exactly what the person they're yelling at is doing - assumptions make an ass out of U... and some guy named 'Mption', after all :D).

If memory serves (I haven't seen the man in over a decade, so I could just be vaguely remembering him after a long sunny Summer holiday), he was also what I think is called 'Ambiguously Tanned' (?), so even supposing that on-sight judgement was accurate, it wouldn't really have worked for us inexperienced youngsters either.
