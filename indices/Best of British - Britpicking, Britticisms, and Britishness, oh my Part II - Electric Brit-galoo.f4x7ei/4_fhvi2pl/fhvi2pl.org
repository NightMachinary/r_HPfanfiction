I'm in Australia, and our secondary system aligns fairly closely with the UK system. We have 6 years (years 7-12), and our academic year starts in late January and goes through until late December. Most children start year 7 the year they turn 13, although some children start in the year they turn 12 if their birthday falls in the first half of the year. Most students are 18 by the time they finish year 12. Our school holidays vary from state to state, but most states have 4 ten week terms with 2 week holidays between each term except for the end of the year, which is a 6 week holiday. I think Tasmania is the exception, with a 3 term academic year.

The house system is a thing here too, although most schools only apply it to the annual swimming, cross country and athletics carnivals. We also tend to have a student representative council that is made up of elected representatives from each year group. In the year 12 group, there tends to be 2 school captains and a number of prefects. They have regular meetings and act as an intermediary between the student body and the school executive.

We actually have one of the most segregated school systems in the world thanks to our pre-Federation history as seperate colonies and the rampant discrimination against Irish Catholics (many of whom were transported as convicts). In the state I live in public (government) schools make up 70% of all schools, Catholic schools make up 20% and Independent schools make up the remaining 10%.

A lot of people will refer to both Catholic and Independent schools as private schools, but most Catholic schools are low-fee and have more in common with the public system in terms of ethos and resources with the obvious exception of religious education. In saying that, scripture classes are a thing in many public schools on an opt-out basis. A lot of the high-end Independent schools that have been around for a long time are even more aligned with the UK system in terms of uniform standards, the house system and use of prefects. My husband went to and taught at such a school, and he said one of the major roles that prefects played at his school was uniform monitoring. Prefects were able to give house demerits and detentions to students who were not wearing their uniforms correctly, and generally had more of a disciplinary role. I was a prefect at my public school, and my role was purely representative.

It's interesting, because the way that schooling is represented in the Harry Potter books actually has more in common with the Australian system than what I understand of the UK system.
