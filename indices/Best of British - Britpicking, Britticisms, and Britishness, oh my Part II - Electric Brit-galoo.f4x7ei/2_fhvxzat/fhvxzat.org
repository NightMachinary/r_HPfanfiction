Honestly the main tells that the writer isn't British or trying to britpick their work are: pants instead of trousers (honestly it's ridiculous how often this one confuses me and makes me picture a scene wrong); sweater instead of jumper; talking about sweets or similar that we don't have in the UK and of course the classic relocating the characters to the States so they don't have to bother trying to make it British.
