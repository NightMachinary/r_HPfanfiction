  pants instead of trousers (honestly it's ridiculous how often this one confuses me and makes me picture a scene wrong)
#+end_quote

I can't remember if it's from Discworld, The History Boys or Witch Week but it's about PE or some sporting thing and the dude in charge says something like, "Any boy without his kit WILL PLAY IN HIS PANTS". Which sounds to me like a completely weird thing to say until I remember pants aren't trousers in whichever thing it is.

(A reverse example would be Plankton's weird pride in being college educated... everyone is! it's compulsory. Of course, that was before I knew Americans don't use college to refer to secondary school.)
