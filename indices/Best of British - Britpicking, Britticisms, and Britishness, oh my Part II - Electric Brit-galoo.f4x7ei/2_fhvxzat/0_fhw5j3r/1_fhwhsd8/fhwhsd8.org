You know, secondary school is compulsory in most countries today, but it hasn't been that way for very long. My grandfather stopped going to (American) school after 8th grade so that he could help out on the farm. My grandmother dropped out when she was 14 in order to go to work because her parents couldn't afford to feed all their kids and she was the oldest.
