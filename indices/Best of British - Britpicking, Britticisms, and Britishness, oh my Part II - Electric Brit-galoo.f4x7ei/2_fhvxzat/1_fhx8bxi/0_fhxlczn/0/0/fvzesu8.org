I loved that “American in Tower” quote above and I've met somewhere Harry coming in the middle of the night in the Burrow down and finding Ginny, who also couldn't sleep, “wearing just her pyjamas, consisting of t-shirt and flannel pants”. And I was for moment really nervous how big eyeful Harry got (it was not THAT story).
