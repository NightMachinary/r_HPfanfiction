I could see that being the case since you mention it - I just know that it's something that I'd never catch haha. Pants being used for trousers is the meaning that instantly comes to my mind, and I'd have to add 'under-' to think of it as the underwear version. I know if I read Hermione looking at Harry 'wearing pants' and ordering him to put some clothes on, I'd be a bit confused - so I can imagine your reaction flipped!
