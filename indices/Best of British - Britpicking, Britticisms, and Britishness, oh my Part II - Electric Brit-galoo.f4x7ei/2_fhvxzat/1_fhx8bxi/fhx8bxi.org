  pants instead of trousers (honestly it's ridiculous how often this one confuses me and makes me picture a scene wrong); sweater instead of jumper; talking about sweets or similar that we don't have in the UK

It's funny, because that sort of britpicking is the one that is least important to me. It's usually the bigger ones that'd annoy me - using modern american slang, for instance, or everyone having a gun or the like.

I think the vocab bit of it comes from me reading the books in French originally - and so they were all translated anyways.
