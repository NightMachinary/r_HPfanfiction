They were originally public schools ie schools ordinary people could get their boys educated in as opposed to the nobs who educated at home with tutors.

During the Victorian era it got fashionable to send your posh kid so the schools were literally stolen from the poor and middling sort who were provided with inferior versions so the nobs could claim that they were not in breach of the founding charters of the schools, which were charitable in origin. They had the cheek to keep the name "public".
