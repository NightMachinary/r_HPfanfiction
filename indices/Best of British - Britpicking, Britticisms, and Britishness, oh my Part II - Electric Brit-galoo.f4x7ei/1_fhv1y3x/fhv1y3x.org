To add to the house points stuff, even my State (public) school has achievement points, just mainly for personal achievement.

Also, if you're ever going to refer to Hogwarts as a type of school, it's, oddly, called a public school, rather than private. This is because of the pre-Georgian population, read: the Bourgeoisie, naming them that. I'm not fully versed in the exact reasons why, but yeah, Hogwarts is a Public School, not Private.
