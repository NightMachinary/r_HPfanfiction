UK system:

- State school. Paid for by taxation, free to attend.

- Independent schools. Paid for by fees.

- Public schools. A highly exclusive subset of independent schools now associated with the upper class, the oldest schools in the country.

The history behind the name "public school" is that prior to that time, you were basically educated by tutors or the church, neither of which were open to the general public. The public schools were the first schools where (in theory) anyone could attend, so long as they paid the fees.

Those schools are now associated with the upper class, but at the time of their foundation they were not designed to serve the aristocracy but rather the merchant class. For centuries the true upper class continued to tutor their children privately. It was only really in the Victorian era that the upper class started sending their children to school.
