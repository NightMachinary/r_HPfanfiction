Public Schools in the UK officially refers to a group of originally seven schools which were allowed to be run exclusively by a board of governors (members of the 'public') as opposed to the crown, government or church. One of the original 7 was Eton, and they generally have the reputation of being for the aristocracy and upper classes. Private schools are schools that aren't funded by the government, I don't think they're necessarily fee paying, but most are. Lastly, state schools are funded fully by the government, though this comes with the caveat of not being allowed to set very strict entrance requirements.
