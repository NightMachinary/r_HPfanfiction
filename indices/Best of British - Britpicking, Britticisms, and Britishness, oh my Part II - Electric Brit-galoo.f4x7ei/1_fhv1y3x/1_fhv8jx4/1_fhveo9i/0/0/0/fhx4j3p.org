Not quite true, failing schools are forcibly converted into academies. The go to "recommendation" for inadequete schools is to convert them to an academy.

Free schools (basically new academies) haven't been schools before. Both of these tend to be involved in chains/clusters of schools and frequently include money siphoned into the private sector.

In theory, they have more freedom than local authority schools - certainly they can easily choose a different model to letters and sounds. It is very difficult for them to operate a different curriculum because they're still assessed for KS1 outcomes. I knew a school that tried to do a play based curriclum but then the children aged 7 were expected to do written exams. (KS1 SATS are voluntary but lots of schools do them to get a good rating.)

I've also worked in two local authority schools who rent out their halls and such, admittedly neither had a gym to be rented out like a secondary academy I visted. Then again, I worked in primary.

When Harry started school, none of this was the case though. Grammar schools (schools you have to sit the 11+ to enter) were winding down. About half had closed, but its reasonable to assume that there is a purposeful distinction between Dudley going to a private (independent) school and Harry going to the local comprehensive which would be bottom rung in a place like Little Whinging.

As a side note: there's nothing actually wrong with mixed ability comprehensive and most of them are streamed by ability anyway.
