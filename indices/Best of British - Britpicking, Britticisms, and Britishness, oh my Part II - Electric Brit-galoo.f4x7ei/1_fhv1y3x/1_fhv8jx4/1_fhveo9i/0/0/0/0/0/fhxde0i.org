Ah, until I month ago I worked in it so I know entirely too much. Although less about the latest Ofsted reforms (just whats in the news) as I moved to Scotland. Scotland puts England's "broad and balanced" curriculum to shame. They don't have Ofsted either and although HMI inspections exist there's not the same hang ups surrounding it.

30 years ago was before me too, so I only loosely know the dates. My school retained the 11+, danced and music selection though only a portion of students could be offered places that way.
