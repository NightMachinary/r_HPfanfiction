Yep that's pretty much spot on. There are a few other slight variations - for example state schools that receive a high enough OFSTED (like school inspectors) rating can be given academy status. An academy has more freedom with what it does, including the key stage 3 (year 7-9) curriculum, but it's expected to be more financially self sustaining. They still can't charge fees, but they can be funded by renting the grounds out to sports clubs and such after school hours, or by fundraising events.
