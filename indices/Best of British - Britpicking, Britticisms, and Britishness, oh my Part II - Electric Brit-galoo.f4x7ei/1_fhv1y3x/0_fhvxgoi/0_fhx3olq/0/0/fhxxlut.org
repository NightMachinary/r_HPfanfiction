Yep, In-Service Training days. In Scotland they just call it In-Service.

There's 5 in England (and Wales?) and 7 in Scotland. Usually the days are set by the local authority so the schedule varies from area to area. I /think/ academies and free schools can set their own, but don't quote me on it.

Some schools (mostly secondary) use "twilights" which is where pupils finish an hour or two early and the teachers stay later to reduce absence. Pretty sure a study showed it was actually worse than having days off.

Almost everywhere has INSET on the first day of the school year. My secondary put three of them at the start of the year and then twilights for the rest.

I have heard of an area that trialled INSET at the end of the year and then straight back to school but I suspect it may have be a "a friend of a friend" myth. I'd avoid the end of the year for fics.

Otherwise it tends to be tacked onto the end of a school holiday or bank holiday, less freauently its at the the start of the holiday or even just attached to a weekend.

I've only got knowledge of four local authorities, though.

If in doubt - September, either October (not relevent to Hogwarts) or January, April (Easter) and sometimes May.
