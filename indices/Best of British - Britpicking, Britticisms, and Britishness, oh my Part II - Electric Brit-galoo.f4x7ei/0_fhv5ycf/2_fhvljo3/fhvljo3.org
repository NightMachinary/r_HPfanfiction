The problem is, it's all so subjective and inevitably all us Brits start arguing with each other. I remember being absolutely baffled on here when another Brit was genuinely suggest Harry use slang like "wagwan" and "blud", but for that particular Brit that was the vocab he had grown up with in his corner of the UK.

British slang is so nuanced and complex and varies so massively from area to area that your best bet is to be online friends with a brit or two to pepper them with questions.
