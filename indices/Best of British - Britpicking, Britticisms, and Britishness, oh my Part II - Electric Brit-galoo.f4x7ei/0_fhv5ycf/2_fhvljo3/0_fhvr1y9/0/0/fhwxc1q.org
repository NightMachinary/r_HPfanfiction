I think it's a markedly American view, part of that whole 'comparing Europe to the US' thing when it's more like US to UK. Each country is varied all on its own, rather than each country being analogous to a state. Might be wrong, but it's the impression I always get when Americans talk about Europe. That the difference between Italy and France is like the difference between Washington and Oregon, for example.

To paraphrase Neil Gaiman, America is a land of geography. You go far away enough, and you can find almost anything. England is a land of history. You go far back enough and you can find almost anything.
