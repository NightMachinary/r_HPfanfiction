“Cesko” is the anglicized version. In Czech it is “Česko”, but we don't want to inflict our crazy language on unsuspected innocent foreigners. (And it is even more complicated ... Česko comprises three large regions: Morava (Moravia), Slezsko (Silesia), and them biggest of them is Čechy (in English, Bohemia), so Česko is the careful dancing around the distinction from Čechy (adjective “český”) so that Moravians are not offended)

BTW, talking about Irish-Italian ancestry, I spent five and half years in Boston, Ma. so I know a bit about this combination.
