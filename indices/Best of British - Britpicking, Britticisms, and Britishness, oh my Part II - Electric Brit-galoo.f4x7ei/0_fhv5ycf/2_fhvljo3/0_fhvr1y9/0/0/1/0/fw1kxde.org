I have to admit, I've never heard it called Czechia before. Though despite my interest in stories from the region (Libuse and her ploughman is a fascinating story :D), I've not been in a context to need a short name for the country.

I also have to admit, I only know any of that because I write Life is Strange fanfiction and I was very confused when the characters (all living in Oregon) kept referring to Portland being in Oregon, when google clearly showed Portland was in Maine. Took me ages to find out there was one in Oregon as well. :D

I wouldn't call Americans stupid for not knowing anything about the rest of the world, though. Just ignorant or uneducated, and highly jingoistic. But that's a very Young British perspective - we may sing the National Anthem, but we do it ironically. :)

Also, the correct answer to the question that young American asked you is 'A'. :D
