Fair point. I'm a little... crudely irreverent at times, so I tend to phrase things in that manner without really thinking about it.

Ah, my apologies for the confusion, but the language question was based on what Czech people would call the Czech Republic. German people don't call Germany Germany, for instance. According to wikipedia, you call it 'Cesko'? (Apologies, my keyboard can't do the accents and special symbols).

The Kosmas part was me joking that it sounded similar to the name of a fruity alcoholic drink favoured by young women.

And yes, I did know that about Cosmas and Damian, actually. I believe I mentioned in another chat we were having (on Benthamite Utilitarianism) that I'm Irish-Italian and the majority of my relatives are Catholic. Learning the mythology (angels and saints and such) was non-optional. :D

I've also taken a lot of inspiration from various Christian stories and mythologies for my own works over the years, both actual Prose and for D&D games. The Extremes of Aristotelian Virtues make for fun elements of villainy. :)
