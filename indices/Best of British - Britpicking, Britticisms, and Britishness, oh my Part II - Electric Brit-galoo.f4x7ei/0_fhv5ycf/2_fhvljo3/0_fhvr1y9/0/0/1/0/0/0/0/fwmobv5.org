I don't think Přemysl the Ploughman or Cincinnatus (or the biblical Gideon from the book of Judges) are “poor person becomes royal” trope. More like “simple person noble in soul leaves his job and serves his people as a king”.

Actually, Kosmas is not the Czech word (and it is completely weird in the current Czech language), it is Syrian in origin, but these are very popular Italian saints ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Cosmas_and_Damian]]).
