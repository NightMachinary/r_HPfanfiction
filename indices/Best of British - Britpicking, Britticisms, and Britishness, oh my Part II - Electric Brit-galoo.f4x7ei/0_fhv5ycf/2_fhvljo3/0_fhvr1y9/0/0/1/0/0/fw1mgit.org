Yes, Libuše is awesome, although the ploughman taking the throne is the trope coming from very far away; I was listening just yesterday about [[https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2008/11/7-the-roman-washington.html][Cincinnatus]], and I am certain the classical trained [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmas_of_Prague][Kosmas]] (the author of the Libuše myth) was aware of him.

And you had supported the Gaiman's quote, because the first thing you mentioned about Czechia is something from our history. ;)

Yes, the term Czechia is still hotly contested, but if you live in the country named the Czech Republic (or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), then you have to have tendency to ignore Irish (everybody does it all the time anyway, unless you live in Belfast) and call your country Britain (or Czechia) quite often.

And I love the answer about the capital of Africa.
