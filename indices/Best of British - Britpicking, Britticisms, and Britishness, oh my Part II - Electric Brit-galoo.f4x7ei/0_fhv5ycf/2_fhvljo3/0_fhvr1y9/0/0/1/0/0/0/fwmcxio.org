Indeed? I knew 'poor person becomes royal' was a common trope - if it makes it to Disney, it's certainly a thing across European mythology at least - but a ploughman specifically is interesting. I imagine it's Kosmos living in a time when plagiarism was equivalent to citation - the more ideas you took from those who came before, the more of their authority you held, right?

But ah, Kosmas. The hardest ancient writer to explain to my non-nerd friends - I keep getting "Omg, there's a writer called Cosmo? That's so cool." type responses (if you weren't aware, there's a fruity vodka cocktail called a 'cosmopolitan' and the short form is 'cosmo') and it's become something of a meme within that friendship group now.

Fair, though, about the country length thing. I guess 'CR' (or whatever the appropriate initials would be for the Czech way of saying Czech Republic) doesn't roll off the tongue like 'The UK' does. :)

And heh. Yeah. You really have to love a smart-arse answer. :)
