Oh, this is a lovely quote! Thank you. Oh yes, and =s/England/any country in Europe/= (my Czechia very much included).

And yes, one young American asked me what was the capital of Africa. And before we, Europeans, start to snigger how Americans are stupid (or that they don't know what's the difference between Slovakia, Slovenia, and Slavonia), it is good to ask ourselves what is the difference between Iowa, Idaho, Ohio, and Indiana, not mentioning Oregon, and where is the other Portland.
