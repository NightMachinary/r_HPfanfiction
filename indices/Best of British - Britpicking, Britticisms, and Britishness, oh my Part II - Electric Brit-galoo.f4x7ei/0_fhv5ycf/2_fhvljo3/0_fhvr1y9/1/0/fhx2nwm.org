Nah it was 90s but in inner London among specific communities. The other Brit I was politely arguing with simply couldn't disassociate his own background from the context implied in the books. For him, everyone at his school was talking like that in the 90s, that was his normal and it probably didn't seem right to him that just a few miles away other British kids had never heard those words in their life.
