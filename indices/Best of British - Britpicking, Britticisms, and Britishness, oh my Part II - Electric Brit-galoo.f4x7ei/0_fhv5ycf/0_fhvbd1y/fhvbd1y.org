The AO3 Writers group on Facebook is pretty helpful with this sort of thing. Some American will ask “What's British slang for ‘drunk'” or whatever, and then the Brits in the group will argue, and the word one Brit says is used by teens will be shot down by a Brit from some other part of Britain as being used only by old people, and I'll get the impression that it's really complicated and I should write only American characters from now on.
