By area too! I jumped quite a big divide by moving from London/Oxford (which has a smaller difference except if you go to 'the Shire' - the countryside) to Edinburgh.

I came to the rather alarming realisation that 'mate' is used in a friendly way down South but is actually a threatening term up here. Whoops. (Pal, you want pal in Edinburgh.) Slang in Edinburgh is VERY different to London.
