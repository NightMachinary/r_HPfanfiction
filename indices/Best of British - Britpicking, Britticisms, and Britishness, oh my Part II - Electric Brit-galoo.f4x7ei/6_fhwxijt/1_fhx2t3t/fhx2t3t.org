It depends on the county, some places still do it. The county I grew up in didn't, so I had never heard of it until I was in my teens, but my little sister really wanted to go to a particular grammar so actually went and did it independently and travelled to the next county every say to go to school. Nerrrrrrd.

In general though, the 11+ started to be dropped in the 90s.
