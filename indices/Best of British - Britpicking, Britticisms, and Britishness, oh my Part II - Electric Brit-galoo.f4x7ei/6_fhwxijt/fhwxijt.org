To go on the Education thing, I also have a question because I can't remember the answer - Does anyone remember when we ditched the old tripartite/11+ system or have any notes on their experiences with it? I know it was before Harry was born, but I'm making this comment quickly before I leave the house and don't have the time to google it all.
