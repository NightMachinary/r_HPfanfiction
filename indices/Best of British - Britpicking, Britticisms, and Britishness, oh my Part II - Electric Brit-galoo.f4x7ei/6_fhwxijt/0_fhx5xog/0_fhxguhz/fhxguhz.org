I thought it was half of grammar schools closed by late 1980s, but the technical schools were closed earlier leaving a situation with grammar schools and comprehensive schools. I applied to a grammar school in ths 2010s for sixth form so there's still a few (literally) kicking about.

The school I applied to still uses the 11+ for it's entire intake, although the 6th form is done by achievements outside of school and GCSE grades.

I decided to pull out.

I also did a varient of the 11+ for my own secondary school although they had a complex mix of intake brackets. Exam, dance or music selection, looked after children, SEN statements (incidently, me as I just missed the score) and a portion who lived within a mile of the school or something like that. It was a semi-selective comprehensive and not a grammar like the 6th form.

Not disagreeing just defining "most".
