  Does anyone remember when we ditched the old tripartite/11+ system
#+end_quote

Gradually from the beginning of Harold Wilson's government in 1964, with most grammar schools being closed under Callagan and Thatcher. There's an interesting bit of political history where most Labour members support comprehensive school, but Wilson (who himself escaped a background of poverty through a grammar school scholarship) ended up as one of the strongest supporters of the tripartite system in constant conflict with his own cabinet and party over it. As a consequence, despite Labour policy under Wilson being to move to comprehensive, because of Wilson's own opposition nothing really happened until Callagan took over, and most grammar schools were closed in the late 70s and early 80s. Northern Ireland lagged behind and still had tripartite education until the early 2000s.
