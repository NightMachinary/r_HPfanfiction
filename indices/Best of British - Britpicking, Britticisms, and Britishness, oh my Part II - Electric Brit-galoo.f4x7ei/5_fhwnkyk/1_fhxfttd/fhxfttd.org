Scotland favor Hogmany (NYE) over bonfire night. They have both, but... it's just not really a thing. I was surprised when I moved up here.

I'm not sure if they had fireworks, but I know Edinburgh started their enormous street party in 1995. Think music festival level of street party. A few years later they had to start ticketing as 300,000 people turned up one year.
