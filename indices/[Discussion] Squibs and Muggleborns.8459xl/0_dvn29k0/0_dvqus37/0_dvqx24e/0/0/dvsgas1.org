It's /magic/. Just assume magic makes it work differently --- perhaps there's no literal gene there that a Muggle scientist could find in the wizard's DNA, maybe the "magic marker" is a purely magical trait that just happens to be passed down in a way superficially similar to Muggle genetics. Or perhaps it's something in-between. All we know is that according to Rowling there's a direct causal relation between a distant wizardkind ancestor and the birth of a Muggle-born wizard or witch.
