_______________________________________________________[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]]okay, personal review for me, I'm not much of a fan of the writing style, although it's a really interesting way of doing it, very deep pov I think, but it's so legendary in the fandom that I would be an idiot to not rec it. This is actually the first one that popped into my head, everything else be damned, when I read the first two words of your title. _________________________________________________ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826][survival is a talent]] I hesitate to rec this, but arc or no arc, it's a fucking brilliant fic. It really, truly is. They're just /so fucking adorable./ Personal complaint: they keep calling Draco's eyes blue, they aren't. They're grey. Or silver.

Even if it doesn't fit the arc you're looking for---honestly, The Man Who Lived might be the only one that'd be able to do that ever---it's a really great fic.
