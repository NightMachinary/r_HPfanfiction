I will agree with this, but I understand why a most authors don't. One--I *guarantee* that conceding that you have abandoned it will get backlash, and I totally understand authors not wanting to deal with it. I recently saw an author who completely walked away from the fandom where pushy, demanding, entitled readers had been hounding them incessantly. The review responses to being told the author was walking away were about a 50/50 split between "wow, really sorry to see you go, but understand you need to do what's best for your mental health" and outright personal attacks (granted, this was on FFN, but... *wow*, small wonder they were walking away). If you leave it open-ended there's always that sliver of hope.

Two--I think there's good contingent of authors who truly mean to return to it and just never get back around to it. Admitting you're giving up on something, even a fic, is hard, even if it's just for a hobby, even if the author has no obligation to continue if they're no longer interested. Something about that fic we once loved, once inspired us, and I think most of us find it hard to admit we just can't get to the end we envisioned, or don't have a plan, or have simply fallen out of love with it.

In the case of the author in question--she's only abandoned one story (out of nearly 60) that I see, and she did indeed, say she abandoned it and posted the outline. That is a completion record I aspire to.
