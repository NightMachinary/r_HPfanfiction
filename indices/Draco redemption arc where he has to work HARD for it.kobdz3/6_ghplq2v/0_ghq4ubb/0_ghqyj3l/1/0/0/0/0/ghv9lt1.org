As I stated at the beginning of my comment, I was only talking about authors that were intentionally stepping away from a story for a while. I have been subbed to stories that only updated once or twice a year, but the author had already stated that updates would be few and far between, which I have no issue with. There could be many reasons that an author does not update a story, but if an author wants to have readers to be invested in their work, they should do their best to be courteous to their readers. As a reader invested in a story, I would rather get a false chapter with a note from the author saying the story is going to be on hiatus for a while, rather than be waiting indefinitely for a chapter that may never come. This is one of the reasons why I tend to only read complete stories. Yes, it is a hobby, but that is no reason to be rude to your readers. - On the flip side to that, if a story has a note saying it is on hiatus, the reader should not be pestering the author for an update. Then again, readers shouldn't be pestering the author for an update anyway. I have also seen stories marked as complete, where readers are leaving reviews asking for an update. I just can't help but shake my head at those and wonder if they even actually read the final chapter. Then again, there is a one shot collection I have been reading on FFN, where the author has intentionally marked the story as complete, but still occasionally adds new chapters to it. I am not sure why they have marked it complete, when it is obvious that it is not, but is it is their collection, so they can mark it complete if they want.
