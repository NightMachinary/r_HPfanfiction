If the author has plans to come back to it, yet feels the need to walk away from it for a while, at least have the courtesy to leave a note saying the story is on hiatus for the time being. This accomplishes two things; 1 - It let's the readers know not to expect an update anytime soon. and 2 - The author doesn't get pestered as much with reviews and PM's asking for a new update, especially if it's been a while since the story was last updated.
