I disagree. For one, I think the people who /intentionally/ step away from works will usually tell us so by putting a fic on hiatus. I don't think most authors usually intend to walk away, or know that it's going to happen. I have seen a few authors who are like "I update when I update, leave me alone," but they're pretty few and far between. I am subbed to fics that maybe update twice a year. That's just the pace the author writes at. There's no good way of knowing that, and too many fic authors don't know when they'll get to something. Heck, few /professional/ authors are good judges of when they will be done.

Would it be courteous? Yeah, but this is a hobby, not a job, and we are not owed an author's work or their time--and this goes for pros too. We should also show the authors courtesy by not nagging for updates, no matter how well-intentioned. As for "telling your fans" if it's been awhile--your options are 1) updating the author notes 2) putting up a chapter to tell your readers or 3) communicate delays on other social media. People don't get notified when you update comments--you have to rely on them rereading. Most readers hate the false hope it gives them to see the update and see it's just an authors note, so that's as likely to get backlash as not, and following someone's social media requires a little time and energy on the reader's part. Not everyone reads author's notes anyway--I've had people ask for updates on a fic I explicitly marked as complete, but also posted an AN saying it really is complete (/at the time I originally posted it/). Without a little status indicator on the site that's easy to update, there's really no good way to notify your readers unless you know you're taking a hiatus at the time of posting. There are also the authors who are just unapologetic, chronic abandoners, who never bother to tell their readers when they abandon things, because they often simply don't know if it's abandoned.

It's easy to say "the author should tell their readers," but it's just not usually that straightforward. Acting entitled to an author's work is often a very good way to ensure you never get it.
