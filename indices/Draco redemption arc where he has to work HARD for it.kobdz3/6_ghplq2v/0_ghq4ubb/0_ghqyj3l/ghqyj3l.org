She's also got an excellent track record for finishing fics. When I found SIAT, I honestly assumed it was abandoned, and was stunned to realize it's just a slow update. Even if she never added another word, it's 360k of goodness that I really enjoy (speaking as someone who some of my all-time favorite fics are incomplete and abandoned. I still say they have value and I still love them for what they are).

I understand people who don't want to read WIPs and get upset when things get abandoned (which SIAT has not been), but I really, strongly disagree with this sense that authors in general, but fan authors specifically, owing their readers anything. I have seen too many really good authors chased out of fandom because for some reason they couldn't write fast enough or because, god forbid, a new property started drawing their interest or a new fic, and their output either slowed down or it was abandoned due to readers being jerks. It's a hobby, and for most authors, if people start getting pushy, the last thing they want to do is work on it.

To put it in perspective, a traditionally published author may publish one ~70-100k book every 2 years. That's a /normal pace/ for a lot of authors. A book a year is considered consistent output. SIAT has been going for 3 years, and has 360k, /and/ the author has started and completed multiple 100+k works (one of which was HP) in that same time frame. That is an /insane/ amount of writing. Of course we'd rather not wait, but at least she's an author who is super open about where she is, what she's working on, and that she got hung up in the outline for the current book.

Sorry if I'm coming across as a jerk, this just hit a nerve for me. There are few things more demotivating for fan authors than to be asked "when are you updating?" (and judging by GRRM and Pat Rothfuss, that's not a phenomenon related to just fan authors). Particularly for fan authors who get nothing but reader response in payment and have other jobs and RL interferes. And if she ever does abandon it, she will tell us. So until she does (which hopefully she never does), can we please cut her (and other authors who might not be updating our favorite stories as quickly as we wish), a little slack? I update my most popular fic weekly and just got a comment that I'm writing too slow. It's really down to reader perception isn't it?
