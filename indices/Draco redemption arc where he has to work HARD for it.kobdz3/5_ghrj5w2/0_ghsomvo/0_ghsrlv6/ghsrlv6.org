I find the concept creepy as well, since it's usually a ploy to have someone "fall in love" with a child. This one is amazing though! It is getting to the heart of Harry's neglectful and abusive childhood, and how Draco has changed, coming to terms with what he did and why it was wrong. And that the de-aging is here is related to criminals Harry is investigating as an Auror, not a trick from Dumbledore to give Harry a better childhood.

Another with minor Draco redemption is linkao3(7331278), where Draco is still growing and changing, still agonizing over how he really believed all the blood supremacy and he's not sure he belongs with the "good" side. I think that's one of the most important aspects of character growth for redemption fics.
