Away Childish Things by lettered is a good one. It starts showing Draco Malfoy how he is now, a more redeemed and mature man, years after being a spoiled child and bully. About two-thirds of the way through, you learn how he got there, what his life was like after the war, and how hard he had to work (no magic, working in the Muggle world since no one would hire him).
