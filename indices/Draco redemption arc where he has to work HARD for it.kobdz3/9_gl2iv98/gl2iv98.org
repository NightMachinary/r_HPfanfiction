- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad Says"]] is an EWE. Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there. I thought the writing could tend a bit towards the melodramatic, but I also stayed up until 1:45 a.m. reading it all in one go, so I kinda have to recommend it :-P It is complete.
- I also recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is a lovely little fluffy piece by an author who excels at writing lovely little fluffy pieces. In this one, Harry meets Malfoy working at a coffee shop in muggle London.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. Draco leaves everything he knows because he can't stomach it anymore. He has to come to terms with the fact that his parents, his friends, and the whole world he knows is populated with war criminals. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]] is a little similar in that Draco leaves and has to come to terms with his upbringing. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
