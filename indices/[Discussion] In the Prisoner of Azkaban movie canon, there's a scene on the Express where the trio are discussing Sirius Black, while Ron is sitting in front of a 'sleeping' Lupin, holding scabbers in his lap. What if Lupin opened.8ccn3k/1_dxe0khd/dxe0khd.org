I'm not sure Remus would see Ron's rat and go 'wait, could that be Peter?', mainly because of the whole thing about Peter being dead for 13 years (or so he believed).

But, I could see him looking at Scabbers and going 'huh, that reminds me of Peter'. And then he might go 'I had a friend who could, I mean, he had a rat like that once, I was just reminded of him', and from there that could be the catalyst that gets him talking about his school days with James & Sirius & Peter to Harry and co.

Although that line of chatting would probably be interrupted by the dementors searching the train, but maybe later Harry might seek Lupin out to hear the rest of his story, then when Fred & George ask where he went, he shares the tales Remus told and about how they created all sorts of enchanted items during their years at Hogwarts...including a certain map, which makes Fred & George realise that Remus Lupin is one of the Marauders.

And then, from there, Fred & George end up showing the map to Remus, who engages in a bout of nostalgia playing with it for a while...until he notices, overlaying Ronald Weasley's name on the map, is Peter Pettigrew...

...But then what? Would he rush to Gryffindor tower to retrieve and reveal the rat? Would he go tell Dumbledore about what he saw? And, would he hypothesise that Peter Pettigrew is who really caused the explosion?
