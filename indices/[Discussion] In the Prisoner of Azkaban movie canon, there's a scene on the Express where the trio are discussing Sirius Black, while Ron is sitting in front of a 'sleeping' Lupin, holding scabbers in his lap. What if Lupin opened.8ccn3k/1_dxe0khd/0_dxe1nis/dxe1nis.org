Yeah, I cam up with that as the most likely possibility pretty quick. But to be fair, the scene I'm talking about had Rog literally just going on about Sirius Black, and it's implied ish in the books that Lupin is fake sleeping, so from Lupins perspective, he's hearing this kid talk about Sirius, and he's imagining his memories of the marauders and the animagus forms, so his mind is already really leaning into the past, and he cracks open his eyes, 0.000001 seconds after having worn tails animagus form in his minds eye, to see... Worn tails animagus form. Obviously he's not immediately going to jump straight to 'worm tail is alive and Sirius was framed.' but he sees wormtails form, and since he's just been thinking of his form, his first thought is that he's imagining it, because wormtails has even dead for 13 years. And then he kind of mentally reality checks himself, expecting to open his eyes again and just see a wormtails look a like, because again, dead for 13 years, and instead sees... Still Wormtail. And what he thought was a vision or a hallucination isn't going away, that is literally wormtails sitting in front of him, but he still has to make sure, so he asks Ron if he can take a look, takes a look...and it's /still/ Wormtail. And now he's got taken readjust everything he knew, break it down and piece it back together again, and that's when he realizes what most likely actually happened that night.

It's a bit like when you see someone who looks almost exactly like someone you know that died years ago, and for a split second your mind goes, OMG IT'S THEM and then you reality check and realize you were just seeing things. Except in this case, it actually was them.

So it's less that Lupin saw a rat that looked a lot like Wormtail and immediately figured out that it was Wormtail

And more like Lupin saw a rat that looked a lot like Wormtail, went OMG IT'S THEM for a split second, then realized it couldn't possible be them, reality checked himself, looked again, but instead of seeing a rat that just looked a lot like wormtail, he was looking at a rat that still looked EXACTLY like wormtail. And then proceeded to check for himself, realize he wasn't going insane, that this actually was wormtail. Then the dementors show up.

ADDITION: human minds are programmed to look for patterns and familiar faces, that's why so often we see someone from the back, and we swear on all that's holy that it's Abby, then they turn around and it's not Abby. So if someone sees a cat who looks /EXACTLY/ like Abby, their dead cat, immediately after watching a video of Abby, the first thing they're going to assume is that they are literally looking at Abby the cat, then remind themselves Abby is dead and go cry in bed. But if that cat actually was Abby, it makes a lot of sense someone would immediately think it was Abby, only to snap out of it, then realize no wait that IS Abby.

I volunteer at a cat shelter, and sometimes I see a cat that looks so much like my cat oreo, that for a split second I actually think it is my cat, despite knowing full well my cats at home.
