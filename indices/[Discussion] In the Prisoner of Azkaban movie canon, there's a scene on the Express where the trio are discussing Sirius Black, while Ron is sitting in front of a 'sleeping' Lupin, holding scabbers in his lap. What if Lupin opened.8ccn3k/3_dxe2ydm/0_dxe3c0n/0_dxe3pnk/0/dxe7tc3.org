The dementer ex machina was just my way of cutting off my rambling, since I couldn't be arsed to write any more + my phone was about to die. It was also an attempt to add a bit of humor to the ramble, as well as acknowledge that if I'm counting from when ron says the line about serious black, there's about 60 seconds until the dementors show up. The whole remus talking to Ron situation went a bit longer than it should have, considering. So when I was done writing, I figured I might as well end it with the dementors showing up as they should have 30 seconds ago. I thought about adding a scene where Remus tells them to grab a prefect to get hold of staff or smth but was too lazy. Wasn't an attempt to seriously say that the dementors solve the problem or whatever.

As to the professor, I had thought that hermione identified him as a professor when she points out the trunk name, if not in the movie than in the book. But I could be totally wrong, I have shitty memory.

Remus referring to Harry by his name and mentioning his parents was me trying to give a potential example of Remus revealing himself to Harry as someone who knows the situation with Black and Pettigrew, to give a hypothetical jumping off point for a discussion between Harry and Lupin. Harry wasn't intended to recognise Lupin, if anything i intended him to be somewhat off put by Lupin knowing his name off the bat. After all, the whole thing was just supposed to be a hypothetical version of what could happen in that situation, not necessarily exactly what would happen. There's a lot of stuff that should have really happened that I left out. Hermione should have asked at least one question, and as I mentioned the dementors were late.

All valid criticisms though.
