Yes but not quite. There's no more official relationship between one's Patronus and Werewolfry than between Patronus and Animagus; it seems Lupin's Patronus would have been a wolf regardless of whether Greyback had bitten him or not. It's not a matter of being "outed". IIRC, Lupin's just come to loathe anything that reminds him of his condition.
