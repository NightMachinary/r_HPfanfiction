Makes sense. Although, if your patronus is something you consider to be a protective sort of icon, doesn't it make sense, in a sick sort of way, that for all Lupin detests his curse and would do anything to change it, some part deep deep /deep/ inside him considers it to be a kind of protection, a part of him that no enemy can escape from, not even himself?
