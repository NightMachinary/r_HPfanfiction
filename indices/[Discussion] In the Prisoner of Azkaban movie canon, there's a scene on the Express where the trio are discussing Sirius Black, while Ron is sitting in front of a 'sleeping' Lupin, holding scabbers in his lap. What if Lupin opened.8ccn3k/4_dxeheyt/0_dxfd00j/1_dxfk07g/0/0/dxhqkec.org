Note:I forgot to mention, in regards to the dragons, harry finds out like in canon, and tells Cedric.

Harry also has the mirror he canonically got in 5th year, so please internally change all mentions of him owling sirius and Remus to him using the mirror to communicate beginning in 4th year.

Also I can't believe I've said this before, but sirius absolutely makes harry go through therapy over his first 2 years at hogwarts. And the dursleys. His whole childhood really. And it's not like a punishment, Sirius is just so fucking psyched about therapy you have no idea. He wants everyone to be psyched about it as well. Of course he hated it at first, but because he got a therapist that really understood him, he grew to love therapy. He attempted to propose to his therapist at least twice. Probable 3 times. Remus suffers. Speaking of remus, Sirius eventually gets him to go to therapy as well. He is reluctant at first, because he doesn't like talking about his issues and doesn't want to burden people with them,but his therapist probably pointed out that they are quite literally paid to listen to people's problems, and they went through years of schooling to be able to listen to peoples problems, and honestly if he's not going to talk about his problems, he's wasting his (read:sirius) money. Remus learns to talk. I'd also really like to point out that I'm headcanoning that therapy culture is pretty much nonexistent. Like, in a world where almost any physical ailment can be fixed with a potion or wave of a wand, the idea of your mind being a problem is just not there. The only real time therapy happens when a doctor prescribes it because you're severely fucked in the head. The therapists are there, but a lot of people are probably surprised that kind of job exists. The Weasley's were given court recommended therapy mainly because the ministry was desperate to save face after their monumental fuck up. So sirius getting therapy is kind of a novel concept to begin with. But this guy just loves it so much, he insists both remus and harry get it. To remus, it's like having your life partner insist you try this brand new foreign diet they've been on, they feel so great on it, but he loves sirius so he goes anyways if only to get him to shut up. He goes to one or two sessions, then drop making any. He's goes to many more this 2. Harry, on the other hand, has heard of it in the muggle world, from the dursleys, but mostly in a negative light, the dursleys are of the opinion that all therapists are quacks trying to steal your money (says the used cared salesman), but he figures maybe Wizarding therapists are different, he'll give it a try, what does he have to lose. He loses very little, and gains very much.

-trio remains tight. Krum flirts with hermione. Ron's jealous obviously because he loves her and just doesn't know it yet, but he doesn't actively treat her like shit, especially the night of the dance. Maybe a berky comment here or there, but not so much as in Canon, and if she gets really upset he'll apologize.

-sirius gives a LOT of advice on getting a girl to go with him, like 3 pages, trying to figure which girls are taken which ones are interested in him. Consequently, he does not ask out cho, because he'll have bothered to ask around and see if she's dating anyone, most likely asks hermione. So he ends up asking the patils to go with him Ron. (this is because I think Krum/Hermione is an important relationship for her development as a character, and her self confidence. She can see herself as more than just brainy boring hermione Granger, she sees herself as a desirable girl. This is not to say she thinks her value is decided by a man, just learned that she has qualities considered attractive by a guy, and that she should be happy and confident about that. And I just honestly think ginny/neville is adorable. I'm still a Hinny maingirl, but I live gineville. I love how proud of himself is is with the dancing, that he can actually be good at something. He looks so happy after the ball, I couldn't bear to take that away.

-When harry mirrors his dogfathers about needing robes, he adds that Ron's robes look absolutely hideous. So sirius of course buys an extra set of Wizarding robes in Ron's size, and sends it with Harry's robes, including a note that explaining that they accidentally bought an extra in a larger size, but that the store doesn't accept returns, if he knew anybody that was the right size in need of a new set of robes, he should pass it on. And thus, Ron's dignity is saved.

-hermione goes with Krum, harry and Ron go with the patils, ginny and neville go together as per usual. Bright side to it, when sirius found out harry got a date, he sends a TEN PAGE essay of advice on hot to be a good date, make sure he has a good time, and make shire his date has a good time. Sirius mentions he should be a good bro and share it with Ron. Do harry shares it with Ron. So while now even though they aren't the pinnacle of perfect dates, they make a solid effort to be a good date. The patils have a pretty fun time, not perfect after all ron and harry probably at least unconsciously take a glance or to at hermione/cho, but they give most of their attention to the girls, and they have a fun time actually getting to go on a date with a girl. Hermiones night ends very well, having had a magical time with a guy who thinks her brain and looks are beautiful. All well that ends well.

-So for the sake of switching things up, because so little has changed, let's say harry mirrors his caninefathers explaining the egg, and Remus, having some experience with magical creatures from third year curriculum he taught, it maybe a line from when he took care of magical creatures in 7th year, says that the screaming he's describing sounds like mermaid language above water and that he should try opening below water. So harry goes to the lake, or sneaks into the prefect bathroom, something like that, listens to the egg, hears the song.

-tells remus and Sirius and hermione and ron, and Remus mentions some kind of plant he had heard of that could allow you to breathe underwater. Ron's goes 'neville's really into herbology, why don't you ask him?' cue harry in asking neville, neville telling him about gillyweed, and Sirius ordering a bulk order of it for harry to practice with. So harry gets a lot of time to practice, and has extra gillyweed in case he need more during the contest. Yes gillyweed is rare, but sirius is loaded and can buy whatever. So harry doesn't almost die trying to save everyone.

-when explain to sirius where he heard about the gully weed from, Sirius mentions his parents, and what happened to them, who he found out about when staying at st Mungos. Harry comments that he's really shy, but really brave. Remus who is there, wonders out loud at the difference and similarities between Peter and neville. How even when both teased by their peers, neville found bravery, while Peter found cowardice.

-this conversation strikes a chord in Harry, and he makes a point to compliment neville on his bravery in year 1, in standing up to the trio, that harry respects him for it and he doesn't think he ever told him that,and that neville deserves to hear it. Nevilles a bit stunned, and manages to ask what brought this on, and harry explains that his father and dogfathers (does not actually use that term) once had a friend who they teased more than they should have, but that instead of rising above the teasing and choosing to be brave, he fell to cowardice and that that cowardice cost his parents their lives and Sirius 12 years in prison. Neville is even more stunned, but thanks him. Harry makes it a point from then on to be friendlier to neville, spend some more time with him, not because he pities him, but because he respects and admires him. By the end of the year neville is solidly in the friend box, like ginny.

-Everything else pretty much proceeds as normal.

-maze contest. He and Cedric touch the cup. Because he is primed to react to any threats from the prank war he had at Marauder's Place over the summer, he is a moment faster in recognizing a dangerous situation and forcefully grabs Cedric to run to the cup Cedric is a bit closer and gets to the cup, worm tail is fast enough and pretrificus totaluses harry. Just before the spell hits him, Harry manages to push Cedric who hits the cup and shows up at hogwarts. Harrys encounter with voldielocks goes exactly the same, up until the prior incantatum. Dumbledore, either able to apparate from Cedric memory, track where the port key went or whatever, apparates with sirius and Remus who were obviously at the contest, with Aurors who are probably there as security for the minister. They all show up in the graveyard. Voldemort and Dumbledore trade spells for a few minutes, voldemort confirms he is actually voldemort, and the Aurors all see that he is really alive. Voldemort and Co split.

-everyone who is alive shows up back at hogwarts. Barty crouch has escaped, not bothering to take the trunk in his panic. The Aurors can prove voldemort is really alive, so the minister can not pretend he isn't. Moody is presumably rescued and identifys his kidnapper as Barty crouch.

-Is this all an ass pull so Cedric lives? Yes.

-Do I care? No.

And there's year 4. As I said, mostly nothing changes. Just a bunch of ripples. Will probably do year 5 tomorrow.
