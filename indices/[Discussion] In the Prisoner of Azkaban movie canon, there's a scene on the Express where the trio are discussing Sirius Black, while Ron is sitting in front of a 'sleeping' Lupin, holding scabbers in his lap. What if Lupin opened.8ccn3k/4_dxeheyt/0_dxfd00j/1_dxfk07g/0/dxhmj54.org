To hell with it. Here goes nothing.

Fair warning, not much changes plot wise. It's mostly a bunch of little changes that would stack to make bigger changes next year. Ripples making waves here, people.

-We start Harry Potter's first year at Marauder's Place. Harry, Sirius, and Remus are all getting ready for the trip to the meet up place for the port key to the quidditch cup. Everything goes pretty much the same. Other than Harry remus and Sirius having a tent next to the Weasley+hermione, it goes the same.

-Krum catches the Snitch, Ireland wins. Death eaters attack. Sirius and Remus stay with Harry, so he's at least got that. They act all protective dad like when the aurors start firing at them, and Sirius threatens to sue the ministry. Again. 50/50 chance if he does it just so he can give some of the winnings to the weasley's. After all, Ron was being attacked too, so it's not charity. they probably lie about the exact percentages that would technically be for Ron, and give them more.

-so I remember exactly nothing about the whole winky thing, but let's say that sirius and Remus buy her to work for them, because shes so obviously miserable not having a master. Maybe she'll lighten up kreachur. Or maybe they'll just make each other 10x more dedicate to their cause.

-so now winky resides at Marauder's Place. Dobby is still at hogwarts.

-so everything is pretty par for the course, up until the champs are picked. Harry goes into the room, dumbledore /calmly/ asks Harry if he put his name in the goblet of fire. So on. Harry gets back to the dorm, him and Ron fight. It is not as bad as in Canon. ron's still got jealousy issues, but the therapy he went through over the summer helped him work through them so the fight is mostly limited to ron make a few bitchy comments about harry putting his name in the cup, harry getting angry and bitching at ron for thinking he would do something like that, both going to sleep, then ron apologizing, and harry returning the apology.

-you ask how therapy over your pet rat being a mass murder leads to better relationship development? I answer. Pettigrew is scabbers>scabbers is his rat>what did scabbers mean to him>scabbers was just another hand-me-down from an older brother, like everything else he owns>how did that make him feel>jealous, worthless, inferior>as part of your continued treatment we will explore your feelings of jealousy worthlessness and inferiority>jealousy worthlessness and inferiority is worked on>ron is a significantly less jealous worthless inferior feeling boy, and a lot more confident and sure of himself and that he is not worthless or inferior>Ron no longer treats the people he cares about such as Ron and hermione as if he is jealous worthless or inferior to them, or at least does it less than in canon. Therapy is dope yall. You should try it added. note: as to the expenses therapy incurs, I think a good portion of it was paid for by the court because it was their failing that caused Peter to run free, and any further unpaid therapy related expenses are paid for by sirius because he's filthy rich and he should have caught him the night he ran free.

-On the note of therapy,Ginny is also 99% over her celebrity crush on harry, from the therapy she had to go through for pettigrew, she also used the chance to work through the chamber of secrets as well, and she able to just see him as a boy she'd like to be friends with not the boy who lived or 'her hero.' So she's spent a lot of this year making an effort to be friendly to harry, ask for a spare quill in the common room here, some help with a DADA assignment he had last year, stuff like that. She's also done things like offer to carry a book if he's holding a lot and they're going the same way. Ask him about the weather, his opinion on a piece of quidditch news. Ginny's a confident girl. She'll find things to talk about. So by the end of the year harry would put ginny solidly in the 'friend' box, and hed be comfortable going and hanging with her if Ron and hermione are getting on his nerves. She's not just Ron's little sister, he sees her as her own person. She's still nowhere near as close to him as Ron and hermione, he doesn't quite let her in on his secrets of deepest feelings.

-there is one difference before the champs are picked, and that's the amazing bouncing ferret. After Draco is put back into human form, he goes off to a bathroom and cries. (The kid is only 13, every truth he's ever known about his identity has been violently torn from him, all of his house mates are making his life miserable for the last year and a half, and now he's just gone and been turned into a ferret and bounced up and down, with numerous classmates laughing at him. He puts on an arrogant face, of course, but that doesn't mean he really feels that way. So yeah, he goes to a bathroom and cries. Same one he's sobbing in in HBP, in fact. Gotta keep those internal references going. Harry, who is intimately familiar with the feeling of being ostracized by all of your peers for something you have no control over, as well as having a deep knowledge of what happens to people who go through that (not good things, he knows), goes after him. He's not quite sure what drives him to follow Draco, but he trusts his gut. So he follows after, and comes across Draco basically doing exactly what he did in HPB. Crying in front of a mirror, to be exact. Harry moves forward, for what exactly he really has know idea, and Draco sees him and throws out a non lethal spell. (He's a shithead yeah, but he's a 13 yo shithead. I don't think he'd be throwing avadas just yet) Harry counters with an expelliarmus. (no hpb's journal=no sectumsempra.) Draco dodges, and runs out. Harry just stares out the doorway for a minute, baffled at what occurred, just kinda processing it all, and then moves on to where ever he was going in the first place. He doesn't mention what he saw to anyone, not even Sirius or Remus. It just felt like something very private. Draco spends the next week in agony, just waiting for the rumors of him crying in a bathroom to start circulating. And when nothing happens, he spends the week after feeling a strange mix of half confusion and half binding anger. 2 weeks to the day after the whole bathroom incident, while running through a deserted hallway shortcut, trying his best not to be late to class, Harry Potter finds himself suddenly pushed with a magical force against the closest wall, and with a wand shoved in his face. It takes him a moment to recognise Draco as the owner of the wand. Draco: “What do you want?” Harry just stares at him, confused beyond belief as to what is happening. Draco, looking around furtively before whispering: “You haven't told anyone what you saw.” He stops, seemingly waiting for a response. Harry, at normal volume, still CBB: “What I saw? What the bloody hell are you- oh. You mean a couple weeks ag---.” The still raised wand is jabbed into his neck. Draco, panicked: “DON'T! Don't talk so loud. Just answer the fucking question, Potter.” Harry, shrugging as much as he can with a wand jabbing into his neck: “I dunno. It just seemed like it was meant to be private, I guess. You may be a pompous git, but I'm not that cruel.” Draco, with an offended look on his face: “Pompous gi---” he cuts himself off. His face fills with anger. “Don't tell anyone what you saw. If you don't keep your mouth shut, you'll regret it.” Harry: “Well if I haven't told anyone yet, I don't know why I'd suddenly start now.” Draco glares. The wand presses further into his neck. Harry's rather surprised his neck hasn't been punctured, the way things are going. He sighs. “I won't tell anyone. Is that good enough for you, Malfoy?” The pressure from the wand increases one last time --- /Really, is all the wand poking really necessary?/ Harry wants to say. He elects not to, in the name of his livelihood. --- and then fully recedes. Malfoy gives him one last glare, then runs off in the opposite direction Harry had been going. Harry stares at him for a moment, rubbing his neck, then continues to class at a leisurely pace. /After all, it's just potions. I'm sure Snape would take points for some imagined transgression anyways. Might as well get something out of it myself./ Snape's face when he arrived, more than half the class over, was truly a sight to behold.

-Up until this exchange, the amount of insults and jeers directed his and his friend's way had been steadily decreasing since the Pettigrew trial. By this point, they were a rare occurrence, usually limited to when they happened to run into each other in the halls, or had to pass each other to get to their classes, and even then it almost seemed automatic, like Malfoy was too stressed to put forth any real effort, and was doing it to keep up pretenses, to keep anyone from thinking he held any regard for Harry. After Malfoy's sudden ambush, they stopped completely. The glares disappeared as well. Indeed, it seemed as Malfoy had just decided to ignore his, and by proxy his friend's, existence. After a few weeks had gone by, Harry realized that even any eye contact had almost entirely vanished. Even the few times did happen, it seemed to be truly unintentional. Eventually, Harry just took it as his new reality, and moved on. He never mentioned either of the events that had transpired to Ron or Hermione, knowing he would just be pestered with questions he couldn't answer. Any curious remarks on if he knew anything about the Malfoy's sudden change of behavior were met with a lost expression and a confused shrug. And it's not like he was really lying. He honestly had no idea why Malfoy was suddenly so set on ignoring his existence.

-He beats the dragon, hermione and Ron are both there to support him, so no love triangle shtick thrown around by skeeter especially since shes fired and presumably got a job at some mega trashy wizard gossip mag.

-gets the egg. Opens egg. Immediately regrets it.
