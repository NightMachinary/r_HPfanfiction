It basically diverts the ENTIRE plot, given that the core conflict everything leads up to is solved in the span of 2 minutes.

Fair warning, it's been over 6 years since I last read PoA, and I only got 30ish minutes into the movie before getting too tired and going to sleep.

But going from the moment I finished...

-The dementors show up, Lupin immediately patronuses them (I quite like [[/u/jahoan]] s idea that Lupin is so out of fucks to give that he just blasts out a full blown corporeal wolf patronus), so Harry doesn't have his flashback. Everyone just feels a bit shitty, overall. Chocolate is dispensed. Because I am a slut for Hinny, I'm retroactively adding Ginny into my previously written scene since she's there in the book canon.

-Lupin gives a very short, perfunctory goodbye, takes Peter, and apparates the fuck to Hogwarts, an immobilized, invisibalized Peter floating beside him. Why Dumbledore instead of the ministry? Well for starters, what with him being a werewolf and all, I'd imagine he'd have more faith in the man who gave him access to an education despite his condition, over the Ministry that has made it a mission to ruin his life. So he marches his furry little ass straight to Dumbles office, says every single sweet he knows of till he gets in, walks in, uninvisibalizes Peter, and drops him to the floor. He does not make any effort to be gentle, other than to assure he doesn't die/become brain damaged.

-Dumdum jumps out of his chair faster than you can say my-lemon-drops-absolutely-arent-laced-with-any-sort-of-potion-why-do-you-ask. He rushes over to pettigrew on the floor and starts casting a plethora of spells, lots Lupin can't recognize, looking progressively more grave the more he casts.

-'This is Peter Pettigrew' he says. It is a statement of fact, not a question. His face is so grave, one would expect his lustrous beard to start growing daisies any second.

-'Ah.' Lupin says, mildly. Inside, he is not nearly so mild.

-'Explain.' Dummyboy commands, gravely.

-Lupin explains.

-Dummeroo goes and grabs 2 strong drinks and sets them on his desk.

-'Sit' he gravely says, gesturing to his chair.

-Lupin sits.

-Dumbledore pushes a glass towards him, then takes a hearty swig from his own. Lupin drinks.

-Eventually, though, through a series of political machinations, threats, bribery, boldface lies and other such sinful activities that I can't be bothered to write, Sirius is declared innocent. The dementors are called off.

-He is released from Azkaban, into the care of St. Mungos, for mandatory physical and mental therapy. Regardless of if the man's sane or not, one does not come out of 12 years of what is objectively the worst prison on Earth without needing therapy. Even if you discount the whole 'surrounded by crazy people and literal soul sucking monsters,' he's still got to adjust to the fact that 12 years have passed, and he was isolated from all outside information for 99.99999999% of it. The world is a very different place than what he knew, and the people are as well. Lupin absolutely visits and they rebuild their friendship again. (Or if you're a poor slasher soul like me, rekindle their teenage romance, learning how to reform it around the new people they are/finally confess their undying love for each other and go form there) Either way, I think Lupin being there and being able to tell him about the world, and tell him about Harry, would help to preemptively waylay any urges to pretend nothing has changed. It would also help Sirius realized that Harry is almost nothing like James, and that it wouldn't be fair to him to expect him to be. That way they can have a more solid foundation of a relationship, able to learn each other as they are instead of as they think they are. After a lot of tests and jumping through hoops, Harry is allowed to visit. It involves an intense amount of nervousness on both sides, a lot of awkwardness on Harry's, and a lot of trying to seem nonchalant and not like he's about to cry on Sirius'. (So he's still a little mentally fragile, cut him some slack. The man's been through a lot.) Sirius spends a lot of it telling stories of the Marauders with Lupin pitching in (he's there as a supervisor, just to make sure things stay low key), and Harry is just happy to learn anything about his parents. The whole James-was-a-bit-of-a-dick thing comes up, but they have lots of time to explain how he grew out of it. Severus and Lily being close friends also comes up, as does the end of their friendship. Harry is surprised by this, to say the least. In hindsight, Snapes undying hatred for him makes a bit more sense. All in all, the visit ends happily, with light hearts and high hopes for the future of their relationship. Harry's also become a bit closer to Lupin along the while, since Lupin mostly likely escorted him to this and any future visits. Sirius also get plenty of other visitors, such as Dumbledore (he was one of the first, given the the circumstances), Fudge, the head of the auror department as well as various aurors, etc.

-Sirius eventually leaves the Hospital, and he and Remus probably move into Grimmauld place, and clean it up. Given the special circumstances, I don't think it would be too unlikely for Harry to be allowed to visit on weekends, A) because having healthy relationships is an important part of Sirius' treatment plan, and B) because the boy had his parents murdered when he was 1, he should get the opportunity to make healthy parental relationships for himself. He definitely stays over Christmas, and perhaps invites Ron and Hermione along as well.

-With Remus, Sirius, and occasionally Harry's hard work, they manage to turn Grimmauld into a place worth living.

-Since Grimmauld is getting cleaned up, Kreacher is definitely going to pop up. The question being, does Sirius treat him as he does in OotP, or does he choose the nicer route? Because in this AU, Sirius is a little bit more mature than in canon from the therapy he had to go through, and has frequent contact with Harry, and a live in Boyfriend/platonic life partner, and isn't being confined in a miserable house, I'd like to think he's going to act a bit nicer, be a bit more understanding than in canon, and have a somewhat better relationship with Kreacher, or at the very least not treat him like shit. Maybe he let's him keep some of the not so dangerous possessions, such as Walberga's portrait, a treasures book, a locket trinket, in a soundproofed room way up in the attic far away from the used bedrooms and living/kitchen area. (in other words, Kreacher still had the locket horcrux, but he's a lot more willing to play nice with Sirius if needed.) So now Kreacher is a hit more willing to help with the house clean up, knowing that if something isn't dangerous and he wants to keep it in his keepsake room in the attic, he can. So the house is a lot less miserable than in canon, and the portrait from hell is removed to a better location.

-Don't ask me how it got moved, just assume that they asked Dumbledore for help, tore down the wall during probably necessary renovations, or Kreacher's house elf magic could get to it somehow.

-Dumbledore receives letters from parents expressing concern for hiring a teacher who lives with a (acquitted) mass murderer. Remus gracefully steps down at the end of the year.

-As summer approaches, many screaming shouts between Dumbledore and Sirius (and sometimes Remus) later, it is finally decided that Harry will spend the absolute minimum time at the Dursleys required to recharge the 'blood protection', but Remus and Sirius will visit every weekend, and 'Padfoot' will be making frequent visits to the park Harry frequents. As soon as they are recharged, Harry will hop over to the newly remodeled freshly dubbed Marauder's Place and spend the rest of the summer there.

-Obviously there are much hopping between the burrow and marauders place, and visits to both from hermione.

-In short, nothing exciting happens past the political shitstorm Sirius hitting the ministry of magic. Harry gains 2 father figures, and gets to spend all year stressing about quidditch and girls instead of a potential attempt on his life. He is happy. Ron has to go through his own share of therapy, as well as Percy. Basically the entire Weasley family comes out stronger for it, as they get the chance to work out their issues individually with a therapist. So Ron's inferiority complex might not stick out as bad during the tournament next year (if there is one), which is obviously good news. He is happy. Hermione still figures out Lupins secret and after getting to know him better outside hogwarts, from harry and maybe from seeing him over Christmas break, she goes to him personally and explains how she knows, but that she won't tell anyone and will protect his secret. They get to bond over being bookworm dweeb. She is happy. Sirius is no longer in prison, and is working towards becoming a well adjusted, if somewhat rebellious, member of society. He lives in a swanky ass house rigged to the teeth in booby traps he Harry and Remus set, gets a healthy good relationship with his godson, and has rebuilt a friendship/romance with one of his closest friends, and is finally able to start moving past the trauma of October 31st. He is happy. Remus has gone from being entirely alone in the world, the only shining light being getting to teach his best friends son, to living with another one of his best friends/boyfriend, having a good healthy relationship with his best friends son, getting to do a job he loved for a year and then fairly peacefully leave. He keeps finding mysterious bars of chocolate around the house with positive notes on them. He is happy.

-oh, and Peter is launched into Azkaban faster than you can say launching-off-at-the-speed-of-light. He no longer has to live as a rodent, in fear of being found out. Surprisingly, he is (somewhat) happy.

Everyone is happy.

For now, at least.
