Further notes that couldn't be fit:

-Harry most certainly does not forget what he now knows of his Mums and snapes history. It shines an entirely new light on Snapes hatred for him. He doesn't ever day anything to him about it, he's not stupid. But it's not something he forgets. Perhaps, if a year or two from now, he gained access to a part of Snapes side of the story, he might say something. But not now.

-Sirius got a big ass check of monetary reparations. Most likely uses it to sue the ministry. Consults hermione Granger encyclopedic knowledge of laws and rules for help when needed. (sues the ministry in 3rd year for their terrible anti werewolf legislation, sues the ministry in 4th year for the ridiculous binding contract nature of the goblet of fire. Sues the ministry for interference in private school affairs in 5th year in an attempt to prevent him from becoming the defense against the dark arts teacher. Sue's the ministry in 6th year for refusing to acknowledge a fire threat existed. Doesn't bother suing the ministry in 7th year, just burns it to the ground.)

-Dumbledore gets to see a boy he greatly cares for finally have a family. He gets to see a man he watched grow up find his hope. He gets to see a foolhardy youth mature into a competent adult man. He is happy.

-Sirius and Remus ABSOLUTELY give harry hell on the subject of Ginny when he finally comes round to that realization. At least one joke about Potters and their redheads is made.

-Harry gets to legit go to Hogsmead, as Sirius and or Lupin signed the permission to slip. He has much fun trying to convince Lupin to go to zonkos to help him pick out something to prank sirius with. He also stops in honeydukes and picks up a giant ass bar of chocolate, like the kind of bar so big its normally given as a gag gift to give to Lupin for Christmas, as well as a book from flourish and bottles. He picks up a few pranks to give sirius from zonkos as well. Seeing as he didn't bring the invisibility cloak, there is sadly no invisible snowball fight against malfoy. He does get into a real snowball fight though. Harry has a lot of fun, since he's more okay with easing up on his rivalry with malfoy. He's trying to learn from his father's mistakes. Ron gladly joins in, hermione with a bit of nudging from Ron. Malfoy probably takes the fight a bit more seriously than really warranted, but I imagine somewhere in that angsty bigoted heart of his he is enjoying himself too. Perhaps this can be an Itty bitty baby step towards not being such a prissy brat all the time. Hermione gives malfoy a solid fastball to the face. It is glorious.

-Buckbeak. Buckbeak is an interesting one, because I barely remember any of it. Let's just say sirius uses some of that sweet reparations dough to sue the ministry and and make waivers a mandatory form as they should be for a class dealing with dangerous magical creatures. He also pays to buy Buckbeak to save him, then low key just gives him back to Hagrid. The ministry is so stupid they don't notice. Idk if it would be from the ministry, malfoy Sr, or remus/sirius, but Hagrid probably has to undergo some kind of class on safety procedures and appropriate animals. The trio remus and Sirius all make sure to express him the animals aren't evil, but that not all the animals are good for an in person class, at least without a prior instructional class to the students on how to treat the animals properly and safely. He is also now supposed to send and instruction slip with his textbooks on how to open them.

-im pretty sure sirius gets possessed by the spirit of James for a nanosecond when he finds out harry rode a goddamn hippogryph, he is so filled with pride.

-I'm going to go ahead and assume that neville gets injured in potions somehow, and Sirius sues the ministry to make safety equipment and lab procedures required in potions, as well as moving the potions room out of the dungeons and into a room with lots of windows so the fumes have somewhere to go. Yes, 90% of his motivation is to piss off Snape. Whatever works, hey?

-Harry is talking to Ron or Hermione about the Sirius and Remus, and uses the names Padfoot and Moony. The twins overhear, and ask what he was going on about. He explains that he was talking about Sirius and Remus. They have a fit of dramatics, then give him the map.

-Hermione ends up burning herself out via time turner to the point that harry and Ron corner her and make her explain, then express that they don't want her to exhaust herself. (Harry's picked up all these nifty healthy communication skills from Sirius, who gets them from his therapist. He loves to explain in detail how he's using each skill as he uses them in the most dramatic way possible.) I don't think she actually drops a class, but probably tried to eat a bit more, get more sleep, sit by the lake, just relax a tiny bit. Not too much though, of course, she's still hermione.

-Remus probably has some issues feeling like he can't become too close with Harry at first since he's his teacher and all, but a sirius pointing out that in all likelihood he's only gonna be DADA teacher for a year, and what a shit childhood Harry's had probably persuades him that it's okay.

-So as much as I'd like to get out of this, it's is most likely that Lupin misses at least one class due to full moon sickness, so Snape does his whole werewolf class. By this point I think Harry's been told about sirius's fuck up with Snape, so he knows why snape is trying to get them to figure out Lupin secret. He also has an internal struggle, because one one hand, this guy's a total douchecanoe, and harry hates him. In the other hand, what sirius did wasn't okay, and an near death encounter with a werewolf would give anybody nightmares, a vendetta against said werewolf, and a good reason to try an out said werewolf. He's still a douchecanoe tho.

-Scabbers is a moot point so Ron and hermione don't spend the whole year bitching to each other about their pet. But, they wouldn't be ron and hermione if they weren't bitching to each other. So they are probably fighting over hermione being all sneaky prior to getting her to confess and about hermione burning herself out. This mostly involves Ron making typical ronnish comment trying to help in his own way, and hermione getting mad at for butting into to her business (but inside she's a little happy because I think by this point she's aware that she's a little bit into ron.) Harry suffers.

-the dementors aren't at hogwarts, so harry never faints, and never breaks his broom. Sirius is probably a 'rich people spending' kind of guy, buying unnecessary things for the people he loves, so he gets harry a firebolt anyways. Remus sighs. They win the quidditch cup.
