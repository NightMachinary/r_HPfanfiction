I mean if you think about it he never was hired for his love of teaching especially not for his talents at dealing with 13 year old Hufflepuffs, and hiring him as a potions teacher was just an excuse to hire and keep him. Dumbledore knew voldermort was coming back and he wanted to make sure there will be a spy under his fingers. Funny enough, voldermort sucked that story, that Snape wanted to work as a potion teacher for Dumbledore to spy on the headmaster later on, right up. However, there is something we are forgetting here, which is the fact that Snape wanted the defense position. In the book, I felt everyone believed he wanted it because he liked the dark arts, which is true, but I feel the true reason behind it is that he wanted to get fired after one year. This position was his ticket out and he wanted it so bad. What's sad is that when he got it finally, the year after that he became headmaster which is sad but somehow hilariously ironic at the same time.
