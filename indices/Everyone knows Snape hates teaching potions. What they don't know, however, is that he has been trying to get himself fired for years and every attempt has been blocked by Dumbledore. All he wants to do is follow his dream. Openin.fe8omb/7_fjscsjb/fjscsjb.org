The store didn't end with a bang but a whimper. Specifically the whimper of a small dog as the life fizzled out of its eyes. The dog wasn't Snape's, of course. He didn't have pets and he didn't particularly like dogs, small or otherwise. Still, it was sad. Now the war had stopped, and the new headmaster was perfectly happy to let him go do his thing, and it ended because of /one/ stupid dog and it's scatterbrained owner. Now what. He could hardly use the damn thing for ingredients, could he? He had notified its owner (and had to parrel quite a few nasty hexes from the older lady) and she had, of course, sued him. Result: he was back to teaching bloody dunderheads. At Hogwarts. Again.
