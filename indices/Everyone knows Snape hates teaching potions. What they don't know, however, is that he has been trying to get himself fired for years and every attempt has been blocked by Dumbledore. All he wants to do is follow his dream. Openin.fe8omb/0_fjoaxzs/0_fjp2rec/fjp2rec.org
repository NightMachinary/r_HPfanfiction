I have a head canon where Snape worked as a cook in the summer during his teenage years.

If you have ever worked back of house in the kitchen industry you would know it is riddled with socially mal-adjusted people with anger issues, mental health issues, and substance abuse issues. "Not sure whether I am a cook or a pyromaniac with a knife fetish" is a good description for many slaving away to the beat of the ticket printer.

I've seen some fics where Snape's nickname among the death eaters is "knife" due to his skill with a potions knife. It is something that would translate well into kitchen work when you are 15 and not allowed to do magic yet. I think he would feel right at home in that atmosphere.
