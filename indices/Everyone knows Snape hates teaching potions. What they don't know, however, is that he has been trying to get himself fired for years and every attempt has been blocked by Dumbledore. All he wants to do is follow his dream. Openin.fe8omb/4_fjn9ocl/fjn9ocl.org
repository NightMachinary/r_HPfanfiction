This is one of the few ideas that would make how snape behaved acceptable to me (at least, more so than canon)

Asshole to everyone, favors the house of death eater spawn despite "being saved", terrible teacher with a huge fail rate. And to top it all off, actively abusive towards his employers social experi... I mean favorite student.

Honestly all makes sense when you attach the label of desperately wanting to be fired.
