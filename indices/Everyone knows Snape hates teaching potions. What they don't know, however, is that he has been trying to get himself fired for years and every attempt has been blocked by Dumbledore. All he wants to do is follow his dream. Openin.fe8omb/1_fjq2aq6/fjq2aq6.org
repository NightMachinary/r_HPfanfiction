"To clarify," Severus solemnly intoned, "I am being... dismissed... from all duties... of an Academic and Supervising nature?"

"You are," said the current spokesman for the fully assembled Board of Governors, his eyes glinting with a victorious and anticipatory gleam. "We have a new professor already lined up to fill both your former positions. We are generously granting you a full week to pack your things and mov-"

"I see," Severus interrupted, almost absentmindedly. "You are firing me." His words were so soft they sounded nigh on wistful. All tension and acerbic severity seemed to melt from his face and stance.

They broke him, Minerva thought. He was in shock; that was the only explanation, she thought. Maybe they should have found him another job in the castle rather than leaving him out to dry like this. Perhaps working adjacent to the infirmiry wouldn't be quite so traumatizing for anyone-

.And then.

.Oh And Then.

Severus Snape /smiled./

He snapped his fingers.

At his feet appeared a long black muggle coat, folded neatly and laying atop a black muggle suitcase, and atop the coat itself was perched a black muggle hat. Minerva watched, uncomprehending, as her former student, coworker, and decade-and-a-half-old terror to all magical minors swiftly capped himself, donned the coat in a single sweeping motion, hefted his featherweight case, and bid the room's occupants a genuinely pleasant "Adieu". From the Headmistress' office he departed; practically skipping, and humming a jaunty tune.

Students in the halls stared in shock and horror at the sight of what they could only assume to be either an imposter or their (not-so-) dear Imperiussed professor as he made his way to the exit. Even Argus Filch seemed astounded - the irrascible old man cut himself off from a heated scolding in order to gape and stare at his fellow terrorizer-in-arms suddenly not terrorizing people! At the very least, Snape's terrorizing was not being conducted in his usual manner. He occasionally paused and delayed his trek to shake hands with promising upper-year potioneers. He shot some unsolicited parting tips to students who were struggling in his (Former!) class. He pat a few darling firsties on their heads and crooned at their endearing-ness. All the while he was broadly grinning a grin which might definitely have given that old fraud Gilderoy Lockheart a run for his Most Charming Smile award.

It was official. The Halfblood Prince had gone barmy. It was uncontestable how unnerving this newfound geniality was for everyone. Students and faculty alike only turned away from this impossible sight to check each other for Confundus charms.

Totally beknownst unto Severus, a thoroughly befuddled audience trailed him to the front doors and watched from the steps as one Sourpuss Severus Snivellus Snape made his way to and through the school gate. On his way out he raised his unburdened arm and waved without a backward glance. Giddy as a schoolboy off on his first Hogsmead field trip, he was. Off to explore new horizons and do with the rest of his life completely as he wished.

Bakery-Apothecary? That was just Item Number One on his list of things to do!
