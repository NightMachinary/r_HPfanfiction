[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]], linkffn(7525570), is a great Hermione/Ginny romance and shows how time turner travel should be done (unlike that abomination known as TCC). I especially like how others reacted to their relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), is a great Hermione/Bellatrix romance in a Voldemort free AU. The main plot goes through 4 crime mysteries.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is my top H/Hr fic, even if they didn't get 'officially' together by the end. This fic is very emotional.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), is a beautiful and refreshing time travel that doesn't focus on fighting Voldemort, but on how Hermione helped Harry to rebuild his 2nd life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), involves excellent world building. Dumbledore and Hermione kicked asses here, but opposing them was an utterly terrifying Voldemort. The final battle is one of the best I've ever read.
