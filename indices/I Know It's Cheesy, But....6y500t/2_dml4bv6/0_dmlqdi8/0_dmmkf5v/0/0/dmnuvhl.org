- Lariope, /Second Life/

-After the Rain, /On the joyous science, in wartime/

-Barb, /Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions/ (an oldie, but remains the best AU plotting I've ever read and the best of her trilogy IMO)

-Thanfiction, /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/, mostly because I love Neville and I love fics that don't 'skip over' the little things in their hurry to hit the big plot points.
