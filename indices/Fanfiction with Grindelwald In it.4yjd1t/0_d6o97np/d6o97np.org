Well, linkffn(The Skitterleap by enembee) is a fic where Grindlewald beat Dumbledore and that is the world that resulted.

linkffn(The Magnate by Halt.CPM) is a Voldemort won fic that features Grindlewald in the later portions. Not quite yet to the point of Harry and Grindlewald having any interactions.

There's some fucking terrible fic where Arcturus Black somehow gets a hold of baby Harry, and then proceeds to break Grindlewald out of Nurmengard, but I forget the name.

linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) has Grindlewald in the context of Dumbledore v Grindlewald in the first chapter.

And that's all I've got off the top of my head. Which is a shame, because I think Grindlewald has great possibilities, being essentially the dark!Dumbledore.
