There's an in-progress story linkffn(Child of Hogwarts, part II: The Marauder Legacy by AimeretVivre) that has some Grindelwald. In the first series installment, I think he plays a role in a chapter or two. Without spoiling too much, and this is mostly conjecture, he'll play a limited role in Harry's education and research regarding Horcruxes. This is a fic based on Harry being pulled away from the abusive Dursleys and raised by Dumbledore and McGonagall at the castle. Interesting story, starts summer before Year 2; it took too much straight from canon in the first installment but it has tempered that habit since the middle of that story and I think the author is getting really good at writing this as she goes along.
