The biggest difference between "well-written crack" and "cringeworthy bash fic" is the narrative tone. When writing crack, you must not come across as preachy and it must never seem that you are actually believing what you are writing.

For example, there is a Germany YT parody where Dumbledore's rap career (with such great tracks as "grandmother fucker") isn't earning enough money so he produced cp in the secret porno chamber to balance the books. Sounds like Dumbledore bashing turned up to 11, except that it is not even taken seriously in the parody but clearly just thrown around as a joke. The woman who made it (writing, voicing all characters) now works for state television.
