I always thought it was weird to me that this society of magical people doesn't have a contingency in place for orphaned wizard kids. The government should have totally been notified when toms name and location showed up in the Book of Admittance when he first exhibited magical abilities.

I just don't see that the wizard government would be like "Yeah okay lets just leave this orphaned wizard kid in the muggle world, let's not find him any wizard parents. He's one of us but since he was born in an orphanage we better just leave him there."

I mean Tom theoretically could have been the first British wizard orphan but I would think it unlikely.
