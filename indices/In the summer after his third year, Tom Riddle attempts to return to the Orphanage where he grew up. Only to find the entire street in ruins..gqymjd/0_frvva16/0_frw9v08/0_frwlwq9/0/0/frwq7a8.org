  Depends if it would be easier for the Ministry to charm him into a new orphanage or just pay for a room in the Leaky Cauldron like for 3rd year Harry.

Between the 2 options, I'm pretty sure that the Orphanage one would be prefered by the Ministry.

Even if the sum is not that much, it's one thing to pay a room in the Cauldron for /the/ Harry Potter, who happen to be targeted by a dangerous Dark Wizard who just did the impossible and escaped from Azkaban itself, it's another to do the same for some orphan Muggleborn whose home has been destroyed.\\
In comparison, it would only take one spell to send him to another orphanage, way easier (and cheaper) for a Ministry (especially one in the middle of a war).
