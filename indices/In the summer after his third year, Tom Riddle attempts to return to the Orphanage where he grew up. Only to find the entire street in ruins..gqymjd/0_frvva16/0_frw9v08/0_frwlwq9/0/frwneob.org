Depends if it would be easier for the Ministry to charm him into a new orphanage or just pay for a room in the Leaky Cauldron like for 3rd year Harry.

I doubt Dumbledore or Dippet would personally involve themselves in that. It really isn't their job to find him a home, or look after him during the summer in Hogwarts (I'm sure the teachers would rather enjoy their vacation too.).
