Would Dumbledore or Dippet really impede that, if Tom legitimately didn't have anywhere to stay? When he asked Dumbledore about it in canon it was a case of him not wanting to go back to the orphanage rather than not being able to.

Also I imagine that the choice of where he would say would be made by some Ministry official.
