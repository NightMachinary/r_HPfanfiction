TBH probably not yet. Since when Dumbledore fought Grindelwald he defeated him and the war ended. Pretty sure it is said/implied that that is what lead to the Muggle war ending aswell. And seeing as the main London bombings happened early in the war I don't think Dumbledore would've faced Grindelwald yet.
