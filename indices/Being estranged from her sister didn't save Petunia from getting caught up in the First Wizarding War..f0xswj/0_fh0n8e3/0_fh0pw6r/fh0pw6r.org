It's my headcanon as well! I also wondered why the Death Eaters never went after Petunia and her family, especially after Voldemort learned of the prophecy and the fact that Lily's son would fit the requirements. You'd think he'd send his followers after any family members she had left, in order to try and get info on the Potters' whereabouts.
