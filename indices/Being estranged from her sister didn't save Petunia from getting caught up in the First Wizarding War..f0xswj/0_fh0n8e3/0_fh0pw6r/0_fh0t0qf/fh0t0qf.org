Depends on how savvy the Death Eaters were about tracking down relatives and how much they cared about muggles.

If there was no contact between Lily and her sister they night have trouble connecting them or they decided that Petunia's death wouldn't matter much if they were estranged.

She would also be a Dursley rather than an Evans by the time the prophecy was given. Might have been enough to go under the radar.

Also, no real need to get information from muggles given Wormtail's existence.
