My head canon is that Lily and Petunia's parents were killed in the first war by Death Eaters. Which would explain the vitriol and desire to be as divorced from that world as possible.

I always felt jealousy was a bit of a weak motivation for 11 years of hatred towards a child. Especially given how limited the interactions between Petunia and Lily would have been once Lily left for Hogwarts.

Also explains why there's absolutely no mention of Harry's muggle grandparents.
