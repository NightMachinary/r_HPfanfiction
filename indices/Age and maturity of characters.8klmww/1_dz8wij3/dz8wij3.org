I now prefer to read and write stories of the characters in their adult years, actually. When I started reading and writing FanFiction in 2015, I only was involved if the characters were at Hogwarts. Now, though, at 25, I don't really care for that any longer. I mean, I have canon for that. I think there's a plentiful field to harvest post-Hogwarts and where a goldmine of creativity lies.

Regarding your second point, I always set a specific date and time for my story (e.g. Summer 2004) so that I know the ages of my characters. I don't specifically mention their ages in the story itself but I make sure that I give hints to readers of what time frame the story operates within. In my previous story, I mentioned that it was Harry's 24th birthday. Since Harry was born July 31, 1980, readers can infer that the story is set in 2004 and Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger (the main romance pairing in the story) are ages 31 and 24, respectively.
