Just because stories are set post-Hogwarts doesn't mean that Harry's an Auror, or that he consistently deals with divorce, kids, etc. Many, many stories that are set in this time period involve even more action and fighting and learning dangerous magic than do stories set during Hogwarts. To each their own but dude, you're missing out!
