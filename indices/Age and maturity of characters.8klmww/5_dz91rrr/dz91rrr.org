I like stories that start before first year and things change from there. And it's better when Harry is more mature, otherwise it would be just repetition of books (and I can just read those instead) or something that I'm not interested in. It's fanfiction, it doesn't have to be the accurate representation of how things work in real life. I see it as means to explore ideas and the more complex ideas are the more mature should the characters be.
