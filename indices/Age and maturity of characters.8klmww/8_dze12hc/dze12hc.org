With Harry's treatment at the hands of the Durskaban-Guards (the Dursleys!)? Yeah, I bet you'd mature early, too and boarding school also accelerates this IMHO (can't depend on your parents if they aren't there! You have to deal with problems yourself before considering writing home - if you can! Harry for example can not! The Dursleys will simply not care for his problems, hell they'd probably write back something along the lines of "You deserve this, freak!" - if they bother replying in the first place!)
