I still don't like kids acting too mature. If I want to read what is essentially a fic about an adult, I'll read a post-Hogwarts fic. I don't see the point of it most of the time. If it needs to be an AU, it can skip all Hogwarts years until a 17/18 year old can enter the Ministry/become an assassin/etc. If it needs to be about Voldemort, throw out the canon timeline so that Voldemort appears later. A tiny kid acting all wise and worldly just comes off ridiculous to me.

I do read mostly post-Hogwarts fics now. I think it's the school setting that bores me more than the age. I don't even like 8th year fics and my headcanon is that Ginny leaves Hogwarts early as well.
