I write a Marauder time story at the moment about Lily and how she grew up, how her relationship with Petunia broke, how she slowly lost Snape and how the war that started before she even entered Hogwarts affected her through the years.

In this story trying to get the age right is important of course and difficult at times. In my story a second year Lily is starting to worry about the strange happenings outside of the school, but at the same time she is still worried more about the fact that somebody could assume that she likes a boy she didn't like...

I often get annoyed by stories that just present children and teens as mini-adults or idiots
