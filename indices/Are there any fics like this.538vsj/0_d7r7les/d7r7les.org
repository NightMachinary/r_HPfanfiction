Probably not even close but: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]] is set in 1590. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3013068/1/Medieval-Magic][Medieval Magic]] is RW/HG and is set in not historically accurate medieval times. There is a couple of regency fics out there too, most are heavily romance fics.

The problem is there is almost no 'magic is known' fics in a non-completely AU (like set in Game of Thrones/LoTRs, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11421858/1/More-Precious-than-Rubies][very]] fairy-tale [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5656012/1/][like]] or something). There are some where magic becomes known over the course of the story like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] where Harry and Ginny are caught dueling on CCTV. There are also a few founders times fics ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3233631/1/Founding-Hogwarts][Founding Hogwarts]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/166415][What's Past is Prologue]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=275890][Legendary]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/844334/1/][Amulet of Time 1: The Age of the Founders]]) with or without Harry.
