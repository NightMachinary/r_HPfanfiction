Some elements are borrowed but executed very differently in the fic compared to Alanna, such as the sleeping sickness, Leo and the court etc. Alanna the Lioness has not aged very well, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it now. It can feel very cliched now, but it was probably still fresh in the 80s
