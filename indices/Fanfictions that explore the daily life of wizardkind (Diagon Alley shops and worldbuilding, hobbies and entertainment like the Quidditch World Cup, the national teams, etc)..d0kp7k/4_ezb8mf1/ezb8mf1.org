I love the rigel black chronicles-- they are 4 novel length stories set in an au crossover with Alanna the lioness series. It has the most in depth world building I've read in quite a while-- some is carried over from the Alanna series (which I haven't read) but a far bit is just sheer inginuity. In particular, there is a lot on wizarding London, potion magic, and politics.
