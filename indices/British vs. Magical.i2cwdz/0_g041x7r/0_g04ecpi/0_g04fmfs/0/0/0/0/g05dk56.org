Yeah, it was one of those older generation comedy fics (Nonjon and Rorschach's Blot's era). Helga's Girdle became a big magical item in the story somehow - though I forget exactly how. I'll see if I can find the fic, but I'd recommend doing a What's that Fic thread since I have no idea whatsoever what it's called. :D
