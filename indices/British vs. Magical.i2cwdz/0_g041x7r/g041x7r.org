Personally, I prefer the British over the Magical. Bloody Hell instead of Merlin isn't that jarring, because it's unfamiliar to me and it's not an intrinsic rule in my head, while 'mom' instead of 'mum' is jarring because it's a rule that Americans say that and not British people.

Although, on that subject, if people do write American characters, I'd prefer if they went full hog on the magical-slang too. I'd love some proper Magical American Slang, there's so much potential there - imagine if instead of "Sup, Dawg" you got stuff like "Sup, Krup." and the like. A little beatnik an example, I know, but it'd be great to see. :D
