I had no idea about sports scholarships. It's such a huge industry here. Collegiate Athletics generates billions of dollars in Revenue every year for the schools. It's not something that Wizards would interact with, mind you, but it still pretty interesting. At least it's something to watch out for if I ever see Dean getting a footy scholarship.

I imagine that characters in Harry Potter are from all over. Cho is obviously Scottish as is McGonagall, and Finnegan is obviously Irish. Everyone else just has a received pronunciation British accent to some degree. The Weasleys are from Devon but they don't talk like the characters from Hot Fuzz.

In my own experience, I'm writing a story where Pansy Parkinson is from Blackpool. Reading Hagrid and Fleur's dialogue is already tedious enough, though, and I wouldn't even know how to write a Northern accent.

It would be cool to see characters that were actually from the Midlands and the North.
