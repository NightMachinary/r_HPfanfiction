It really, really bugs me when I see stuff about sports scholarships. If Dean wanted to go into pro football, he'd go through the clubs and probably not bother with uni. I'm the wrong person to ask about it though, I'm not a sporty person.

In the films (we don't usually say movie and /definitely/ never movie theatre), Neville has a strong Leeds accent. Blackpool is a dump though. Once you get away from the promenade and the pleasure beach, it's properly rough.

Regional accents are really hard to write down, I agree. However having at least some characters reference living somewhere outside of London and the south is really important.
