British. I really, really hate all the Americanized fics where the author hasn't done the bare minimum of research on another culture.

No, we wouldn't go to a diner to have pancakes for breakfast. We'd go to a caf√© and probably have a full English. Medical debt isn't a thing over here and it hasn't been for decades. Even my grandmother doesn't remember a time before the NHS.

No one gets a sports scholarship to university. Your uni doesn't care that you're really good at football. Uni sports are a hobby, not some semi professional thing. See also legacy admissions and graduation. We don't have graduation ceremonies in the UK for secondary school. This is partly because different kids leave at different times. I left at 16 and went to an FE college to study childcare. My partner stayed on to do his A levels and left at 18.

Something else that bothers me is when every character is from London. The UK is a lot bigger than just one city. Have a character from Manchester or Leeds or Glasgow or /anywhere/ but London.
