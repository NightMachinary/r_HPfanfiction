I do prefer British spelling as far as it's possible. I even appreciate an attempt even if I do see American terminology here and there, because I realise how hard it is to know all the British English terminology if you're not British (I know; I'm not British myself). If there are any blatant American English words in the story, it destroys the "plausibility" of it, and I lose interest.
