Yeah the imperial system is used, but since that didn't come into effect in the UK until after the Statute of Secrecy, I like tossing in some really old obscure ones - pottle, firkin, kilderkin, scruple are my favourites. I think there used to be a pennyweight too, which I converted to knutweight/sickleweight/galleonweight - perfect for measuring out sweets!
