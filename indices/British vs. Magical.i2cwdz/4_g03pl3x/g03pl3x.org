As an American one of the things that throws me straight out of a story is when the author uses inches, feet, pounds etc instead of metric units of measure. Idk why this is the thing that drives me the battiest, but it does.

As a writer, I do worry about using Britishisms properly and not using catch phrases that are clearly American.
