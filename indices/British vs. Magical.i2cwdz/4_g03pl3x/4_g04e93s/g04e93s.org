As a German, using metric in English just sounds wrong even if it is the native system to me. The bigger measurements are pretty easy to convert anyway (1 yard = 91 cm, so you can guess with a 1:1 ratio, 1 inch = 2,54 cm, 1 mile = 1.6 km, 2 pounds ~ 1kg). Only stones, combined heights rather than decimal and liquids are unintiutive IMO.

And despite having switched to metric, well I've been in London last summer and saw very little in metric.
