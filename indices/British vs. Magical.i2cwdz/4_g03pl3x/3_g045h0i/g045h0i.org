While pounds are unlikely to be used for anything but burgers and steak, feet and inches are pretty common for heights, ounces for cooking, stone for people, miles for long distance and mph for speed (noone uses km) etc.

Some Imperial stuff is less common now, but back in the 90s when Harry Potter is set it was ubiquitous.
