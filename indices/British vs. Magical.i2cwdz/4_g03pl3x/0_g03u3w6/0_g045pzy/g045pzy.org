We use a weird hybrid of both systems depending on the situation.

I run or cycle in kilometres but drive in miles (and measure driving speed in miles per hour) and watch horses race over furlongs; my height I measure in both feet and inches and in metres/centimetres but all other things like furniture or cable length or the size of anything under a microscope I'd measure in metric; I'd weigh most things in kilograms except myself which is stone and pounds; and I'd buy milk or beer in pints but everything else in litres.

Gen Z have moved further to metric though, with measuring their own weight and height in metric in the main. The really big national difference is measuring driving distances and speeds in miles, most other things are either metric or offer both systems fairly easily. We spend a lot of time converting - eg I do a rough conversion of 0.6 miles to the km in my head on the fly pretty often, and 2.5 cm to the inch.
