Just to be clear, it's ok to bash Hermione as long as Harry later forgives her, but the other characters can stay in the dirt where they belong?

Outside of crack fic and parody, bashing a character is just boring. Ron and Dumbledore are probably the most bashed characters in this fandom, and in both case, people keep using the same 5 arguments to bash them in every fic. It's almost impossible to remember what happened in one specific story because, outside of some minute details, they are all the freaking same.

In comparaison, I think Hermione really has it easy. From the top on my head, I'm not sure I could remember more than 10 stories where she is bashed, and some authors even make a big effort to include her even when it's in contradiction with the plot (Good old Slytherin Harry! story where he is totally on board with Blood Purity and Death Eaters, but still make an exception for Hermione cause "she is smart").
