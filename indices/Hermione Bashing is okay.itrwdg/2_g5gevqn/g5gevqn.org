Bashing is never okay since it serves no purpose other than drag someone through the mud. You might depict a character negatively, but if you reach the point where you remove all their positive characteristics, what's the point? It makes antagonists weaker and anyone else is better served not being included.

Perhaps the only exception would be stories with distorted PoVs, like let's say Lavender's perception of Ron after his birthday, but even there's a point at which it starts to feel like beating a dead horse.

Of course, crack lives from bashing and there's no limit when you are writing crack (Champion's Champion for example, or the Coldmirror parodies on YouTube (in German)).
