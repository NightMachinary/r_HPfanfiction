Wards are fanon, but the fanon does usually state that they're just blocks on things coming in or out (ie. you can apparate in, but not out), not blocks on what you can do inside them. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say Wards can stop people killing each other inside them.

But really, the simplest explanation for the lack of security - it's a school. People probably come in and out all the time, so setting blocks on them would likely make things more complicated than would be convenient.

Plus, culture. In the UK, it would be considered odd for a school to have more security than a receptionist and a big fence around the perimeter. Most of us wouldn't ever consider schools to need to be fortresses of security - we haven't had a school shooting in 25 years. There are literally panicked news stories about the schools that have metal detectors in the "Oh my god, what's wrong with this school that they'd need them?" sort of sense. Since Harry Potter is basically supposed to be "Real World Britain, but with Magic!", it tracks that Rowling'd keep that same culture going in her series as well.
