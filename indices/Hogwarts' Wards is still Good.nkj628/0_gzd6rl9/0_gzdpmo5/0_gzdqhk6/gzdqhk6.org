No worries. But no, the word 'ward' is only mentioned in canon as a medical area allocated to a specific type of patient, not as part of any protective magics. Those are only ever called 'Protective Magics' and as far as I know they've never been described as being able to prevent people from killing each other inside them either - the closest I know would be the fanon 'duelling wards' that make spells non-lethal.
