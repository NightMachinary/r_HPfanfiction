I don't think it's a very popular trope. Not many people have written non-smutty, plot-centered fics that feature Harry/Ron/Hermione, so I doubt there are very many that have shipped them together and have them travelling back in time together. There are plenty of fics where Harry or Draco gets sent back in time (to first year), but there aren't many where the three of them are sent back together. I plan to write one (in the very far future) and I'm afraid that my recs aren't very plentiful. :/
