Do you mean all three of them romantically involved with each other? I haven't read any of those, so can't help if that's what you wanted.

Backward With Purpose has Harry, Ron, and Ginny go back, with Harry and Ginny romantically involved (which alarms and alienates her family when they find out), but Hermione wasn't part of it (she died before they went back).
