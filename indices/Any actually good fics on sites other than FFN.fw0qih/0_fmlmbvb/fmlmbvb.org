It depends on what are your preferences. There are sites like [[http://www.siye.co.uk][SIYE]] or [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/][Phoenix Song]], which are oriented on Hinny or all canonical pairs, respectively. There are obviously other sites which are focused on other ships, but I am less familiar with them (for example, I cannot find Hawthrone & Vine, which was a famous Dramione website). There is always [[https://www.wattpad.com/][Wattpad]], the paradise of all teenage writers.

I thought I was too harsh about Wattpad, but then I just took a look at the site and this is the blurb of the first (paid for?) story promoted there:

  When Ryan is assigned a male dorm by accident, she has no choice but to put up with infuriating(ly hot) college bad boys. But what will she do when things get out of control?

Should I say more?
