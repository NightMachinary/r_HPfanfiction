I don't really remember well where I read the things I'm afraid but I can recommend browsing through [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/CategoryStories-1-5/Harry+Potter.htm][Twisting the Hellmouth's Harry Potter section]] for crossovers (mostly for the site's mian fandom of Buffy The Vampire Slayer), [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/browse.php?type=categories][HP Fanfic Archive]] which has a handful of stories not on FFN, and [[https://ficwad.com/category/19][ficwad]] mostly for stories that are far shorter but a lot of them are only there, I'd recommend signing up for the last one so you can filter out stories ranked below 3 or so.
