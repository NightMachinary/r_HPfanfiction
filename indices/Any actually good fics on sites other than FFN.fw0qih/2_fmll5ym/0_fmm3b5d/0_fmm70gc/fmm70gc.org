I have a Paperwhite 2, so kindle is the obvious choice for me because of whispersync, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with Aldiko: I've used it myself and liked it. It's also a bit more user friendly as far as your library goes iirc.

If you don't have an actual Kindle e-reader, then the only benefit to using the amazon app is the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200767340][document cloud]] and sending the books to your phone wirelessly via Calibre. However - this gets messy with In-Progress stories as the original one in the cloud is just treated like a duplicate.

If your eyes are bothering you with most apps and you're an avid reader, I'd really suggest getting an e-ink device. It's a night and day difference between a kindle (or similar) and a tablet for reading, and you can bet that in the seven years since I've bought mine I've gotten my money's worth and then some out of it.
