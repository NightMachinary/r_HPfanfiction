Hey my first tries in writing stories was a creative writing class on a harry potter minecraft server so I really can't blame anyone for their first tries, I did get E's and O's on them though...

Also I have a carp ton of fic ideas but I believe I don't have enough to change the plot enough to make it writable to me, I love my creativity and if I have to work off of a predetermined plot then I'll probably die of creativity starvation
