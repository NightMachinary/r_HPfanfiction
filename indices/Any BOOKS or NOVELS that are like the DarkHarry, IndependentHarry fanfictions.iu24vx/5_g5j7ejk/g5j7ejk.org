The Godsgrave Trilogy by Jay Kristoff. Super dark and violent. My favorite part was probably the blood mage that teleports assassins by using a huge pond of blood.

Rhys from the A Court of Thrones and Roses trilogy fits the bill but that's got a lot more romance than most of the suggestions here. He sided with the villain in the first book to protect his country.
