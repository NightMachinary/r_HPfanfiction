The Coldfire Trilogy by C.S. Friedman:

Black Sun Rising (1991)

When True Night Falls (1993)

Crown of Shadows (1995)

Fantasy (very slightly sci-fi) series with magic! Dark wizards! Warrior priests! Good guys who aren't always so light and pure! Lots of questionable morals and corruption of ideals! Plus, really cool cover art: [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40358-the-coldfire-trilogy]]

The magic system involves manipulating "Fae", which can be used to do what you want, but can also appear like a Boggart, taking on the shape of your worst fear.

No slash, not even any queerbaiting as far as I remember, sorry.
