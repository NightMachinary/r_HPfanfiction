linkfp(2961893), Mother of Learning by nobody103, is an excellent novel available online which has plenty of shades of grey and questionable morals. It doesn't solve the "I need physical books to read" problem, though.

Would your school, perchance, permit you to read a kindle? The kindle paperwhite (not the kindle fire, which is a normal tablet) only serves as an e-reader and doesn't support mobile apps and such, so you could probably convince them pretty easily to permit it if they don't already. You can download .mobi files--the primary kindle file format--of fanfics directly from Ao3 and email them to your kindle to read. Fanfiction.net doesn't have a direct download feature, but there are websites such as [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]] and [[https://ficsave.xyz/]] which create a .mobi file of the fic and email it directly to your kindle for you.
