I liked Vampire Junction by S. P. Somtow: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Junction]] It is about a 12yo rock star who is actually an immortal vampire. It gets pretty dark in places.

There's also a whole genre of so-called "noir" fiction, that your teacher might even think is legitimate literature. Jim Thompson was prominent in this genre; e.g., look at the article [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killer_Inside_Me]] . I haven't read that particular one but have read some other stuff by him. It is intense and creepy enough that it would have to be rated M or higher. I don't know your age but I figure you can use your own judgment. Just be aware, especially if you are prone to heebie-jeebies.
