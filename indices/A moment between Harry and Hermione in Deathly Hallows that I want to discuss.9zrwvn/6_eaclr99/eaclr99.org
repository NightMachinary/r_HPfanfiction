Harry is under polyjuice as "cousin Barny" for the wedding, so that might change the way of looking at this I dunno. Honestly, I think Hermione's just happy here, it's not the strongest evidence for romantic interest. Then again, Deathly Hallows shoots all sorts of signals all over the place, so it's possible!
