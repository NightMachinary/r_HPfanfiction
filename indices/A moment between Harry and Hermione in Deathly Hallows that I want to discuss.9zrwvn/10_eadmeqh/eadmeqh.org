I don't ship H/Hr & I don't think Rowling intended it to be romantic so I would say no (and in general, I don't think she wrote anything that was meant to be secretly decoded like that. But there's nothing wrong with reading things how you'd like!) But I do love that scene for their friendship! I think it's only natural that she'd look at Harry. I doubt there's any deep reasoning behind it (she does only have one pair of eyes after all, and can't look at them both. maybe Harry's just closer.)

although we don't have any evidence that Hermione has a difficult relationship w her parents, they do obviously seem very distant to the plot. she has, however, faced years of ostracisation and bullying from her peers. and iirc at this point she's not long obliviated her parents, so no doubt she's in a very delicate situation re family and love. Ron, despite minor insecurities, has had a pretty untroubled life up to Hogwarts. his parents clearly are very loving and he has no reason to doubt his family will always love and support him. he's also not very emotional (beyond anger) and we know Hermione has been frustrated with this before. Harry, conversely, grew up unloved and ostracised like Hermione. at this point Hermione has in a sense recently lost her parents and her home, ahd Harry ofc lost his a long time ago. the war has just started and they know it's going to hurt them and they'll face more losses soon (Ron can't really relate to this until Fred, I think).

I think seeing such a beautiful display of love and promise and family right before their world is about to collapse, means that moment had to be shared by Harry and Hermione. I think they would both appreciate it in a way Ron can't yet. It's a very sweet moment imo
