I don't think you're overthinking it, but I don't read it the way you do. I think one of the things Harry and Hermione share is that they are in touch with their feelings, whereas Ron is emotionally dense. I think Hermione looks at Harry, not because of friendship or romantic love, but because he's one of the few people she's sure will grasp the importance of that moment. Harry has a deep respect for family and commitment. Ron does as well, but he takes it for granted whereas Harry sees it as precious. Therefore Harry can share that moment with her in a way Ron can't.

I also think that Hermione is way too wise and mature to allow herself to look at Ron in that moment. That would be way too much pressure for a young relationship. They haven't even been together very long, so I think Hermione would be far too uncomfortable to--intentionally or not--put out a marriage vibe to her new boyfriend. That makes Harry a safe person to acknowledge at that moment since he's not going to read into her meaningful look with any romantic intention.
