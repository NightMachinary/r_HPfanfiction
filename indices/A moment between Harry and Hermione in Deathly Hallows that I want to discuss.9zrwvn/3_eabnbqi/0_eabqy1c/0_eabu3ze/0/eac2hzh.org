I think what [[/u/Exis007]] wrote makes a lot of sense as far as Hermione's thought process is concerned. Whether or not Harry was as receptive to that desire to share the moment, well it's debatable perhaps. He is rather clueless a lot of the time as well and the passage only says that he noticed her look, not that he understood and thought about it as deeply as we do. I do think I can tentatively claim that Hermione has Harry on her mind a lot more than the reverse. Doesn't have to be in a romatic sense at all. But Harry is often a poor friend to her and takes her for granted IMO. And he is not known to immediately turn to her to share his feelings or problems.
