  Yeah, but I think that was mostly written by Rowling so as to show how the Trio doesn't work without the 'emotional support' of Ron, and why he's 'needed'. She hasn't really given him any talents or proficiencies other than chess and being funny, so she has to plug him into the role of being the emotional glue (which doesn't really make sense IMO with the characterization in the previous books).

It might sound a bit conspiratorial, but I really have to wonder whether JKR watched Buffy and was trying to (unsuccessfully) turn Ron into Xander Harris (the heart of their trio, "the one who sees"). Ron started out as the chess strategist with the emotional range of a teaspoon, constantly starting fights, but suddenly he's the glue that holds everything together?

Xander is actually my favorite counter example how to do that archetype of a character justice. I adore Xander (who has a lot of the same problems as Ron, Xander doesn't even get the girl, twice!), who grows above his insecurities. I do not like Ron. At all. Can you imagine Ron not getting the girl in the end, if Hermione had fallen for someone else? He'd be so petty about it!

Just for Ron's sake JKR needed to keep the pairing intact, because he wouldn't have been able to handle it ending any different way.
