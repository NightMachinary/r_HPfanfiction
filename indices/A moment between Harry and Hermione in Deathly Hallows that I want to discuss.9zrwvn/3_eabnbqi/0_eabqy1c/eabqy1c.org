  Will notice an emotionally delicate moment

Aren't we talking about the guy who, a few months ago, had absolutely no clue about lust, let alone anything deeper than that even though girls were throwing themselves at him and even attempted to rape him? Whose emotions are described as "monster in his chest"? Who just sat there and let Hermione cry for days in the tent a few weeks later?

I mean, I'm not saying that H/Hr is the only valid interpretation, or that it is not, but the point you are making seems a little far-fetched considering canon.
