I've argued before that his infatuation with Cho and Ginny shows an incredible amount of immaturity (somewhat appropriate for his age). It makes more sense when this is his 'sowing wild oats' phase and not 'finding the love of his life'.

I think it is easy to argue that his upbringing with the Dursleys left its mark and gave him lots of intimacy issues. Not being able to differentiate love from lust and physical attraction seems like a logical consequence from here. It's not like he has a lot of references... how many loving relationships has he experienced or even seen?

Getting a stiffy on the other hand is dead simple. Also pursuing some kind of romantic relationship fits right in with his agenda to try to be normal, so he's not exactly in the right mindset to approach this healthily considering how obsessed he is with fitting in.
