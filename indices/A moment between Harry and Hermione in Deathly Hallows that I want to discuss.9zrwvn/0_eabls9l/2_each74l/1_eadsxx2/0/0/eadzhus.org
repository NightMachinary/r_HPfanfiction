They both have a sarcastic, dry sense of humor.

Anyway, the Harry Potter books were never meant to be romance novels, and romance was never more than a side plot. Also, relationships often just happen, there doesn't need to be an entire Jane Austen novel preceeding it.

If Harry and Hermione had ended up together, it could have worked just as well, but I don't see a point in getting upset about the fact that it didn't, because romance simply isn't a key element of the books.
