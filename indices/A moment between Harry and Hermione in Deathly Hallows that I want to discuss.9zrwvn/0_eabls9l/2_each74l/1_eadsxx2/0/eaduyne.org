Ginny's character was disgustingly under devoloped, what sense of humor did they share? Ginny's only connection is she didn't take Harry shit, and his 'possession'

What's more profound is near the end of ootp when Harry's distraught because of his vision of Sirius and lashing out, yet Hermione gets him to calm down and listen to sense. It even says Ginny/Luna/Neville just stood by because they couldn't get through to him, and just stood by and watched.
