Well, Rowling admitted Ron and Hermione would have marriage issues (to no ones surprise) and Harry and Hermione canonically both work at the ministry. I have a pretty strong headcanon that as they work together during their adult lives, Hermione begins to fall in love with Harry whether she likes it or not (assuming she hasn't fallen already). Where it goes from there, I don't know.
