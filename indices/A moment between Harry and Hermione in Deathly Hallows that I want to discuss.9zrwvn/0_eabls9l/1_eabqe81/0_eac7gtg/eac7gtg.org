I am fairly sure that ages back Rowling also admitted that Harry and Hermione were the "original" couple (or at least implied it) but the dynamic of the Trio caused her to change the pairings. In other words, early on Harry was intended to be paired with Hermione, but later Rowling changed it, and further developed Ginny as an alternative due to Harry's strong connection to the Weasleys. Its one of many reasons people often point to the fact that Ginny seems underdeveloped and then rushed later on for such a major player as Harry's love interest.

I don't know how this exactly plays into the section of book you describe due to no one but Rowling knowing how the story was developed or at what rate and what changes happened when... but it is intriguing.
