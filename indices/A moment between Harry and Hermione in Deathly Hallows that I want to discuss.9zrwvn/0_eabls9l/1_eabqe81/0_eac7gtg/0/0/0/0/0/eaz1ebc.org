I don't know whether you've seen the actual interview, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WdmOfij1NM][which can be found here]] - 3:15 timestamp for the relevant part, but there she says that the epilogue changed only "very slightly". And that whole conversation was motivated by the interviewer saying who she would want the characters to end up with and immediately after mentioning the "final chapter hidden away in her safe".

Even if you don't think this counts, JKR admitting R/Hr to be wish fulfillment definitely suggests that she wrote the epilogue before the series started being published. Especially given that she based Ron off of a childhood friend, Sean Harris. She had a plan and was sticking with it no matter what. In fact, this is what some fans who don't like the epilogue criticize about it - that it was too choppy, too 'fanficy', not consistent with the writing of her previous books, etc. At the very least, it means that H/Hr were never the original couple, and in no interview during the series being published did she ever say or imply that.

In the link you provided, she said that she took out several details because "you have to resist the urge to tell everything", so I'm not sure how that translates to her implying that it was not written early on, or how that was anything 'drastic'. I think she had simply wanted us to imagine more, although judging by her actions these past few years, that seems rather inconsistent. Immediately after /DH/ she even said something along the lines of "no more Harry, ever", and look where we are now...
