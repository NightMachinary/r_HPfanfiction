I appreciate you bringing in this source, however that does not say epilogue. I was aware of this BBC article and it's not the first time shes mentioned this. However, every time she has said "final chapter" (including what you linked) and is about who she kills off at the end of the book (implying the final battles). So again, in this article it's not the epilogue she refers to, but the final chapter.

She has made several mentions over the years to alterations that affected how she wrote the epilogue. For example, in this:

[[https://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/jk-rowling-goes-beyond-the-epilogue.html]]

... she discusses how things changed drastically with various parts of the book which affected how she wrote the epilogue, implying that the epilogue was never written early on, and even changed a lot late into the story development.
