That's the same interview where she talks about regretting the choice and that Hermione/Ron would have ended up in marriage counseling. It also does not date the choice. Her implication that she was clinging to the plot as she first imagined it, is about how the Trio would develop, which she has mentioned before. To develop the Trio as she wanted, it would have been difficult to pair up Hermione and Harry.

It does not say that anywhere in what you linked, nor have I ever heard that she had a specific epilogue penned. In fact, if anything I have heard the opposite, that the epilogue was a late addition. I could certainly be wrong and would love to know if anyone has seen this news anywhere out of curiousity.
