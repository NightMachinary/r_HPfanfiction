Good one. I think there's plenty of canon pointers for H/Hr to be believable. I think it's just very likely in general that two teenagers that share a very close relationship and go through a lot of upheaval through the years at one point at least entertain the thought of a romantic relationship. Neither one of them is very proactive in those matters though so it is also believable that it never materialises into anything.

At the very least they share a bond that goes beyond simple friendship.
