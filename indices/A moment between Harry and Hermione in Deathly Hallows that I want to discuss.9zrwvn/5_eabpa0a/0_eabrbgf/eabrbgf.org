They sure as hell had sex in the tent when it was them against the world. Two hormonal teenagers, alone in the wild, the only two still out in the field openly fighting. Imminent death looming around each corner and the opposition being an immortal magical fascist and his own magical Waffen-SS squads would do the rest.

Not that it was done out of love, but the need for physical and emotional comfort was significant during that time and there is no better way to fulfil those, especially without access to the wonders of modern technology (or a Spa resort).
