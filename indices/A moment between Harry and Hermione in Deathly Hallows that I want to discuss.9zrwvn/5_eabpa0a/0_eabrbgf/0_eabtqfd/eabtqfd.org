Except...none of their behavior suggests any of that in the book.

What, so you're saying that two friends who never felt any lust for each other, suddenly boned because no one else was around?

Harry didn't even /talk/ to Hermione for a while, and she cried a lot during that time. Neither of them would be ready for something so intimate and vunerable, especially with Ron on their mind, and a Horcrux on them 24/7.

Like, I get that that's your ship or whatever, but it's perfectly believable that they had no interest whatsoever in having casual sex. Horcruxes tend to be boner killers.

Besides, sex tends to complicate things, and I doubt either would want to risk the friendship with the only person they still know is alive.

Like, I seriously cannot see Hermione being down for that, even if Harry was a horndog and felt that monster in his chest again for someone other than Ginny.

Also, that was a pretty big tent, with private rooms. There were other ways if Harry needed an outlet.
