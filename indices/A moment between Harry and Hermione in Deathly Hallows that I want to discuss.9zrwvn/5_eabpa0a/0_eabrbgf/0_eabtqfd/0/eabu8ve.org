  What, so you're saying that two friends who never felt any lust for each other, suddenly boned because no one else was around?

No, not because no one else was around. Because they had no one else to turn to. Hermione had mind-wiped her parents, Harry never had a family and Ron was gone (with no return conceivable). And their survival was anything but certain. To each other, they were basically the only other human left alive.
