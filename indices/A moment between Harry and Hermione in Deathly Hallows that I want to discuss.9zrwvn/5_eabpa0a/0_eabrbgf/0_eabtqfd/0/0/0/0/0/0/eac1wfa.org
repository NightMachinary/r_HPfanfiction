  Why would Hermione "I just got Umbridge gang raped and look at all the fucks I don't give" Granger or Harry "I crucified a teacher over spitting at a woman who has done nothing for me, ever" Potter not go for it?

Because those have nothing to do with the possibility of them having consensual sex between each other.

It's a different matter entirely.

Also, "monster in the chest" and "Harry has a boner", is a hell of a lot different from "Sometimes, late at night, when Hermione thought Harry was asleep, Harry could hear her crying. Harry soon found himself looking at the Maruader's Map, looking for Ron's dot to inevitably show up, only for his eyes to turn to Ginny's dot, as if he stared intensely enough at it, she might wake up and know, somehow, that he was thinking of her. " and "Harry and Hermione had sex"

If anything, the subtext is that Harry was fapping to the thought of Ginny. Wouldn't be a hard clean up for him either, since all he would need is a quick Scourgify charm.

Sorry, but the subtext just isn't there for Harry and Hermione to bang in that tent. They missed Ron so much, that they put Phineas Nigellus' painting propped up in the tent, so that they could have /someone/ there besides them just to fill the space where Ron might have been. They were not exactly comfortable alone together.

Edit: it also explicitly states in the book that Harry was looking for signs that Hermione was going to leave him too, which means even if he did have frisky feelings for her, he wouldn't dare ask her for sex for that fear of losing her too.
