This. Though scourgify is a little overkill I think.

I think it's probable that Hermione had had some feelings for Harry, because that happens. I think that in slightly different circumstances, it might have happened. Though Harry would definitely consider her out of bounds, as by this point she and Ron have been obviously hiding feelings for each other for at least three years.

Putting Black's portrait up in the tent because they were /not exactly comfortable alone together/ does suggest that one or both of them didn't trust themselves. I know that's your wording not JKR's, though.
