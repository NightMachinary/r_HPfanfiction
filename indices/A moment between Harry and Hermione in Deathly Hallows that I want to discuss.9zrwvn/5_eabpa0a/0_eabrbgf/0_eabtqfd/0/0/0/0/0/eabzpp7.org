Why would Hermione "I just got Umbridge gang raped and look at all the fucks I don't give" Granger or Harry "I crucified a teacher over spitting at a woman who has done nothing for me, ever" Potter not go for it?

Also, keep in mind that canon was written with a younger target audience in mind. Teenage sex would be rampant at Hogwarts otherwise, and the monster Harry feels about Ginny would be in his pants, not his chest. So there's a certain freedom when it comes to interpreting anything related to sexuality.
