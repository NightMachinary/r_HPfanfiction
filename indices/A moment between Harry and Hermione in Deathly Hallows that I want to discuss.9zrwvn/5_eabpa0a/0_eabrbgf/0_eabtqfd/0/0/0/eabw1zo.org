  their friendship means more to them than busting a nut or getting their rocks off

Their friendship in a year won't matter if they are dead. And that's how things were looking during that time.

Having some desperate "I don't want to die tomorrow" sex won't harm their friendship, especially not if it is as strong as you imply (and as it was in canon).
