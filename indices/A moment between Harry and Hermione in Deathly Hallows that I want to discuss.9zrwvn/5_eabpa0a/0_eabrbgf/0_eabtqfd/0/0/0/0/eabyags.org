Right. I'm sure Harry would argee with that assessment, and that the Horcrux wouldn't feed him thoughts about Hermione leaving too if he tried anything, leaving him all alone.

I'm sure Hermione was in the mood after crying for hours about Ron leaving her. She's clearly over him and ready to be intimate and vulnerable with his best friend.

Again, they barely /spoke/ to each other after Ron left, and even after a month or so, Hermione was still crying whenever she though she was alone.

Even later, Harry was still hesitant to even talk to Hermione and bring up the idea of going to Godric's Hollow.

Their friendship was not in a good place, and the Horcrux exacerbated their fears and doubts that neither would even attempt such a thing if they had those thoughts of sex at all.. The fear of rejection would be too much to handle, and things were still way too awkward between each other with Ron gone.

I'm sorry, but the "end-of-the-world" argument just doesn't sit right with me. Hermione wouldn't go for it, and Harry wouldn't either.
