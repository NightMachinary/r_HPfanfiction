I see where you're coming from but i interpret it differently. I believe in the beginning that Harry and hermoine thought they might have something going but by this point they have both grown and found the ones they really love. I believe this moment was their mutual acceptance of that fact. They were giving each other that l knowing look that says "I'm happy for you and your choices"
