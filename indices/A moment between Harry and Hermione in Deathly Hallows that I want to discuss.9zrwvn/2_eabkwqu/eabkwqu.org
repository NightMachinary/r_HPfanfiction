Interesting theory, and well-argued. The only argument against that I can think of is simply an out-of-universe one --- by /Deathly Hallows/, Rowling had obviously very clearly decided on what the pairings would be, so I don't think she would have /meant/ it as a Harry/Hermione hint that would undermine them.
