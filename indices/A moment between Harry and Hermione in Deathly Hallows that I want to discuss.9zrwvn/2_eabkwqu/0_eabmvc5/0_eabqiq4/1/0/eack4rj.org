You have it the other way around. Her second husband is Harry. She even stated in an interview that "I married Harry Potter". Ron was based on her first husband. And of course she's Hermione, somewhat. Which in my opinion makes it a bit convoluted that she ended on R/ Hr, but maybe that's the wish-fulfillment she spoke about.
