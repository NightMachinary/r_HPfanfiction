  Harry is very in tune with Hermione. One of my biggest reasons why I don't like the ship is because I dislike when there can't seem to be a purely platonic male/female relationship in movies/books. (To be fair, I also don't ship her with Ron.)

I like the ship, but I also love platonic but very intimate/close Harry&Hermione friendship fics. The only problem with those is that I can't really see them happening with Ron&Ginny's canon personalities (if they are in the picture). It's my headcanon for why Harry and Hermione seem so distant in the epilogue: They are accommodating their spouses.

And no, I'm not bashing. Even much less insecure people get uncomfortable and make a fuzz when their SOs have close friendships to the opposite sex.
