It would take a lot of work to make that happen. Hermione didnt try very hard to get herself out of the friend zone. So to Harry she's still just a friend who teeters between and off and on relationship with Ron who she frequently disagrees with.

And as for why Harry left her alone in the tent to cry by herself, he's ALWAYS done his greiving alone and he knows that crying doesn't help him by this point.

Didn't help with the Dursleys. (Ignored) Didn't help when Siruis died. ( Channeled his grief into a hair trigger temper that got much worse) Didn't help when Hedwig died either.

So he's just at a complete loss. How do you comfort someone when you've never known how or been on the recieving? If anything would think Ron would know how (Big family and two living parents), and Ron's not there, which brings the problem back full circle.
