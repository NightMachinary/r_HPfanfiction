Well, while it is overall a good read, I think it takes way too much time describing the lifes of people that are purely OC. I mean, I wouldn't mind it if it were just the Marauders or Snape, but for example, the life of Donna Shacklebot is something I don't give a crap about.

Apart from that, and here it comes a SPOILER, the arc of James and Sirius being mad at each other for the incident between Reums/Snape is really, and I mean, really long. And plain stupid. He/She kept it innecessarily to the point of being absurd. Also, the whole Shelley vs Carlota is unbelievable, that was Hogwarts, not a sappy prom from a teenager american movie.

Despite all that, I enjoyed it and wanted to see how he/she portraiyed the beginnings of James and Lily relationship, but almost 5 years later, that is probably not gonna happen
