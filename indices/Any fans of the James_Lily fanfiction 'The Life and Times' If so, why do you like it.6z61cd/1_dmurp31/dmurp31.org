It's just too good man. The characters are really how you would imagine them being, it's not like this sappy weird james following Lilly around and then just falling in love and being perfect. And the OCs are actually really fantastic. And the weight of the first wizarding war is really there. And it has the aspect of like teen drama that we didn't get from the original books which is awesome and hilarious at times and low key heart breaking
