The fic I'm co-writing currently seems like something you might like. It's definitely along these lines, and absolutely no character bashing. We are intensely interested in complex characters who make both good and bad choices & just generally clash and misunderstand each other.

It is unfinished, but fairly long already and only going to get longer. No hard feelings if it's not your cup of tea. :)
