Ironically enough, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][/Make a Wish/]] by Rorschach's Blot treats the canon good characters very well. It's just Harry becomes ridiculously OP. I swear, Dumbledore's characterization in this particular fic is one of my favorites, for all that he's a very minor character in it.
