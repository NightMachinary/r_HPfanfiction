It's not for everyone, but linkffn(12978482) is doing pretty good with competent adults and exploring motivations. Sirius and Barty are great and though Harry is quite biased against Dumbledore, what we see of him is canon compliant. Even poor Ron is treated well.

Incomplete at the moment, but updates are pretty regular.

Warning: Harry/Voldemort endgame.
