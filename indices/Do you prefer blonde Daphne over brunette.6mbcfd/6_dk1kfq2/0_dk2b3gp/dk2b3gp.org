She gets mentioned once in the books. That's it. Now as to why she's so popular you have to remember the idiot ball idea. For a story to be compelling and believable then people have to do dumb stuff or else problems are solved and the issue that creates the plot goes away. In Harry Potter obvious points are the seeming incompetency of adults and Harry seemingly ignoring the return of Voldemort in his fifth and sixth years. If we categorise then about half of fanfiction isn't new stories using the Harry Potter world but rather the canon story done 'right'. This often means the idiot ball is kicked away and the characters 'improved.' Some of Harry's idiocy can be blamed on the fact he's a Gryffindor, a house known to leap without looking. Fanfiction writers have hindsight. This often leads to them picking up foreshadowing and the like and seeing the 'obvious' outcome. To get this into the fic you need a 'cunning' planner, so a Slytherin and since this is fanfiction it needs to be a pairing. Pansy's face looks pug like and she's a brat with Draco. Millicent looks like a troll leaving Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. Which has the cooler name and being a pureblood from Slytherin opens up more ideas than a halfblood.

She's also the default pairing for Slytherin!Harry for the reasons listed above, she's the only choice.

Harry Potter world > Harry Potter Story. I want to know more about the magical world. To explore that we need a guide. The Weasleys won't do, they're too quirky. We need a pureblood to guarantee the magical background to contrast with the readers knowledge. Name purebloods that didn't fight for Voldemort? I think the obvious answers are Susan Bones, who might be a halfblood but comes from an old pureblood family and just so happens to be quite a popular pairing, Neville, he knows his way around but isn't a girl so isn't a traditional pairing or oh look its Daphne.

By this point she's found her way into so many fics she's taken on a life of her own and is the fandoms own child.
