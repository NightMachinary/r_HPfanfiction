As I understand it, she is used as an OC who's the pureblood slytherin that can get close to harry and show him a different world. She's grown in the fandom as her own character: the beautiful ice queen.

She's got an awesome name and she can be used as an example of the good slytherin. Cunning, ambitious but not evil, not necessarily blood supremacits or Voldemort's blind followers, like pansy or malfoy.

I like some stories with her, yet I never forget that she's just a very interesting common OC. Unfortunately her stories usually have a lot of Gryffindor bashing and ridiculous tropes (that some times have been done right, after all tropea are tools) like marriage contracts, goblins, lord potter black slytherin.
