Well, we do know she is blonde so I am operating with that assumption when I read anything that features her and I need an image of her for whatever reason.

That said, I don't know why but any time I try to imagine her without any prior image to influence my imagination, she comes out with green hair. And I've already ruled out the option of this happening because she is a slytherin, so I guess it's just my imagination going haywire.
