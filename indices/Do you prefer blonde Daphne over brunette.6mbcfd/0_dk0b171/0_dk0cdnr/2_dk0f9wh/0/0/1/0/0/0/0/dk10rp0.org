I don't think we'll ever really agree over this, because our perspectives are fundamentally different in some ways.

Yes, I see what Ron did for Harry and I never said that I hate Ron - just that because of some of the stuff he did I prefer Hermione's character and that I can understand that the dislike for Ron comes from more than just the movies.

I never said Ron was a bad person!

And while Ron is in some ways relatable he in some ways isn't. I can relate to Hermione's love for books. I can relate to Neville's lack of confidence. I can relate to Harry's awkwardness in certain situations. I can partially relate to the shittyness of Harry's childhood, but way less to the problems of Ron's.

One example: I never had any expectations on me, neither of my parents ever got any higher education and neither did my brothers - in fact, I was teased heavily because I was sucessful in school and book-smart.\\
Yet I had the feeling that I /have to/ be academically sucessful or I'd be worthless, and I absolutely worked for it. (I've been called teacher's pet on more than one occasion).\\
My boggart would be more similar to Hermione's (when I was thirteen).

Another example: While my family was poor growing up (debts + gov. aid) I never felt ashamed of it, not in the way Ron seems to be.

So in the end I have to disagree on one point: In many ways I can relate way better to Hermione and Harry than to Ron.
