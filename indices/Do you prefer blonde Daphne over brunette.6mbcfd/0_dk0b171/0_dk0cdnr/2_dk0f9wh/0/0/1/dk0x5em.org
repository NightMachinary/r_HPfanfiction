Well, there is the part where he leaves Harry twice when things get hard (GoF, DH) while Hermione stays with Harry. I think that also went a long way in people liking her over Ron. Especially during GoF I really started to feel some anger at him sometimes, in DH he had the excuse of the locket.

And during the books Hermione hermione became more like- and relatable (relative to their situation) while for me at least the older Ron grew more and more unlikeable (Won-Won, ...)

To blame everything on the movies everytime is a bit of a cheap excuse. It's certainly part of it, but Book-Ron's characterization has problems, too.
