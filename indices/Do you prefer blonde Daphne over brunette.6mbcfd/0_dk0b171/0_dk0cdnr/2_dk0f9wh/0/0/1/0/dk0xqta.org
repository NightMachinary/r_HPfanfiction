Book!ron is already overshadowed by his five older brothers and his younger sister who would get much more attention because she was the first Weasley girl in generations. He also grew up and hardly got anything he ever wanted-not that children should get everything they ask for.

Then, Ron escapes from his family to Hogwarts and he makes friends with non other than the Boy Who Lived, who gets attention when he as much as sneezes. He then makes friends with Hermione Granger, the brightest witch he ever knew.

So now Ron is Harry Potter's friend and not Ron Weasley. He is Hermione Granger's friend but not Ron Weasley, of course he's going to get jealous!

His best friend saves the stone, kills a basilisk, has Voldemort's biggest supporter break out of prison to murder him and is then picked by the Goblet of Fire as a 'fourth' champion. Come on!

His other best friend is a prodigy at magic, teachers like her and she gets the highest grades in their year.

In DH, it was a bit insensitive for Harry to leave Ron out of the conversation with Hermione though it is very understandable and excusable. Ron was manipulated by the Horcrux and when he left he wanted to get back that very moment.

Ron is one of my favorite characters in the series and in my opinion, massively and criminally underrated. He always came back when he left and as Harry tells Ron, Dumbledore gave him the deluminator because he knew he would come back.
