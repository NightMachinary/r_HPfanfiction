I know all of that, I was just trying to explain why despite all that I just don't really like him as much - because if you argue that way, Harry would also have every right to never forgive Ron.

From Harry's perspective his first friend - that he trusted with /everything/ - doesn't believe that after all he went through - including saving his sister- doesn't trust him to not lie in his face.

Harry, who has never had a friend before the Hogwarts express just forgives Harry after the Goblet, but man that must have hurt for Harry. What more should he do for Ron to trust him?

And that is why I started to dislike him after the scene in GoF, and he never was the same for me again. While yes, he does have his reasons they are just not good enough for me to remain liking him as if it never happened.

Other people with different experiences and priorities will see the situation differently, but for me it was such bullshit that after all Harry went through, with and for Ron, he can't trust him for months and then simply comes back.

Only a while later Harry gets him a date for the yule ball, and it seems like Ron isn't even trying with Padma, and instead is angry and accuses Hermione of betraying Harry (He says l"He's just using you Hermione"). That especially annoyed me after what he did just a short while before.

You can have a completely different view of this, and I know that 14yo kids are sometimes insensitive like that - but not all the time, at least the ones I'd like to have as my friends, even at that age.
