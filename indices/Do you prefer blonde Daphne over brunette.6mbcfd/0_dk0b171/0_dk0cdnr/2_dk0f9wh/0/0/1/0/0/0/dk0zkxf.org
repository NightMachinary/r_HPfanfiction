You do realize that Ron also went through so much for Harry. People point out his behavior in GoF and DH and yet they don't seem to remember that he stood by Harry in OotP when the ministry was ridiculing him.

This was the guy that sacrificed himself to a go at Che's game at age 11(?), the guy who rescued Harry from his cage of a room in CoS, the guy that stood on his broken foot to tell a murderer that he has to kill him if he wants to kill Harry, the guy that knew his faults and acknowledged them, the guy that stood by him in OotP, the guy who still stood by him in HBP, the guy that came back and was the one who insisted to come on the Horcrux hunt because he wouldn't leave Harry, the guy that helped him win against Voldemort, the guy that later became his brother-in-law and the guy that accompanied him in his years as an auror.

Edit: this is also the guy that faced off his own phobia because Hermione was petrified. Come on. He is also very relatable because he is the most realistic of the characters.
