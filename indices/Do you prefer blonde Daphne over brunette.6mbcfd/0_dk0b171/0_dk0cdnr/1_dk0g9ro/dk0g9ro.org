Even if it wasn't Daphne, I do admit I think it would have been cool if partway through the series Harry actually made friends with Slytherin and had to get over his prejudice because despite many of the new Death Eaters coming from Slytherin, they were not all bad and Harry never saw that. He really bought into the whole all Slytherins are evil thing that Ron sold to him on his first trip on the Hogwarts Express. I think it would have made for interesting character development. It didn't have to be a potential romantic partner, but could be as well.
