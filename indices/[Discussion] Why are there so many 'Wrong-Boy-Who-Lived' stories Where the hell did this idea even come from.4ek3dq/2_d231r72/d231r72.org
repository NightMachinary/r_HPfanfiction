The idea is straight from canon, is it really surprising that it's commonly used? A large point of HP is the self-fulfilling nature of prophecies, I can't stand it when fanfics ignore this and pretend that Harry is the only one capable of destroying Voldemort.

"Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. . . . Or would it? Would Neville's mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no "Chosen One" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's? (HBP pg 139/133)"
