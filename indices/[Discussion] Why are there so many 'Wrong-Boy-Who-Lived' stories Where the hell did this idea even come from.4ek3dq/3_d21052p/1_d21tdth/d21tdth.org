Haha, that story was one of the first things that came to mind when I came across this thread. I would have mentioned it if you hadn't - because despite the fact that wrong!boy-who-lived is now becoming a cliche (or was), this was a completely fascinating AU. There was so much effort and thought and words-in-general put into it, and even if it wasn't my absolutely and indisputable favorite, it was definitely a good read.\\
I actually didn't know about it until recently though, after a reading a light-hearted parody. I would say that I'm surprised that it spawned this trope, but I'm kind of not, because it's like what.. a decade old, right?\\
I realize that this comment is slightly tangential, but I guess I just have to gush about this a little haha.\\
And to continue on in [[/u/TantumErgo]] 's thought-process about the fic:\\
Yeah, the name choice really tripped me up. Like insanely. That, coupled with the fact that Draco was such an unbelievable pleb. Ugh.\\
It was a great read though! I'd recommend it to the OP - it might change your opinion on the terribadness of this trope!
