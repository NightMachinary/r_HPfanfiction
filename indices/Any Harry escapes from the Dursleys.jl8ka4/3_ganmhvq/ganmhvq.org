Bit of Spoiler & Not sure if this is what you are searching for but I'm currently reading "A very Slytherin" series from geoffaree and here Harry gets taken from the Dursleys and placed as the guard of Severus Snape. It's not finished though. I don't know how the link bot works so here is the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]
