  Harry stepped into the Veil in the Chamber of Death in the Department of Mysteries and steps out into a new - and strange - world in search of his godfather Sirius Black.But Harry should beware: the differences between the two worlds are more than skin deep and if he isn't careful even the most ancient bonds of blood and trust won't be enough to save him when someone in St. Louis starts slaughtering vampires for their power.A Harry Potter/Anita Blake Crossover

  Harry has started learning the ropes in his new world, will he survive the deeper he goes or will it drag him under? In the tense and delicate power structure of St. Louis a single misstep could be lethal. With a past cloaked in mystery and a godfather trying to keep him safe, he's drawn the eyes - and attention - of several powerful players in St. Louis's preternatural community.Not all attention, as Harry very well knows, is positive.However, Harry isn't the only one causing mayhem in St. Louis, and a secret that has been carefully kept from him may be the undoing of all that he has managed to build.
