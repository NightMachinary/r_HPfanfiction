um, the Bonds series works. He follows Sirius into the Anita Blake universe. Fair bit of power-wank, among other despised tropes, especially in the first installment, but you can easily skip it if you like. Slash. I only have vague ideas about wtf is going on in the other fandom (I read one book and didn't particularly like it), but managed fine with the story because shit was explained for Harry's benefit.

If you want to go straight to Honor Bound (the crossover), then here's a spoiler-rich summary and you can avoid helpful goblins:

Harry realizes that Sirius is alive, gets handed a whole list of blocks on his magic and shit like that from Gringotts, hides away in Grimmauld Place with the portraits and a time turner he stole and studies like hell because evil dumbledore is manipulative. He breaks the blocks with the help of the portraits. Then he jumps through the veil, the horcrux dies in the void, and part two starts.
