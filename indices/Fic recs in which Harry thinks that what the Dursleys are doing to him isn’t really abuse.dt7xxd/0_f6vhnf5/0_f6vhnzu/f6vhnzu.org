  When Harry appears at the Welcoming Feast wearing a glamor only Snape notices, Snape decides to find out what the glamor is hiding. You, the guiltless, will pay for your father's sins,Roman, until you repair the decayingtemples and shrines of the gods, and theirimages, filthy with blackening smoke.When you act as servant of the gods, you rule:from them all beginning, leave them the ending.Horace, Odes, III-6
