No, that's genuinely what I meant. Yeah, it's obviously abuse, how could it not be? But it's not always as clear when you're in the situation, especially when it's the only life you remember. I recently read a fic that had a really good take on that and I was interested in finding more on the subject, that's all it is. So, I would appreciate it if you didn't go into ad hominem arguments, thank you.
