Fanfiction can make readers think more deeply about the characters and the plot, asking questions that require digging below the surface. Consider how "Gone With the Wind" is seen in a different light from a slave's perspective in "The Wind Done Gone", showing more of what goes on behind the scenes in the household, or how the character of Mr Rochester in "Jane Eyre" is questioned and reinterpreted in "Wide Sargasso Sea". Harry Potter's interactions with Severus Snape can take on new meaning after reading Severus' perspective, eg in "The Snape Chronicles", which draws the reader's attention to just how impulsive and unreasonable Harry could sometimes be, and how unfairly Slytherin in general was treated by canon.

On the other hand, since it's usually noncommercial online publishing, with a very low barrier to entry, fanfiction tends to have immense quantity with far lower average quality than traditional publishing. It can be time-consuming to identify stories that will be interesting and valuable to oneself, and even then, there are likely to be many more typographical and stylistic errors than a paper book would have, as well as other signs of limited proofreading, such as excessive length.

Economically, fanfiction is a mixed bag. It typically doesn't and can't earn any money, but it does operate in its own communities offering non-financial incentives such as camaraderie and acclaim. Furthermore, authors of fanfiction are likely to be readers of it as well, so its free nature is a benefit to them at the same time as being a cost.
