The greatest strength of fanfiction is that it is highly personal. People write fic because they enjoy the characters or the setting. Perhaps they disagree with a canon choice, or they just want to see what would happen to a what if. But ultimately, they do so for personal reasons, that are almost never born out of more mundane reasons like fame, money or obligation (though I suppose spite might be an obligation).

The downside of course is that fanfiction is highly personal. There is a reason that fanfiction of fanfiction exists after all, and it's that the only way to really get the fanfiction you want to read is to write it yourself. That means for those of us without the time, skill, or spoons to write our own fic sometimes have to spend a lot of time finding the fic that we want.
