One thing I do not like, is when authors use characters as mouthpieces for their own views, and it doesn't fit in with the overall tone of the story.

Using your characters to project your views to the world is fine if you take the time to give proper context, and make sure to build up your characters, so that it doesn't disrupt the flow of the story, or clash with your characterisation.
