Oh shit I forgot about the cons XD

I honestly can't think of any except for the poorly written fics out there but I prefer to think of them as practice. After all, you never get good at something unless you practise it.

Oh wait no, I got some.

Because it's fanfiction, some people will copy works and post on other websites. And the creator can only report the work or ask them to take it down and there's usually no further consequence to plagiarism.

Comments are sometimes very negative. I understand criticism, I welcome criticism as an author myself but some are just plain rude and mentally draining to read. I have seen authors take down 100k+ fics because of them.

Hiatus/Abandoned fics. I understand that they have lives outside of fanfiction but it's honestly so frustrating to read a masterpiece and then see "Last Updated: 8 years ago". I ain't mad, I understand but it's just so ಥ‿ಥ, you know?

As an extension of this point, some people will continue on the fic without the explicit approval of the original creator and that's just another form of plagiarism as well. The reason often cited is "oh this is just too good to be abandoned, it's been __ years since the last update, it's practically free real estate by now."
