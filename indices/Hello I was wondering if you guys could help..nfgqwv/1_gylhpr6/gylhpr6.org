Let's start with the pros!

1. Canon Divergence. I don't need to elaborate on this, do I? Sometimes, the original story (canon) does not go the way the readers won't. For example : Most authors thrive on killing off characters (Some fanfiction authors do too XD) but it would be nice to know a variation of the story where that particular character stays alive. I have personally spent hours scrolling through works tagged "Tony Stark doesn't die" or "Alternate Universe - Nobody dies/Everybody lives".

2. Background stories - I want history! Flashbacks! Gimme more! An extension of this and the preceding point would be any variation to canon XD

3. Word length. I have read fics which is way lengthier than the original book series and with writing on par with or better than the original.

4. Creative outlet. Needless to say, people get to work on their creativity, and inspire people with the fics. I have seen works based on other works, GIFs/mood boards on fics, etc.

5. No unnecessary process to get a story published online. Usually to publish a book, you have to find a publisher, editor, etc but I have seen original works on ao3 that are (pardon my language) fucking amazing, I would literally buy a dozen copies if it came out as paperback amazing!

6. Friendship based on beta-ing works, comments, etc. In ao3, there is a system in which you can gift works to other users too.

Hmm I'm sure there's more pros but these are the only ones that come to mind right now !
