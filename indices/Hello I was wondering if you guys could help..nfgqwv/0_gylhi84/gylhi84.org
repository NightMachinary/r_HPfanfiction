Pros:

It can flesh out the minor characters and a lot more.

You can build on minor character development where the author has to editorialize.

You can keep reading new content in a world you love and with characters you love. It's not limited to just the words the original author has written.

Cons:

You can get pulled into the fanfiction world more than the original one and it muddies the content a bit in your head.

The characters lose some of their definition, with fanfiction the authors make the characters who they want, and if you read enough of it you almost lose the original characterizations.

Tropes, even widely accepted concepts, become part of your head canon. For example, Dumbledore saying, “My boy”, and the use of defensive wards are two things that happen a lot in fanfiction but are not in the original work.

Most fanfiction is at least somewhat poorly written. It's either overly long, too short, has poor structure, isn't planned well, etc. Reading to much of it can actually make you a worse writer if that's what you're into.

I'm sure there's a lot more pros and cons, but those stood out for me.
