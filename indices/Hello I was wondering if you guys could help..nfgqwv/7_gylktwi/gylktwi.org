Well, some pros are: 1.for the writer, they get to work on their writing and communicating skills via their works and they don't have to think too hard on world building since the world is already built by someone else. 2. For the reader, we get to immerse ourselves into further sections of something we clearly loved or enjoyed enough to seek out more of it. 3. we get a choice of what type of turn we want it to take. E.g don't like the Canon couple? Fanfiction has a plethora of options available but maybe you want to like the ship so some fanfics will look further into the ship to help you like the ship, doesn't always happen but it can. 4. If you haven't read the books (I'm guilty, I own them but I haven't read them), a lot of fanfics base main events and gather information from the books so you get an understanding on why certain things happened in the movies and we also get better insight to characters themselves without having to actually read the books. (I do plan on reading them though) 5. Sometimes the fanfics are simply better done and have better explosions and such than the original content.

Cons 1. Sometimes we forget what's Canon and fanon since it is seen so often in fanon that it gets taken as fanon 2. There isn't always a beta to point out plot holes and or grammar or spelling issues. (Althought Canon can often have plot holes that need to be filled by fanon and assumptions) 3. Bashing.
