In terms of reading:

As the writer doesn't need to build everything from the ground up, it allows for more focus on developing specific points. The rough outline of the world, magic system and characters are already in place. While the author is free to change as much of these as they want, they don't have to and can get straight to the story. Especially for fantasy, for original works you often need to spend a lot of time worldbuilding before you can actually start the plot if you want the setting to be engaging, and as reader you don't always want to bother with that.

It is a way to run intellectual thought experiments. A lot of fanfics are, to a greater or lesser extent, what-if scenarios. What if Harry was in Slytherin, or what if Harry and Ginny started going out earlier are common examples. The fanfics which do this bring characters and situations to life by investigating how they would change and behave under different scenarios, and what the long term knock on effects could be.

Comfort. I enjoy reading for many reasons, and I don't always want to read for the same reasons. Especially with all of the tags, I have quite a good idea of what a fanfic will be like before I start it, as I know most of the situations inside out. Therefore if I just want to spend a couple of hours reading a particular kind of story, I can do it easily.

Convenience. Ironically I feel that copywrite laws may actually be hurting the publishing industry more than helping. Even if you discard the genres and tags you aren't interested it, and only go for 'good' stories, shear volume means that there is vast amounts of text to read completely for free. Most of it is over a handful of websites which have tags and other methods for filtering out what you are looking for, so as long as you have an internet connection, you can keep reading endlessly if you feel like it. This is probably more true for this fandom than any other, because it seems to be by far the largest.

A disadvantage can be quality. While there are many excellent fics out there, most aren't. You will end up reading some utter shit. Although a counterpoint is that this isn't exclusive to fanfiction. I also have Kindle Unlimited which gives me free access to a selection of books, and I have dropped some of them for being terrible as well. At least with fanfic if you don't like it you can close the tab and never look back. Books, especially in shops, can end up getting quite expensive if you are reading a lot.

I would say that fanfiction probably isn't safe for children. Quite aside from the tick-box 'age restrictions' on the internet for sex and gore. The internet being the internet, there are a lot of stories that do not show their author in a good light. Due to the age of the characters during the canon plot, the HP fandom can have a lot of issues with excusing or actively encouraging underage sex and grooming. Also, as the series was aimed for children, many of the authors are writing at and 'edgy' stage in their life. They are not necessarily malicious, but may just be before they have reached full emotional maturity and understood what is and isn't ok when it comes to dealing with others. A lot of stuff that labels itself as 'dark' or involves death eater main characters glorifies violence, abuse and unhealthy, often rape-based, relationships. That is not to say that these stories should never be written, but it may not be the best thing for them to be open access for people at impressionable stages of their lives.

Many stories are abandoned. While this isn't always much of a loss, there are many excellent stories out there which will never be finished, which is a massive shame. Even if what is there is good, suddenly running cold mid way can overcloud that with the disappointment.

In terms of writing:

It is a entry level way into becoming an author. Anyone can create an account on a fanfic site and post something , even just a few hundred words, and chances are someone will read it and give feedback. Also there is already a basis of world, characters and plot for you to build off. Especially if you don't want to or lack confidence in constructing everything from scratch yourself, then it allows a starting point. A bit like using a level-editor or modding a game rather than coding something from scratch yourself. In addition there are a large number of communities for you to discuss concepts and ideas with as you go.

It allows you to let you imagination run free. Many, if not most of those who write fanfic, even what ends up being novel length and quality, would never have started writing original works instead if fanfic didn't exist. Especially if you don't see yourself becoming a professional author, a place to write what you want, the length you want and at the speed you want can be invaluable.
