Umbridge. Like objectively so. Send dementors after Harry, was about to use the torture curse on him. Allowed Filch to use his torture methods on students when she became headmistress.\\
Also, it was not just Harry who got the blood quill. Everyone Umbridge disliked got it. Even for something as small as mere pranks.

Not defending what McGonagall did, but Umbridge is worse, that is just undeniable fact.
