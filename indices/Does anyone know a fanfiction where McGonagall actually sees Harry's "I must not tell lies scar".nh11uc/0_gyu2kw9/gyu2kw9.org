There's one with a title along the lines of "The Dark Mark would clash with her pink cardigan" or something like that. It subverts the usual fanfic trope by having the scars discovered and reported make things /so much worse/. Umbridge and the Ministry spin it as Harry having done it to himself - after all, everybody knows he's a very disturbed child - and use it as justification to lock him away in Saint Mungo's.
