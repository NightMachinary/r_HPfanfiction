Hopefully This will make the Game system in The Harry potter fics better. Because all the gamer fics being based on the manwha the gamer ha made me developed a hatred for the Gamer's Mind and the Instant Dungeons ability that appear in every single one.( then again I guess anyone that comes up with their own original System would be better off going it as a original Litrpg)
