If you are actually interested in the hows and whys people are calling Rowling out on her TERF bullshit & manifesto click the YouTube video I included in this post. It is from 3 months ago. Before we even knew of this book.

Her new book is actually harming the already negative image trans people have by making the killer a guy in woman's clothing. That is everything but being an ally.

And that is why I really don't even want to play the game at all (not even if I managed to get it free) because I am quite scared that it might use stereotypes or allegories that will piss me off.
