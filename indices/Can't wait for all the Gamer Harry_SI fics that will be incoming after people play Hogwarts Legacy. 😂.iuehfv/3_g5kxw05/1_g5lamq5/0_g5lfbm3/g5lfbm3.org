I think it's the part about coming to Hogwarts a few years late that really gets me. That just seems like a terrible SI premise. "I'm so special and I'm showing up at Hogwarts at 16 so I can immediately start romancing [author's favorite character]."

As a video game enthusiast, I don't care too much about the plot. As long as it's serviceable and the gameplay is fun, I'll probably enjoy it.

But as a fanfic enthusiast, I am worried about what sort of awful ideas this game will introduce. Especially since a lot of people (and especially the wiki) like to treat absolutely everything as canon.
