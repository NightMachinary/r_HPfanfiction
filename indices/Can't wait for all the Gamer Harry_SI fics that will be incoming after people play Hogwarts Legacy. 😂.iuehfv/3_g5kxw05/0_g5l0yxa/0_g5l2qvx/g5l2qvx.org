There is something very fun about crub stomping the opposition into oblivion. Which is one of the reasons I love GoT SIs where the SI starts the industrialisation and brings guns to a sword fight.

Although I don't think that there's a single complete GoT SI fic with that premise, only a bunch of abandoned ones which stop when they get to the good part.
