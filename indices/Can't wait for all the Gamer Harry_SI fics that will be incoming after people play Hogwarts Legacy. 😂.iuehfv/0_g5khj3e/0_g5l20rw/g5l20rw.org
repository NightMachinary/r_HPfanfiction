I can't stand that genre because for some reason the authors always choose to use the worst aspects from video games, namely grinding, for their stories. I get that you want to show that a character gets stronger, but IMO a Mass Effect like approach where you get XP for completed quests/levels rather than on enemy kill would be way smoother to read.
