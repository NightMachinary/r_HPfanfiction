Or a Fallout style to system where everything counts. You could even have skill sections for charms, DADA and the like. Have each year based off of a 10 point block and everything over 70 would be mastery level things not taught in Hogwarts. Basically if you meet both a stat and/or skill point number you learn the spell or potion and earn exp.

With a fallout RP system most stats are static for each person but perks and skill point spread is the biggest thing for PC and NPC people. For example Snape might have a higher skill level in potions then voldemort but be behind him in the dark arts skill. Lucius malfoy could be a charisma based person with a high speech skill. Maybe his skillet is not fighting directly (could be the reason he was beat by mostly fifth years in OtoP.
