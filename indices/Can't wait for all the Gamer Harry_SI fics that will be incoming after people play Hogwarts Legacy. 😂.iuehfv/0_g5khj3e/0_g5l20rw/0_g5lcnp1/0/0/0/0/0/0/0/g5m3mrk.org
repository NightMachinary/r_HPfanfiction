You can raise the competency of the good guys too. And you can still have Harry facing off against enemies with little help due to circumstances. A good author could make this all work excellently. There's nothing impossible about this idea, just need an author skilled and clever enough to think things through and make it work.

And not everyone is interested in a gore-fest. If you want to kill a bunch of people you could set up the rules of the game differently and tweak the setting too. Make the setting darker, with much more lingering problems. Force Harry into more life-or-death situations.
