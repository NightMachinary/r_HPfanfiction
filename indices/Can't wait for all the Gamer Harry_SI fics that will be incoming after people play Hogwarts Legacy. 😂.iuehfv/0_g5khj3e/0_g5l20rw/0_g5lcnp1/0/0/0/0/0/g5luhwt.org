Never said we had to make up OC bosses. You could just raise the competency of the top Death Eaters and other main antagonists. Take what Taure did to Lockhart in Victoria Potter. He's more competent and would make a great boss, while still being recognisably himself. As for the death count, you could make the mechanics of the game encourage mostly defeating threats non-lethally or stop them before they're killed (because they're arrested or something else). If they get arrested it also allows them to power-up later too for rematches. As for the usual fodder enemies in games, you could expand the population of Magical Britain. Instead of just like 40 students per year, increase it greatly. Have millions of witches and wizards. And then the canon characters can be made more important for some reason or another. It doesn't have to feel cheap.
