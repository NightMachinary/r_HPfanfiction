Most games have different enemy types early and late though, which is an issue if your plot has the same enemy all the time. If Harry can deal with Death Eaters in chapter 3, meeting them in chapter 40 is honestly a waste of words. And there are not many Death Eaters who'd make a good boss. I certainly can't see Lucius play the part (outside of a tutorial level at least).
