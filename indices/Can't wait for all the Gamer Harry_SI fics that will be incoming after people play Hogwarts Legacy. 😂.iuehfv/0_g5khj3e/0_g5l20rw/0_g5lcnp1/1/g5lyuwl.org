The reason they die is because they trivialize literally everything. Not just the difficulty of beating opponents or antagonists, but the entire concept of the story itself.

The problem is not the numbers, it's that ALL gamer stories have the protagonist be the only person who experiences the game. The very, very few stories I have read where at least one other character than the MC have the gamer abilities, or where the MC doesn't keep this ability secret, are often interesting regardless.
