Gamer fics are where characters suddenly find themselves with the power to use game mechanics to themselves. They find themselves with Health bars, stamina bars, magic bars able to gain buffs from eating foods or resting etc. They also gain the power to "Lv up" by doing tasks, thus making their rate of growth explosive. i.e, doing a certain task like completing Homework gives you experience points. Passing the experience threshold gives you points to add to your attributes. So your strength, intelligence, charisma grow up magically overnight whereas a Normal person would have to train themselves up and study to do this

Si is short for self insert. It's basically mega wish fulfillment in which you write yourself or a character based on yourself or someone you know into your favourite story/fic and he goes through life in the story, perhaps saving characters, changing plots, discovering new things or growing stronger etc....or suffering through mega loads of shit depending on the fic writer and fandom. (I have no idea why someone would want to be dropped into Warhammer 40k. That universe is just a hellhole on its last legs and where disaster is just another Monday.)

But that's basically it.
