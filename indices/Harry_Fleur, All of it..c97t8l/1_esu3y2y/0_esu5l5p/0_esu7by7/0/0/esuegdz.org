I chose not to put anything in the description because I didn't want to scare people away who are not familair with the Souls Universe. My OC in the story is the Chosen Undead, albeit a bit tweaked to fit the story.

I had the idea running through my head for quite some time but decided to write it down and see what people thought about it. I felt like both universes could compliment each other rather well. However, I had to change a few rules in both universes to make it work, but everything will be explained in due time. I am planning to take this way beyond Harry's fourth year!
