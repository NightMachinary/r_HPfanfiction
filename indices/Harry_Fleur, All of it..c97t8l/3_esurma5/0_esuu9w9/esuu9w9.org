Regrettably, I must agree with you on all points. When it is done well, such as in A Cadmean Victory, the pairing works fantastically. However, if done poorly, the result could be fairly actuarrately summarized as a sort of crossbreed between the Hindenburg and the Titanic. That is to say, God awful. Fortunately, in the 40 fics listed there are quite a few that are still quite good. In addition to A Cadmean Victory I am quite Partial to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters by TheEndless7]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132670/1/][The Stag and The Flower by ReluctantSidekick]]. Neither is perfect of course, but both are quite pleasant and a decent read.
