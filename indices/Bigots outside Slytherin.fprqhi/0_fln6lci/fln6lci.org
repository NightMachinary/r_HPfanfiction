I feel like all the Ravenclaw Harry fics that I've read always show the boys in his dorm as somewhat bigoted. It's always the same set that I can't name for the life of me, but there is always these two that are name dropped in the books, that are always presented as being just as bad as Draco, except that they hide it somewhat in front of the teachers/are not as outspoken as Draco. One of them always hate Harry from the get go only because of his mother/blood, whereas Draco always came off as being mostly spiteful (at first) because of the friendship denial.

(As a result, I always feel like Ravenclaw would have been a terrible house-especially in comparison with Hufflepuff or Gryffindor---where thinking outside the box, like Luna, would mean 7 hellish years and being different in any way a true nightmare).

(And wasn't Barty a Ravenclaw? Maybe he got corrupted by the house bigotry in the first place. See, all makes sense now haha).
