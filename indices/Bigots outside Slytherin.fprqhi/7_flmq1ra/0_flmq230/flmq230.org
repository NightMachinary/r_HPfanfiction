  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
