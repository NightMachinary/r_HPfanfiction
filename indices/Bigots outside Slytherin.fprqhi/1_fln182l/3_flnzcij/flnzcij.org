I don't think the point was making fun of squibs, in fact a squib is never mentioned, could be a muggle that's married into the family. Ron says he believes that there is a second cousin of Molly's who is an accountant, but they never talk about him. So it's a bit of a grown-up joke from the author about accountants and how boring their profession (and them in extention) is. This is how I've read it at least.
