  I feel like Slytherin would have more bigots that know that they're bigots and are outspoken about it. And other Houses would have many people who are â€˜I have a black/asian friend so I'm not racist' kind of bigots.

Yup. There was a quote from a fic I read that basically stated that the Dark wanted Muggle(borns) killed off, the middle-of-the-road people wanted them seperated, and the Light wanted them assimilated.
