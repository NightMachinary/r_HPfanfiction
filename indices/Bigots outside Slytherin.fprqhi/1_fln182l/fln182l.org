I feel like Slytherin would have more bigots that know that they're bigots and are outspoken about it. And other Houses would have many people who are ‘I have a black/asian friend so I'm not racist' kind of bigots.

I also can't help but remember Weasleys. “We have a squib cousin but we don't talk about him.” Molly basically calling Muggle medicine stupid. Arthur literally having a work that has him study Muggles and still being ignorant even of the most basic things like money. He could have asked any Muggleborn at any time to explain him anything, but he hadn't got around to it in all his 40+ years. It just shows how casually bigoted all of the wizarding world is.
