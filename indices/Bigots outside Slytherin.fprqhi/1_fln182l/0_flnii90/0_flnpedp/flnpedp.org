  it's like comparing modern medicine to some of the quackeries that claim to be medicine
#+end_quote

It isn't though. It's like calling medicine in a less developed country stupid because they don't have access to the same education/equipment/money that the first-world countries have. Similarly, Muggles don't have an access to the necessary skill (magic) witch doesn't make them stupid. And some things Muggles just don't need. They don't need to know how to regrow bones because in Muggle world you can't vanish them in the first place.

There's also a difference between â€˜quackeries' and a less developed medicine.

Getting back to the stitches. Because of the venom, healers were unable to close the wound by magical means either, trying stitches wasn't unreasonable at all. Yes, it didn't work in this case. However, it's not a stretch to think that there are curses/cursed daggers/etc. that also leave a wound that couldn't be closed by magic , in witch case stitches would be helpful.

No, he doesn't need to. But his job still involves dealing with Muggle goods. Considering he's so enthusiastic about all things Muggle, I would still expect him to go and ask about the said goods if he's interested and doesn't know what it is (and ok, maybe he does this, the books really don't give that impression though). I also would expect him to be prepared when he knows beforehand that he will have to use Muggle money.
