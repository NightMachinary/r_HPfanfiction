  They don't need to know how to regrow bones because in Muggle world you can't vanish them in the first place.

This is false - if something heavy enough falls on your hand or foot, you can expect your hand to get pulverised. IRL, you'd have to spend the rest of your life without a hand, while wizards can regrow your hand from scratch.

  It's like calling medicine in a less developed country stupid because they don't have access to the same education/equipment/money that the first-world countries have.
#+end_quote

This isn't the proper comparison. As someone living in a third world country, I can say that the medical practices we have here are the same as that in Canada or wherever. We have the same equipment and education as any developed country. The medical technology we use, the medical concepts used by doctors, the treatment of patients, and the overall science behind medicine - they are all the same.

Sure, a country like Canada would have more of the medical equipment that's bleeding edge, but we have that here too, just a lesser number.

It's not like we're using an entirely different medical science, like homeo or acupuncture or whatever they're called now.

On the other hand, Muggles use a completely different medical science compared to wizards. The fact that they don't have magic should not be a mitigating factor when you want to compare the effectiveness of the two sciences.

Besides, Muggles have done incredible feats without any magic, things that wizards haven't been able to do.

  trying stitches wasn't unreasonable at all. Yes, it didn't work in this case.
#+end_quote

It makes for a nice story to laugh over later on, but when you're in that situation - an urgent case, and someone does something as stupid as this when a life could be on the line (speaking from personal experience as a by-stander) - the by-stander will lose their shit.

Imagine if the stitches caused complications and caused something permanent.

  I also would expect him to be prepared when he knows beforehand that he will have to use Muggle money.

There are a lot of inconsistencies as far as the writing goes. This is another of them - Arthur knows how to buy a car and drive it around, but doesn't know how to use the currency to make the purchase itself.
