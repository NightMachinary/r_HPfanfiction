  Being in a third world country doesn't mean your country is less developed. It simply means your country wasn't allied with the Soviets or the US.
#+end_quote

I am quite aware that a third world country is in fact a non-aligned country. However, the vast majority of people treat the term third world as a synonym for developing country. My country is a developing country, in any case.

  If someone was possibly hit by dark magic, which has been known to not allow people to properly heal with magical means. Attempting to use muggle means
#+end_quote

Given the number of dark wizards who hate muggles in wiz history, why would you think that dark magic could be countered with muggle means? If dark magic could be countered easily with muggle means, that sort of defeats the purpose of using dark magic against muggles.

  we can assume Severus Snape as an outlier, due to the outlandish pureblood esque names of all known spellsmiths
#+end_quote

Severus is also an outlandish name by 1990s or 2000s standards.

  And, even then, this entire argument is catastrophically retarded, considering said stitches were dissolved by Nagini's venom either way, and quite literally couldn't have caused complications
#+end_quote

When a substance gets dissolved by a solvent, that substance does not disappear. They are either still present inside the solvent as solute particles, or chemically react with the solvent to form a new substance.

If you want to look at this scientifically, the corrosive nature almost definitely means that the venom reacted with the stitches to produce a new substance.

And you're suggesting that the formation of a new substance in the bloodstream - probably one that's rarely seen before, seeing as normal snake venom is either haemotoxic or neurotoxic - won't cause complications? Are you joking?
