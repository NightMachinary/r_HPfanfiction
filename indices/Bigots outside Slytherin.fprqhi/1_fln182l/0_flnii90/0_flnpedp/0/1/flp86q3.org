Being in a third world country doesn't mean your country is less developed. It simply means your country wasn't allied with the Soviets or the US.

And hence your points on that can be thrown out.

  Trying stitches while in a urgent case is utterly stupid, and this would make a bystander lose their shit.

No, no it wasn't. If someone was possibly hit by dark magic, which has been known to not allow people to properly heal with magical means. Attempting to use muggle means is certainly a viable option, considering how on Earth would a pureblood spell Craftsman (Which would be most of the spell crafters, considering we can assume Severus Snape as an outlier, due to the outlandish pureblood esque names of all known spellsmiths) know about muggle healing techniques. And, even then, this entire argument is catastrophically retarded, considering said stitches were dissolved by Nagini's venom either way, and quite literally couldn't have caused complications, in the scenario offered.
