I think he's trying to say that calling Muggle medicine stupid is just a ridiculous thing to say. Of course it's not stupid because it's the best it can be with the tools Muggles have. If they had magic, it would be an entirely different sort of medicine.

The comparison he's trying to make is between modern allopathy and alternative medicine like ayurveda or acupuncture. Calling those medical traditions 'stupid' is equally as ridiculous as a wizard calling Muggle medicine stupid. In both cases, every group did the best they could with what they had. They formed extensive medical theories, practices, and applications- they didn't simply bumble around in the dark in their stupidity. It just so turned out that one (allopathy) was more suited to today's world and has had better results.

What would be fair to say is that practitioners of other forms of medicine should adopt some allopathic methods because we have proven that that type of medicine is 'better'. You can pass judgement on those practitioners that refuse to do so. But a Muggle cannot adopt Wizarding magic so they are free from criticism. If Muggle doctors could use magic and refused to do so, then perhaps a wizard could say they are 'stupid'. But you're only stupid when you see something that works and refuse to accept it.
