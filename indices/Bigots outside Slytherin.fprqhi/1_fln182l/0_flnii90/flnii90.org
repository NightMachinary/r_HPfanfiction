  Molly basically calling Muggle medicine stupid
#+end_quote

When wizards can regrow bones in an entire arm inside 12 hours (as opposed to never in Muggle medicine), it more or less makes sense for Molly to say this. Wizarding medicine is far beyond Muggle medicine - it's like comparing modern medicine to some of the quackeries that claim to be medicine.

  Arthur literally having a work that has him study Muggles and still being ignorant even of the most basic things like money.
#+end_quote

Arthur's job involves the unlawful enchantment of muggle goods by wizards and dispelling those enchantments, not studying muggles. He doesn't need to know how a currency bill works - however, if a currency note starts biting its owner, then it's Arthur's job to cancel the enchantment.

And Arthur is quite brilliant at enchantment, considering he enchanted his car to fly all by himself.
