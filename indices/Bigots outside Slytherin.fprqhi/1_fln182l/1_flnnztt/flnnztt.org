Bigotry is thinking that you're /morally/ superior based on inherent qualities. it's not bigotry to think that medicine that works better works better.

The Squib accountant thing is more suspect, but there's certainly plenty of non-racist reasons for that, including the Squib simply not wanting to be reminded that there's an entire world out there that he's basically disabled in.

Arthur is ignorant, but his job is basically just getting rid of enchantments on Muggle stuff, not studying Muggles in any way. That's just a hobby. He also does ask Harry and Hermione about Muggle stuff, and it's implied that he does so to Muggleborns at work, which is why he's considered eccentric and kind of a loser.
