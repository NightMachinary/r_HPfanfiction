I think that while this issue is noticeable, it points to a lack of planning by JK from the beginning. Unfortunately at no point in the series is Voldemort's goal logical. I'd guess she planned the first two books? Where it was clear bad guys vs good guys and was more a children's book than a novel. She created clear evil and good, with a distinct lack of â€˜grey'.

It would make much more sense to make bigotry against muggles worse, but embracing magical people was encouraged. Like Grindlewald. If Tom was a disciple of his, he could have created an aristocracy based on magical strength, history, and knowledge that would have made much more sense (And it would have given you an opportunity to have the bigger boss fight).

Blatant bigotry against muggleborns and half-bloods, while part of story, is not only illogical from villain's perspective (who's a half-blood), but downright stupid.

I've seen someone do population dynamics math on here and show that being a pure blood meant you were something like under 10% of the population. Meaning that the chances they could have established a highly popular group with the sole focus on being bigots gets impractical.
