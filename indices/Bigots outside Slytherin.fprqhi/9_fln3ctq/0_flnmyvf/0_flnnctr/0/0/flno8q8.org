I wasn't trying to be patronising love, I use pet names with everyone, check my history, it's a habit of mine. I didn't mean to offend you. And bad roommates have never made me hate all people like them but from what I can see in the series, people are that petty. My roommates have always been good to me actually. I mean, I walked in on the last one having sex with her girlfriend on my bed but I got over it. But I was pissed for a solid week!

Edit: You're right, Hermione seemed to have an issue with her roommates. I want to read a fic that focuses on that.
