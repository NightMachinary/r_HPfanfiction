Lavender and Pavarti would be excellent deatheaters. I can see them not liking muggle-borns because of Hermione annoying the shit out of them. It's my head cannon that those two are great at duelling anyway. Read â€˜Make a Wish' and tell me you can't see Lavender assaulting a vampire with a tanning spell.
