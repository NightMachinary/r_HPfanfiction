What the fuck. One teacher's pet nerd makes them hate all Muggleborns? Because she annoys them? I mean, maybe if you were already a fucking Nazi, I guess, but just being roommates with someone annoying doesn't make you hate their whole race. Plus, they'd still be around and friends with all the other Muggleborns at Hogwarts, which is apparently a huge amount, so I'm not sure where you're coming from.
