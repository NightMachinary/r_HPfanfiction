I generally assume that Death Eaters and anyone with a similar belief ended up in Slytherin because blood purity was the issue which drove the founders apart. Not to mention that it would exclude you from the other houses since buying into social Darwinism isn't a sign of intelligence and the desire to murder people in gruesome ways or see that done to them goes against the values of both Slytherin and Gryffindor.

That isn't to say that there are no bad people outside of Slytherin, but the particular branch of blood purity related nastiness should be quite limited outside, although there might be some who only started to dig the rhetoric after they were sorted. But most Death Eaters are the descendants of other, likeminded people and that brainwashing should ensure that they end up in Slytherin.

Most House traits can be twisted into something which supports Voldemort (Hufflepuff loyalty (eg to old friends), Gryffindor courage (join to protect someone else) and Ravenclaw cleverness (I do not stand a chance against them so I better join)).
