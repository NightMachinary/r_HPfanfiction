I think the "bigots outside your house" concept works way better with Grindlewald's ideology. I know the movies weren't all that great, but he does have a very intriguing ideology, compared to Voldemort's enslave everyone, kill muggleborns and, uh, I'm not sure what else there really was there.

- Ravenclaws are going to be interested in being benevolent dictators because, well, they view themselves are smarter then everyone else, so you extend that to looking down on Muggles as being intellectually primitive.
- Hufflepuffs could look at it as someone who was fighting for the entire wizarding world, and appeal to their sense of loyalty and perhaps bettering the world for both muggles and wizards alike. They could justify his crimes through "For the Greater Good".
- Griffindors similarly might be drawn to the motto, and considering the timeline of the movie, which was set in 1926ish, they would have seen WW1 in it's glory and could be forced into a more warlike and aggressive mentality.
- Slytherins would (naturally) love being in charge, so they'll be interested too.\\

So all in all, you've got a ideology that's reasonable enough to interest core characteristics of each house, and in the post WW1 setting and most of Grindlewalds's crimes in Durmstrang not being known to people, you have a very possible scenario for people from each house to be interested in joining him.
