I feel like slytherin house is very misunderstood. The first thing anyone ever found out about Slytherin is "There wasn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in slytherin." We have been given a biased view from the start. I find it hard to believe only folks from slytherin go dark and only Harry has the capacity to go dark because he is connected to Voldemort. Everyone else is a monk. It's just too unbelievable
