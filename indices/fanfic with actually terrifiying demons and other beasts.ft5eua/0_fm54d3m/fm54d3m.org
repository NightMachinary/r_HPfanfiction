linkffn(2889350) mostly takes place in a necropolis full of terrifying undead, evil spirits and the like. Less lovecraftian and more tomb raider/uncharted.

Keep in mind that it's been /ages/ since I've read it -- story was completed in 2007 and I read it not much after -- so while I liked it at the time I'm not sure if I'd still like it now.
