#+begin_quote
  London was a dirty city when it rained. It was as if the 1800's hadn't released their coal tinged grip on the city and soot ran in the streets like dark,oily tears.
#+end_quote

Is London really that dirty when it rains? It seems a little excessive.

#+begin_quote
  A grubby unremarkable pub
#+end_quote

I think we're missing a comma

#+begin_quote
  A cheery fire filled the room with pleasant smoke and the chatter of the full great room was a loud roar in my ears after the patter of heavy rain on pavement.
#+end_quote

Too long of a sentence

#+begin_quote
  The woman asked, her accent was thick and unfamiliar to my ears, but it was warm and she smiled.
#+end_quote

Too much description, especially since it's all focused on a voice/accent

#+begin_quote
  “Uh, No marm. I was just hoping to use your floo...” I broke off suddenly
#+end_quote

I think "broke off" implies suddenly. And to me, the ellipses imply trailing off. But I think it's fine just dropping "suddenly"

#+begin_quote
  Quickly a vision hit me of a figure, tall and dark not but across the street from the pub crossing quickly with a quick, forceful stride. “ Quickly if you please. I added quickly gulping.
#+end_quote

So much is happening "quickly" here! Vision is (not technically, but let's not get all science-y) instantaneous- we don't need to be told that it happens quickly. That description is bloated. We have a nervous character catching a glimpse of something frightful in the mirror, but the description doesn't match the feeling of it. His glimpse should be short with no time to think about how tall, dark, far away, intent, and velocity of movement. He's too nervous for that and the reflection through the dirty mirror and windows won't allow it!

#+begin_quote
  “Five kunts, Irishman.” She drawled the last word, amused as I dug the coin out of my belt pouch.
#+end_quote

Knuts, or? Also, is that period after Irishman correct? Why does she find it so amusing that he's getting out the last coin? Is he fumbling with it? She's already drawling, no need to add amused.

#+begin_quote
  “Master McConn, I presume?” the dark giant said, its voice deep,male and dangerous.
#+end_quote

I don't know if I'd classify Snape as giant. He seems more the lanky sort, so unless McConn is a small child or incredibly small, giant is out of place. Also, "male" makes it seem as if McConn is a woman that Snape is eventually going to sweep of her feet. Romance novel description

#+begin_quote
  He had sallow skin, dark recessed eyes, a large hook nose and stringy, greasy hair.
#+end_quote

Good. Snape isn't supposed to be handsome

#+begin_quote
  The man noticed my trepidation and sneered, making his face a rictus of sarcasm.
#+end_quote

It can stop after "sneered." The rest is overindulgent

#+begin_quote
  the last word was a malicious drawl.
#+end_quote

He's treating him like Harry or Sirius. McConn's "circumstances" need to be significantly weighty enough to account for that behavior from Snape.

#+begin_quote
  I let out an audible breath I didn't know I was holding. Clearly, he was trying to get the measure of me. I steadfastly ignored it.
#+end_quote

McConn is visibly nervous. He's not steadfastingly ignoring anything. He's jumping at shadows.

#+begin_quote
  Snape rolled his eyes.
#+end_quote

I think only teenagers roll their eyes

#+begin_quote
  By all means, move at a glacial pace. It thrills me
#+end_quote

Not quite Snape voice

I think you have two areas you could improve. the dialogue grammar needs a bit of work regarding the use of commas/periods before the closing quotation mark as well as the capitalization of the word following it. Since it's first person, you have to be extra mindful of description. We're seeing through McConn's eyes. For example, he's scared and in a hurry. The barmaid is taking her sweet time telling him the price, does he notice she's amused, or is he too pissed she's costing him time? Is he grabbing the last coin or is he fumbling to find it? Is he taking fifteen seconds to analyze Snape in the mirror, or is he catching a quick glimpse as he attempts to escape? Try to examine your word choice and use them deliberately.

I think you're off to a good start! I enjoyed it and that says a ton because it's first person. How many times did you read through it? Do you have more sketched out? I hope you plan to continue it!
