I just read the first couple of chapters and it doesn't really make sense to me.

They apparently go back to give Remus instructions, but at the same time, they also dont go back. So they couldn't have given Remus instructions. It seems like a good premise, but it starts off messy right off the bat. So I dont really know what to make of it ^^
