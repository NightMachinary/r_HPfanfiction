I think it was me who wrote that one liner, but I have yet to find a fic featuring her parents as mob doctors.

On the other hand, Grangers are secret agents in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290), and Hermione is anything but 'normal'.

Its author is specialized in writing BAMF Hermiones, such as:
