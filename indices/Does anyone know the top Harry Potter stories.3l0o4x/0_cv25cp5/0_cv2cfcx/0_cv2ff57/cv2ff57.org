  Considering a completed story couldn't get anymore follows compared to on-going/abandoned stories

There's been a trend of late for users to add a story to their Follows instead of Favorites if they want to be able to track it down again but don't want to be judged for bookmarking it as a Fave.

My take on it is to try sorting by each and see where the top contenders land in comparison, if you're trying to judge 'popularity'. If you're looking for the best-written fics, you're better served by asking around in forums (like Reddit) for opinions based upon similar interests.
