I agree that these can become skewed rather easily as series are finished. Take A Black Comedy (a story I read back in 2007 when it was being updated), it gets significantly less follows or reviews simply because it is finished. Follows and Reviews depend heavily on interest at the moment, rather than all time. As for favorites, many fan fiction apps require you to favorite a story to download it (Highly recommend Pocket Fiction. Love that app) so even that I think can be a little funky to base off of. It'd be really cool if fan fiction could post a Best Of section just to see which fics have been read the most.
