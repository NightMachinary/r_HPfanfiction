The imperius defense is stupid in principle, because if there's no way to investigate it or if you don't require positive proof (affirmative defense) for this kind of thing, you can throw your whole legal system out of the window. Why wouldn't any criminal, accused of actually anything, just claim "I would never do this, I must have been imperiused!"

If claiming the imperius is all that is needed, then it is the most idiotic legal loop hole I've never heard of and it's even more idiotic if Magical Britain is supposed to still have a functioning legal system.

Therefore their courts can't possibly regularly accept the imperius defense on its own merit and only did it out of corruption for influential or rich Death Eaters like Malfoy. It is a weak/impossible legal defense otherwise.
