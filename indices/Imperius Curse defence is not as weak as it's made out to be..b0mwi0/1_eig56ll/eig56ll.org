I've always believed...

Harry is highly resistant to the Imperius Curse because it induces a sense of euphoria. It's such a shock to Harry's system (especially in his Fourth Year) that his subconscious mind knows that something is wrong and works to discover what. Conscious thought leads to questioning. Questioning leads to overcoming.

People who are well-adjusted, i.e., they have happy experiences in their past, are more susceptible because it's not an alien feeling.
