Fanon has done a number on the Imperius Curse for sure, but I would argue that canon screwed it up with inconsistent information first.

First up, we have Harry. Whatever quality it is that is needed to fight the curse, Harry seems to have it ten times as much as anyone else. He can fight it off easily after a few minutes of practice while twenty of his peers, to a person, have no success at all. And this is the same Harry who's rubbish at Occlumency in the next book. It just seems too improbable that he's /that/ different.

Then there's the fact that it seems as if you can build up a resistance to the Imperius Curse over time, rather than it grinding your will down further. Barty Crouch Jr. is kept under it for twelve years, but then breaks free on his own. Then his father was under it for just a few months, and he /also/ broke free long enough to come from his home to Hogwarts (and acted conspicuously delirious when he got there). If this is a common trend, the Imperius Defense starts to look less plausible if the defendant claims they were under it for years.

Then you have the detectability of the curse. Most of the victims we know of acted perfectly normal, at least long-term. However, Stan Shunpike had a "strangely blank face" when he was under it. Katie Bell "looked all funny" (though admittedly she had it cast on her by someone who was under Imperius herself and had probably never used it before). Travers was also "looking abnormally vacant" when Harry cast it on him and had to be specifically ordered by Harry to follow them. This suggests that the curse is not as invisible as was first suggested.

And the parting shot: every time the Imperius is used in the movies, the victim looks pretty spaced out, presumably for cinematic purposes, and this only serves to cement that last point in people's minds.
