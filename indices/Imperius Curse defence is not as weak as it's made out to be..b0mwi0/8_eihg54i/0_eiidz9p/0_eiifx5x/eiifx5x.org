Ironically, I've never seen the Patronus scene as a sign of off-the-charts power like everyone seems to think it is. I just assumed that a Patronus strong enough to easily repel one dementor would also be able to repel many dementors. Its power seems to radiate in all directions, so it wouldn't need to be divided among them. I think I blame the movie for this, too, because it's hard to make an army of dementors being repelled by a normal-sized stag look believable without making it a super-Patronus.
