Resisting the imperius isn't a sign of off-the-charts power either, but it is a sign of something special.

I kinda disagree though. Each Dementor brings their own aura of despair, so it's not unreasonable to assume that it's worse the more there are, and therefore it's harder to fight off.

Then there's the sheer amount of space that that many Dementors cover. To affect them all, the patronus has to radiate enough mojo to reach all of them. Feels like it's reasonable to say that the more powerfully the spell is casted, the more area the patronus can protect.

So while I wouldn't say it's necessarily a sign of an extremely powerful wizard, it could easily be interpreted to mean that it was an extremely powerfully cast patronus.
