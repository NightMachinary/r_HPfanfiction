  First up, we have Harry. Whatever quality it is that is needed to fight the curse, Harry seems to have it ten times as much as anyone else. He can fight it off easily after a few minutes of practice while twenty of his peers, to a person, have no success at all. And this is the same Harry who's rubbish at Occlumency in the next book. It just seems too improbable that he's that different.

Yeah, this and the patronus bit stand out to me as points in the series where Rowling either forgot or was flip flopping about Harry being an everyman hero instead of a Chosen One.

  And the parting shot: every time the Imperius is used in the movies, the victim looks pretty spaced out, presumably for cinematic purposes, and this only serves to cement that last point in people's minds.

It's worse than that. Krum's eyes are straight up [[https://youtu.be/oCR1gAurnoI?t=126][obviously milky]]. I put a lot of the blame on this scene, though you do have other good points.

I tend to think that it's a question of how skilled the caster is. Voldemort can do a flawless imperius, but other people leave noticeable signs.
