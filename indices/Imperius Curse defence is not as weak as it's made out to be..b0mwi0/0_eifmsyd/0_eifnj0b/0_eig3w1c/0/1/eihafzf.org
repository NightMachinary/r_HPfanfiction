Was she under the Imperius the entire time? Or just was put under the imperius multiple times? How did she function day-to-day under the imperius? Can you be placed under the imperius, go about your day like normal, until whoever put the curse on you tells you to do something? Otherwise how would Draco control her every action for weeks? Could he just say “go about your days as normal and inform me of Dumbledore coming and going from the castle”?
