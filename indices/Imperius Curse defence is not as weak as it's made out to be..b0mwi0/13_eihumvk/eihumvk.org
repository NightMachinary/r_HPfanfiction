I don't care about the implied facts per se. Having it as an audacious, obviously dishonest claim is fun both in terms of realism and in its own right. A bunch of well-connected criminals claiming that they were brainwashed and getting off scott-free is something that would happen if such things did exist in our world. Even better if there are legitimate reasons to honestly both doubt and disbelieve their claims.
