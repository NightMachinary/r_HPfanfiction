I think fans have always said it was a cop out excuse. But Rowling proves time and time again that it's just as powerful as Crucio is to pain.

Someone already mentioned Rosmerta was under it for a whole school year and nobody noticed (not even Dumbledore).

Moody's rant in GoF with the spider was always exceptionally chilling to me. At first the class laughs as he makes the spider dance. It's a curse that can seem so harmless, but he can force that spider to drown itself or bite someone in the class. The laughter quickly stops. The imperius can disguise itself as an innocent joke but it leaves no trace and you can do irreparable damage with it. I mean the minister Thicknesse is under it for over a year(?). Originally nobody had any idea and he was the head of the DMLE under Scrimgeour. Moody is about the only one who suspects I believe that he's under the imperius or that there is someone compromised. Imagine waking him up from that and he'll have been trapped in hell for all that time. We know that he's been under the imperius, but some might blame him for all the horrible acts he committed under the curse.
