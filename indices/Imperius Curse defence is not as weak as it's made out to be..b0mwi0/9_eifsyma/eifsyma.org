I think you're missing the point.

Most authors think the Imperius excuse is weak for several reasons:

1. In their canon you need to make a conscious, willing choice to join the Death Eaters and accept the Dark Mark by performing some sort of horrible ritual (usually torturing muggles).
2. How likely is it that someone was under the Imperius for years (remember that the first war started in the 60's and only ended in the late 70's) and not suffer some sort of brain damage or personality shift? Just look at Barty Crouch Jr.
3. It's a good excuse, it makes people uncomfortable by bringing up ghosts from the war so they don't tend to think too much about it lest it brings up bad memories for them. It's why the kids of Harry's age are much more critical about it since to them the war was just a distant memory of their parent's time.
