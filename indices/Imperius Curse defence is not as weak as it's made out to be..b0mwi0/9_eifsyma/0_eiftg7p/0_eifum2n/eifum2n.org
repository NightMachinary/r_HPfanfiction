To the best of my knowledge, canon says nothing about how the Mark is earned; and anything written about it by the fandom is merely a cartoonish overstep in making the Death Eaters look as evil as possible. (I'm pretty sure I read a fic a long time ago that had Draco earn his mark by kicking a puppy to death.)
