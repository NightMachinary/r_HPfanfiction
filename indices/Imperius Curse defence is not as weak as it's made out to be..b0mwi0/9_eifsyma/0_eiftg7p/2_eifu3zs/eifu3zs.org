  I'm not sure if the first point is canon or fanon. I don't remember anything in the actual books about how the Mark must be earned. Malfoy has the Mark and he's no torturer or killer, as we see from the scene in the Tower.

Yeah, that's why I wrote "In their canon". Torture is just a common trope I've seen used in many fics, the main point was that joining the Death Eaters and getting a Mark should be a privilege, like joining an elite club. It shouldn't be akin to getting press ganged into being a sailor during the 19th century.

  The second point, Crouch Jr was sane enough to fool pretty much everyone into thinking that he was Moody. He has two moments of weakness, right as he thought he was going to kill Harry and in the grounds near the WC stadium. Other than those moments, he was in a pretty calm state of mind for pretty much the entire time we see him.

There are many forms of madness, psychopaths for example can masquerade as normal, sane people quite well. Watch the movie American Psycho and you'll see what I mean. Barty Crouch Jr. was most definitely insane, whether it happened before he was sent to Azkaban is up to the author but getting held under the Imperius by his dad for years certainly didn't help.
