I'm not sure if the first point is canon or fanon. I don't remember anything in the actual books about how the Mark must be earned. Malfoy has the Mark and he's no torturer or killer, as we see from the scene in the Tower.

The second point, Crouch Jr was sane enough to fool pretty much everyone into thinking that he was Moody. He has two moments of weakness, right as he thought he was going to kill Harry and in the grounds near the WC stadium. Other than those moments, he was in a pretty calm state of mind for pretty much the entire time we see him.
