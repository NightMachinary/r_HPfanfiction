Phoenixes are loyal and can detect loyalty. But loyal people aren't necessarily loyal to the things you'd like (or expect) them to be loyal to.

Dumbledore is actually a great example. He helped along the downfall of Fudge and Umbridge, the people shown worrying about him. They were right to mistrust him.

In my opinion, Dumbledore was deeply untrustworthy in general. He prioritised pusuit of his own goals and ideals over the welfare of the people around him, even repeatedly endangering the children in his care. So, maybe the people judging Dumbledore were taking their cue from him not having a pet kneazle.
