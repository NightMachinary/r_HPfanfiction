Dumbledore had a Phoenix and people still shit all over him and didn't always trust him.

Likely someone a long time ago made up some BS about phoenixes not being proof of a good person because it conflicted with their plans. Likely no one even remembers who started the rumor or why or even think to disbelieve it.

I imagine veritaserum received the same treatment.
