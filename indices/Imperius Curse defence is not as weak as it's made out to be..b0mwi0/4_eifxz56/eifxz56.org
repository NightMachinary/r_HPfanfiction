I don't think people doubt the strength of the curse itself. The narrative of it being a weak excuse stems from the fact that the prominent death eaters used it while bribing their way out of azkaban. In a society that has access to veritaserum, it should be easily verified whether or not they were under the curse while committing their crimes, but they were never actually held accountable. They never should have been able to walk with a lie that could be so easily disproven.
