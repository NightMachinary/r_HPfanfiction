I am curious about the resistance.

So, if we say that strong will does not translate into ability to throw off the Imperius, then what is the criteria?

I mean, what made Harry different in that class that he was the only one able to throw off the curse? If we can't use will power, then the next best thing we have is strength of character. Unfortunately, Harry is very unlikely to be the only one having either of those two. So, both of them are out.

So, what is the requirement for resisting it?

I am not criticising you. I am just curious.
