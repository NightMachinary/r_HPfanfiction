I apologize if I wasn't entirely clear. My point was a response to the purely fanon idea that the so-called Imperius defense is:

#+begin_quote
  a sign of weak will, weak mind, yadda yadda yadda.
#+end_quote

The implication here being that only a weak-willed person would be susceptible to the Imperius Curse to begin with, and thus conversely that a strong-willed person would not have been affected - which is bollocks because strength of willpower/character demonstrably *DOES NOT* correlate to susceptibility in the sense of /being affected/ by the Imperius Curse.

It affects /everyone/.

Strength of character/will can be argued to correlate to ability to /overcome/ the curse. Someone like Pettigrew, who's a chickenshit little coward, would never be able to throw off the Curse the way someone like Harry can. But Harry was still, on multiple occasions, affected by the Imperius Curse, and even in Moody's class it took him several attempts before he could throw it off.
