The weak will thing is absolutely fanon, albeit one that is very, very tenuously rooted in canon - arguably - because it takes the assumption, based on the example of Harry, that strength of will enables one to resist and eventually overcome the Curse, and reverses it to conclude that susceptibility to the Curse indicates weakness of will.

This is absolutely codswallop, because even those characters strong enough(or stubborn enough) to fight it off /were still under its influence to begin with/.

Doesn't matter how strong-willed you are, you are still going to be caught if the Curse is used on you. You might be able to escape its influence with a great deal of mental effort, but it's not gonna stop it from influencing you to begin with.

Also, it seems to be impossible to determine that someone is under the Imperius Curse. For example:

As of the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament and up to, IIRC, the First Task, Barty Crouch Sr. was already under the Imperius Curse. Nobody noticed - not even Dumbledore.

The following year, Madam Rosmerta was under the Imperius Curse for a very lengthy part of the school year. Nobody noticed - not even Dumbledore

Pius Thicknesse was placed under the Imperius Curse(by Yaxley, IIRC) early in DH. While Moody realizes that Thicknesse "has gone over", nothing indicates that he suspects Thicknesse to be under the Imperius Curse. And despite being surrounded by eminently qualified wizards including his boss, Rufus Scrimgeour, nobody else ever noticed a thing.
