That depends. The Mark itself and its symbolic significance is widely known. The /brand/ that's given to Death Eaters was, in all likelihood, much less common knowledge - I assume this is what you're referring to, and I do agree.

I would say outside of the Ministry, the Order of the Phoenix, and the Death Eaters themselves, the fact that DEs are branded by Voldemort was, and very likely remains, little-known.
