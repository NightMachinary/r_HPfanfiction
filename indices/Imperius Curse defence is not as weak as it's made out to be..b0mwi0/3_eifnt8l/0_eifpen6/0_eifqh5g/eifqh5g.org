My headcanon is that the Marks were quite new when Voldemort died the first time. Snape knows, and presumably told Dumbledore, and Crouch-posing-as-Mad-Eye publicly alludes to it without breaking his cover. However, Sirius didn't know and didn't have one, and nobody thought that was suspicious.

People knew that the skull and snake were Voldemort's symbol because he'd cast it above the houses when he killed everyone inside. I imagine that, if anyone saw them, they'd just assume that they were tattoos that some Death Eaters had, and not definitive evidence either way.
