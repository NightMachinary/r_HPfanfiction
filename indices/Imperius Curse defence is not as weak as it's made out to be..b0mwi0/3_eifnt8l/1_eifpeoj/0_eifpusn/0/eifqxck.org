I agree with that theory, knowing what kind of character Voldemort is, and how he rejected his blood family and called his followers his "family" at his resurrection. The Dark Mark is a display of ownership over his servants.

But in a Wizengamot trial, the jury doesn't know the inner details of how Voldemort and his circle work. With the Imperius defense there to cast reasonable doubt on a person's crimes, I don't see how they'd pardon someone for murder but prosecute them for a tattoo, unless they straight up admitted to being terrorists, like Bellatrix and her gang.
