I think that would depend on one's interpretation of how the dark mark functions. It's clearly magical on some level since Voldemort uses it to summon all the death eaters at his resurrection, and from there it's not /too/ huge a stretch to imagine the magic behind it is such that it can't be taken unwillingly. AFAIK there's nothing in the books that outright explains how they work, so it's pretty much open season for headcanons.
