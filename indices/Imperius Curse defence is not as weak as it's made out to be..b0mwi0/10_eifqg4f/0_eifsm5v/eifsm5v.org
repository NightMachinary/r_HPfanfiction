IMO, possession by horcrux ought to be stronger than the Imperius curse, if only because horcruxes are described as the "darkest art".

There was one fic I read that described the possession by Horcrux as nigh on unyeilding. I think it was the Mind Arts, but I can't be sure - Harry chances across the Diary and is completely ensnared by the power of the horcrux's compulsion.

I think that the Imperius is superior to all those other bits of magic that have relatively similar effects because the Imperius is fairly easy to cast and offers complete domination over the victim, even over long distances and long periods of time. Love potions require the victim to be dosed regularly, memory modification only allows for partial control and the horcrux possession requires direct contact with the horcrux.
