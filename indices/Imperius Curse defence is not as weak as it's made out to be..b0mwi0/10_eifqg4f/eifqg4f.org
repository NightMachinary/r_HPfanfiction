Are there fics that make the Imperius Curse look weak?

I think the issue with the Imperius used in fanfiction is how an author's worldbuilding will often introduce other types of magic that do similar things, or perform the same function. Love potions, memory re-writing, compulsion charms, magical or mental blocks (as revealed by the Gringotts tests), Horcrux possession, or whatever way Parselmagic is turned into a plot device.

So it's not that Imperius is weakened, it's just made irrelevant to the story, when it was a big deal in the canon. The benefit in using alternatives also allows the author to write a character who can do bad things without passing the moral line of using an Unforgivable Curse.
