Hermione's character is always very interesting to me. She can perform a spell that is functionally identical to the Imperius (overrides a person's natural willpower and personality), but feels bad about stealing from a muggle supermarket under tHarry's invisibility cloak.

  Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left) and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.
