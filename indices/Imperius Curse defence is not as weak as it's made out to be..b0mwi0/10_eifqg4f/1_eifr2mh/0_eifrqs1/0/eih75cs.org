Hermione has quite a simple moral system, she's very black and white even more so than Harry. In Order of the Phoneix she panics at thought of harming a Death Eater that only looks like a child, is horrified at the thought of stealing and disobeying school rules. But for Hermione those same moral compunctions don't extend to things she can justify to herself. Treachery is the ultimate sin, so Marietta is justly punished. Saving her family can only be a good thing so it doesn't matter how she goes about doing it.

Those moral aspects of Hermione, frustrate Harry across the series.
