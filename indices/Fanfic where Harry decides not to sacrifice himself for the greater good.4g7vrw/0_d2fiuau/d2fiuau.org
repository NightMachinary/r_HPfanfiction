Many stories do not have horcruxes or have alternate solutions to them. But I don't think that is what you want.

*His Mother's Love*, linkffn(10132530), offers an interesting middle ground: [[/spoiler][Harry basically forced the truth out of Dumbledore during his first 'private lesson' in year 6. He knew he had to take a killing curse from Voldemort, but Dumbledore also told him that he had a good chance to survive, so they were all making plans for that event.]]
