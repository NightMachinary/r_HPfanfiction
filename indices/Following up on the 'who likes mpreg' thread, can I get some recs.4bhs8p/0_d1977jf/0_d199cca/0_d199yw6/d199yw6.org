Then I wish you good luck!

I was never much into mpreg, but even the little I did read I learned pretty much immediately that there seems to be a higher percentage of bad mpreg stories compared to good ones than any other sub genre of HP FanFiction.

A large percentage of them basically just make Harry a girl in all but name which I never enjoyed, or are just cheap smut fics. It's most likely because of the popularity of Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape pairings, which ends up attracting everyone and their mother to write sub par stories for it.

But I suppose that's FanFiction for ya!
