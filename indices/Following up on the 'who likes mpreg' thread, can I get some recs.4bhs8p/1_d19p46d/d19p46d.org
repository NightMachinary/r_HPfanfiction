Ok, this one /has/ mpreg, which makes me reluctant to rec it in other threads, but the mpreg isn't really the point and it's not typical mpreg. It's actually a great post-Hogwarts cursebreaker story: linkffn(harry potter and the soul gems). But in this thread, at least someone might give it a try without noping out when they see the mpreg warning. There's a sequel, too.
