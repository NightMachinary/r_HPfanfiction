Using the "mpreg" tag in AO3 brings up a lot of stories, and some of them are even great, but it really depends on what kind of relationship/pairing you want to look for. For example, most Tom/Harry mpregs also have quiet a bit of angst /or/ a lot of light side bashing. On the other hand, Draco/Harry mpregs tend to be more about "true love". The type of story is also influenced by at what point mpreg occurs. Mpreg can be the end result of a relationship, just like pregnancy often happens at the end of male/female romance stories. Or it can happen at the start, and be the point of the story, which will be more angst and less romance. Some mpreg fics are really more kid fics then about the mpreg itself.

I like Tom/Harry myself (I like dark Harry). The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10221383/1/Kitty-Love][Kitty Love]] series is very popular linkffn(10221383), but I've never liked it that much (I find it a bit too cliche and childish). The same for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264186/1/Surge-de-Hydra][Surge de Hydra]] linkffn(10264186), and really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3996465/Watermelonsmellinfellon][Watermelonsmellinfellon]], but if you are willing to read anything, give them a try. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good, but its a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/604625][Meant To Be]] linkao3(604625) is unfinished and more kidfic then mpreg.
