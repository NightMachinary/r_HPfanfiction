Plot-hole, simple as that. Harry also cast spells that night in the graveyard, but it couldn't be put on Harry's record because the Trace doesn't record who did magic, only that it was performed around an underage witch or wizard. Also, the Riddle's estate has been Voldemort's hideout for a year, now. It's reasonable to assume he or Pettigrew or Crouch Jr protected it in some way so they would be undetected (certainly after the Frank Bryce incident).
