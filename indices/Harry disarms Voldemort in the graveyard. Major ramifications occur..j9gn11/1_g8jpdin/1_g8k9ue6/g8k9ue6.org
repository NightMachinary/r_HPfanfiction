It is keyed to wands. That's how they know when magic goes around underage wizards. The trace in a wand does not track only the magic on the wand, but all surrounding magic (hence dobby).

Having Voldemort's wand would still be useless for that as Harry's wand would detect magic from Voldemort's wand nearby
