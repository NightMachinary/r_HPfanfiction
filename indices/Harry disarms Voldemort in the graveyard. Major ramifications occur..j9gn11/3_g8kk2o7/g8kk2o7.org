1. Harry's reputation is even more inflated, but its actually deserved because probably not even Dumbledore could have disarmed the Dark Lord at 14 in a fair fight.

2. Voldemort's aura of invincibility is seriously dented.

Of course this assumes Harry gets out of the graveyard without being hit by every single Death Eater there.

Granted, Riddle is probably dumb enough to order them not to kill Harry because he wants to best him personally, but he probably will order them to prevent Harry from escaping. Harry's good at dodging, but /that/ good?

I don't know, maybe all the Death Eaters are too shocked by what happened to act for the few seconds it takes Harry to reach the Portkey.
