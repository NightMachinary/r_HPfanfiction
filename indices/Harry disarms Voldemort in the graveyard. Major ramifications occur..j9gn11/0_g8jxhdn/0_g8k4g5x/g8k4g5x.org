Harry dove behind a tombstone, dodging another killing curse as he went. "This is not a game of hide-and-seek, Harry! Be a dear and die, won't you?" Voldemort called out impishly. Harry thought furiously as his nemesis continued to taunt him. His schoolboy spells were having no effect against the experienced creature. He needed to step it up a notch, and start using spells he wouldn't normally be caught dead using; several came to mind, Dark curses he'd read about during his preparation for the Tri-Wizard Tournament that had led him to this trap.

Harry breathed deeply, waiting for an opportunity, trying to decide which dark curse he'd try; he knew he'd only get one shot at this. Voldemort, tiring of taunting him, stalked forward, intent on flushing the boy from hiding. He kept his wand at the ready; he would not underestimate his young opponent again. He strode closer to the grave; his outstretched arm proceeded him beyond it...

"Sectumsempra!" Harry screamed, catching both of them by surprise; Harry by the darkness of the spell his subconscious had chosen, and Voldemort by the shout. As if in slow motion, both wizards tracked the curse towards its target. The Dark Lord tried to pull his arm back, but it was too late. With a flash of spellfire and a sickening spurt of blood, the limb was severed cleanly just below the elbow. It flopped uselessly to the ground as they watched in horror.

Harry recovered from the shock first, as Voldemort was staring at his stump. With a Petrification Hex and an Incarcerous, The Greatest Dark Lord in British History was bound, bleeding, and helpless at a injured teenager's feet. His followers could only stare on in horror and shock (and not a little fear) as their newly reborn master laid prostrate. Harry, struck by a sudden impulse, seized the severed limb and began to run. The Death Eaters broke out of their shock and began firing hexes and curses as he sprinted for the Cup and Cedric's body.

Pausing only to duck a nasty-looking purple curse from Lucius Malfoy, Harry tucked Voldemort's arm under his own, grabbed Cedric, and pointed his wand at the Cup. "Accio!" Harry cried, grasping the object as it flew towards him. With a flash of light, he was gone.
