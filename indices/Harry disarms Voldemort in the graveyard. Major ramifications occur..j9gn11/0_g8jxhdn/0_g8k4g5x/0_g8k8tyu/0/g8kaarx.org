1. A book in the Restricted Section (thank you, Cloak of Invisibility). Snape claims to have invented it, but he also claims to be a loyal Death Eater when he's anything but. I'm just saying, dude's credibility is shoddy as hell when it comes to stuff like that.

2. He was aiming for whatever he had a clean target for; in this case, he had a clean shot at the arm below the elbow. Don't really see how it would be funnier to take the whole thing.
