Not bad, but I have a couple of thoughts about that.

1. How did Harry learn Sectumsempra? To my knowledge, the only book with that spell in it is located in the Potions Classroom, in the form of Severus Snape's old NEWT Potions textbook.

2. He should've taken the arm off at the shoulder, because it's funnier, and more of a pain to deal with attaching a replacement.
