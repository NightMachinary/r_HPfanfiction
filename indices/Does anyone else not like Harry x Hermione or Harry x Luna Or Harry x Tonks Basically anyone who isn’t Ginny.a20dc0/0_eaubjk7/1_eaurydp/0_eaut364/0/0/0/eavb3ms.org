To be fair, I am with [[/u/rachrox92]] here. There are characters which I have come to utterly despise due to fanfiction because their portrayal is always in a way I dislike. I have nothing against the canon Weasley twins or Neville, but I am not touching any fanfics where they play a major role because I am sick and tired of pranks or "growing up to be his own man" (the average Neville arc when he is not the antagonist).
