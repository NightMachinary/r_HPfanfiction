I can't do HP/HG. Not sure why, but I've never been able to convince myself to read one. The only Harry/Luna stuff I've come across is poorly written smut. I've read a couple good Daphne Greengrass stories, but I feel like those are easy to take because she's just a name. There's a lot of cornball Hinny stuff to wade through, but when Ginny is written well, she's my favorite.
