Personally the farther away from cannon, the more I like the romance. HP/GW? Bleh. HP/HG? Super bleh, I don't particularly care for it in general and more than that the execution is often shit IMHO. HP/Luna I don't particularly like just cause I find Fanon! Luna..bleh, just not my cuppa tea. HP/Greengrass or Fleur, or even further afield? Love that shit. I guess I just like HP/OC with that thin veneer of cannon compliance.
