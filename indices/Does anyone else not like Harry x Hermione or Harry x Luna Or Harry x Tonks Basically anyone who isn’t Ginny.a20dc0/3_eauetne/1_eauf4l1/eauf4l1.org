Any Tonks pairing is not based on their canon chemistry. It's based on her OOTP characterisation, where she was a funny woman with a devil may care attitude but also a sense of duty and a positive attitude. She was the only one who was not doom and gloom at Grimmauld. It also has a certain "We shouldn't be doing this" factor, the forbidden fruit so to say.

Or on the fact that she is, without contest, the most attractive person in the entire series. She could mirror anyone else and even improve on them.

Edit: There is no canon chemistry between them because they really just have two scenes together (packing in OotP and the hike to Hogwarts). If you want to write that pairing with any depth, you need more than that. I'm writing that pairing and even I admit that it has absolutely no canon base since the whole "bonding over superficial people" is bad fanon and there's no indication that Tonks dislikes her abilities or the reception she gets for them. Like many interesting pairings, it has some potential based on what we see from the characters, but the author is the one who has to do all the work.
