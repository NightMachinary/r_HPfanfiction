I think I can read everything, except Harry/Ginny. I really don't like her. In my opinion she should not end up with Harry. He was her "love" when she was a kid, then he saved her in her first year. In my opinion she love hero, not the person. She doesn't know him. Not like Hermione or Luna. With Luna he has this weird connection. And Hermione was his best friend, always by his side. Tonks.. eh, I don't know, I don't feel chemistry beetwen this two.
