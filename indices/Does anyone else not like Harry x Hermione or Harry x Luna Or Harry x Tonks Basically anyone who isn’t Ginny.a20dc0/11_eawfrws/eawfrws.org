It's just personal preference, and yeah, a lot of people don't like pairing Harry with anyone other than Ginny.

That's fine.

But there's a lot of potential in non-canon pairings that I find (theoretically) more interesting. The executions can often leave something to be desired, so I don't really read shipping-heavy fics these days ...

... but if I had to choose a top three of ones I'd read for Harry, I'd pick Harry/Cho, Harry/Luna, and Harry/Neville.

Don't know why. Popular ships usually don't interest me as much. Could be over saturation or lack of appeal. Harry/Hermione is one that I've tried to get, but never have. To me, they come across as friends in canon.

I don't get Harry/Ginny, either, though. Not the best friends part, but to put it in Trope-speak, it comes off as [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString][Strangled by the Red String]] to me. Bad pacing, not enough characterization, sudden "chest monsters," etc.

(Ron/Hermione also feels off to me, too, for similar reasons -- they read like friends, and the pacing/characterization is lackluster.)
