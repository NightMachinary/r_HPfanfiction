I'm probably one of the most diehard H/G shippers on this forum, but do you really think that Ginny is somehow exempt from bad writing? More than 90% of all fanfiction is crap, and that applies to all pairings, including H/G (to a lesser extent than Harry/Draco or even H/Hr, though). If you head to [[/r/HarryandGinny]] there are threads where what we don't like about Ginny in fanon is discussed.
