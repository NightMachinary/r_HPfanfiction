  The only pairing i'll give a chance is Harry x Susan Bones, because like Harry, her parents where killed in the first war, like Ginny, she and Harry have something to connect to

So, according to you, the only way HP can connect to a female is if she's either had her parents die in a war, or if she was possessed by a Dark Lord?

That's ridiculous.

I personally don't like HP/HG because it's overdone as hell, and makes HG into someone who can never do any wrong (although this is done with fics where the HP/HG pairing isn't there as well) instead of being the generally annoying character she actually is. I don't like HP/GW, because going out with your best friend's sister is just a big no in my book. Having said that, Changeling was one of the best I've read so far.

Luna, Daphne, Tonks, Fleur - if it's well written, I'll read along.
