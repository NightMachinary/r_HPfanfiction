Personally speaking I'm the exact opposite way round. I'll take Harry paired with nearly anyone else, except Ginny. By far the easiest way to get me to nope out of a story is to pair Harry with Ginny.

Then again that's probably because I'm of the opinion that Harry and Ginny should have never been paired in canon in the first place. I literally screamed when I read that part of the ending of DH because no. Just NO.

If anyone, Harry should have ended up paired with Hermione. Even JKR herself in more recent years has admitted that those pairings were a mistake.

So yeah suffice to say any Harry/Ginny pairing just completely ruins the story for me.
