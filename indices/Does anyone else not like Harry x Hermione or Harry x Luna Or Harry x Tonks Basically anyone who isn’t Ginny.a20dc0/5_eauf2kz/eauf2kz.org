I'm the opposite. In canon, Ginny is a Mary-Sue. In fanfiction, she's just arm candy. In both, she's the Hot Quidditch Girl, and since Harry's straight, he has to marry the female version of Ron.

So yeah, I've yet to read a good fic with Ginny as the main love-interest. Hermione, on the other hand... A lot of people mess her up, but she has a lot more depth to her than Ginny ever managed.
