If you count slash - seriously, Harry is not gay and changing someone's sexuality is IMHO a big thing, so nope for me!

Otherwise, I am the complete opposite from you!

I normally leave Harry/Ginny the hell alone (their relationship is to out left field for me!), I can take it if it is well writen - but even then I usually prefer not to!

Also: Ron with Hermione? That pairing makes me want to find a barf-bag! Seriously, we even have WOG that this is basically only canon because Rowling liked the idea (she didn't think about it much, if she had? She would have seen that those two would file for divorce within 2 years IMHO, especially since I believe that Hermione either doesn't want kids or wants them after having established herself professionally - she's muggleborn, so no having kids straight out of school!)
