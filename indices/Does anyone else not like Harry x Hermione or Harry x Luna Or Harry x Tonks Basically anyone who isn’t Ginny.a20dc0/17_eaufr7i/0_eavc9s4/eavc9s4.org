You go to FFN, set Ginny as character and sort by favourites. Pretty much everything on the first few pages is either horribly dated (NoFP) or straight up bad (OP Harry, harems, Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, Hermione bashing, protagonists without flaws, Hermione paired with any Weasley, soul bonds, way too early/serious romances where everyone finds their true love by age 15, Death Eater apologism).

I would love to enjoy a Ginny fic which takes her OotP characterisation as a BAMF and a slow building relationship between teenagers (attraction -> lust -> love). Sadly, if you find the other Weasleys utterly boring and like Hermione as Harry's best friend, that leaves very little choice.

Ironically, the best characterisations I have found were in smut, whereas the "regular" stories either turn her back into ideal GF/fangirl/armcandy instead of a character with depth and agency or make Harry follow her around like a mindless minion. I see the potential but so far it is untapped. Give me a Harry/Ginny story where she has a similar characterisation to either Hermione or Tonks in "Grains of Sand in the Hourglass", one where she acts like Lisa Turpin in "Call Me" out of Teenage rebellion, where she acts like "Harry"/Jamie in "Jamie Evans and Fate's fool. Like Meera Reed in ASOIAF. Like an actual character and not just a few background appearances outside of book 5.
