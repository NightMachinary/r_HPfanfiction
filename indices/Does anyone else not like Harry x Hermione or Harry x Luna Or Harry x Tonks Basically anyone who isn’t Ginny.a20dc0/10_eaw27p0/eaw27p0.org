I'll read anything so long as it's well written. So long as the characters are well written and not "In Name Only" I'll go ahead and give it a read and it's usually something else that makes me tap out of the fic.

With that said,

  The only pairing i'll give a chance is Harry x Susan Bones, because like Harry, her parents where killed in the first war, like Ginny, she and Harry have something to connect to.
#+end_quote

Everyone has their pairing, but wtf are you even talking about here. Canonically, unknown what's going on with Susan's parents.

Also something they can "connect" with? It's fanfiction, the writer can write in anything to make those character's connect with Harry, even in canon compliant fics.

For just canon: Hermione can't connect with the shared adventure experiences? Luna can't connect with having been bullied and treated poorly by those her age? Fleur can't connect with people only seeing their surface and not their depth? Tonks can't connect with losing family?

Daphne is a blank slate, writers can give her anything they want to connect with Harry.

  it seems as if fanfic writers make mary sues out of the Main 5 Harry is paired with
#+end_quote

They do that with Ginny too. A ton of stories contain mary/gary sues, that's just how it works with fanfiction. There's nothing wrong with not liking those stories, people don't. Just seems weird to me personally to attribute mary sue to those five characters, when it is there writer's fault for doing that and, there are stories out there with those pairings that don't have them as mary sues
