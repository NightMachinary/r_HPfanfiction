They'd been trying to send Harry his letter for a while before he actually got it on his birthday. Pure coincidence in that manner.

What isn't a coincidence is in the letter itself:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Mr. Potter,

  We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

  Term begins on September 1. *We await your owl by no later than July 31.*

  Yours sincerely,

  Minerva McGonagall,

  Deputy Headmistress

Harry's birthday happens to be the last day of school registration. They finally sent Hagrid instead of another wave of letters because this was literally the last day. First thing Hagrid does after giving Harry his letter, is to reach into his coat to pull out his own owl to accept the enrollment.
