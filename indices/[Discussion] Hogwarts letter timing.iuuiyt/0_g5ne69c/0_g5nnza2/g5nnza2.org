Actually the whole letter thing is a little bit strange. Because if July 31 is the last available date for registration Ginny shouldn't be able to attend Hogwarts the following year for her birthday is on August 11. And they arrive to different times every year: the letters arrive in the middle of August in year two because Harrys birthday had already passend and he was at the Weasleys. In year three the letter came exactly at his birthday. In year four we don't know, but in year five it only arrives a week before the term starts. In year six it's again in the middle of August.
