i'm not sure I follow. To Hogwarts people go whose birthday is before September 1st. And those that, as such (and in general, if there were other requirements and not everyone could go), are eligible, have to reply by July 31st. There's no relation between the two dates?

As for the rest, either the July deadline is only a rule for new first years, or that is only the rule for 1991. Ultimately, it's just an administrative point; it's not as if there is a deeper significance.

Regarding the OP, the answer at the top of the thread is perfect and I agree entirely.
