Harry gets his first letter at least a week before his birthday (July 31) and he keeps getting them until then, when Hagrid shows up.

I like the idea that the letters arrive on the summer solstice (some time around June 21) although this doesn't really fit with canon unless you really stretch how long Harry was getting his letters. Other than that, the first of July gives students two months to prepare, which should be plenty of time.
