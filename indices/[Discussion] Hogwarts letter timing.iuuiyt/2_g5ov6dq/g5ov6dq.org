In addition to what has been already said, you can probably even make a case that all letters don't go out at once (which makes sense, if the school doesn't have a few hundred owls):

In CoS, the letters for Harry and the Weasley arrive at the Burrow on the same day Ron gets a letter from Hermione -- in which she says that she will buy her books that day. The wording in the letter is such that it wasn't written on that very day, and also implies that she already has her book list, which means her school letter must have arrived before the Weasley's and Harry's.

.

As for OotP: Recall they had trouble finding a Defence teacher, and Umbridge got it eventually. They couldn't have sent out the letters if they didn't know the teacher and his curriculum incl. booklist, which sounds like a reasonable explanation for why they came quite late.
