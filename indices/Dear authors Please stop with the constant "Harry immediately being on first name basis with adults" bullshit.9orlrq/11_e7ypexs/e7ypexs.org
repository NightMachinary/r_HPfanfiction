Actually, I also have a question around this.

Titles at Hogwarts confuse me a little. The teachers are all addressed as 'Professor' So and So, implying a certain level of higher education and study as well as respect for their teaching position. This is gender neutral and easy enough to understand.

But then you have Hagrid, who is never called Mr Hagrid by anyone as far as I can tell, but is also never referred to by his first name by anyone but the faculty. Sometimes I forget that Hagrid isn't his first name because it's bandied about with such informality all the time by the trio. Then, despite never having graduated Hogwarts and presumably not having the higher education levels of the other teachers, Hagrid is granted the title of Professor as soon as he starts teaching.

Filch, by comparison, is addressed as Mr Filch by the students, presumably by virtue of being a faculty member who is not a teacher.

Then you have Madam Hooch, and her title probably confuses me the most. She's sort of a teacher but not a professor, and Madam would imply she's a married woman, but isn't called Mrs Hooch. What does Madam imply here? If she was not married, would her title be Miss Hooch among the students?

Madam Maxine is similarly confusing because she's a headmistress, and no one addresses her as Headmistress or as Professor, but only as Madam, even though she most certainly has the education and position to warrant the Professor title.

What does it all MEAN?
