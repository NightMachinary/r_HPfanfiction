.... your response makes zero sense.

The OP made a post asking authors to stop the constant first name basis shit. By that logic, the OP is only interested in reading FF that caters to "their" cultural/geographical/education situation. In other words, what the OP is asking for basically comes off as, "cater your FF writing to my needs/views or its bullshit writing".

That's not remotely reasonable, and the OP's experiences, OR YOURS, are not indicative of everyones. I got a bit of both myself, as my high school had a policy of using your teachers first names, while up until that, it was always Mr. or Ms. "last name".

My point is that that view is not valid because FF is read by people from many cultural/geographical/education situations. Its not bullshit because in some situations being on first name basis is normal. If the OP doesnt like it, the OP can write their own FF, or search for authors who cater more towards their views. But the OP should not come in here, and act as if its "bullshit" to have Harry be on a first name basis, especially because the books themselves support BOTH sides of the debate.
