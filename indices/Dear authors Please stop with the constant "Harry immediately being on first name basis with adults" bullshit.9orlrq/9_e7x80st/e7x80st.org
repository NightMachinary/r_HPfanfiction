Why is this shit even upvoted this much. This complaint is definitely colored by cultural differences and even simple geographical or school/education differences. If you want to argue that HP takes place in Britain that's fine, except you conveniently forget that it also takes place in the Wizarding world, which is VERY different than the Muggle world, and is a FANTASY world. So an author can interpret it how they see it.

Honestly the only argument that may have merit would be "how did JK write it in the books". But if you argue from that aspect, than whats the point of fan fiction?
