Inches and miles, yes, because Britain is a bit weird about selective metric, and was even worse about it in the 90's. We use centigrade, both stone and kilograms for a person's weight (but no two people seem to use both), kilos for most other weight, miles for long distances, meters for short distances, except height which is usually feet unless you are at the gym or GP. Sewing and building materials are usually referred to as inches for width and meters for length (e.g. 2 by 4's or 60" wide fabric) though sold in metric. Drinks come in pints of beer, and litres of milk but we still call it pints of milk, no matter how much milk is actually in the container. Cider comes in gallons, but only if you buy it from the factory. Cooking is done in grams, millilitres, teaspoons, ounces, pounds, cups, and any other measurements we can rustle out if another countries pocket, except for Delia Smith, who has a couple of cakes that are just ratios of the weight of the eggs.

Makes perfect sense, obviously.
