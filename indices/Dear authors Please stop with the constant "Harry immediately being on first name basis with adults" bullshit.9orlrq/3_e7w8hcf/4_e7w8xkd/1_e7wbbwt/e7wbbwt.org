Hi, I'm English! Mr/Mrs was reserved for teachers, who we'd never address by first name - in fact, I was yelled at for doing so.

However, friends' parents were all addressed by their first names or 'so&so's mum' if that wasn't known. If we didn't know their name, we'd ask. I literally cannot remember any of my friends ever referring to my mum as 'Mrs [lastname]'.
