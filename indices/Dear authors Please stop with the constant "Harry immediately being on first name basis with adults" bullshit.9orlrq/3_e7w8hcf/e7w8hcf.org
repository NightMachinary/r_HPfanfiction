This might depend on your cultural context. In Australia we almost always call adults by their first names only- even from childhood. All of my primary school friend's parents were only ever their first names, never mr/mrs so and so. If it's a teacher that's different and they get their title, as do aunts/uncles etc, but for general adults you come in contact with it's their first names only. So maybe you're just reading fanfics from people with a different life experience from you!
