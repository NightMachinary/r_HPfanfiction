To be fair, mate, I reckon it's where you're raised in Aus too. I'm from a rural city in NSW and we always addressed teachers by Mr/Mrs and surnames, never by first names until later teen years.

In Harry Potter though, you'd expect the children to always address adults by their surnames. Harry's consistency in calling Molly “Mrs Weasley” in canon establishes this as well. I think OP just wanted to remain immersed in Pommy culture whilst reading fics. I don't really mind, myself, as long as it is consistent with the character.
