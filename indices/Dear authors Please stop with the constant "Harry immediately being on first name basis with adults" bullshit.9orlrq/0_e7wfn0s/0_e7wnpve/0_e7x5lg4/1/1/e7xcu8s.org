Nah! We don't have that 'gotta show people respect instinctively just because they are older or in a position of power over you' - thing. Social equality is a big thing in Scandinavia and so we like to remain on even level with everyone. It's also pretty normal for inteviewers to refer to politicians by first name during personal interviews. I think the only reason we even refer to politicians by last name MOST of the time is because of foreign media.

Edit: Same for titles like doctor. I would absolutely never hear; "Doctor Jensen is ready for you now Mr/Miss." They'd say; "Lars is ready to see you."
