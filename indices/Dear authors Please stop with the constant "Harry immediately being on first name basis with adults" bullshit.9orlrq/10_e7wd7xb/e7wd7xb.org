Wouldn't it depend? If you're reading a fanfic where he is an abused child, an adult might give him permission to call them by their first name as a way to make him more comfortable and them less like the "adults" who have been abusing him. If he becomes family in some way--not necessarily adopted, but family. I used to call close family friends by their first name, only sometimes giving them the "Aunt" or "Uncle" appellation.

But I agree, those "Harry is the most intelligent, most wonderful human on earth" fics where he is smarter and better than all adults that you normally see that in are very annoying.
