  "Oh!" said Ronnie suddenly. "Professor Dumbledore --- I have a question!"

  "Yes?"

  "Why do you call Harry and Neville by their first names, but Hermione and me by our last names?"

  Dumbledore actually looked surprised at this, his eyebrows raising and his blue eyes twinkled behind his half-moon spectacles. "Heh," he finally said. "I must admit, that was not a question I had anticipated. Quite encouraging to know that my students are still able to occasionally surprise me! But to tell you the truth... I'm not quite sure. It may simply be the fact that I knew both Harry and Neville when they were very young."

  "You did?" said Harry, though Neville didn't seem at all surprised.

  "Why, yes. I knew both your parents quite well, after all. I was quite saddened to learn that --- well. In any case, I suppose it just feels more natural to use your given names. If you're not comfortable with this, I shall of course do my utmost to use your surnames for the future."

  "I don't mind!" said Neville hurriedly. "It's kind of nice, actually."

  "Yeah," Harry agreed. "You can call me Harry, Professor, I don't mind either."

  "Only ---" said Ronnie, turning pink again and averting her eyes. "Only I wouldn't mind if you, you know, wanted to call me 'Ronnie.' Not that you have to or anything, but, well, er, I think I would like it."

  "Hm," said Hermione, who didn't seem quite convinced that such informality between teacher and student was called for. After a few seconds, though, she smiled. "Hermione."

  Dumbledore's eyes actually looked like they were watering over for a moment, but his voice was steady as he said. "I'm quite touched. Yes, I would be most honoured --- Ronnie. Hermione." He nodded slowly at both girls. "Now... Shall we go and see if we can wake everyone up?"
