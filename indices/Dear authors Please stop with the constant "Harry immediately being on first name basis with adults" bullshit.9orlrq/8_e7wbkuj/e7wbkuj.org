Ehh, most adults would use first names?

I always assumed the Mr. So and So was a boarding school thing. Maybe that is coming from the US where you get occasional use of last names by teachers, most students call their teachers by their titles (Professor So and So), although it isn't universal, and it is non-existent outside of the school environment.

Might be different in Britain though, I always thought the whole "*Professor* Snape Harry" to be a very weird tic for JKR to include in the series. Mostly ignored it or read it as 'Hermione/Dumbledore are overly formal and no-one else cares'
