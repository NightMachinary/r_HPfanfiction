It is definitely different in the US compared to UK/Aus. My partner is from north west US and he tends to call adults by their last names or say sir/ma'am. He even calls his college professors as 'Professor' or 'Professor Lastname' which is not really a thing here in Australia. To do that is quite formal.

Honestly if I introduced myself as Gold and anyone, kids or adults, proceeded to call me Mrs. Opal, I would feel that they were kinda rude and ask them to just call me Gold.
