Depends where you're at in the US. I grew up in the south and we always address people as sir/ma'am or Mr/Ms/Mrs /insert last name here/ as a sign of respect. Several of my friends growing up were required to answer their own parents' requests by saying yes sir or yes ma'am. The only time we didn't address adults with this form of respect was when it was someone we did not respect at all and we made it obvious simply by using their first name.
