This whole argument reminds me of an exchange I had when I was very young, around 5 or 6 years old. My grandmother used to have a neighbor that she'd been neighbors with for decades- since my father was a kid growing up there. My grandmother was obviously on a first name basis with the woman, whose name was Marie.So that's what I called her: "Marie;" I was introduced to her as that, so I had no reason to call her anything else. So, when I first met her, I went back home and started talking about "Marie" and my dad, who'd grown up next to the woman took a while to figure out who I was talking about: "Oh, you mean Mrs. Russo?"

Point is, that because I was introduced to her a certain way, I was on an informal first name basis. whereas my father who had known her for decades still used the formal address, probably because that's what he would have called her when he was a kid. It's still a thing my dad will bring up every once in a while for a laugh.
