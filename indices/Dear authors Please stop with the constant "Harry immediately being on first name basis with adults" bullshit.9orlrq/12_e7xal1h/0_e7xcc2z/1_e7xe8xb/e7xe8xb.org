Harry also addresses Hagrid right away with "you" in the book as well. Which is rude but a lot of children around that age do use the informal version unless otherwise instructed or with a teacher. I have taught children that age and I had to constantly tell them to use the formal form of address because apparently primary school teachers allow them the informal address. It is realistic, a lot of children don't understand the difference until they are around 11...but you are right that Harry should have used the formal you.
