I have a related question, that I hope you don't mind answering. I am currently studying German and was just watching the first HP movie in German. I was a bit confused why Harry instantly used the informal "you" with Hagrid. Was it just poorly translated or is there something I don't understand about the whole formal/informal system? It seems to me that when a child meets an adult they should use the formal form of address, unless instructed otherwise.
