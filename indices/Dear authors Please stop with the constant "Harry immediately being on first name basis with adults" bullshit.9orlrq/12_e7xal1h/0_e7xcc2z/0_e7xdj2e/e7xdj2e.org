That's kinda complicated. Because the whole formal/informal system is complicated. But I think he uses the informal 'you', because he considers Hagrid as a friend and saviour. Hagrid also mentions that he knew his parents and in general you speak to friends of your parents with the informal 'you'. There is also the fact that it is a children's movie and it just fits better. Especially when you consider the role of Hagrid. It shows that Hagrid is a good friend.
