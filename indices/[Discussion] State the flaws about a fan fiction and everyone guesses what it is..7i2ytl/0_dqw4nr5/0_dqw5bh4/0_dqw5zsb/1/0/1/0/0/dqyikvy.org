  it's objectively bad within the Harry Potter universe.

I don't really see what you mean by that. Some say it's a bad story which is an opinion (e.g. not something "objective"); and I don't see at all what you're trying to say by "within the Harry Potter universe", especially considering the story does /not/ truly take place in the Harry Potter universe but rather in a very extensive AU.
