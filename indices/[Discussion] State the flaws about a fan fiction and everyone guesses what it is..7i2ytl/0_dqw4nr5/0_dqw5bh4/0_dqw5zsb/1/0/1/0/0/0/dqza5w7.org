It may be an AU, but it still takes place within the Wizarding World, where magic has its causes, limitations and standards. A common argument against HP that people use is that plot happens because of convenient magic. This is usually easily disproven by piecing together relevant parts of the book, writings on Pottermore and JKR's statements.

HPMOR throws away a good chunk of how magic works because the writer is very smart and science is /obviously/ superior in a universe where laws are clearly different from ours.
