And it's super funny. You want critique about HPMOR, you get it, you complain that's tl:dr. Isn't "/Those are literally the same two sources that every person who pretends to have read HPMOR gets all their info from/" ? Where's your smart, and potent rebuttals you've surely got if you meet those links often?

Oh wait. You don't have them.

Because you can't oppose that critique by actual scientist. Because you're pompous and pretentious idiot who thinks if he knows few obscure definitions and writes long paragraphs saying how everything opponent said is beneath him, or doesn't merit an answer, or whatever other bullshit you invent because you actually can't refute, is smart.

Cut the crap, because you're not doing anything but wiggle and weasel and cry and moan, go to your /hpmor echo chamber, and circlejerk each other about how smart, how wise, how rational you idiots are.
