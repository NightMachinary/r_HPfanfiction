linkffn(Triumphant, the Dreamer by Shadowblayze)

The beginning about their childhood is actually pretty decent. Heather and Harry even have a pretty well written relationship. Even the fact that Heather is a self insert character "reborn" as Heather Potter isn't a negative. It just goes out of control with the OC's who magically have what she needs pre-Hogwarts. And the time frame is beyond silly. She solves so many problems in like, a month. There was also some 'pureblood are more magical' annoyances but I was willing to look past.
