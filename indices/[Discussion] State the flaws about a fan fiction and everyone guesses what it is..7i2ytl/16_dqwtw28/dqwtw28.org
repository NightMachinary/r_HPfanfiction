Harry Potter's twin sister solves almost all of Harry's problems during the weeks before Hogwarts because she keeps somehow coming across new OC's who have exactly what she needs/are the puzzle pieces missing to fix all of their problems including freeing Sirius, stopping Voldemort/Quirrel, freedom from the Dursleys, and finding new pureblood OC 'cool' guardians.

Also, slavery is okay because house elves need wizards magic to survive.
