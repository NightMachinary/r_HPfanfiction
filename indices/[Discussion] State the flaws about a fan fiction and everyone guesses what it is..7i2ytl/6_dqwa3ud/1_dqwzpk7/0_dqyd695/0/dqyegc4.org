I have no idea how scientifically accurate it is but I've read a couple times that snakes have vibrating tongues, therefore a parselmouth has a built-in natural vibrator. I remember a theory that parseltongue is not a language per se but magic channeled through the tongue. If you touch a sensitive area, like the clitoris, with that it ought to feel pleasant. There are a few stories that have a parselmouth split his/her tongue while using that particular ability, giving you a unique experience down under.

Or, the easiest explanation, that someone speaking the language of snakes is basically doing very fast tongue movements far beyond the ability of a normal human.
