The least bad.

But I see where you're coming from. In Harry's first year there was a lot of pushback against him. Yeah, he ultimately prevailed, but you could see Dumbledore and John and ultimately even Voldemort acting against him, so there was this sense of "back and forth" between them. I feel that's missing now in year 2 (Virgo Malfoy isn't enough of a threat), which makes the fic feels too self-congratulatory on Harry's side. Especially the latest chapter 40 boiled down to "Look Alex, Harry's awesome". Hopefully the dynamic switches back to year 1 style in next chapters.
