Haha, I asked the same thing when I was reading it and was assured it starts to really diverge around year 3. I sort of disagree. Like I said, there are a lot of unique scenes and sub-arcs, but the meat of the story is basically a rehash the entire way. I think year 5-6 had some really delightful moments, but 7 gets pretty convoluted trying to come up with explanations of how a whole bunch of magic stuff happens non-magically when it was really never necessary to write that plot in the first place. I did finish it though and I remember the thing pretty fondly really, so if you can just sort of accept that you're going to be rehashing stuff I actually do recommend finishing it. I think the writing is worth the plot.
