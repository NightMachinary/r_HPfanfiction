Yes, divergence began after Year 2. The body count started to climb dramatically after Year 3. I actually feel a little sorry for Umbridge in this one.

Unlike the original, this fic is heavily weighted toward later years, with Years 6 and 7 taking up 98 out of 200 chapters. Year 7, [[/spoiler][which lasted only 5 months]], contains 67 chapters.
