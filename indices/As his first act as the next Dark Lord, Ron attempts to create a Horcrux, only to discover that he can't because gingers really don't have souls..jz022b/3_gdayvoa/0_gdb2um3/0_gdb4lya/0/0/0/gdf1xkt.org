It was a Slytherin Harry one, Hinny with them both in Slytherin and both in the same year; lemme see if I can find it rq. It's also a “Lily lives” story, and be warned - Molly gets bashed pretty hard, though there's an “explanation” for it in one of the later books.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter) it's pretty damn long, since each year (and this one, the prehogwarts stuff) is its own fic. Currently on year six, though I'm not caught up atm.
