One fic author had an amazing quidditch fix: no seeker, instead of 3 chasers you have 4 “slashers”. At 5 goals, a slasher can try to catch the snitch for 50 points (catching the snitch doesn't end the game). Each time they score after that, they can try to catch the snitch again, and each time it's worth an extra 50 points (100 for the second catch, 150 third, etc).

It was super interesting, cause it meant the tactics of a game could really shift based on who was playing - Harry is amazing at catching the snitch, so keeping him under 5 goals is a priority; if a player isn't great at catching the snitch but amazing at scoring goals, it might be better to keep them on goal scoring even if they qualify for a Seek.

Game ended after an hour I think
