The only stupid thing about Quidditch is the seeker. The rest is great.

The way to make it better is to either:

- Remove the snitch and play on a clock to 90 min

- Keep the snitch and lower the points it gives to 50

- Keep the snitch and play three 30 minute periods with the possibility of catching the snitch in each period with it being worth 20, 30, and 50 points in each respective period.
