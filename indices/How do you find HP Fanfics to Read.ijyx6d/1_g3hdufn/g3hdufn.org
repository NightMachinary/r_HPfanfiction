I use this. [[https://www.faenfiction.com/fanfics/harry_potter]]

It's been my go to search directory, since I can no longer be bothered to 'search/filter' ffn or ao3 and rummage through piles of cringe-worthy messes.

I find something there, go back to ffn/ao3, search the title or author and read it on those(ffn Android app is beautiful for keeping track lmao)
