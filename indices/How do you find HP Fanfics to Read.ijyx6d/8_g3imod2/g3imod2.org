I pretty much solely read on fanfiction.net, so I search for certain themes such as Dark, Slytherin Harry on Google depending on what I feel like reading. Try and find communities there to scroll through and check out. Reddit can be useful for recommendations, but I never ask, rather go of other people's posts. Recommendations within authors notes can be gold dust sometimes, as the themes generally carry through.
