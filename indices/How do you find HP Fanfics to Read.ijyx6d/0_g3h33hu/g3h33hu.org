I like to scroll through search results for specific characters, Scryer is pretty useful here since it has a few helpful search settings such as minimum and maximum length. Searching by character is pretty pointless on Ao3 though.

Recommendations, well that's what we're here for. Although one person's treasure is another person's tab-close. Recommendations in author notes are also pretty interesting since generally speaking, if you are enjoying a story there's a good chance that you will enjoy whatever the author is recommending.

Someone's favourites or followed stories, only for authors whose stories I've enjoyed. Everything else is random.
