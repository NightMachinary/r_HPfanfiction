This might be what your looking for. It has some slash (harry/tom) but it's so funny, very well written, and has a good plot. It follows harry and his friends trying to bring down a bad Dumbledore as well as some side plots.

There is another that I think is good but I cant, for the life of me, remember what it's called.

The only thing I remember is that Harry is revealed as the new 'bad guy' when Ron casts a nickname spell on him in the great hall as a joke and his 'villain' name is shown. If someone knows what it's called then please link but I'll be looking for it any way.
