I don't know about having Hermione punch him out; but I think that the Carrie moment wouldn't be Hermione. Hermione in canon can be pretty darned vicious and vindictive: certainly not a person you want to cross, but when she takes revenge, she does it with conscious use of magic, planning, and manipulation, not accidental magic or impulsiveness --- that's more Harry's domain.

A question worth asking in your premise is that, in all appearances, Harry and Hermione haven't spoken in a few years. In those years, Harry has become Rich, Powerful, Confident, and Suave and defeated Voldemort; what interesting things could Hermione have gotten done in the meantime?
