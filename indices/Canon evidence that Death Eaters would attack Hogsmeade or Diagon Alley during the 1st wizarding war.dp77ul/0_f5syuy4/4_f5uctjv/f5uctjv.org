  The main activities are not to try and conquer the wizarding world. Mainly, they intimidate through various means, coerce cooperation, infiltrate the bureaucracy, deliberately discredit the Ministry's efforts, and occasionally assassinate potential high value targets.

From the descriptions of the Wizarding War, that's not really accurate. The Death Eaters didn't just occasionally kill high value target - they regularly murdered Muggles, muggle-borns, regular witches and wizards, used the Imperius curse to have victims kill each other, and the like. They deliberately targeted and dispatched with entire families of those who opposed them (eg, the Order of the Phoenix).

For instance, when looking at the picture of the Original Order, Moody points out 7 characters who died during the war, 2 more who were tortured into insanity (Neville's parents), Harry's parents (not included in the dead), and 10 who survived.

It was a /lot/ more bloody in canon than you're suggesting - though yes, the strategy you mention would have been far better.

Here's another example of how the general population viewed the Death Eaters (from Arthur Weasley):

"You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed. The terror it inspired... you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside... Everyone's worst fear... the very worst."

The Death Eaters were /casual/ about murder, particularly of muggles, and were far more likely to use terror and death than to work through other means, from what we know. That makes an attack in broad daylight more of a show of their own power than anything else - just like going in and killing a family of their opponents and putting the Dark Mark up in the air above it, it's not particularly discrete.
