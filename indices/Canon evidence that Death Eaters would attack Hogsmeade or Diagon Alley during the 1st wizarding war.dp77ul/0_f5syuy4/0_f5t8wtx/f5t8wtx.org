The only other point I would make is that if you look at past facist examples, they would occasionally ‘flex' their metaphorical muscles with displays of violence on the streets.

Think of the night of broken glass. Groups of certain people are targeted in a perceived safe area. If for example the death eaters went around Diagon alley at night it would likely be to burn down Muggleborn and half blood businesses or attack those who were known sympathisers with hit and run tactics until they would become so bold as to do it in broad day light because they know the average joe would be too afraid to act out themselves.

In terms of full scale battles, it's unlikely, as it's difficult to convince most people to actually openly fight (to the death) on a large scale unless there is a spectacularly clear idea of ‘us' and ‘them'.
