The short response to this is: no, its not likely at all that their was ever any big public attack on any location as we see in many fanfics for a variety of reasons. This is usually done to either 1) provide action sequences/show off Harry's power, 2) make some part of the plot occur, and/or 3) openly show the Death Eaters being horrible in public.

Long answer time, so buckle up.

There are several issues with that idea that make it infeasible with canon HP. Firstly, this fundamentally mischaracterizes both the nature of the "War" and how Voldemort operates. Voldemort is not the head of an army; its more accurate to liken him and his Death Eaters to modern terrorist organizations such as Al-Queda, the Irish Republican Army or even the FARC. Such groups are not seeking to subjugate an external foe but essentially engineer the overthrow of a government by attacking from within. Look at what we see of the war in OotP, HBP and DH.

- Voldemort is a charismatic 'revolutionary' who organizes the forces while largely remaining out of the fray himself. Only he knows the full extent of his various machinations, and without him the organization immediately crumbles.
- The Death Eaters wear masks and conceal their identities, possibly even from one another, similar to how terrorist cells are often compartmentalized to insure stability.
- The main activities are not to try and conquer the wizarding world. Mainly, they intimidate through various means, coerce cooperation, infiltrate the bureaucracy, deliberately discredit the Ministry's efforts, and occasionally assassinate potential high value targets.
- The Death Eaters essentially take advantage of the existing systems rules and methods to find weak spots to exploit, both undermining the system to the public and increasing the credibility of their organization/rebellion.

In other words, the wizarding war is more accurately characterized in our terms as an uprising or insurgency (although the later term has fallen significantly out of favor in light of recent revelations in the real world). And terrorist organizations /never/ engage in open warfare, battles and public displays of strength. Such organizations, including the Death Eaters, invariably have the /weaker/ hand compared to the governing body and the majority populace.

To paraphrase Sun Tzu, when fighting a stronger opponent you broadly have two options for success: 1) attack with full force at the enemies weak point in the hopes of breaking the opponents resolve or 2) engage in hit-and-run or guerilla attacks, fighting through asymmetric warfare. The second option is the natural choice, and with good reason. The Ministry and Order would probably love it if Voldemort attacked Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. That is literally why Voldemort lost in DH - because he attacked Hogwarts and created a united foe for the fence-sitters to rally against.

Mostly, battles are shown for a couple of reasons in fanfics: 1) its a simplistic way of showing the conflict without considering the implications; 2) provides opportunity for action sequences or showing off how powerful characters are; 3) can be used as a 'surprise moment' or advance a plot point the author wants to occur.
