You are why I love this sub.

But without Harry's sacrificial protection, could Voldemort have lost the battle of hogwarts? Assuming Neville couldnt destroy the snake, I think there was definitely enough forces to defeat him the 2nd time around as there were way more fighters in part 2 with much much more loss of life. But then I think he would have been overtaken but still alive and in the same form he was after attacking Harry.
