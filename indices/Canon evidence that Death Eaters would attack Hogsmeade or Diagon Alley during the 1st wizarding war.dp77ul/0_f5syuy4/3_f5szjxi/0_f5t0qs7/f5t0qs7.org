That really depends on how it all goes down. Basically, Voldemort got caught up bragging and ended up in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_tactics#Eight_classical_maneuvers_of_warfare][makeshift double envelopment]], with the defenders in front and the forest creatures plus Hogsmeade inhabitants coming at his back/sides.

In the 1st part of the Battle, Voldemort held the numerical and magical advantage over the defenders. But now he was outgunned and out in the open - more succinctly, Voldemort made the mistake of literally bringing everything he had, as a show of force, out into the open so he could be trapped. Thats really the major reason Voldemort couldn't be taken down by numbers or possibly Dumbledore in the past, he could always escape if the scales tipped against him. He made it all or nothing out of overconfidence.

And even if Neville didn't get Nagini, Ron and Hermione were also aware and had Basilisk fangs. Worst case scenario is the crowds would mass fire spells at Voldemort from all sides and potentially wear him down through shear weight of numbers, the ultimate equalizer. Even if he dies, he only has one Horcrux and no one else to really call upon to easily revive himself. Worst case scenario there is now he has no Horcruxes and the public is less easily dismissive of the idea that he still survives without a body.
