Umbridge said Fudge wouldn't tolerate her methods as she was literally torturing schoolchildren, that doesn't say much about Fudge. And Dumbledore having power as well doesn't mean Malfoy doesn't.

I'm not saying Fudge was a violent bigot. I'm saying he was, like most people in power, motivated by wealth, which was primarily in the hands of bigots.
