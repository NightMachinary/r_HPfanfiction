The Minister is torn between Dumbledore and Malfoy. This IS explicitly stated. We even see it during Chamber. He only turns to Malfoy when he wants to deny Voldemort is back, because he's a coward, not because he's in any way anti-Muggleborn. Wizard society as a whole does the same.

Umbridge is an obvious exception, and explicitly says that Fudge wouldn't tolerate her methods if he knew about them, WHILE Fudge is against Harry and Dumbledore.
