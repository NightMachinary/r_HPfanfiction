Elites are not always a minority among those with political power. That's a fairly new thing.

And I'm arguing that anti-Muggleborn discriminators did not hold the reigns of society. Unpleasant Death Eater children called Muggleborns names, but can you think of an instance before Voldemort controlled the Ministry where Muggleborns were oppressed on a societal level? The wizarding world was transitioning from broke to woke, which is why the Death Eaters wore masks instead of suits.
