Those elites are a minority in magical society. Hogwarts /is/ accepting Muggleborns, who /are/ afforded the same basic rights as purebloods. Magical society takes pains to stay off the Muggles' radar, and Muggle baiting and hunting Muggles are both illegal. The Dark Arts are illegal. We literally see a Ministry official come to take the descendants of Salazar Slytherin to task for harming a Muggle. The Aurors were against them. Even many Pureblood families were against them. They might have been a majority among Purebloods, but that's not even for sure.
