I disagree with comparisons between the Death Eaters and revolutionary terrorist organizations like some you mentioned, an essential characteristic of Voldemort's cause is that it aligns with the dominant political beliefs of the elite class within magical society. We can also see that the Death Eaters themselves are closely tied to the Ministry, with the higher echelons of government clearly sympathetic to their cause if not their methods. All this makes the Death Eaters much more akin to an unofficial paramilitary arm of the government like the cartel-affiliated militias in Latin America, the UVF, or any of the products of operation Gladio.

This doesn't change the fact that they are unlikely to do something absurd like lay siege to a shopping district, but it does change the character of their actions somewhat. These groups are more likely to take ‘proactive' action against possible ‘subversive' elements, traditionally repressed groups like Muggleborns, only taking nonviolent action outside of the movement's identity and with the backing of large amounts of wealth. Revolutionary groups are generally happy to publicly promote policy.
