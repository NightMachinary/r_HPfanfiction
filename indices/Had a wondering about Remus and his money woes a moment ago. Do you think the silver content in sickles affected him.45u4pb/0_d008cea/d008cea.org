Werewolves in HP canon are not affected by silver at all. From Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  The many Muggle myths and legends surrounding werewolves are, in the main, false, although some contain nuggets of truth. Silver bullets do not kill werewolves, but a mixture of powdered silver and dittany applied to a fresh bite will â€˜seal' the wound and prevent the victim bleeding to death (although tragic tales are told of victims who beg to be allowed to die rather than to live on as werewolves).

I also recall in OotP that they were drinking out of solid silver goblets, and there was no mention of Remus being allergic to silver there either.
