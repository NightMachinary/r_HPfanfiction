Do we see any instances of skin contact with silver being a problem in canon? I know blood contact is an issue since silver/dittany is used to seal the bite wound according to Pottermore, but blood contact vs skin contact are very different things.

There may be some slight discomfort at the very most is what I'd think. Not like the dramatic 'my hand is on fire' we see in old vampire movies when they touch a cross. But if there's nothing in canon to say or imply that there was an issue (like the goblets another post mentioned!) then there's no reason to think the silver in sickles would be an issue.
