My fic is Harry/George (sorry for the shameless self-promo). Harry/George is my OTP, so I basically just wrote the fic I wanted to read. It does feature abusive Dursleys, but I mostly just read between the lines of canon. It's nothing over the top and mostly is referenced as part of Harry's reactions to other things. I hope u like it :)
