I like the “Amare” series for Harry/Cedric (two done, one in progress), though it does have worse-than-canon abusive Dursley's: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1757755]]

Another in-progress Harry/Cedric one that I've been enjoying is “You're Okay”: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29204478/chapters/71706093]]
