Dudley/Goyle: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/200820][Hand in Glove]] (rated explicit)

The following fics include male Slytherins but not Harry.

Quirrel/Snape: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13615362][Quirrell's Moonlit Stroll]] (rated explicit)

Dumbledore/Voldemort: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25975459][A blind date]] (silly) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1601735][Purgatory]] (not so silly, rated explicit)

Quirrel/Voldemort: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1146804][The Greatest Weakness]]

These next few fics contain potentially offputting or “problematic” dynamics but again, not actually with Harry.

Dudley/Piers: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189985][Dudley Distracted]] (rated explicit, Dudley has a weird unrequited incesty crush on Harry that he processes together with Piers)

Tom Riddle/Slughorn: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1169296][In the Style of a Lover]] (rated explicit, a scary reversal of the typical teacher-student power dynamic)
