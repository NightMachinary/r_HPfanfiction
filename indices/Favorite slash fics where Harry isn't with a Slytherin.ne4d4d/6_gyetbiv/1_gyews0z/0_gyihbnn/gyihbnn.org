Ahhh I see now what happened. I applaud you for putting up that post. Seriously that was good.

As for the pairing I had recently read Harry/Bill/Charlie if you are fine with threesome but it hasn't yet started with the relationship. Its WBWL with a good twin brother no weasley bashing with an evil Dumbledore.

Blind Love by misteeirene

Wrong boy who Lived. Dumbledore declared Harry a squib and so he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle. What will everyone do when they find out that Harry is the true prophecy child? What condition will the Order find Harry in when they finally locate him.

Harry/Cedric. Seriously light hearted and so good and no bashing at all. Complete

Paranoia and Puns by You_Light_The_Sky

Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo.

For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

Edit: Blind love is not finished but there is re-write going on.
