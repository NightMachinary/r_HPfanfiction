I made it because of that discussion thread actually.

And you're pretty much proving that discussion thread's point...

    if you want explicitly slash subreddit, you may try [[/r/HPSlashFic/]]

People doing stuff like that is why people think this subreddit doesn't like slash. HPSlashFic had to be made because HPFanfiction wanted slash fics gone, which isn't right.

This subreddit should allow different stuff.

Slash and femslash fanfiction should be allowed on here.
