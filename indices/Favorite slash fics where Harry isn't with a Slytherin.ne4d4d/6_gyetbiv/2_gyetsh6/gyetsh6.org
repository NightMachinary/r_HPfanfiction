If you're subscribed to that very subreddit, there's actually a recent post about how people there feel about the atmosphere towards slash in this subreddit. I think some of the people who saw it might be trying to prove it wrong by posting about slash and showing that the users of this subreddit can recommend and discuss slash fanfiction too. After all, slash fanfiction is fanfiction too!
