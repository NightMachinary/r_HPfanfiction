My biggest pet peeve in relationship fics is when they make a contrived reason to put two people together. People can choose whatever pairing they like, that's fine, if you want to make a well written story about Snape falling for Dobby then hats off to you. But marriage contracts, soul bonds, Veela-mates, and other fics start with the idea “Okay how can I force these two together, and how many chapters of them being sad should I write?” I understand the nice dramatic tensions forcing two people with loss of magic if the don't get together, but you know they will get together in the end, so the whole fic is them slowly coming around to that conclusion, so for me all the tension is dead.
