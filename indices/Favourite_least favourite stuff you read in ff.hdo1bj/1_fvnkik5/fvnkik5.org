I really don't like harem fics, because every single one has the girls ganging up on Harry and pushing him around. They usually get together and decide --- completely without his input --- who will get to sleep with him in which order and on what schedule. Not to mention the apparently required punitive shopping trip, wherein he is made to take them shopping to make up for some perceived slight, and in which they usually show an unholy glee in tormenting him with trying on countless outfits that they then force him to purchase.
