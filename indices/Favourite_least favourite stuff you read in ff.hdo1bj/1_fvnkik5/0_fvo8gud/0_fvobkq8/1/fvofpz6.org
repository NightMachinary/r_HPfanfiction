  I don't think most harem fics are a match for harem manga/anime. In the anime/manga, it's always about the central character ultimately selecting 1 girl, and the girls competing for his attention.

No, there's a reason for the [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Marry_Them_All][Tenchi solution]] being a trope. /High School DxD/, /Testament of Sister New Devil/, /Trinity Seven/, /How Not to Summon a Demon Lord/, are probably the most popular harem series in recent years, and all of them appear to be going the full group route.

Chinese and American harem series usually go the group route, with a large chunk of American ones also having the women date each other also. Then again that's also true of most American reverse harems also from what I can tell.
