Ah. I don't read that many harem manga, to be honest. The only ones I've read for any length of time are:

- /Ranma 1/2/, which is far more about the absurd martial arts adventures, with Akane ultimately "winning". That annoyed me, with how much Akane abused Ranma, especially during the times he didn't deserve it. It always felt like Ukyo and Ranma were the couple with the fewest problems between them.

- /Mahou Sensei Negima/, which I never actually finished, but IIRC it dropped the harem aspect to become a battle manga

- /Rosario X Vampire/, which seems to drop a lot of the harem aspects of the manga towards the end, going full on battle-manga(and saving the world). Even so, Tsukune the only girl he ever really expressed any romantic feelings for was Moka. Everyone else he seemed to only express platonic affection for.

I didn't even know Tenchi married them all. I thought the "Tenchi Solution" was stringing them along forever.
