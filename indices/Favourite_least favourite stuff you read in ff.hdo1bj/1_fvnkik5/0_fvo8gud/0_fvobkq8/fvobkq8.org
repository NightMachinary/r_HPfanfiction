I don't think most harem fics are a match for harem manga/anime. In the anime/manga, it's always about the central character ultimately selecting 1 girl, and the girls competing for his attention.

In just about every harem fanfic I've read, they're perfectly willing to share(and even encourage it). Some animes/mangas will have a character aiming for the "Harem ending," but it's almost always one out of the bunch, rather than the girls coming to an agreement.
