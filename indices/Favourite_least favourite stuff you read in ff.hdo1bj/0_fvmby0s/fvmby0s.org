I don't mind characters getting what I feel they deserve, but I really hate time travel fics where someone does a preemptive strike against an 11-year-old because of something their future self from another timeline did.

Probably the only RobSt fic I felt went too far with the bashing was when Future!Ron committed an unforgivable offense, and Hermione and Harry are thrown back in time when they're executed for murdering Future!Ron in response.

The author spends a lot of time hemming and hawing about whether to outright murder an 11-year-old, or just permanently disfigure him. It's even more egregious because the same author portrays Ginny as nearly as guilty in that particular fic but allows her to be redeemed, not to mention making Percy basically an older version of Ron, with the same stupid jealousy.

My /favorite/ fanfics are the ones get just what they deserve /legally/. There's nothing I find more satisfying than a character being judged by a jury of their peers, and getting a deserved sentence. Umbridge springs to mind particularly. I've only ever seen a few fanfics where Umbridge /wasn't/ an antagonist
