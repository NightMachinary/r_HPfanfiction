Two things really bug me.

OP first years. Ron accidentally knocks out the troll with his first successful levitation charm. Hell, they're using tickling charms in the dueling club in CoS. First years should not be throwing around cutting curses and explosions. I don't care how many books Harry read in the month between meeting Hagrid and school starting.

Dating first years. Ew.
