I don't mind op first years as there always ends up being more mental over the top stuff happening later and I read it like it's a crack fic at that point. It does beg the question though why give eleven year olds a powerful weapon especially when some of them have only known about magic for short time even in the books, maybe Umbridge kinda when she took practical learning out of the equation. Crap I just though lot of Umbridge as a sensible person mostly instead of the hellish she devil I hate.
