The find most bashing to not be needed like the constant bashing of Ginny and Molly but Snape Umbridge and Ron I really dislike so I'm good with that but they aren't my fics so as long as it has enough good points to it I don't mind. If Harry is in another house I will always prefer it to be the snakes.
