-As soon as we're at hogwarts, convince Ron somehow to visit McGonagalls office with us and present her Peter Pettigrew. Sirius will be out of prison in no time.

-Next item on the list, get to the room of requirement and get the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Also ask Sirius to send us that locket from 12 Grimmauld Place ASAP. Walk into Dumbledore's office with 3/6 Horcruxes (including Harry). That should get him to trust my information.

-Now with Dumbledore trusting me, we can quickly take care of Quirrel. No Voldemort in the school threatening my brother any more! Voldemort will probably escape and return to being a spirit, but without Wormtail to find him, things will be difficult for him.

-I'll ask Dumbledore to get Remus as teacher right in first year, he's capable and with Sirius out of prison we can surprise Fred and George with a visit of their heroes.

-After making sure that the school is safe, the next job is to get the remaining Horcruxes. The Gaunt Ring will be easy since Dumbledore is capable of retrieving it in canon, and my information will make sure he doesn't die because of it. The diary will be retrieved in a surprise raid on Malfoy Manor by ministry forces after Ron tells his dad about it, and if we can't convince the goblins to give us the cup from the Lestrange vault Dumbledore should be capable of breaking in. He still has the Cloak of Invisibility, and he trusts my information after I located all the other Horcruxes.

-Now that we have all the Horcruxes and all the Hallows (imagine Dumbledore's shock when I tell him that I know exactly what his wand is), it's his job to figure out how to get rid of Voldemorts soul without killing Harry (and maybe preserving those ancient artefacts) and we can focus on our normal hogwarts education and spending time with our Godfather and Defense teacher. We're only first years, after all.

-Oh, before I forget it, let's also open the chamber of secrets and take care of the basilisk.

-Once Dumbledore figures out a way to get out the Horcrux from Harry, we can get rid of Voldemort for good and have a normal life.
