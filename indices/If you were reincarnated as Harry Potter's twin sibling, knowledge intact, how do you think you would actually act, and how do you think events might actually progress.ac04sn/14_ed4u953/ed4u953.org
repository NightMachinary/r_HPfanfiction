I think what I would do is a twin sister.

But regardless, a sibling, especially a twin, especially a twin /sister/ invokes a fundamental change in the story. An insert of a character who knows everything may as well be "Sandbox mode" where you intervene when you feel like it. A sibling on the other hand goes right down to the prophecy. Does the prophecy need to change? Maybe Neville has a twin as well. Or perhaps the prophecy is the same, but Voldemort attempts to kill Harry first, the love charm kicks in and wastes Voldy before he can try to kill the twin. I like this angle, it's what I would take.

Next: even if your character knows everything in the books, you're still growing up with Harry and the Dursleys. Even with future knowledge, these are still people you're living with day in and day out and forming relationships. I think the Dursleys would be softer, specifically I think I'd take the approach with the sister having her mother's charm, and the Dursleys being begrudgingly pleasant, or at least not tyrannical as they were before. They might be inclined to favor the girl and still be harsh on Harry, but this is where that knowledge would come in, the sister knowing the progression of the story would either decline the favoritism, or leverage it for better treatment for Harry. I think this would end with the two still doing a lot of chores around the house, and a not especially loving home life, but one that's far better. To that point, we see with Harry that the worst part of living with the Dursleys after his first year is the isolation from his friends it brings.

I see the greatest amount of conflict between the kids and the Dursleys would be the school letters. I don't know if I'd take them all the way to the island, or if I'd just make Hagrid show up earlier, but I think he would really want to see both kids. We get to Diagon Alley, nothing differs significantly, we get to 9 3/4, Harry still meets the Weasleys. I REALLY like the idea of people growing up basically not giving a shit about Sister Potter, only knowing that Harry defeated him. I think I would make it a recurring joke that it's not common knowledge that he has a sister because all they've ever heard about is "Voldemort murdered Harry Potter's parents and then failed to murder him" and they'd leave off "and his sister was in the crib next to his but everybody ends the story at "Voldy died trying to kill Harry." This accordingly leaves plenty of room for the sister to develop how she wants---and keep in mind, she's a person, she might know the future but she still has her own wants and needs and dreams!---so here is the question. Is she part of the group, and the three become four? Or is she content to be on the periphery, like Neville?

The exact narrative arc is if the author wants it to be crack or not, but I think either way she intervenes in mortal threats (So everything after book 1)

• Book 1 remains the same, perhaps she helps with smuggling the dragon, but I suspect she might think it have some ultimate significance.

• Book 2, she determines some way to convince Dumbledore there's a basilisk in the school. The most effective way would be revealing future knowledge, so this could just be a fairly boring arc, where she shows Dumbledore the diary, gets him to kill the snake, destroy the diary, and probably figures out some way of getting Dobby freed like Harry does. My "entertaining" arc would be Dumbledore kills the snake, but the sister isn't sure who has the diary, and there's still the final confrontation between Harry and Riddle and somehow Harry still pulls the sword and destroys the diary.

• Book 3: Pettigrew's caught and Sirius is exonerated before he needs to escape, so the entirety of the Book 3 plot is subverted. Normal year.

• Book 4: Once again this is a arc/narrative question. With the Chamber/Pettigrew, Dumbledore trusts the sister, so does she want Harry to compete in the cup? This would require her to leave Barty in place, or perhaps she busts him right after the Goblet of Fire hoodwink. I genuinely don't know how I'd do the cup/portkey/graveyard. Otherwise after she busts Pettigrew I'd imagine she'd say "oh yeah and Barty Crouch Jr. is still alive," which preempts Goblet of Fire except the graveyard.

(By the way, in the background during all of this the Horcruxes are getting dunked on by Dumbledore.)

Maybe I set it up so the graveyard is the final confrontation. I like the idea of this because it might mean Dumbledore and Harry go together to the graveyard, which could be cool.

• Book 5: So assuming that for whatever reason the story is progressing like canon, Dumbledore stops the Dementors, maybe Umbridge is preempted outright and the ministry sends some other shitty but at least not evil instructor. DA probably still exists in this scenario because fuck it why not. Harry doesn't go to the ministry, or it's bait if for some reason they need to prove Voldemort is alive.

• Book 6: Ring's already destroyed, Dumbledore's no longer dying, if the horcruxes haven't been dunked on yet (for whatever reason) that starts in this one, and instead of memories it's just Dumbledore and Harry playing seek and destroy. Don't really see a compelling reason to have Dumbledore dying at the end of Book 6 with everything before this.

• Book 7: IDK. Again, I just figure any way you slice it the story's all solved by this point. Alternatively there could be some interesting area about the ministry being under Voldemort's control in all but name, and Hogwarts being kind of a powder keg, and horcrux dunking happening during this year in secret, leading up to Voldemort's move on Hogwarts to take out Dumbledore & Harry, and him subsequently losing.

Really, like I said, I think I would construct it such that the graveyard is the final battle. I think it lines up neatly with the timeline and with a character with mostly perfect knowledge, and then Harry/Sister enjoy a quiet final 3 years at Hogwarts.
