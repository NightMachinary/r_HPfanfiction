Besides the main problem that Harry doesn't have a twin, and one does not fit in the story one iota. So you already start off super-contrived, as you gotta explain how either you have a pair of neglected twins at the Dursleys (and Harry's character development would be very different if he had a confident through that), or you got another 'Found family after joining the wizarding world' situation that Sirius fills quite nicely.

Next, you have to explain wtf reincarnated as means. Baby with a previous lifes knoweldge? First off, that would really, really suck. Second, events from the books should never even get close to happening, all it really takes is getting old enough to hold a conversation. Plus you'd be rich. Filthy rich. Anyone with a modest understanding of history would be able to make lots of money off of historical events.

Or you have someone taking over a body after it is grown. Setting aside the fringe horror of you killing whatever body you take over, you are being put into a situation which has already dramatically been altered from the books (as previously mentioned, Harry didn't have a twin brother and if he did everything would drastically change pretty much everything about the story). So your knowledge is basically useless (not that it wouldn't be anyway, for other reasons).

I have never understood the whole 'Harry has a twin' thing. It makes no sense in the context of the story, in the context of Harry's character. As far as I can tell, it is just a way for authors who don't want to write a real OC or SI to ease into it. Or for some reason want a teenage version of Sirius for Harry to connect to. And don't even get me started on the whole WBWL thing. You have a perfectly good Neville if you want to do a story about the prophecy being misinterpreted, and for some reason authors keep pushing in OC siblings instead.

/sigh/ this is just something I think I'm not going to get. And I honestly wouldn't even mind a story that was 'What if Harry had a sibling, how would things change'. But that is never the story written. It is always 'I need this kind of relationship for harry, so lets force it in', falling into the same mess a lot of magical core, inheritance, or marriage law fics do, just a lazy plot device. Only it fits the theme of the books even less.
