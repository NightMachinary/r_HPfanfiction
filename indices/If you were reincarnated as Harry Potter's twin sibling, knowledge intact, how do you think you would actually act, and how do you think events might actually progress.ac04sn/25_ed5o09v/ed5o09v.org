It's the 1980's or 90's, so no matter whatever ‘else' I do, should I survive to adulthood, I will be a billionaire in the stock market. I'd likely have no choice but to stay at the dursley's and attent Hogwarts; however, my headcanon says that magic is curbed by intent and will, and given I'm a Sociopath, assuming that would carry over, I'll likely be doing crazy things with magic in no time flat. I'm very good at convincing myself to believe in things that don't really matter to me, after all.

I'm sure I'd go for a ‘Third Path to the Future' ending, where the magical world ends up know to the miggles, and an economic powerhouse I atleast partly control. I'd collect the Deathly Hollows, prevent the destruction of the Stone, and walk around with an Unplotable wand holster on my wrist, with an expanded space Bag-Of-Holding pouch built in.

I'd also, I imagine, save everyone all kinds of time with the PoA and HBP plots.
