The Ministry couldn't tell the difference between a house elf and a wizard, couldn't loophole their way around a burning goblet, had little to zero respect for muggle governance and economy, were honestly astonished that airplanes worked over distances longer than "a field," and could barely dress themselves in appropriate clothing without attracting attention. I don't know if they even /have/ a financial management department, and their department for dealing with the nonmagical world is literally "The Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee."

You'll forgive me if I doubt their ability to monitor financial crime, much less suspicious but legitimate investments.
