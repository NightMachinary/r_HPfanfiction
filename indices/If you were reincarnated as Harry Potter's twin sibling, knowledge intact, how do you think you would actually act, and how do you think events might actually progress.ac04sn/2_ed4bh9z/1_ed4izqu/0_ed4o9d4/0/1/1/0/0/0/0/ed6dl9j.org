Bitcoin isn't though. And instant information age kinda coincides with the rise of those stocks, so it won't take long for it to become available.

The teller would tell them who to ask. A chain of confuded muggles, will eventually lead them somewhere. They can fake any kind of muggle authority, like that blank piece of paper that apparently explained everything to Ms. Cole. They can straight up use a muggle of any authority. I don't think any accounting can withstand magic, as long as there are muggles around it.

So if MoM gets suspicions they will get the info. I think only stronger magic can stop them. And they would, cause how would they miss that Harry Potter's twin suddenly got super rich?
