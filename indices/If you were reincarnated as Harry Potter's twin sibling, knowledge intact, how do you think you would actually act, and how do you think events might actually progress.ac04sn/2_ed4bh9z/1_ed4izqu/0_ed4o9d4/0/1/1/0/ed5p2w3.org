But which Bank teller? How would they even know where to look for that information? There are dozens of different banks in the UK alone, and that is not even mentioning the Commonwealth and the EU (or Swiss number accounts). And even then, shouldn't there be some internal safeguards so that a random teller in a London branch cannot get customer information from someone who hasn't even been in that branch office? This is before the whole system goes through the internet, which only spread in the later 90s.
