I meant that quite literally, the Teller wouldn't be able to get the information. The series is set before the age of instant information.

Potter is not exactly a rare name, so searching for an X Potter in the archives of credit institutes will not yield the expected results. This was before the days of getting gigabytes of information with a few keystrokes. And even then, Swiss accounting should be solid enough to withstand some MoM investigation, especially since they wouldn't know to look in Switzerland. Outside of the initial withdrawal, nothing happens on the magical side. As far as they know, you withdrew a few thousand Galleons and that's it. They would not know of any fortune you made on the side. It's not like the average MoM employee would conclude that the random garage full of Mercedeses are yours, much less that you used future knowledge to earn the necessary monetary assets to pay for that.
