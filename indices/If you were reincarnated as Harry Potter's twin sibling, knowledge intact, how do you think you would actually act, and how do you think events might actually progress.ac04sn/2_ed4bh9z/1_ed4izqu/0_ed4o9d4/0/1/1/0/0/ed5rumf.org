I think you are underestimating MoM, they can twist muggle minds however they like so nothing in muggle world is a secret for them. Muggle security won't stop them. It might take them a while to figure out exactly how to get the info, months even maybe, but someone of average intelligence can eventually do it.

They have a point to start with - you. You make purchase, they follow the money trail.

Now, I am sure you can probably fool them if you are clever enough with some planning, especially if no one knows you have the foreknowledge. But I think it would be quite hard.
