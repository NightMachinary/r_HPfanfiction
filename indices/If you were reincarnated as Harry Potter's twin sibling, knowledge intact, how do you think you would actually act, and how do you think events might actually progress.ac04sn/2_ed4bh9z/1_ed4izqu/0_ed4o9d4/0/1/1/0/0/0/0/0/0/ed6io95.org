How does IRS knows everything I earn? I am not suspicions, that's just their job, to make sure I pay taxes. And they don't even have magic (I think).

I guess you mean that you'll have a separate secret muggle identity, that might fool them for a while. But it's kinda lame to have all that money and have to spend it on muggle stuff. Super car is lamer than that Ford Anglia, imo.

This is getting sidetracked. I was just trying to say that in world building sense, I think wizards really should be very restricted in using muggle financial stuff, cause it's very easy for them to abuse with magic. Making money from helpless muggles seems so sinfully easy, MoM should really come down on it like a ton of bricks.
