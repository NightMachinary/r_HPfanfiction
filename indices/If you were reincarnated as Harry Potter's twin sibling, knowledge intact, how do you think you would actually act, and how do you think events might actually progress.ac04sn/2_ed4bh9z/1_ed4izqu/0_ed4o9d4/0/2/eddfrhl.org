So, assuming they actually bothered to/were capable of investigating these suspicions (others have made plenty of arguments against that already), or assuming the muggle get suspicious and you don't want to charm them (not that they could do anything about you just getting lucky), the easy way out is to just invest in more than just the companies you know will succeed. Invest in thos companies plus some you know will do okay or fail. Your gains will still outway your losses and it'll seem like you're a savvy business-person who knows what to invest into but isn't always right.
