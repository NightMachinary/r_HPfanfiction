Well, I'm asian so lily would have a lot of explaining to do to james.

Probably id chill until the end of the second book. At this point the sword has the basilisk venom and one horcrux is down and out. id bring the diadem to dumbledore. No one has died as well.

This act would probably give me enough pull to convince dumbledore of multiple horcrux and have him help me capture pettigrew so sirius gets released before needing to escape.

From there dumbledore could get the locket. And then dumbledore would have to rob gringotts himself. And also id be like, don't fucking touch the ring before stabbing it with the sword bro. And then id stab harry and I guess Voldemort would just disintegrate?
