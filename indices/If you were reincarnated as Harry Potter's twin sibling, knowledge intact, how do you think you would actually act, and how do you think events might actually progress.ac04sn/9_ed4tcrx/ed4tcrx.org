Try to track down anyone that has a vested interest in Harry's safety (and that has good intentions and isn't in league with Riddle) and get us both there ASAP. Knowing my personality, I probably would've feared Dudley a lot and acted as a shield for Harry getting beat up... though I don't think people would turn as much of a blind eye if they saw that Dudley was beating up his legally blind cousin. I would tell anyone who would listen in the neighborhood about how bad Dudley beat me and Harry up. If someone listened, whatever the UK's version of Child Services is would've probably taken both of us away, but Dumbledore would probably intervene and keep us there anyway. If we're still there at the Ripper-chases-Harry-up-the-tree incident, I'd run straight over to Mrs. Figg and beg her to do something and tell her everything (assuming she doesn't already know).

If somehow we're still with them after the letters arrive and we go to Diagon Alley, I'm calling the Knight Bus and have them take us both to... somewhere. I'd try the Weasleys first since they seem to be good parents. If they somehow don't take us in, I try to find the Longbottoms. If they don't have us, then I'd feel out of options, so I'd try to find literally anyone on the "good side" in Harry' year and beg their parents. After that comes digging through the family tree and finding someone, even outside Britain, to take us.

And that's all before first year
