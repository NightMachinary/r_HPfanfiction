I would try to get Harry and I removed by Child Protection services (or whatever England's equivalent is), but I don't think it would work... I think it would just get a bunch of social workers obliviated. It would get Dumbledore's attention and I feel like he'd do something... but would it be effective? Or would it only work for a little while and once Dumbledore's attention is elsewhere it would just start again?

I don't have any kids and I never had any siblings so I feel like there'd be a pretty dramatic change in myself. Honestly, Dumbledore might end up obliviating me, because I feel like I'd become fiercely protective of Harry and wouldn't be able to stand him being in that situation. Hell, he might end up having to separate us.
