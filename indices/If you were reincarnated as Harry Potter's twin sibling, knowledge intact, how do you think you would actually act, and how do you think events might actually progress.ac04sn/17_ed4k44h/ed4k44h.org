This is assuming i'll be reborn with magic. Let's say I was born a squib, and Lily and James never found that out. Petunia, however, eventually would realize that unlike my brother, I did not have magic. I think I would be treated much different than Harry at the Dursley's, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't do anything about Harry's abuse. I think I would tell him everything. He is my twin, hopefully Harry wouldn't mess up the timeline with the knowledge I'd give him. I don't think the Dursley's would allow Harry to write me, but I could tell him to send the letters to Ms.Figg, and that's how we'd keep contact while he was at Hogwarts. I would try to free Sirius, and hopefully he'd take me in with Harry and away from the Dursley's.

If I was born with magic, then I'm getting me and Harry out of the Dursley's. I wouldn't tell him everything, I would say I'm a type of ‘seer' or something that sees visions in my dreams. I would get us to Gringotts and hopefully the Potter manner isn't something that only exists in fanfics. If it was destroyed or something, then I guess we'd be homeless for a while, until our Hogwarts letters came. I doubt I'd be sorted into the same house as Harry, every Pottermore quiz says I'm either a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, and I'd most likely beg the hat to sort me in Ravenclaw. I'd let Harry do his thing, giving him “visions” every now and then.
