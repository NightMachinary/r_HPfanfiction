I thought you started as a baby with adult knowledge. Letting Sirius sit in Azkaban for 10 years is a bit much. Ideally you would stop Vodemort from even making Harry a horcrux, but that might be hard as a baby. And Voldemort might just win without Lily stopping him.

And if you capture Wormtail Voldemort would still chill in Albania, waiting. You'd be better off letting Quirell do his thing and having the Mirror trap work out.
