You can probably change a lot in the first few years. One stunner at Scabbers, grab him and run to McGonagalls office, tell her you think he's an Animagus, and you get Sirius Black out of Azkaban. One trip to the room of requirement and you have Ravenclaws Diadem, one of the Horcruxes. One owl to Sirius, and he'll find Slytherins Locket at Grimmauld Place. In second year, you can have a quick talk with Ginny, telling her about Voldemorts true identity, and you have another Horcrux. With no chamber of secrets opened, Sirius free and a quick mention to Dumbledore about Quirrel, the first three years will be much more normal and a lot less dangerous. By the time Voldemort starts to return, you know exactly that he's at Riddle Manor with very few Death Eaters (Wormtail is already captured, remember?) so the Order of the Phoenix can save the day, kill Nagini and capture Voldemort in his weak form. Some Veritaserum later, all Death Eaters are in Azkaban, all Horcruxes are destroyed except for Harry, and Voldemort is captured, so the only remaining task is to get Voldemort out of Harry's scar, which should be easier with no war going on.
