You literally don't have to do anything the first 3 years, just stay out of the way. Everything goes fine for the good guys in those first 3 years.

Fourth year is when it gets tricky. You can easily fuck the whole thing over by tainting the bones of Voldemort's father if you are careful about it in the first 3 years, but Cedric would die if you do nothing else. It would Sabotage the ritual tho. From there things would go mostly to the wind except some fixed things like the horcruxes which are the most important.

Tl;Dr lay low for three years.and figure out a way to make people believe you when you say you know where the horcruxes are. Pretend to be a +deer+ SEER or whatever.
