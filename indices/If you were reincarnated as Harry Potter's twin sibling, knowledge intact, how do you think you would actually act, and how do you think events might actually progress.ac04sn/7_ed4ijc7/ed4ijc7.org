I would certainly feel compelled to save some lives, but probably make things worse.

I know if I change things too early the knowledge will be useless and it's hard to predict how much change is too much. So it just seems like a long shot, especially since Harry having a sibling is already a big change.

And honestly, the best thing to do would be to tell Dumbledore. He is much smarter and more powerful than I am (I know zero magic), so he can actually quietly do something about horcruxes. Meanwhile I will use my adult mind to learn as much magic as possible (hopefully I won't have to stay with Dursleys). Depending on my progress, I can also help destroy horcruxes or at least be useful later. Nothing really bad happens until 4th year, so I will hopefully have 13 years for it.
