I'd probably screws canon up so badly. Because if I was reincarnated as his twin, he'd be my family and I value family a lot (ridiculously so).

Harry would probably be annoyed by my constant hovering because I'd be very worried, slip of tongue and all the mind reading would probably get me in trouble. Not to mention the fact I definitely won't be sorted into Gryffindor (or Slytherin) making us share not many classes.

I'll also speed the events up because since I already know it, I'll do it kinda thing? idk. I'm pretty sure nothing would go as canon, that's one thing down.
