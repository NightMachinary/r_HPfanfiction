Child Services would be my litmus test for Dumbledore as to how much I trust him in the future.

Whether he notices our removal from Number 4? How does he react?

If he interfered and placed us back at Number 4 regardless, I don't trust him at all.

If he interfered only to find somewhere else for us when he found out about what happened then I trust him much more.

If he doesn't notice or notices and does nothing I assume ignorance over malevolence and use him as a resource on an ad hoc basis.
