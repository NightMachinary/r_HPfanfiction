A good point - I've read some pretty good self-inserts. I just won't write one because, well, I'm not any good.

I agree - Dumbledore may mess with the cops and social workers. To that effect, I suppose I'd need to get REALLY GOOD at Occlumency and show false memories of Vernon violating me sexually - maybe THEN Dumbledore would actually act and get us out of there. Several problems with this - 1, it's shown that even Slughorn cannot manufacture a fake memory with no gaps or weird shit that gives it away as fake. 2, Dumbledore is incredibly clever, and if he got even a HINT that I was able to occlude at that age with no training, he'd probably peg me as Dark. 3, I'd still be a person with less than 1st year experience, and have to go through and learn everything. There's no guarantee I'd be any better at Occlumency than Harry was; in fact, nothing suggests I'd be any kind of talented witch at all. I'd probably be roughly average at best, albeit very studious and knowledgeable.
