Try my hardest to get us away from the Dursleys as soon as possible, for one. As you said 'twin sibling' instead of just 'twin' or 'twin brother', I assume I'll keep on being female. Sad as it is, people would probably take the abuse of small girl more seriously than that of a boy. Also, I could certainly accuse Uncle Vernon of certain, /specific/ things to speed up the process. (Note: false rape allegations are fucking wrong and fucked up, but I do feel in the Harry/Dursley situation that I could be forgiven for wanting to say it to get my brother and I away from the family, and it would be as a last resort).

I'd also work early on being seen as fairly bookish, though not in a Hermione-like way. More like fictional stories, especially involving magic and fantasy. After being particularly obsessed with Dahl, 'Matilda' in particular, I'd 'pretend' to be magic like her and hopefully be able to have some early show of magic in a way that Harry would see, and get him to open up about any magic he may have shown. I'd convince him we were magical and that it was perfectly normal (for us), just like in Matilda. I'd try to get him to help me figure out just what we can do and to work on doing more and more. I'd try to make him more confident and a little more interested in study and work ethic if I could.

I'd also try to 'somehow' sense things/know things about evens and people, like Sophie in Halloweentown, though sadly that won't come out until Harry and I are well out of Hogwarts. But I'd be able to 'just know' about things, like Mrs. Figgs cats being unusual, and (assuming we haven't escaped the Dursley's yet), that Dudley will grow up to be a decent man. Maybe I could convince him to become nicer earlier on. I'd also 'know' stuff about Aunt Petunia and Mom, and see if I could change her or at least unsettle her with the knowledge.

A day or so leading up to the arrival of the Hogwarts letters, I'll warn Harry that 'something's coming, something is going to change', further establishing my 'ability' in Divination or some shit. When the letters come, Harry will fully know it's real and have concrete faith in my 'future-sensing' capabilities, if he didn't already.

Because Hagrid is necessary in terms of us getting to Diagon, and just because I love him, we won't be able to find a way to answer the letters, though we'll have snuck one from the Dursleys. We'll probably end up in that shack on an island again, and Hagrid will come for us. I won't let Hagrid give Dudley the tail if I can manage it, though, because then Dudley will owe me, or at least see I defended him, and maybe put some more stock in what I said about him being a decent person, or having the potential to be.

We'll get our supplies with Hagrid and be shocked at the Voldemort story and my brother being the Boy Who Lived. We'll get all of our supplies, and go along with most things as in canon, except I'll share to Harry that there's something 'off' about Quirrell. I won't antagonize Draco Malfoy in the robe shop, but like Harry, I won't befriend him, either.

Come Hogwarts Express time, we'll find our way to the Weasley's and ask for help getting on the train. Ron will sit with us, I'm sure. When Malfoy shows up, I'll move to shake his hand before anyone can devolve to insults, and then I'll 'sense' something about him, distract him from being rude if I can. Hopefully the situation leaves Ron, Harry, and Draco neutral to one another for the time being. I think I'd claim that my sense of Draco is that he's 'really smart, going to be brilliant someday if he studies well - he'll change the world!' I'll tell him he looks 'blue' to me. This is bullshit, of course, but maybe he'd think a little more.

When Hermione comes by looking for Trevor, I'll let her know that he'll turn up when the time is right, and ask if she's read Matilda. (I'm almost positive she has!). I'll try to get her and Neville to stay with us and open up to Harry and Ron more, so they both go into things a little less isolated.

Sorting time. Most of this goes to canon, until Draco, heeding what I mentioned, isn't put in Slytherin instantly, but into Ravenclaw. He's a bit shocked, but proud. His family won't be TOO angry, either, because it's a respectable house, and at least isn't Gryffindor or Hufflepuff. Even Lucius probably couldn't argue the importance of intelligence.

Now is the tricky part - not having had any super horrible experiences with a Slytherin-to-be (and with Draco not going to Slytherin after all), Harry probably isn't as biased against the house. However, he still needs to be in Gryffindor and befriend Ron and Hermione, 1 because he needs them and they're great, and 2 because I can't fuck up the universe too badly and still have my future knowledge be of a help. Suppose he and I read a lot about knights and heroes as kids, and I let him 'save' me from something at some point before, leading him to still head to Gryffindor..

As to myself, I'm a little unsure. I'm normally given Hufflepuff in the Sorting quizzes I take. But, surely, my manipulations to this point, my ambition, and all of the sneaky cunning shit I've had to do peg me as a Slytherin? That would go a long way into keeping Harry from getting SO biased, but what would Snape do to me? Ron would probably never accept me, as 11-year old Ron HATESSSSSSSSS Slytherin. And aside from Draco, I don't know a large amount about any of the other Slytherins, so navigating the house would be challenging.

While Hufflepuff would be great, personally, as I AM one, I don't know it would be the best choice for me in this scenario. I'd love it, but the closer I stay to Harry and the original timeline events, the better I can work with them. So I do my best and hopefully make Gryffindor.

At some point, someone cottons on to my 'sensing' abilities and Dumbledore or someone thinks I have a special affinity. It will make things easier, but this assumes I somehow am able to keep Dumbledore and Snape out of my head..

Anyway, if all goes well, I mention my 'off' feeling about Quirrell to the right people at the right times in order to get Dumbledore suspicious and have him do something.

As this is getting pretty long, I'll skip around. I befriend Neville and try to work on his confidence. I try to help Hermione tone it down so she isn't as hated. I do my best to stop Ron from injury in the chess game. I'm friendly enough to Draco, I like flying, Harry still makes the team, I gain Slytherin-tolerance by pointing out they shouldn't go to their common room during the Troll incident because it's in the dungeons. We still try to get the Stone, but suspect Quirrell, not Snape.

In the grand scheme of things, I do my best to try to save Cedric and Sirius, protect Luna, and enjoy being magical. I help Harry and Co fight Voldemort.

Apologies for the long ass response, this was very fun to think about! If I was any decent, I'd want to write my version of things with this as the prompt, but I don't think 'self-inserts' are generally well accepted anyway?
