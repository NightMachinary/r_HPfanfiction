You should probably learn Petrificus Totalus immediately, sneak into Ron's (and Harry's) room, use the spell on Scabbers, grab the rat and bring him to Dumbledore ASAP. Tell him you had a weird feeling about the rat, and he'll test it and find out it's an animagus.

Seriously, the man murdered your parents and framed your godfather. How can you not think of getting him when he's sleeping in Harry's room and you know it?

Once Sirius is free, you never have to see the Dursleys again, you can spend the Christmas holidays with him at Grimmauld Place, and you can have a weird feeling about the locket Kreacher has and bring it to Dumbledore to get an excuse to start Horcrux Hunting.

After that you can have a weird feeling about that spot where the room of requirement is, and find a strange diadem there. Tell Dumbledore, Horcrux #2 gone.

In second year, after your weird feeling about Quirrel just barely saved the Philosopher's stone, you can befriend Ginny so that Tom isn't the only person she talks to, and have a weird feeling about her diary (probably ASAP before Tom notices what's going on and you become the first victim instead of Colin), get Ginny to introduce you to Tom, ask some questions and reveal him as Voldemort. Once Ginny gets over her shock, take the diary to Dumbledore, Horcrux #3 gone, and the Chamber disaster doesn't happen.

Now with Sirius out of Prison it means that the notable events of third year just don't happen. No dementors, no Wormtail, and Lupin probably was teacher in second year after you met him in first year as Sirius' old friend and informed Dumbledore that you had a bad feeling about Lockhart.

With third year completely different, it's here where you take Divination and suddenly you can't predict anything anymore. The irony.

Dumbledore probably trusts you after randomly finding 3 Horcruxes, a Death Eater and the Chamber of Secrets so you can be a bit more direct with giving him all the information you have about the whereabouts of the remaining Horcruxes.
