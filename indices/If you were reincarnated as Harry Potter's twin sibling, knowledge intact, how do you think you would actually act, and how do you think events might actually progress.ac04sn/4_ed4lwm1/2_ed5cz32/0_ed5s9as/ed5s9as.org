That's something I was considering, too - but it worries me. With Wormtail captured, who's helping Voldemort? Will he just die, or will Barty Jr somehow find him and replace Wormtail? Will Moody be real Moody or still Barty Jr? Is Harry getting entered into the Triwizard? What about the rebirth ritual, and Voldemort taking Harry's blood being a necessary part of the plot?

A lot hinges on the events of PoA and Wormtail's escape. As much as I adore Sirius and want an out for Harry and I, I don't know if it'd be worth that risk in potentially ROYALLY screwing up the timeline and my ability to 'predict' things. It may cause much more damage than it prevents.
