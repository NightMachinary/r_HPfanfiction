No wormtail will certainly delay any plans Voldemort may have. If Dumbledore can manage to get into Gringotts all the Horcruxes except for Harry and Nagini will be gone by 2nd year. Pettigrew being captured before he returns to Voldemort is the only way to get Sirius free. While it does risk uncertainty about Voldemorts plans (he'll still need Harry for the ritual), you can't expect someone to spend three years with the man who murdered his parents without doing anything about it. Ideally Dumbledore would replace all of the bones of Tom Riddle Sr. with bones of someone else, with an alarm charm and everything so that if he tries some other plans to get Harry, the ritual will fail and Dumbledore knows where Harry is and can rescue him (and kill the Death Eaters wondering why the ritual didn't work).
