If magical/

Step 1: Learn enough wandless magic to k.o. an adult muggle. Pseudo-telekinesis (?)

Step 2: Scare the dursleys enough so they're not much of a bother to you and your twin. Keep it a secret from Harry if possible.

Step 3: Learn enough chemistry to be scary with transfiguration, train enough to be able to run a long time. (Check if magic can act as chakra and try ninja shenanigans, if it doesn't work no problem)

Step 4: Wait for letter and whomever takes you to diagon, secure moneys. Wait to find RoR before buying books and other extra stuff unless you find something worthwhile like occlumency books and magical common knowledge, maybe goblin history in case they are the ultra helpful kind, if not no problem.

Step 5: Stick to cannon unless Quirrelmort becomes an issue, try to get into ravenclaw if possible. Harry probably won't change much since I'm not much of a family guy, he'll probably be more outgoing and get some more friends.

Step 6: Learn enough so you can tell if you are obliviated, ideally prevent it from happening, back up memories (?) If it works run to tell Dumbles about Quirrell and hope for the best. Same plan if if takes longer, more than 3rd year? make plans to bomb little hangleton and pray you're not the one selected for the TWT, train wandless accio everyday just in case.

Step 7A: HOLY SHIT HE OBLIVIATED ME! I'm in a Evil!Dumbledore storyline! Despair for a few months while trying to steal(bond) as many elves as possible, move everything away from the RoR ( check if instructions are avaliable if not fuck it) Take harry and if she's cool Hermione with her family away to wherever you can hide from everyone. Learn as much as you can, have elves look for pple worth saving and take them away if war breaks out. Imperio your way to nukes and blow everything away as many times as necessary. I'm not a good person tbh.

​

Step 7B: Good!Dumbledore storyline! YAY!! 1rs year goes the same BUT the trio never make it past the door to fluffy, Snape smiles while stunning them. Dumbles face Quirrell, let's Spiritmort get away. Have Dumbles take the map from the twins so he can make sure Harry's fine before any of that.

​

Step 8: If you're lucky canon should be relatively the same. Check with dumbles if Harry can spend the summer with his friends (may as well give him a family experience since you're kinda cold), ask for a contract so the Wealeys can never potion Harry or similar scenarios (it never hurts to be cautious). Check on Luna in case she's cool to hang out with, plus magical animals are cool.

​

Step 9: Dobby and Lockhart shenanigans, good, canon still canon. Dumbles takes the diary while ''checking'' on Harry. Second year should be a quiet one.

​

Step 10: Let canon be canon until Dumbles get's a chance to capture the dog and the rat. Have him mess with his memories so he think he get's away the same as canon while tracking him to voldie.

​

Step 11: By this point all Horcruxes except the cup should be accounted for (unless Dumbles is THAT cool and can get it from the goblins) and nagini should be with voldie. Capture voldie, destroy Horcruxes, find a way to destroy the one in Harry. Worst case scenario let babymort AK Harry in case the prophecy is a thing. Happy ending (?)

Optional:

Step 12 : Learn as much magic as possible. Track the 1% with all the moneys fucking up the world, go on a killing/imperio spree, try to unfuck the world as much as possible using said moneys.

Step 13: Create some space wizards company. Profit!

Step 14A: MAGIC DOESN'T WORK OUTSIDE THE EARTH! D:

Repeat step 13 but help non magicals do it instead.

Step 14B: MAGIC STILL WORKS OUTSIDE THE EARTH! :D

Really happy ending ;)

​

There may be some plot holes or canon may change but I think this would be my main plan.
