Revel in the favoritism I'd receive as the Boy Who Lived, relentlessly bullying Harry. I'd then feel betrayed due to him being Sorted into Slytherin, giving me greater impetus to continue my poor treatment of him. After he proves that he is a Magical and political genius, continually out performing me in every theatre of life, I would go insane and try to kill him, probably around mid to late Seventh year. I would fail spectacularly, my final thought being the realisation that I was the Wrong Boy Who Lived.
