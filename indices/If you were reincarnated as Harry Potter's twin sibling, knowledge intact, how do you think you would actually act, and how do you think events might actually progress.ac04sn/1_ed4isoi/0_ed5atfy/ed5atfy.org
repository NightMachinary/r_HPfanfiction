About half the Horcruxes could be destroyed a week after we arrive at Hogwarts. The diadem is in the room of requirement, and we know how to open it. The locket is at Grimmauld, which we can access after freeing Sirius by capturing Peter, which should be easy if we can stun him while he's a rat, not suspecting anything. The ring is at the Gaunt house, which Dumbledore can get after we tell him to be careful because it's cursed. The cup is in the Lestrange vault, and should stay there for a while since the Lestranges are in Azkaban, so it's not a priority. The diary will be given to us if we don't change the timeline too much before 2nd year, so we can simply tell Ginny "hey, Tom Riddle is actually Voldemort, you should probably not befriend him, he'll just use you to murder students, give us that diary". Nagini could be difficult, but we know that Voldemort will use Riddle Manor as his base of operations once he returns, so we can tell Dumbledore to send the entire order of the phoenix and the entire auror force there as soon as Harry gets strange dreams. Harry's Horcrux might be difficult since Canon isn't very clear about it, but it might just be a "get out of jail" card for surviving another killing curse. And destroying the other Horcruxes will be easy, since we happen to have easy access to Slytherins basilisk.
