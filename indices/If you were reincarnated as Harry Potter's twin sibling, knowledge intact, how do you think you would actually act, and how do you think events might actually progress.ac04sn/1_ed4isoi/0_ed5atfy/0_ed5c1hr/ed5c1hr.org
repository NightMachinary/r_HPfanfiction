True enough, but we're a kid that shouldn't know about dark things like Horcruxes, so getting a reputation as a seer covers you for that, as you "Foresaw it" at least means Dumbledore will believe you, and him believing you before it's too late will basically turn the fic into "Competent Dumbledore wins the War by basically reading the Books" if you don't change too much on the outside.

Can't get rid of the Horcruxes in the First year unless you oust Quirrel early, as Quirrelmort might check on the Diadem off screen that we don't know about, and if he finds it gone... it'd fuck up EVERYTHING.
