Get established as a Seer by making harmless but correct "Predictions" as you already know the set events. Use that to get Dumbledore to believe your "Visions" and get him to act to deal with the horcruxes before Voldemort is back. If Nagini can't be gotten, wait til you know Arthur is going to be attacked in 5th year and then ambush it.. Harry, well... see if i can find a Magical Exorcism Ritual (Like Kyrie Eleison from Fate Stay/Night) to remove the Horcrux without him being dead.

Harry etc can deal with the rest whilst I become the new Oracle of Delphi.
