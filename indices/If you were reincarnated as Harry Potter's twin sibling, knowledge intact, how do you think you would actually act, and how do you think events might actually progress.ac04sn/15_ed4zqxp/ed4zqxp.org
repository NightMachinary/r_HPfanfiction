I have to admit that I would not want to partake in the whole Harry Potter storyline, except to prevent unncessary loss of life. - I think Harry would not be Harry if he hadn't had to walk through his own hell. That's what makes him, him. Utilitarian duty comes before my own want to indulge myself. There would be too many variables with someone attempting to influence history, - it would be better to let it play out and only help along those that would have died. A subtle charm here, or there, or maybe influencing them to avoid these keymoments that would have taken their lifes.
