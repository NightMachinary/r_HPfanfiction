I think these adjectives can be used in a fic under certain conditions, my main problems with it are:

- The expressions "How very _________ of you" and "Embracing yout inner _________ , (often Slytherin in both case) are so overused it instantly take most people out of the story and should be avoided.
- These terms should only be used when a character, or his actions, is the epitome of a House, not when he is just not a complete moron. Hermione using spells several years ahead of her for the DA make people wonder why she is not Ravenclaw and it's the only time in canon they talk about Houses like this. Actions like jumping into the Chamber of Secret with no plans or serious escort as 2nd year, knowing there is a basilisk inside, just to save someone can be a "Gryffindor action", but I doubt helping someone to gather his books after he dropped them is chivalrous enough to deserve the appelation.
- I already said some expressions were overused, but I think that the use of a House as a describing adjective should only happen in dialogues, and never in narration: "/Harry though it was time for him to wake up in Inner Slytherin to break free from the manipulation of this old coot, Albus Dumbledore/".

For example, I would be ok to see them used as it:

She stared at him "You want to tell me" she said slowly "That you and Weasley, as /2nd/ year, followed a bunch of spiders into the Forbidden Forest at night without any plan, and that, in the end, you ended up in the middle of a nest of /Acromantula/, raised by /Hagrid/, who tried to eat you?"

Harry kept looking at the floor, refusing to catch her eyes. "To be fair" he said "he answered our questions before trying to eat us, and the Weasley's car was living in the forest and took us out so all ended well".

"Gryffindors" she scoffed.
