I know that it's annoying, but you need to understand that these kids have grown up using these terms, for them, Gryffindor is a perfectly accurate way to describe a brave but foolish boy.

Even irl we have many such names, like "jocks" or "nerds," both having a predefined stereotypical behaviour attached to them. How's it any different for HP?
