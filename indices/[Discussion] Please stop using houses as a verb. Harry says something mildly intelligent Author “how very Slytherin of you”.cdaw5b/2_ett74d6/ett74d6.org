I can forgive it if they are using it as a part of a characters inner conflicting with a decision.

Like if they are Slytherin, and because of a conflict they are making series of rash and dumb decisions; ie "what the fuck am I doing? I'm a Slytherin, I need to stop acting like a Gryffindor and play to my strengths."

That being said, it does bother me when it it gets overused.
