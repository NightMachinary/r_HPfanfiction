Three things are hardly enough, but I guess it encourages prioritization.

1. Give Harry and Ron, especially Harry, gifts or talents that are equivalent to Hermione's intelligence. Hermione went from a valuable member of the trio in book 1 to the wondergirl who saved the day and ran the show in book 7 and then who supposedly became Minister for Magic while tolerating her drunk loser of a husband. Hermione, the girl who prefers books to people, offends people as easily as breathing and has a cruel streak a mile wide that she doesn't care to hide somehow becomes the premier politician of her country. It's pretty obvious that Rowling just starts heaping positive traits and accomplishments on her because girlpower and Emma Watson's rising star by the end of the series. Had they remained balanced, the story would have been better for it and epilogue related stories would be much more tolerable. Harry should have shown an intuitive talent for Charms or Transfiguration, and it should have affected the story at important moments. He should have been shown as a young wizard who was quite powerful for his age. Ron's supposed strategic genius from book 1 should have been built upon in the later books, as well as giving him more to do than being decoration for the last few books.

2. Include Ginny, Neville, Luna and other secondary characters from the beginning. Neville comes and goes but Luna just suddenly appears in book 5. She could have been used earlier to colour in the wacky Wizarding World. Ginny needed a lot more character development and shading in to be more widely accepted as a good pairing for Harry. Friends and allies from outside Gryffindor, bonus points if from Slytherin, would have further fleshed Hogwarts out in canon.

3. Harry suffered three straight years of defeat after defeat until he beat Voldemort in book 7. Instead of building Umbridge and then Draco Malfoy of all people up in books 5 and 6, there could be a particular powerful Death Eater that Harry and his friends come into conflict with and manage to defeat. The identity and actions of each senior Death Eater defeated could match with a theme against one of Harry and his friends.
