1. Agree with you on H/G. Develop Ginny as a character. She was awesome in OotP and then she was relegated to only being Harry's love interest in HBP. If she was a better character, I could maybe go for her being with Harry.
2. Harry's training! Yes please! It was clear to the Order that Harry had to fight Voldemort since OotP. Even if they were hoping to let him "stay a child" and not push his destiny on him, he was still in danger. He had survived at the end of GoF by pure accident. Why not teach him a few tricks to at least keep himself safe? They had multiple aurors in the Order. None of them could be bothered to say "Hey Harry! Here try this spell. Might help you stay alive"
3. Have Harry ask for help. I understand that it is a usual "hero" thing for Harry to go off alone in the search of Horcruxes with Ron and Hermione and is essential for the plot. But I find it a bit moronic that he would not ask the Order for help. They didn't have to know why they were looking for things. Just that it is a locket or a cup. Aurors could have been useful in getting the locket from Umbridge. Bill might have had connections at Gringotts.
4. Not name Harry's kid after Snape. I personally love Snape and his arc throught the books but from Harry's perspective, he was still the man who had made his school life miserable. Being on the Light side did not make him less of an asshole. And yet, Harry decided to name his son after the man, forgetting about Remus, Fred and all the other people who died that were closer to him.
