1. A different ending. Either forego the "Harry has to die" arc or give him a heroic death like Leonidas. Don't turn him into Jesus.

2. A better thought-out Battle of Hogwarts. Just the mandrakes alone should be enough to kill the entirety of Voldemort's forces within a few seconds. Perhaps nerf that plant somehow. Have the castle matter more, have strongpoints fought for harder instead of just some battle happening. Take inspiration from the Battle of Stalingrad if you are out of other ideas. Or the Siege of Vienna.

3. No Ron/Hermione. They have three things in common, being Harry's friend, being in Gryffindor and fighting Voldemort. That is not enough to base a relationship on, at least none which lasts longer than a weekend.
