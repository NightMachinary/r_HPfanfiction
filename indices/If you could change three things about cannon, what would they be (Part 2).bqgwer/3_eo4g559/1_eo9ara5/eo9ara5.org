  Let others point out what cruel things Hermione is capable of. It is never spoken about and always swept under the rug

Holy hell this.

Harry wants to ride his new broom? Goes behind his back, no recrimination.

Harry thinks Draco is a death eater? Shuts him down constantly, no recrimination.

Harry isn't a master occlumens after knowing about the art for all of a year? Harps on Harry constantly, no recrimination.

Hermione tricks people into signing a cursed contract that possibly permanently disfigures a teenager? Haha good one Hermione!
