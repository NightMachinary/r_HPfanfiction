I would say;

1. Make Voldemort a better villain. Canon Voldemort is the typical childrensbook villain who is evil, powerful and fails because of his ego. Grindelwald and Umbrige are so much better villains and they aren't even supposed to be the main ones.

2. Give Ginny a better character arc. In a way, she is only there for Harry, which is weird.

3. Let others point out what cruel things Hermione is capable of. It is never spoken about and always swept under the rug.

4. Expand Ron's character arc.

5. I've got the feeling JK Rowling got herself inspired in the last two books from the movies' portrayal of Hermione and Ron. Quite the lost opportunity.

6. And lastly get some representation of the lgbtq community into the books. I dunno, emphasize for example Albus' crush on Grindelwald or something.
