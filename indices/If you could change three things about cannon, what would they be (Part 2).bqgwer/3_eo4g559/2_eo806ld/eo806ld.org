  And lastly get some representation of the lgbtq community into the books. I dunno, emphasize for example Albus' crush on Grindelwald or something.

But why though? Generally speaking the magical world is quite backwards. It would make a lot of sence that they don't accept lgbtq couples and, as such, we don't see them.

In the context of the story it doesn't make sence to get a lot of lgbtq representation nor is it logical that Hermione is black (talking to Rowling here).
