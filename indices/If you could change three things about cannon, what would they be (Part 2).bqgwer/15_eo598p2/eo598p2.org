Remove the epilogue. There was so much potential for post war Harry Potter. I have always disliked the way the series ended up so neatly. The world should have been a bit of a mess. I've always felt robbed by the epilogue's 'and they lived happily ever after.'

More of Harry's parents. Flitwick passing on some of Lily's old charms essays to Harry and them making more sense to him than Hermione or the textbook. I'm not after pranks or any of that, frankly I find it annoying and a reason to close the story when I read it but I would like to see Harry picking up bits of magic from them. James' annotated transfiguration books or something. Just making Harry a bit better of a wizard in small ways and fleshing out the world a bit more.

Have the troll kill Hermione. Removes one of the most obnoxious characters and drives home to Harry that the magical world is dangerous. Opens up for more adventure and less Hermione read it in a book as a plot device.
