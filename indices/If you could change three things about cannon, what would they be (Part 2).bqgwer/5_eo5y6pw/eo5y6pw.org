Hm, let's see. I would...

1) Have more competent and well-balanced adults. I understand why so many of them weren't, but there's a point where the number becomes a little silly. I'd give the surviving ones a boost, have a couple more survive - in particular, have Barty Crouch Jr., who I'd have either escape or spying as Moody. He would have made things a lot more challenging for Harry and the Order, which is probably why JKR shoved him out of the way. But it was a huge wasted opportunity, IMO. Particularly since, having been so careful and methodical all year, I find it very out of character for him to randomly lure Harry away and start monologuing. Also, I realise that not everybody is going to have the same level of maturity or handle things in the same way, but, for example, Lupin's behaviour (Best friend's kid entered into a death match against his will? Should I write? Nahhhh. / OHYAY I'm no longer alone. ...Better abandon them and go off on my own, then.) to be highly irritating. And don't even get me started on Snape.

2) Dial back Harry's shinies a bit. - The youngest Seeker in a century, possessor of multiple unique and mythological items, Parselmouth etc. I realise some are required for the plot - the ones I would keep, even if they ended up adjusted a touch, - and he's the protagonist and all, but honestly, sometimes it seems like a bit much. I'm much more interested in a hero who wins despite being extraordinarily ordinary. Actually, I'd allow some of the other characters a little more involvement in general. Not to the point where they take over, but we don't even know the official canon names of the other two girls in Harry's year. One hundred and ninety nine chapters and we don't even get their names.

3) Pairings and the names of their kids. I would not have almost everybody end up with someone they went to school with and I would change many of the latter. Snape does not deserve someone to be named after him and I'm a little dubious about Albus also at times.
