1. Harry/Luna

2. The tasks in the Triwizard Tournament get changed to the Jbern ones.

3. Nicolas Flamel plays a bigger role. The most criminally underutilised character in the entire series, by a wide margin - and when they finally did use him, they turned him into a fuckin joke that doesn't even make sense, the Philosopher's Stone is supposed to produce an elixir of life, not turn you into a bone-man who breaks at the lightest touch.
