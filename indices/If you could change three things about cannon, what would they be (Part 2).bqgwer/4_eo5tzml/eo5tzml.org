1. Most importantly: the series is presented from the start as though it's a coming of age story about a young wizard who, by learning, going through formative events, and growing up, will eventually defeat the great evil villain. Instead, in the last two books, Harry becomes an almost complete puppet in Dumbledore's extremely convoluted plan, even to the point where Dumbledore is basically running the show even after he's died. I would either make it into the coming of age story we expect, with Harry slowly growing in power over time so he can believably defeat Voldemort, or I'd make Dumbledore's role in the last couple of years much more explicit by presenting him carefully laying the groundwork /and/ somehow involving Harry enough in it that Harry isn't just a marionette for a dead man. Either way, Harry should be much less passive and much more the conscious and involved agent of Voldemort's doom.

2. If the real desire is to have Ginny become Harry's believable love interest, she needs to be a real character. If you're not willing to give her enough space that the reader actually knows what her personality is like and why Harry might like her, then pair Harry with someone like Luna or Hermione who /does/ play a significant enough role in the story that we know them well. Or, don't have a pairing at all. But please, if you're going to pair the main character with someone, let us understand why they find their love interest interesting.

3. The plots in the series are often pretty terrible. Just a few examples that have always stuck in my craw.

   a. In Chamber of Secrets, no one, among all the experienced expert wizards in the castle, can figure out that the problem is a basilisk? No one? Really?

   b. In Goblet of Fire, Fake Moody could have handed a portkey to Harry to kidnap him and get him to Voldemort any time over the course of the academic year, and instead is operating an insanely complicated plot to have Harry win the Triwizard tournament just so that he'll touch a portkey at the end when he wins. This is silly. Hell, Fake Moody could have just stunned him and stolen some of his blood at any time, too. (The entire Triwizard tournament is silly; it's supposed to be deadly, but a sense of real danger isn't there through most of it, the events are kind of lame (except maybe the dragon) and the rules are silly, plus everyone is cheating with inside information.)

   c. In Order of the Phoenix, we presume the adults/experienced wizards all know about veritaserum, pensieves, etc., but no one tries doing something like getting a reporter to look at Harry's memories or having him interviewed under veritaserum or any such? No one at the ministry wants to try that either? Sure, maybe we claim they could all have been faked, but they would probably go a long way towards convincing people of what is going on. We have to assume that in a world where people can look at other people's memories that this would be done routinely when something important is witnessed by a lone individual. Furthermore, 80% of the plot is driven by idiocy. Dumbledore knows more or less what's going on with the prophesy held at the ministry but never bothers to tell Harry enough, Harry never talks to Sirius (who is supposedly a father figure) with his mirror, etc.

   d. I could go on and on about the plot, but I won't, I've said enough...
