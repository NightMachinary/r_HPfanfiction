On point 3b, the reason a random object wasn't made into a portkey is that, aside from it probably not being possible to create or bring in unauthorised ones for security reasons, Voldemort's return was meant to be a secret. If Harry had just vanished one day, people would have noticed. Whereas, even if Harry escaped, he'd have returned with no real proof, because memories can be tampered with and veritaserum can be overcome with occlumency. Memories and beliefs are sometimes just mistaken as well. I think the plan was for Harry to be sent back dead and people to presume that something in the maze got him, or for somebody else to become him and go back in his place. Barty Jr could have either continued as Moody and spied - remember, Voldemort thought Snape had abandoned him at that point - or at some later point, taken over as Harry. It could only have been him or Pettigrew. No other Death Eater aside from Snape really knew him. The others I'll give you.
