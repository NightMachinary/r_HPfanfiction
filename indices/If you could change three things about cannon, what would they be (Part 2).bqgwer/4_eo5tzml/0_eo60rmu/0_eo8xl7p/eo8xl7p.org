  On point 3b, the reason a random object wasn't made into a portkey is that, aside from it probably not being possible to create or bring in unauthorised ones for security reasons, Voldemort's return was meant to be a secret. If Harry had just vanished one day, people would have noticed. Whereas, even if Harry escaped, he'd have returned with no real proof, because memories can be tampered with and veritaserum can be overcome with occlumency

This makes no sense. Voldemort intended to kill Harry after the ritual and had no worries about him escaping, and it makes no difference to secrecy whether he's kidnapped mid-year or at the end of the year. He could have been sent back dead at any time, and even if he disappeared, there would be no particular reason to believe Voldemort was responsible. Whether he was kidnapped mid-year and escaped or kidnapped at the end of the year and escaped, the same rules would apply to any story he told about his absence. Thus, this hypothesis explains nothing.
