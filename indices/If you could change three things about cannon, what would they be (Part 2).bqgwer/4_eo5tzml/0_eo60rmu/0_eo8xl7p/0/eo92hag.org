He could have been sent back dead at another time, sure. But if he just doesn't turn up to Charms one day and someone finds him, I don't know, lying out in the corridor when the lesson is over, then it'd be investigated and Voldemort could have lost 50% of his confirmed supporters and the potential for the gathering of further information. Whereas, if it happens in the maze (or at least in the second task) there wouldn't necessarily be one, or at least not such an in-depth one, because to most people the cause of his death would have obviously been something in the task itself. It would ruin the reputation of the Ministry and of Dumbledore himself. I suspect this is a part of why the third task specifically was selected. - More witnesses to Dumbledore's failure. We also don't know how that potion was made or how long it took to brew. Some potions, some ingredients even, can only be used or collected at certain times. It's all speculation until JKR gives us more information, but a lack of information doesn't necessarily mean that the plan didn't make sense. We just haven't heard all of it yet.
