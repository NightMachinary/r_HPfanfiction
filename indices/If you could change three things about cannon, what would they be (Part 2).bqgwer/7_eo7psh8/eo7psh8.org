1. *Giving Ron an emotional arc*.\\
   At the start we saw his biggest desire was to achieve not just what any of his brother accomplished, but to do all of it. Head Boy with the Quidditch Cup getting all the adoration. So, essentially he starts off measuring himself based on other's achievements.\\
   He should've gone through a journey of self discovery and finding his own worth that doesn't compensate his brothers or his family member's have already done.\\
2. *Team Balancing.*\\
   Oh you know? Like not just having one member of the team doing all the work while others just hang around moping. Each of the three friends should have something unique of themselves that the adventure required. Hermione's thinking, Harry's instincts, Ron's... well, it should've been common sense, but Hermione gets that as well. Go figure.
3. *Harry stepping up to be the hero.*\\
   /"When you can do the things that I can, but you don't, and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you."/ - Peter Parker.\\
   Yes, I know, JK wanted Harry Potter to be an everyman. An everyman who also happened to be the youngest seeker, an almost prodigy in flying and defence and the youngest to cast corporeal Patronus.\\
   Harry's arc should be about him getting better. Not awesomely powerful mind you, but he should at least be trying to get to a better place. Otherwise we wouldn't have a last minute save from Dobby with gillyweed.\\
   This will also put forth a good message about how if people start to act more responsible then things can get better.
