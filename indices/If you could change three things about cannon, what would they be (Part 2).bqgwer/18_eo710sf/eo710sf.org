1. Harry and Hermione should have ended up together, possibly being a couple from the earlier book (3rd, 4th book maybe ?). Ron doesn't really serve a purpose in the story anyway so it's fine if he stays celibate.
2. The fights are made less boring somehow. Idk includes guns maybe ? I can't understand why the wizards never use any.
3. Change the setting to america.
