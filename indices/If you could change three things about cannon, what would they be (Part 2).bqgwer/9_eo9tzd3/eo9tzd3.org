I spent a long ass time writing an answer here and then the reddit app closed when I accidentally hit the home button because my phone has the RAM of a dying chihuahua so here's the abridged version:

1. Rebalance the trio: make Ron the sociable, charming one and keep Hermione as being hideously socially inept as per her introduction. In the later books, Hermione is constantly explaining social implications to Harry and Ron, and honestly, the whole thing comes across as Rowling going "lul boys r dum and Get It (tm)!" Honestly, and I'm really showing my age here (I'm just shy of 23, for the curious), it makes me think of Shoes. Y'all remember Shoes? With Kelly? Anyways, there's this point in the song where Kelly just says "stupid boys, stupid boys, let's get some shoes, let's party," and every time I think about Hermione (the character who introduced herself by saying "hi, I'm a bossy know it all with no tact"), say, carefully breaking down Cho's complex and volatile emotional state for the Dumb Guys, I'm taken right back to fucking 2007. Or was it 2008? God, I'm old.

2. Don't do Harry/Ginny. Assuming that we're going for relatively minor/realistic adjustments here rather than broad, sweeping changes, Harry/Luna is really the only pair that I would've been happy with as an end game (or is it endgame?) ship, since none of the other female characters would've really made sense and none of the male characters were ever on the table, but him hooking up with a Slytherin would've been great, albeit not any of the ones we know in canon since they're all either terrible people (every Slytherin student we meet, all of the Death Eaters, Snape, who wasn't a Death Eater by the time the story starts but who spent his adult life abusing children) or old (Slughorn, the only explicitly adult Slytherin character who never joined the Death Eaters (also Snape stans don't @ me I know he defected but that doesn't change the fact that he willingly joined them, and the only reason he left was that they threatened someone (probably the only someone) that he personally cared about, and he was 300% willing to let her husband and infant son die if it meant she would live. Also it was insanely hot today and my apartment is still 80+ degrees and I'm not in the mood for your shit.)).

3. Give us a clearer picture of who Lily was as a person. In canon, she's more of an unimpeachable symbol of perfect maternal love than, like, a person. We learn a fair amount about James, we get to meet his closest friends, hell, PoA was more about the Marauders than it was Harry. Lily doesn't really get that, though. The only people who really talk about her are Hagrid, who adored her, Slughorn, who adored her, and Petunia, who resented her but is also an abusive prick who is never once treated as a reliable source of information on anything, much less something about which she's so obviously biased. I think the thing that best sums up my issues with the unequal portrayals of the Potter parents is how people compare Harry to them:

When Harry goes after Ron in PoA, Sirius says "I thought you'd come for your friend. Your father would have done the same for me." James' closest friend is directly and favourably comparing Harry to his father. It also makes explicit the parallel between Harry and Ron's friendship and James and Sirius' that the book has been building up ever since it revealed that Sirius, as movie!Harry is wont to tell us, WAS THEIR FRIEND!

Meanwhile, in DH, Snape rants that Harry is "his father, all over again," and Dumbledore counters "in looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother's." Here, Dumbledore is telling Snape something very obvious that he's too selfish and stubborn to realise, and Harry isn't even present. The line also serves to foreshadow Harry's sacrifice and the protection it gives the people defending Hogwarts, yes, but it doesn't really tell us anything new about Lily.

Honourable Mention: don't treat dark magic as inherently evil. Harry uses it all the time in the later books with basically no consequence (dude successfullyâ€‹ casts the fucking Imperius Curse on his first try and when the guy tries to fight it off, he's all "OHP GUESS I DIDN'T DO IT STRONG ENOUGH," and just casts it again like it ain't no thang), but someone liking or being interested in dark magic is somehow a mark against their character? I don' geddit.
