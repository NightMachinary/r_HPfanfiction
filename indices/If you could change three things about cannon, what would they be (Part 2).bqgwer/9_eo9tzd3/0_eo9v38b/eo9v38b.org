I completely agree with how fucking hot it is and I love your points. Only things I disagree with are as far as Ron goes I never found him particularly charming, he is more of the clueless type who has NO idea on how to talk to women with major jealousy issues. But I COMPLETELY agree that Hermione should not be some kind of social god when she only has two male best friends and her only female friend is her male friends sister! Makes no sense, she's supposed to be book smart and not socially smart. It would've worked well if the magical world was slightly more medieval and Ron knew all about the proper greetings and social interactions that way, otherwise I don't think Ron even gave af enough to try being charming, he kind of just expected people to like him.

And yeah Snape is a slime ball who deserves no redemption in my eyes, I really don't think I have to even explain why, you seem like minded on the subject. As far as romance goes, it probably wasn't necessary PERIOD because I think the whole friendship thing actually worked incredibly well, which is odd for me because I generally only read fics with some kind of pairing, but JK built their friendship so well it could've stood alone.

And yeah Harry's parents

James: pranks, smart, funny, social god Lily: smart, kind, Hermione basically

You're telling me that if you had an orphaned boy, and you knew his parents well, they were your best friends, your students, or anything! You wouldn't tell him all about them!! Let alone never even been asked! Their whole lives have been categorized from their traits, rather than their actions and it's total crap. I could've gone without vivid descriptions of Harry and Ron bullshitting their way through divination (albeit it was incredibly funny) and have actually fleshed out the world and characters a lot more...

Well I guess that gives us a reason for Fanfiction, thanks for the reply!
