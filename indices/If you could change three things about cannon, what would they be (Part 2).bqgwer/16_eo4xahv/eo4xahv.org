1. H/Hr instead of H/G, imo H/G only really suits as a pairing if Ginny was "added in" with the Trio for a lot more than we see in canon. Alternatively it could also work if there was focus on how "broken" they were due to Riddle's influence via horcrux.
2. The whole walking to death thing should not have happened imo and is one of the stupidest things i've seen in canon. IMO they should've baited the brother wand effect then have every able person blasting Riddle with AK's especially Neville as we could make the case that he was also marked (emotionally) by Riddle and the DEs
3. The Complete lack of training for Harry. I mean the entire plan for Riddle's destruction hinged on him being the one to kill Harry. Suppose Riddle does the smart thing and after countless failed attempts and destroyed Horcruxes decides to say fuck hubris and tells the DEs to just kill everybody and bring back Harry's body
