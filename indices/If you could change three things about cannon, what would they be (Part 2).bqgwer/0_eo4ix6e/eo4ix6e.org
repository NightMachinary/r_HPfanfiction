The excess letter "n".

In seriousness:

*Change #1: fix Harry's character arc in HBP to restore the hero's path*

Consists of:

- Making Harry take to non-verbal magic instinctively, in the same way that he was naturally good at resisting the Imperius.

- Removing the mentions of Harry's increasing struggles with his classes, replace them with mentions of his classes beginning to make sense.

- Showing Harry learning the combat spells and the campsite protection spells which he is using in DH.

- Having Harry learn things from the HBP Potions book so that he actually gets better at Potions rather than simply following different recipes and learning nothing.

*Change #2: More war*

Consists of:

- Having Harry work his way up to Voldemort, defeating a primary Death Eater antagonist in each of OotP and HBP. This showcases Harry's progression but also adds more depth to the Death Eaters.

- Fleshing out the specific actions Voldemort is taking to gain control of the Ministry, and the counteractions the Order is taking.

- Emphasising the search for allies, including at least one ally who is gained via less-than-noble means.

*Change #3: Alternative climax*

Harry's realising that he's a horcrux and walk into the forest is perfect as the emotional climax to the series. But the physical climax needs some work. There needs to be a better way in which Voldemort is in fact defeated, ideally directly connected to Harry's stint in limbo, destruction of the scarcrux, and return to life.

"Harry gains Voldemort's magical skills by absorbing the horcrux" is a curbstomp premise which removes conflict when it comes at the beginning of a story, but I do actually think it would make a satisfying /ending/ to the series, and reasonably foreshadowed - the multiple times Harry is said to be like Tom Riddle, the fact that he has already gained some of Voldemort's powers (parseltongue), the prophecy describing them as equals, and then the realisation that Harry is a horcrux.
