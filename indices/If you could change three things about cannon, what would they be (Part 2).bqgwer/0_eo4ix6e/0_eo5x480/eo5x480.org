I've vaguely thought about some of these ideas before in a fanfic, but put all together they make a coherent and ideal alternative narrative.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry gains Voldemort's magical skills by absorbing the horcrux" is a curbstomp premise which removes conflict when it comes at the beginning of a story

In canon Voldemort is so much more powerful and skilled than Harry that it's actually unbelievable that Harry could win. Harry absorbing Voldemort's skills could power him up to a place where he's more reasonably close to Voldemort while still appearing weaker due to additional scruples etc that hold him back in a way that Voldemort doesn't.
