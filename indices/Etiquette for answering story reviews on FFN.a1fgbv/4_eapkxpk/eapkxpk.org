I think it's just good manners to thank reviewers by pm, after all they don't have to take the time to do it and most readers don't bother. Mind you I hardly ever get reviews so it's easy for me to do. If I was ever in the happy position of being inundated I suppose it might be more difficult but I think I'd still make the effort.
