I'll pm someone with the title "review reply". That's pretty much all there is to it. It's up to you whether or not you want to answer them, but I will generally say it's not really worth it to try and assuage people.

Answer reviews in a story chapter is a big enough peeve of mine that I will actually stop reading a story because of it.
