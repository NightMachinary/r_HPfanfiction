For a fairly dark portrayal, I've read about half of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/]]), which is well crafted but I gather that it may not have a particularly happy ending. Severus intercepted Peter Pettigrew and learned what he'd done, then snatched Lily away before Voldemort arrived, and so Voldemort won. Lily has been Obliviated of the memories of James and Harry, and is Severus' servant whom he treats as kindly as he can get away with (but still keeps locked up).

For one where he has a dark past but more hope for the future, I'm a fan of linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). There are several stories where he goes back from his canon death to his teenage years to try again, but this one is my favourite. Bear in mind it's very long, and not yet complete but updating monthly.
