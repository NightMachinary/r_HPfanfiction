I know you're looking for a full length fic probably, but this short missing scene on Snape - when he goes to plead for Lily's life from Voldemort - is an exceptional addition to the character! It's only a small read but I truly love how in-character it is, he's horrendous without meaning to be and the mental gymnastics - oof.
