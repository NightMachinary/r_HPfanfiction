Judging by your request, I think you would like this one the most out of Snape fics I like: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions)

Snape never truly becomes "nice" in it, but isn't the devil either. And he has a much better relationship with Harry, even if they're never actually /friendly/.
