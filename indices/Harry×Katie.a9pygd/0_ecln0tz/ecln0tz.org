Harry/Katie is a fairly popular pairing idea. I know I and many others have asked for recommendations in the distant past with little success. And yet there are still precious few fics even today that have the pairing (unless it's in a multi-scenario), especially 100k+ ones, so just be forewarned you are unlikely to find much.

I will look through what I have and try and get back to you but to be honest I don't remember a single Harry/Katie that comes close to 100k that I have read.
