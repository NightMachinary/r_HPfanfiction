So in my view, she suffers 1 simple fate. Just like Daphne Greengrass, she is barely there in the books/movies. However, unlike Daphne, she has just enough development to prevent her from being a blank slate and to some degree limiting interesting development.

This is for the most part simply because Katie being in Gryffindor with the main characters means we know more about her house, and because we also know she is heavily into Quidditch, again connecting her to the main character Harry. So she is "sorta" a blank slate, but not as freeing as Daphne for authors, has less potential for interesting directions due to being in the same house as Harry, and with just enough development on the Quidditch front, to cause authors to need to incorporate Quidditch into any story with her (or at least it feels like that).

Now keep in mind I'm not saying this is all true or without grey area, but I suspect it is how she is viewed by many. So she is stuck in a bit of limbo. Not quite developed enough to slot in easily to a story with a preconceived personality and backstory, but also developed just a bit too much to feel like an OC.
