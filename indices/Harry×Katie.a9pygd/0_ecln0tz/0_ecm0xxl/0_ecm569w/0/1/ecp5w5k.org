Have to disagree here. Besides the Quidditch angle, it really not all that relatable to Ginny. (All this holds true for Alicia as well).

Katie/Alicia is Harry's senior (in particular being on the Quidditch team, where she was already established when Harry joined. That gives a relationship dynamic that you really don't see at all in the books).

Katie/Alicia can be used as a wedge to explore the year above Harry&Co, which is relatively undefined compared to Harry's year and 1 year younger. All of them are described as having pretty strong connections to their year. (Compare Ginny's relation with Luna)

The characters fit into the 'half-blood' mold pretty well, which is something you don't really have much in Harry's year to play with.

They never went through the 'fangirl' phase that Ginny went through in the books, and don't have the Chamber mess hanging over them.

And perhaps most important, they are mostly a blank slate.

Honestly, they seem more like a Hermione replacement than a Ginny replacement (Either as a character from a non-wizarding background, or as a 'smart female' character, if you don't want to use Hermione for her character baggage.).
