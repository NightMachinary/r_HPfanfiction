  Harry has just seen Snape kill Dumbledore in the Astronomy Tower. An event that drastically changed his life. Harry is determined that despite the loss of Dumbledore that he wants to still be with Ginny. What new adventures await Harry and Ginny in the summer and year to follow. Post HBP, Cannon divergence, AU. A/N This is my first attempt at writing a story. Please be somewhat kind.... This is my view of the Harry Potter world and I hope to share some of it with you. Comments feedback are welcome please just make them constructive. At least for a while I will be active in responding. My goal *crosses fingers* would be to be able to update bi-monthly at least for a little while until i get stuck.
