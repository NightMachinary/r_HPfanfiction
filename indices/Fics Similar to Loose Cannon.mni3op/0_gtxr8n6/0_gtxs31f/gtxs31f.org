I just like that it actually feels alive and like a real world thats more than just what we see on an everyday basis. The quidditch is also fun and I like Harry actually having a good time and doing what we wants. I feel like you gave up on it too early. It makes sense why he would turn kind of obnoxious and arrogant. His job is mostly him talking shit on people while trying to catch the snitch. If he does that for hours on end 6 days a week it's bound to slip out into his everyday like accidentally. It doesn't even happen for long and he eventually stops the taunting
