Maybe you're right. I'm a bit too impatient with fics and books I'm reading and the slightest things put me off reading them. I'll probably give it another go. And for what you are looking for, it's actually quite hard to name fics like that. I love linkffn(A Black Comedy). It's fun. Also linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes; Kicking Gotham; Toppling Heroes) are good.
