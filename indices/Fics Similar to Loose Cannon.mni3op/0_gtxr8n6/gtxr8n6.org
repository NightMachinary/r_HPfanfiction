I read some of it. The idea was interesting, but at the point where that guy warned Hermione that Harry for some reason would become arrogant and they have to prepare for it I gave up on the fic because it sounded dumb.

What do you like about it. The background about the wider wizarding world? Harry not getting married and popping out babies immediately after Hogwarts and actually living a little? Harry becoming a Quidditch player? Tell us that and we can help you.
