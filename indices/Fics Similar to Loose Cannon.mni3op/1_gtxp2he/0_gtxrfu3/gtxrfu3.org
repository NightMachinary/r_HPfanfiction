I don't even know how to describe it honestly because there's so much. When it starts Ginny has recently broken up with Harry, maybe a few months before it starts. The Daily Prophet prints an overheard conversion between George and Harry about how he's going to quit his Auror training and become a league seeker for the Cannons, only they were joking and Harry had no intention of doing that. But after thinking about it he decides to give it a go and he's actually really good at it. From then on the story is basically a genius mix of side stories involving endorsement deals, Harry struggling to come to terms with all the left over trauma he's had from the war, members of the Black family that get rediscovered after Harry fixes the Black family tapestry after becoming head of house, and many other amazing things. Oh and he has a bunch of relationships with different witches and a muggle.

Theres just so much to the story and I couldn't get enough of it. I've seen people complain about it needing to wrap up soon, but honestly it doesn't feel like it needs to for me. It's great. I just love the atmosphere of the story
