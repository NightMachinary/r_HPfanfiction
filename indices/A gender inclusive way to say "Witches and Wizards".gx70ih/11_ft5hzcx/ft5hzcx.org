The ones I have seen before have already been discussed, so here's a needlessly technical one.

From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Thaumaturgy is the purported capability of a magician to work magic or other paranormal events or a saint to perform miracles. It is sometimes translated into English as wonderworking. A practitioner of thaumaturgy is a "thaumaturgus", "thaumaturge", "thaumaturgist" or "miracle-worker".

(Of the others, I don't like wix either. Magician would be my choice for non-gender-specific while still being humanist.)
