Actually I just fucked up in editing it so many times and forgot to copy and paste the part where I mention how much comes from Dresden. Thanks for saying something.

I'm not saying that I think that Rowling's magic system is flawed because while yes we see that there's more to magic than what we see, I enjoy a fleshed our magic system(and I assume other people do too.) a lot of the things I put down are directly related to different things in canon that aren't explained, they just are. This is a post I made to see what kind of fleshed our magic system there can be in Harry Potter.

Yes not everyone is studious but we are told that Aurors who are dark wizard fighters have trouble with the patronus. This gives a possible explanation of why that is.

JKR left the world building vague, is it wrong to try and see how many gaps can be filled?

Casters tiring(especially if it's made so that with practice you can go on for longer) means that pitched battles suddenly are a lot more dangerous for everyone involved.

Another trope that has been done many times and often in a way that makes (me at least) one thing think “ok but why not do that same type of thing but with magic instead of spending so much time learning to use a sword effectively. If you just make it so wizards can cast endlessly, why would they need
