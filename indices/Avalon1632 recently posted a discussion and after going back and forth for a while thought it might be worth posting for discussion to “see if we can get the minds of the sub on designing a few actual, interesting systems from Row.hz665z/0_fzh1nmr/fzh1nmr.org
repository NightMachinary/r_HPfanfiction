So essentially, you rip off Dresden magic mechanics, and call it an "improvement on Rowling's magic system". At least credit where you got your ideas from. Going to be honest, it seems like a pointless nerf to HP magic with little improvements for literary purposes. HP magic isn't just incantation and wand movement or they wouldn't need to go to school.

Rowling is subtle with her world-building. She doesn't always spell everything out for her authors. There's nuance that can be missed. Schoolchildren write essays, read books on magical theory, and there are research journals for individual magic subjects. It's clear that theory is an important part of magic.

The disparity in canon is easily explained. Not everyone is intelligence and studious. Not everyone goes to school and comes out with the same skills and base of knowledge. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, and Sirius don't have affinities for only a subject. The most skilled wizards are good at all of them. Sure, some may prefer a particular branch but they aren't weak in others. Many people can't cast shield charms because they're out of practice and weren't that good in school anyway.

I do believe that magical strength is a trait analogous to phenotypic strengths in canon. I don't think nerfing magic by having casters tire is an improvement.

Potions seem useful because while wand magic may be better in some regards, you also can't cast a charm for better luck.

Magic is HP is already fairly symbolic. Point number 5 is just rationale for the Laws of Magic in Dresden.

Seriously though, edit your post to credit Butcher.
