I very rarely leave reviews, personally, because I always try to be fair with any criticism, and that's a tricky proposition when dealing with amateur writing that someone's doing in their spare time. If I were reading a professionally published book from which the author was turning a profit, I'd have no trouble saying stuff like "this scene doesn't flow; it really needed another couple drafts," "this exposition is unnecessary; save it for your notes," or "this character adds nothing; cut them out and save your readers some time," but I feel awful saying stuff like that to someone who's simply writing for the enjoyment of it, so I just kinda don't.
