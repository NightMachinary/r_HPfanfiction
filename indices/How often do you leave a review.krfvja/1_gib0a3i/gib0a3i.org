Most of the time, I review every multichapter story I like. I rarely, if ever, comment on fics I didn't like, or fics which in my opinion, have some serious flaws (grammar, characterisation, pacing, plot). If it's WIP, I try to leave a comment in every chapter. If it's complete then, I usually post one, long review at the final chapter.

One-shots that I loved, I usually bookmark, and sometimes I leave a comment.
