I try to leave at least one review on a story every time I read it.

If it's a chapter story then usually I power through it and have read 6 chapters before I've even realised so... So if I'm reviewing it's usually an apology and a summary of what I liked so far. Then always one big happy rant at the end.

There's some stories, especially one shots that I love rereading and if you go to the comments section its 3/4 comments of me from various dates going "I cried again!!"
