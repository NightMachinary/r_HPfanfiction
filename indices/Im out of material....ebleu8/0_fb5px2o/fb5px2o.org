I'm not sure what you've already read, but I can recommend some of my favorites in a variety of genres: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville; Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes; The Augurey by La-Matrona; Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm; Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof) are all complete. Linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) are also quite good and complete.

I also love linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) although it hasn't updated recently. Linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) is a good fem!Harry that is in progress.

Hopefully some of these are new to you and sound interesting!
