If you're talking about the flagged violation at the top of the thread, that's because I used the word 'smut' in my little description disclaimer thing (I asked the Mods about it). It flags anything with any kind of synonym or slang like that so the mods can look it over for approval or not.

+If it's deleted a fic, I was asleep and missed it completely, sorry. English time here. :D+

EDIT - Oh, right, I didn't see your other comment. That's the fic I mentioned at the top, isn't it? Thanks for finding it! If it isn't, thanks for the rec! :D
