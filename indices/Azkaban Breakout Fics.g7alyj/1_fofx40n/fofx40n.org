Well you could try Don't Look Back in Anger by RobSt. In this story Harry is sent to Azkaban for "murdering" Cedric at the end of the 3rd task. He ends up "spirit roaming" eg leaving his body to escape the painful memories the dementors raise. It turns out that Luna can do this as well. The fic is a Lunar Harmony and is 140K words long.
