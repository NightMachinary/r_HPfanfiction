I have not read this one, but I've never really been off of AO3 and FFnet, so that's not terribly surprising. Also, your fic violates rule 8, if the tags are right. I'd recommend editing out the link to avoid the Mods bringing you up on it. Is the smut skippable without losing plot or overmuch character development?
