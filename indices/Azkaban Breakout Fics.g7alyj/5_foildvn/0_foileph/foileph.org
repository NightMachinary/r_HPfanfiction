  Sirius read: “Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes Permanent Hair Color, Flame Red. Colors ALL hair. Lasts until antidote is taken.” The meaning sunk in. “I'm not living the rest of my life as a ginger!”“You have something against gingers?” asked Fred menacingly. “He's just intimidated,” said George before Sirius could reply. “Let us assure you, Mr. Padfoot, that you are worthy of this, the most noble of hair colors, Gryffindor red. We based this color on our own hair, so you know we endorse it.”“It's more carrot orange, really,” observed Sirius. “Close enough.”“And the freckles...” Sirius said. “Don't worry, we have a potion to provide those too.” George tossed him a second vial. “Oh...good,” said Sirius hopelessly, catching it. It was pink with orangish-brown speckles. “You'll look very different without the trademark Black hair and alabaster complexion,” said Fred. “Trust us, changing your coloring is the least annoying way to change your appearance. Polyjuice is such a hassle,” said George.“Have you ever tried to pick your nose when it's not the shape you're used to? Difficult, very difficult.”
