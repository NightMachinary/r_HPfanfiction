I mean my general concern would be: what makes your story original? What makes it worth reading? Because as it goes now you've just listed a bunch of tropes - it sounds basically like every other mediocre Slytherin!Harry fic. You say yourself that you're disappointed with other fics. How will you make yours stand out?

One note is I'd scrap all nobility/pureblood etiquette lessons. It's boring and grating to read. Introducing alternate wizarding traditions and culture can be nice, but I don't care to read about “persecuted” dark wizards, which is a common theme in those stories. I think Harry delving more into his family history could be interesting if done well.
