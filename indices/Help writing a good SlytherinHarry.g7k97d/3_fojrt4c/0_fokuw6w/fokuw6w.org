  I mean my general concern would be: what makes your story original?

  You say yourself that you're disappointed with other fics.

Good question, most of those I have read, are of poor quality, either in grammar, spelling, or writing wise, with lots of bad tropes, and trying to be edgy.

Most have never really explored the consequences of some changes and have only used those to give Harry more power or to make him even edgier. Also many have bad romance or harems. They give and give without consequence, and often too much that is not useful to the story(10 houses? Billions of Galleons? WTF)

Things I want to explore:

-How would a decent Dumbledore(closer to canon) react to a Harry in Slytherin that seems to be really liking wizarding culture, despise muggles, and enjoys the company of some children who are inadvertently sharing their prejudices(nothing overt at first) with him?

-How would the moldable Harry react to a very different environment and influences?

-How would Harry and Hogwarts react in the Second Year when he is officially the "Heir" of Slytherin but has nothing to with the attacks and only some in his own House believe him.

-Later, how would Voldemort react when his prophesized foil seems to be stealing the heritage he thought unique to him.

In this story I want Harry to embrace his family history more, build up Potter history a bit (Potioneers, soldiers, etc) (and Wizarding culture along with it), and these things to matter to him, for example there will be a Potter Manor, but instead of Avalon 2.0 it's a dilapidated big house that needs a lot work to be restored and safe.

  One note is I'd scrap all nobility/pureblood etiquette lessons. It's boring and grating to read.

Wow, people seem really bothered by those, I guess I will cut back and just cite these happened and focus more on traditions and customs. I also think I was not able to communicate what I mean with etiquette lessons.
