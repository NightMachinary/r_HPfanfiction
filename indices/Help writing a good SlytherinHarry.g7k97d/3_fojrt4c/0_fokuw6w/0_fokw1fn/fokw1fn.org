That all sounds reasonable. I'd be interested in a well portrayed Harry-Dumbledore dynamic without bashing.

Some more things to consider:

- Will you be following the stations of canon?whats the actual plot of the story?
- what are Harry's motivations? What drives his character?
- will it be a seven year story starting in first year? Those can be hard to finish from what I've seen. How much time would you spend on every year?

Good luck with your story. Please link it here when you get around to posting
