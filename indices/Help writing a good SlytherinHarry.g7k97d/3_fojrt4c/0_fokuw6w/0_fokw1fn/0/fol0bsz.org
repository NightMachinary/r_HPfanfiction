  I'd be interested in a well portrayed Harry-Dumbledore dynamic without bashing.
#+end_quote

Yeah, no bashing here, I understand some people can see him as Manipulative, but I think the way JKR wrote him and some plotholes causes this more than the character himself. He is one of my favorites and Mentor!Dumbledore is one of my favorite tropes.

  Will you be following the stations of canon?whats the actual plot of the story?
#+end_quote

Most of the things external to Harry will probably still happen, but the results will be different because Harry will be different. Some new things will happen due to this condition(mostly because Harry will be more mobile during Summers and have more contact with more people)

  what are Harry's motivations? What drives his character?
#+end_quote

At first, the want to belong, while the Dursleys do not torture or beat him or something, they do make him feel very unwelcome, different in bad way and dislocated, so when practically overnight he discovers there's a whole world that will accept him, a world where he has a family(even if they are all gone) that is like him and even distant blood relatives, he just jumps right in.

Of course, over time there will be more things, a sense of duty, honor, care for others, etc, but all will come from this want to belong to something. Sometimes this will lead to bad things too.

  will it be a seven year story starting in first year? Those can be hard to finish from what I've seen. How much time would you spend on every year?
#+end_quote

Well, some years will be shorter than others(like Third Year) while some summers will be longer(without the blood wards after the First Year, he sometimes will have to go abroad and visit other places, so he will have Summer adventures too.

The draft is still very crude(this is why I am asking opinions now, so I can change stuff without losing hours of work), but the outline goes a bit after 1998. As I said this will be a long fic.
