  Voldemort is the direct descendant of Slytherin, not Harry, end of discussion. There isn't a Slytherin name to claim because that name became Gaunt, just like Hufflepuff became Smith

Eh, so that's why it's AU, same reason Harry's grandparents are Charlus and Dorea instead of Fleamont and Euphemia, I always thought the whole parselmouth by Horcrux was stupid, so here Harry is meant to be mirror and foil for Riddle in this. And in the AU the line of Slytherin will not be the only parselmouths, it's a rare trait, but happens more in the east or in Greece, still ostracized in Britain though.

Harry's line is through a bastard line that mostly squibbed until his mother, but magic doesn't care for marriages, it cares for blood.

The Gaunt line from which Voldemort comes is from a second son, he is not of the firstborn's blood, they got the money and properties because the firstborn didn't have /legitimate/ children, but not the ring because the line was still alive, and Voldemort hid this from those in the know(he never found out the line though). So the genealogy is a bit different.

  'Lord Potter' and others being called 'Heir Malfoy' or 'Heiress Greengrass'.

That always sounded weird to me, I believe this comes from Japanese culture because IIRC there is a situation where they put 'heir' at the front. So it must have spread from Naruto fics or something.

I can see adults calling children Lord in Game of Thrones, not Harry Potter, and yes etiquette is mostly good manners from high society. I can see adults calling others Lords if they actually have the proper title OR hold an office that calls for it, but it's mostly Mr.

  Number 3 is very iffy. I'd advise you not touching upon this before at least sixth year. Using two wands simultaneously is useless if you can't cast silently and is in no way like wielding two guns. I appreciate more what the movies seem to imply with Lucius Malfoy using his cane as a protective item, but that's just my opinion.

I didn't say two guns, it's actually contrary to that, I said like a parrying dagger, so for blocking or parrying, not for attacking. I may drop this if I don't like how the fights and duels flow.

And it's not easy to use, it takes training and is magically exhausting, it allows one to attack and defend at the same time, or attack and defend in different directions, but if you don't practice it's unwieldy, by the time Harry reads about it only people like Amelia Bones and Kingsley Shackelbolt along with few others can use it, Harry's grandfather used it in the Grindelwald War, that's what picks his interest, he learns the same style but without the second wand because 1. he doesn't have a proper second wand(it's different from a regular wand) and 2. he can't cast protego and variants silently until later.

I might actually substitute the whole thing to just being a different style that was particular to Charlus but not James, this idea came while imagining how would a wizard fight if surrounded (and he's not a master who can transfigure and animate stuff to auto block spells or an expert at combat apparition or something)
