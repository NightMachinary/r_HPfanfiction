Advice: /Do not do 4./ If you want to shoot your story in the knees then go ahead. But if you want to be a minimum credible than you will not approach this trope by two thousand miles because not doing so is called /suicide/. Voldemort is the direct descendant of Slytherin, not Harry, end of discussion. There isn't a Slytherin name to claim because that name became Gaunt, just like Hufflepuff became Smith. Go with the grandparents' journal, but nothing else you said about this point.

Number 3 is very iffy. I'd advise you not touching upon this before at least sixth year. Using two wands simultaneously is useless if you can't cast silently and is in no way like wielding two guns. I appreciate more what the movies seem to imply with Lucius Malfoy using his cane as a protective item, but that's just my opinion.

Pure-blood manners don't really make sense and are grating to read. If you want to include good manners, sure, you can also base yourself on Victorian/Edwardian code of conduct for high society, but do /not/ do anything like people call a literal child 'Lord Potter' and others being called 'Heir Malfoy' or 'Heiress Greengrass'. No one does that and no one ever did that. In a civil but not really formal setting like Hogwarts, they would be called Mister and Miss (Noble House Name which isn't their last name).

The rest seems alright, but in the end, it's your call.
