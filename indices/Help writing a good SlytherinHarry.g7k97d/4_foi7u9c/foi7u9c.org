  Yes, he might also get a ring

Standard Head of house ring, Heir ring, and member ring? The whole "magical protections" and all that other stuff is too overpowered in my books. Them being keys/identifiers seems way more in tune with the HP universe.

Please. This alone is interesting. The whole scarcrux = parseltongue thing felt really stupid to me. It being a natural gift feels more... organic than it being a bleedover gift from the horcrux.

And it having actual drawbacks is hilarious. I can see Harry reading the first message on the wall and he just goes "Crap..." and everybody's eyes slowly turn to him at once.

You could also have more people being parselmouths. Have Harry trick people into revealing they are parselmouths. It's a magical gift, it would be hilarious if there was a half-blood and muggleborn who could speak it too.

  *any suggestions*

How are the Dursleys being handled? If you are getting rid of them, you can still keep the "protections". Blood adoption potion. Just hire a squib or someone to take one keyed to Petunia. Still get the protections, but none of the Dursleys. AND! It would probably work better this way than with the outright hate the Dursleys were giving him before. This could also potentially give breathing space from Dumbledore, or have him rethink a bunch of things.
