  Standard Head of house ring, Heir ring, and member ring?
#+end_quote

It will be a fancy signet ring, to seal letters and documents, the magical part of it is that it adjusts it's size and can only be worn by the heir/Head of the House, and can't be forcefully removed. It also doesn't have that nifty ability to hide itself. It mostly serves as a certificate. There is a Potter ring, but it can only be worn by the actual Head(so not a minor) and that's it. Badges of Office, not Lantern Rings.

  And it having actual drawbacks is hilarious. I can see Harry reading the first message on the wall and he just goes "Crap..." and everybody's eyes slowly turn to him at once.

Yes, I always thought most fics don't explore how problematic Harry being in Slytherin can be, and in this one he wears the ring(because it makes him feel connected to his ancestors) since basically day one, so Second Year is worse than in canon(think Aurors showing up to take him for questioning, people leaving throwing dead snakes at him).

  You could also have more people being parselmouths. Have Harry trick people into revealing they are parselmouths. It's a magical gift, it would be hilarious if there was a half-blood and muggleborn who could speak it too.

There will be more, but not in Britain, more to the east and in Greece, I am thinking of having some parselmagic involved, but mostly for healing.

  How are the Dursleys being handled? If you are getting rid of them, you can still keep the "protections".

Well as of now, he is going to leave in the summer before Second Year because he gets sick of them(after learning of his family), he runs to the dilapidated Potter Manor(no instant magical fortress full of house elves here) and claims it as his home(using an old ceremony), inadvertently breaking the wards and giving Dumbledore and himself lots of trouble. A theme will be him restoring the Manor and learning new things while doing it. The lack of wards will have consequences. This can change.

I don't like this whole blood ward thing because it's clearly an excuse, but here it can be useful to teach Harry to not do ceremonies he doesn't fully understand and that rash actions can have unforeseen consequences.
