First suggestion: forget the pureblood manners/etiquette stuff. Maybe this is just me, but I think it usually just adds nothing to the story and just makes the dialogue more grating to read. And it's not like there's any reason in canon to think 'pureblood etiquette' is important. Did Tom Riddle learn about proper pureblood manners in his muggle orphanage? No, but he ruled Slytherin house anyway because he was powerful and ruthless. There's no indication Draco has manners, he's popular in his house because his dad is rich/powerful.

Another popular Slytherin!Harry trope I think you shouldn't include--child marriage contracts. Mostly because its creepy and generally a sign of a badly written story, but it's also completely ahistorical for Britain. The magical/muggle worlds separated around 1700 iirc, and the average age of marriage in England in 1200-1800 was around 25 for women. Child marriage was common in most of the world during that time, but not in Britain.

A Slytherin!Harry trope that should be used more: pagan religious customs/rituals. It can be an interesting way to add to your worldbuilding, and make the magical world seem more magical/mysterious.
