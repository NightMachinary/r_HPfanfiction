  First suggestion: forget the pureblood manners/etiquette stuff. Maybe this is just me, but I think it usually just adds nothing to the story and just makes the dialogue more grating to read.

  A Slytherin!Harry trope that should be used more: pagan religious customs/rituals.

These will go hand in hand, the etiquette stuff will be just at the beginning and basic stuff like proper stance and one or two custom like who offers a handshake or treating ladies.

The pagan religious and customs will be much more important and prevalent.

  Another popular Slytherin!Harry trope I think you shouldn't include--child marriage contracts.

No such thing here, lol, I may have one of the Patil twins commenting on it(it still happens in India) but the "arranged marriage" part in Britain limits itself to frowning upon cousins marrying. Noone here getting in an unbreakable marriage contract. However, feudal societies can be prone to have arranged marriages of adults as part of family alliances and a way to control dowry, I don't think it will fit here, some parents may try to play matchmakers though.
