For me Mandragora goes too far in humanising mandrakes. It makes it hard to believe no one notices that they have some degree of sapience when they make pants for themselves or hunt for worms with spears. It would be more horrifying for me if it was portrayed as if they were a species that never got to a stage where they could show enough sapience and were chopped to bits as babies/children.
