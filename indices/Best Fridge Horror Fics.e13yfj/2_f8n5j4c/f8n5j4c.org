I've actually wondered about the Unbreakable Vow. All we're told (as far as I know) is that you make a promise with a certain spell, incantation, and a witness, and if you break that vow you die. But what caught my attention is that we're never told about /how/ the person who broke the vow dies, and what happens in the case of vague instructions? Gives fic writers a lot of opportunities. I have a small idea right now that plays with that very topic. It's not up yet, I've only thought of it recently.
