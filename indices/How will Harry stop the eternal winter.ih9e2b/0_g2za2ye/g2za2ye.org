The smog rises from the highways tonight

Not a Tesla to be seen.

A kingdom of industrialization

And it's run by gasoline.

The engines roaring like the constant blasts inside

Couldn't keep NOx in, heaven knows VW tried.

Don't let them in, don't let them see!

Be the clean car you always have to be!

Let oil flow! Let oil flow!

Can't cheat on tests anymore!

Let oil flow! Let oil flow!

And Trump believes "Clean coal"!

They don't care that we're going to pay

Let the world heat up

It's all a Chinese Hoax anyway.
