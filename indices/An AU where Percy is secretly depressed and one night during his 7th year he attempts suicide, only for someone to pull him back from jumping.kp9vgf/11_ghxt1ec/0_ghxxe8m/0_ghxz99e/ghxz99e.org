The prompt an sich (the title) didn't mention anything specific. The thing under that is merely how OP planned to write it. In the prompt, Percy is secretly depressed, attempts suicide, gets saved. That's it. In my interpretation, it wasn't really about grades, perhaps not even about Sirius or his brother; he is depressed, feels like a failure of a brother or human being or Gryffindor, and that feeling latches onto any reason, however rational or irrational.
