It was McGonagall, who was patrolling the area

There was a noise above her. Swiftly she looked up, wand already pointing at the source. She relaxed as she recognized the red hair above a pale face.

‘Weasley? What are you doing there?'

Then he jumped (whichever it was) and time stopped.

One part of her was, although she'd never admit to it later, gibbering in terror. Most of her, though, worked through the most effective spells and memories, and automatically she used Dumbledore's spell from when Harry fell off his broom. Percy's descent slowed. But it wouldn't be enough... she shouted a /Locomotor/ spell and moved her wand upwards a bit, then slooowly downwards. It did the trick.

When Percy landed, he looked /furious/.

‘Why didn't you just let me?' he demanded. McGonagall closed her eyes. ‘I couldn't,' she said simply, and then, stern again: ‘come with me.' Percy looked about to protest. ‘/Now./'

He didn't protest.

In her office, she made him a cup of tea and shot off a Patronus to Pomfrey and Dumbledore.

Then, she wasn't sure what to do. Dumbledore was Merlin-knows-where, probably arranging another patrol in her area, so he wouldn't be on hand for this.

‘Chocolate biscuit?'

She winced. It sounded more like a order then a offer.

Percy gulped. ‘Uh, yes, thank you?'

She gave him the tin and began to dig through her drawers in search of Scotch and the good chocolate from Hogsmeade - ever since all those Dementors came she had made a habit to always have some in her office - which she gave him, too. Percy ate as if it was some solemn duty that he had just gotten the honor of full filling.

‘Why'd you...,' she trailed off, not sure how to word it.

He sniffled. She gave him a new cup of tea.

‘It's just...,' he began. ‘It's just IamabouttofaileverythingSiriusBlackwantstokillmybrothersbestfriendandwouldkillhimtooIcanthelpthemwhycantIhelpthemIshouldbeabletoIamaGryffindor -‘

McGonagall was unable to discern much more than ‘Sirius Black' and ‘Gryffindor'.

‘Can you slow down a bit?'

Percy took several deep breaths. ‘Sirius Black is trying to kill my youngest brother's best friend and probably him, too, and I can't help them but I /should/, I am a Gryffindor, I am their older /brother/, I am responsible for not just /them/ but the entire year... and I am failing all my classes, I am /sure/ of it!'

McGonagall sighted. ‘You're /not/ responsible for Harry Potter's safety - /or/ your brother's, for that matter,' she started.
