I'm not sure this is quite true. Wizards seem more hardy in terms of falls from Quidditch but staff still are quick to cast cushioning charms. Neville bouncing was an incident of accidental magic coming from strong emotions which is harder to come by in trained wizards. (Or else you'd see more of it in duels.)

If Percy felt numb or relieved, it's quite possible accidental magic wouldn't kick in. Of course, it depends on how strong his lizard brain impulse to live is.
