Sorry I'm so late, I saw this and got an idea for crack.

With a sad sigh Percy pushed open the common room window to its full length and gazed out at the moon.

Just the sight of the glowing sphere bought regret crawling up his throat.

Despite his best attempts at being a good brother, non of the others respected him, his attempts to thrive academically were looked down on and he had nothing on some of the others boys in the looks department.

He was a waste of space.

The only people who loved him were his parents and that seemed like it only came up when Percy actually came into view, the rest of the time he was more then likely swept away into the recesses of their mind while they focused on the other children.

Taking a breath he leant over and stared at the long drop down. It was as ever-long.

Long enough that to jump from his current height would kill him instantly.

Straightening up he took a deep breath.

This was it. No point hanging around-

Before he could even finish the thought he felt someone rip him away from the frame, sending him stumbling to the cold floor.

With a startled gasp he whirled around to see Oliver Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, leaning over to shut-

-wait.

“O-Oliver?” Percy stuttered as the man climbed up on to the small sill and pushed himself as close to the edge as he could without falling. Upon hearing Percy he whirled round, a vicious look in his eyes.

“That fucker Flint!” He spat.

For a precious second Percy just stared glassy eyed at him before darting to his feet and holding up his hands in surrender.

“Oliver stop-please I-”

“He said he's gonna off himself tonight but /I'm/ gonna do it /first!/-/there he is!/-see ya Percy!”

And with that Oliver Wood threw himself out of the window.

With a cry Percy ran over and looked down, only to immediately regret it upon seeing Oliver explode on the ground into a puddle of red.

Before Percy could do anything, another cry of fury echoed from another tower, looking up Percy just had time to catch a glint of a falling figure and hear the familiar voice of Marcus Flint give a cry of /'Fuck you Wood!'/ Before he too tuned into a red puddle on the floor with an echoing crack.

Percy could do nothing but stare in horror.

Had-had Oliver turned Flint's suicide into a competition?

Had the overly competitive Scot actually made a game out of mental illness?

Swallowing hard Percy wanted nothing more then to pull back and scream hysterically, however another voice made itself known, swallowing his attention.

“Holy shit! Was that Oliver?”

Though he couldn't see him, the shrieking voice of the Ravenclaw captain-Roger Davies was unmistakable.

Percy tried to speak but nothing came out.

“Holy Rowena it was!” Davies filled in, voice as hysterical as Percy felt. “Finally!” “What?!” Percy accidentally cried out, trying to crane his neck up through the window despite fearing it and its drop seconds ago.

“Quidditch cup here I come!” Davies continued almost happily now. Percy just mouthed wordlessly upwards, unbelieving of the Ravenclaws sheer gall. Despite feeling seconds from fainting, another voice, this one from far below and sounding distinctly like the usually cheerful voice of the Hufflepuff captain, Cedric Diggory, made itself known as an angry snarl.

/”Davies you ignorant slut!/
