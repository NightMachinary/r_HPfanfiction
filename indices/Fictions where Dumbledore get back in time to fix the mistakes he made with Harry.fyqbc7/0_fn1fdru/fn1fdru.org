There is that one where he is a great wizard his whole life, and a great person. He's a grandfather to Harry and the next 5 generations of Potters, and he defeats Dark wizards and doesn't meddle in peoples lives. Basically he's a really good guy.

Then he dies of old age and death gives him the option to go into another dimension and take the place of a 'meddling puppet master' dumbledore. (think the worst of Dumbledore bashing)

So he goes back in time in that one, and into another dimension as well.

I'll look through my fanfiction records to see if I can find what its called.
