Well, the problem with this premise is that you get the problem of a benevolent, omnipotent god in miniature. If he retains his canon power, intelligence, and knowledge, then no physical, magical, or social difficulty can pose any sort of challenge toward fixing everything. If he's good, then he has no reason not to do it. You'd have to go geopolitical to make this interesting. And that is /hard/.
