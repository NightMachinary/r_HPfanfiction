Hey, what a coincidence. Just finished reading [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope.]] Fundamentally Harry/Gabrielle. Despite not liking the actual basis for the fic very much, I still thought it was excellent, though perhaps dragged a little near the end. And, of course, all the problems with having a basically Gary Stu Harry and partner, but we're all used to that by now in fics.

Krum/Harry have a great friendship - not /too/ huge a role in the fic, but pretty interesting all the same.
