I can't think of anything that perfectly fits your request, but I'll give you a couple that hit a subset of your asks.

linkffn(The First Day by little0bird) - A truly excellent post-hogwarts, reconstruction fic centered primarily on Harry's experience with moving on with his life.

- Jaded, cynical, and untrusting - Mostly no
- PTSD following Voldemort - Mostly yes
- Golden Trio still close - Yes
- Rebuilding - Yes

linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) isn't as good of a match, but is tonally similar, although much darker in atmosphere. Post-Hogwarts fic about Harry's life as an Auror after his wife, Luna, is killed. One of my favorites, and extremely well written.

- Jaded, cynical, and untrusting - YES
- PTSD following Voldemort - Mostly yes
- Golden Trio still close - 50/50
- Rebuilding - No
