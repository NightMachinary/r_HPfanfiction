I like the post Voldemort political shenanigans in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994). It's strong AU though. As for your criteria:

Not trusting: yes, the situation was extremely volatile after Voldemort's defeat. The Minister was trying hard to undermine the Trio, extremists on both sides were trying to keep fighting, and hostile foreign powers were trying to carry out sabotage.

PTSD: Pretty bad for everyone involved in combat

The Trio was extremely close, especially after Voldemort went down.

Rebuilding: yes, as they significantly reformed Magical Britain's government.
