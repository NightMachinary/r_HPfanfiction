Old, so I don't know how well known it might be, but I figure there's at least some people who haven't read it, and it's so wonderful I just had to share.

The author has a bunch of other amazing stuff on her fanfiction.net account as well as her [[http://ozmafics.livejournal.com/][livejournal]]. I've just been reading her stuff all day and have yet to encounter anything less than awesome.
