Hmm, there are a lot of stories that could fit that, but I can ask around and see. The subscribers on this subreddit don't like Dramione so this will probably be downvoted into oblivion before you get any answers. Are you a member of Dramione FanFiction Forum on Facebook? They have stories categorized by tropes and such that may make searching easier.
