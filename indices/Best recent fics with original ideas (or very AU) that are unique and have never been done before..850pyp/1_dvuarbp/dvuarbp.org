WIP:

linkffn(We, Harry Potter): Harry turns into a five-headed dragon. Fun ensues.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor): Hermione is a Parselmouth, the Sorting Hat is a gossip, Boggarts want to go to school, and the timeline is /so/ wrecked.

linkffn(Why Time-Travel Should Be Illegal, And Other Morals) A very surprising self-insert. The SI comes into the world /as a Muggle/ in the mid-1980's and decides to adopt Harry, send word of the Horcruxes to Dumbledore, and then nope away to Magical Hawaii with Harry and his newly-found wife, a Squib of the Macnair family. Magical Hawaii is well-worldbuilt, the SI and his wife are both complex, non-Mary-Sue characters, and it's overall a very refreshing take on the SI genre. Only warning: some religion (although it's done better than I've ever seen it).
