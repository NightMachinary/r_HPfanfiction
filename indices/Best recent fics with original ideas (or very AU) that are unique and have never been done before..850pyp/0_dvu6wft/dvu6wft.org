The Mind Arts is kind of recent. It stars a Harry Potter who starts using legilimency naturally at a very young age, and how it affects the world around him. Harry is constantly using legillmancy to read his friends and enemies minds, and he uses the information to sort of manipulate them. It's a great fic.
