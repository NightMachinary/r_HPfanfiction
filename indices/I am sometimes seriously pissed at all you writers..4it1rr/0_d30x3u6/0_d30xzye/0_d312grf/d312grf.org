To me, it seems that they're setting up that the Star Wars universe is almost cyclical, in a way. The Phantom Menace parallels A New Hope parallels The Force Awakens. Attack of the Clones mirrors The Empire Strikes Back, and then of course Revenge of the Sith is the dark reflection of Return of the Jedi. Like Maz Kanata said, it's all one war, just in different guises. Sith, Empire, First Order. Republic, Rebellion, Resistance.

Let's examine the main character of each trilogy (assuming Rey is the main of the new trilogy). Anakin knows his parent. Luke knows of one of his parents. Rey knows not of her parents. Anakin was a slave. Luke was a moisture farmer for his uncle. Rey was an independent scavenger. Let's look at the major threats in the first film of each trilogy: Droid army, Death Star, Starkiller Base. Each a technological threat that the villains believe to be overwhelming, but increasing in stakes as time goes on. Hell, let's take a look at how people (Outer Rim people) thought of the Jedi at the start of each trilogy. A Phantom Menace: Known to currently exist. A New Hope: Known to have once existed. The Force Awakens: People thought Luke Skywalker was a myth.

Hell, I just thought of this. Examine the beginning and ending of TPM, ANH and TFA. Diplomatic mission gone wrong. Spy mission posing as diplomatic mission gone wrong. Spy mission gone wrong. Major ceremony, minor ceremony, no ceremony.

Clear arcs and progressions of events and themes exist when you look at the first movies of each trilogy, and I'm also guessing it is going to be the same when looking at the second of each and the final of each.

The Force Awakens being similar to A New Hope isn't a sign of hack writers, but *is part of the point* and was a conscious decision.

I spend a lot of time thinking about Star Wars.
