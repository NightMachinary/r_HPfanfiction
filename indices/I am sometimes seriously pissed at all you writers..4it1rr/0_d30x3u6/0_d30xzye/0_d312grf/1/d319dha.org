Yes, each trilogy can have similarities in that Nietzschean eternal recurrence sort of way, but there's a point where the audience won't accept it because you're shoving the same thematic drivel without analysing context. The SW writers can't keep trying to convince me these people will succeed. I know that sounds weird, but let me explain:

Luke, Leia, and Han succeeded where Anakin, Obi Wan, and Padme failed; they saved Anakin's soul, brought balance to the force in doing so, and destroyed the Empire. They're all bona fide heroes.Twenty to thirty years later, and suddenly The Empire is back even stronger under the guise of First Order? Leia and Han have split up? No one has seen Luke in years, to the point where people aren't even sure if he ever existed?

In other words, the original protagonists failed miserably after Return of the Jedi. Leaving aside that the fate of Luke disrespects the hero's journey Lucas set up for him in the original trilogy, the problem in the new movie is that message is still by-and-large the same as the previous ones: friendship and believing in yourself can help defeat the Sith. Except it can't, as we've seen the actual heroes from the previous two trilogies abandon that and let the galaxy collapse. So both now both Anakin and Luke failed, and now they're trying to convince me that Rey will do what they couldn't? By approaching things exactly the same when faced with similar obstacles?

This is what I mean by no analysis of context: nothing the characters do actually changes anything, but the films don't reflect that theme. The new trilogy (at the moment) isn't some existential series of films centred around the Sisyphean struggle of trying to extinguish evil; it's a romp about friends defeating an Evil Empire, like the original trilogy, and in doing so, it shows the writers don't fully understand the universe they've set up. The similarities to A New Hope may be a conscious decision, but I also think it was a lazy one, especially when there's no nuance to it ("The Death Star destroyed two planets? Fuck it, we'll destroy five, at the same time!").
