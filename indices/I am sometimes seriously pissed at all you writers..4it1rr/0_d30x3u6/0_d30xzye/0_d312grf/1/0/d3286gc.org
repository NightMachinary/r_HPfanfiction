Well, here's how I see it. The prequel trilogy was not very good. They were very widely hated. So much so that in comparison to the widespread opptimisim for the Phantom Menace, it was very cautious opptimisim for the Force Awakens. In order to make up for the sins of the past trilogy, they had to show that they could pull off the same tone and style of the original.

Here's a good metaphor I heard "sure it's not a classic, but it doesn't need to be. This is an old friend who got beat up a little and is just showing you that they're okay before moving on to do better things."
