You're the author? I'm glad it's just hiatus and not abandoned, I just read it thanks to this thread and really enjoyed it. Especially the Nameless part, which I'm happy to say I managed to guess, thanks to a few clues. He's not dead, is he? He will make another appearance?

I also wonder...where did Merlin go? Did...he become Thanos? Because it'd explain his obsession with Death!
