  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/43otdp/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/czjyppq][I've come up with a funny problem recently. I've been reading a lot of rational fiction recently. It's not the only thing I read, but it's been most of it for the past few months. And when I turn back to "traditional" fiction, I find myself criticizing incongruities and poorly planned characters. Mostly in TV shows and movies.]]
