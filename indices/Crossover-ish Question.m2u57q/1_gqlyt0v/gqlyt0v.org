A witcher is just a different name for a monster-hunter, from what I understand (obviously coming with a bunch of other aspects in that universe).

Personally, I think if it's a term that comes up too much, it'd be a bit jarring because it's not the generic term for what they are, but a universe specific one. Eg, it'd be like if writing a superhero group into a story, calling them the Avengers. However, everyone has different tolerances there, and if Witchers were your concept for that fic, perhaps it can make it clearer to readers what it is/read as a homage/reference.

(There's also the question of how the term integrates into the Harry Potter series - from a quick google, the origin for 'Witcher' was to take the polish word for 'witch' (female only) and coin a new term to designate a male witch, essentially. But Harry Potter already /does/ use witch & wizard for the gendered names of magic users, and I'm not sure how well witcher fits into that).
