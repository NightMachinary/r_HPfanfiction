I really wanted to like Soul Scars, but damn, that author has a thing for only women being in relationships together. It's pretty obvious Harry is in that story just to have a reason for the three girls to be intimate together. He referrences multiple times that they don't want to do anything(the girls) without Harry, because they feel like that's cheating, and then they all spend the next 20 chapters getting more and more intimate without him. There was even a whole arc about Daphne being sold by her dad if Harry didn't send a contract for her, when the Goblins pointed out multiple times that he was (by magic and law) already betrothed to all three of them.

That story fucking sucks. Ugh.
