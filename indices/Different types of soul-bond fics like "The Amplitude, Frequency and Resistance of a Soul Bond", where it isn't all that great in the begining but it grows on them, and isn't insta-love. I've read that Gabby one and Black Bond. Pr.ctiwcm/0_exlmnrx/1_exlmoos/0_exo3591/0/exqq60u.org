I really like Soul Scars; I think it's an interesting premise, and I feel like the author has managed a /mostly/ believable story... though I do agree with you about the imbalance in the way their respective relationships have developed so far.

But you are right about him having a thing for F/F relationships. I think almost all of his stories are M/F+ or just straight F/F.
