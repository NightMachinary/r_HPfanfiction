The Bonds of Blood - Harry/Ginny fic that definitely has the "not all that great in the beginning but it grows on them"

Dimensions of the Soul - is another H/G soul bond fic. Though it's been a long while since I've read this one so I don't remember anything about it.

Soul Scars - is definitely a unique take on a soul bond.

The Accidental Bond - Not exactly a soul bond, and it does include Hr, but it is an interesting idea none the less.
