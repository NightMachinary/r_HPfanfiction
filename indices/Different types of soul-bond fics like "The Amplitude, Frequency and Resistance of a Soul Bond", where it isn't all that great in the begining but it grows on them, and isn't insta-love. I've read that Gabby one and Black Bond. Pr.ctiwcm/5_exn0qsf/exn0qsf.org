One of the oldest complete ones, started back in 2006.

And it's Sequel started in 2007.

The premise is that Harry and Ginny were deliberately created by an outside force to be lesser as individuals, but once their souls come together, are greater than any living person could survive. They essentially become one person in two bodies. After their souls merge, they still have individual personalities by virtue of their experiences prior to the merging, but afterwards any experience is shared; and if the duo encounters something that one of them has experienced, they will have the bias that the experienced one has.

The greatest part of this series was not any sort of power fantasy, but two pre-teens trying to find their place among their peers and Ginny's family when they are fundamentally different from them. Where most of the conflict is not by magic duels, but by trying to get their elders to accept that Harry/Ginny are who they are.

Honestly, it's my favorite soul-bond fanfiction of all time(among all fanfiction).

Unfortunately, despite the author's initial desire to go through the entire series, their motivation petered out in 2010, until they finally pushed through finishing Part two in 2013.

Part Two ended on a moderately satisfying conclusion, but the series is currently on indefinite hiatus.
