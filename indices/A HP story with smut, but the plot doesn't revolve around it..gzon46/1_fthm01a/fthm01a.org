Try We're in this Together by zugrian. It's a Harry/Pansy story with both characters being very cynical and doing what needs done (in terms of Voldemortand his deatheaters. Lots of teenage hormones that takes advantage of being at a boarding school with little to no adult supervision. Story starts a few days after Harry comes back from the Chamber of Secrets.
