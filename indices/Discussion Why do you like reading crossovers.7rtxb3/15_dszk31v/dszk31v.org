I don't think I have read a single crossover! So I don't know why! :) Crossovers sound like they would be very frustrating though! Because yes like what if Harry Potter says magic is inside you and you do not get magic drain but then you crossover with a story that does that with its magic? How would you decide which world's rules to apply to both?! Yes that sounds so frustrating to have to decide!!! Unless like you do it where if Harry is in HIS world then his magic works like normal, but if he crosses into the other world then his magical rules change to match it?
