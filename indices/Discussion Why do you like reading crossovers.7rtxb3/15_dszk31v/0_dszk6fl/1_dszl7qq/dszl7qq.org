I don't generally read them either. I skip them though mostly because I am often unfamiliar with the other fandom or I just have no interest in reading something that involves another show/book/movie magic or setting. Also crossovers often involve main characters from other fandoms that I don't care about.

I have read a few but none have been very good either so maybe it's also because I don't expect crossovers to be any good.
