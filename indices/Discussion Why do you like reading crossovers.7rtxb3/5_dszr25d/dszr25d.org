I like the idea of crossovers but I very rarely find good pieces dealing with what I want to see.

For example, I like the idea of a HP/Flash crossover with Draco Malfoy being Julian Albert (same actor). I also like the White Collar/Chuck crossover with Bryce Larkin being Neil Caffrey. And Terminator the Sarah Connor Chronicles/Bäckström series, with John Connor being Gregory Valentine. Now, I never watched past season 2 of Flash but I get what the series is about, I read up on Julian and I like the idea of the universes colliding. And like with the other other two crossovers, these would be secret pasts the characters would try to hide in various ways. I've found a few fics on some of these ideas but nothing I personally find spectacular, I'm afraid.

I might try out the HP/Avengers crossover because the idea does sound promising but I have no idea of what characters I'd like to follow the most. Maybe that's better, to be more open minded.
