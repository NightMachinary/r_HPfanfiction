Well the thing is most crossovers stall, like most fanfiction but with the added caveat that since it's a smaller community even less stories are ended. I don't want to give you old unfinished work and leave you with blue balls and a hatred of crossovers.

Linkffn(Heroes Assemble!) is a current updated Harry Potter/Avengers Story. I'm not a huge fan of it due to the time spent observing the Stations of Canon, but has recently picked up with the move beyond Winter Soldier.

Linkffn(Harry Potter's most excellent adventure) a fun if messy Harry Potter/Star Gate crossover that requires a mild knowledge of SG. (Not a lot just knowing who the main players are really) I actually really like it.

Linkffn(A Wizards Life With Monster Girls) a recently updated Harry/Monster Musume story, that mixes the standard Harem Manga tropes with a more western story telling angle. Some lemons if your into that.

Linkffn(A Third Path to the Future) probably one of the best written Marvel Potter crossovers. Biggest knock is the length, some chapters are literally 150k each. Harem, Lemons again if you are interested. Does a wonderful job of blending The MCU, Mutants and Harry's Place in it all.

Linkffn(Magi Ranger) yep Harry Potter in Might Morphin Power Rangers as a 7th Ranger the Magic Ranger. Well written fun ride through the first season of MMPR and will continue further.

Linkffn(Chrysochlorous) HP Crossover Fanfiction ain't nothing without Twilight Crossovers. Here is one I enjoy, Harry/Rosalie. So just on pairing it's Ultra rare due to not being Slash. Super Angsty but par for the course in Twi fiction.

And basically anything by plums if you can enjoy non finished stories. The man is a great story weaver if someone who doesn't finish them up
