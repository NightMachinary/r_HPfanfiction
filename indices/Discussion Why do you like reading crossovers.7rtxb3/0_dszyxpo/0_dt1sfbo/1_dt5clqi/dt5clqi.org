linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) for sure if you like LotR. It's just really great.

linkffn(The Wasteland by The Carnivorous Muffin) is a sidefic from Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus where Lily finds the One Ring. So crossover between LatAoBS and LotR, not quite HP but still good.

I second Heroes Assemble, its good.

linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari) is a pretty good crossover with Avengers and Thor, but it focuses on the Norse mythology part a lot more than the MCU did. (Ok, I haven't actually watched Ragnarok yet, and that seems fairly mythology focused, but still) Disclaimer, I read this a long time ago when I was fairly new to fanfiction so I really don't know how well it holds up to someone more experienced xD.

linkffn(Wand and Shield), Avengers crossover. I never actually finished it because it kind of gets boring (imo) near the end, but it is really good in the beginning.
