You can only read Harry is a Teen age wizard BUT WAIT THERES MORE! but so many times without becoming bored. It also doesn't help that 20-30's Harry stories often focus on things like romantic drama, romantic comedy or grim dark stuff that often feels super over blown to get you to realize Harry is 20. I can read that or

Harry is off somewhere else, crawling through the forest of Endor or he is standing in Chicago with another wizard name Harry play PI, Maybe Harry is in Japan defending the princess of the Universe from her many aggressive Suitors. Maybe Harry isn't exactly what we thought he was, maybe he is a Kryptonian, or he is a Full bringer, maybe he is a Anodite. He meets new people, people who like him were chosen from birth to be a protector due to prophecy, maybe he meets people who leaped into the life style to just do good. He may even find someone else to fall in love with, whether it's Supergirl or Rangiku or Akeno or maybe a group of women.

I like Crossover because they get The story away from Hogwarts (on occasion because some people don't even do that) and we get to see more of the world that a Drafty Castle, a small room in Surrey, a weird house in the the English County side, a scary house in London and a small street in the middle of London. I'm not reading about Draco Malfoy and Harry having a childish Duel. I'm reading Harry being a Interplanetary Bounty Hunter, or a Superhero or Pilot or just a Rich guy who got into some stuff, or maybe he is just a Student still but that isn't all he is maybe he is a Gladiator trying to rise up the ranks to become a high ranking devil, or maybe he is also a defender of life against Hollows, maybe he is a Disciple Martial artist who is fight against a gang.
