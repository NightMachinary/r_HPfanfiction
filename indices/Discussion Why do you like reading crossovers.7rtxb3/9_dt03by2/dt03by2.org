It's an exercise in imagination. How do you take what you know of this series, and merge it with another? How do you frame the story and mix the colors. How do you decide to alter things?

Most importantly, do you keep consistency within character reactions, or does everyone start to react the same, sound the same, and think the same?

I find that it's incredibly rare for a writer to manage to separate different character's thought processes, speech, emotions, and the like from each other. I've seen a few short fictions where a writer manages to write a person's expressional thoughts and the framing of words consistently and decidedly different from others. Those are usually top quality fics, and it's a shame I don't see more.
