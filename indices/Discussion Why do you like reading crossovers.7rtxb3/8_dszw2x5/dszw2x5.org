I used to absolutely love the kind of stories where a person or several persons from another book/movie/show are hired or sent on a mission to Hogwarts, usually ending up as students, sometimes as teachers. Nowadays I still like those stories, but most of them fall into the trap of bad writing, follow the HP canon a little too closely, or get terribly annoying with how the author tries to "up the ante" by bringing in more and more villains from the non-HP series and that spirals out of control with way too many characters to keep track of.

My favorites these days are where someone from the HP universe is reincarnated into another universe, preferably someone other than Harry. The best ones I've found have Hermione reincarnated as Sakura Haruno from the Naruto universe.
