Those cross-universe reincarnation stories sound interesting. Can you link to any you recommend, or to your profile if they are on your favorites list? I tried looking for those Hermione/Sakura stories you mentioned, but so far the only promising one I found was /Effloresco Secundus/ (linkffn(8525251)), which is incomplete.
