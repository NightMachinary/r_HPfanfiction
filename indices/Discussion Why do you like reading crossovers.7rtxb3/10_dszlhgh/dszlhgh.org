I like some crossovers. For me Harry Potter is a huge world full of potential but in reality we only get a few stories done again and again. I often read cross overs when I feel tired of Harry Potter. Something to inject a bit of life into things. Some fandom cross-overs are the same story again and again too but since only the very worst cross overs stick to the stations of canon in either universe it should be somewhat fresh.
