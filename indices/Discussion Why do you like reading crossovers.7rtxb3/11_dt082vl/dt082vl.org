My all time favourite crossover is linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force). Its not very in character, almost to the point that its an OC in the Star Wars universe with references to the Harry Potter world. The thing that sets it apart is that is is damn good fun. So much of popular fanfiction is whiny angst and frankly horrifying romance, wound through the thousandth canon retread with nothing new or exciting added, that it just cheers me up immensely to read about a man and his mad killer robot larking around the galaxy, causing chaos and stealing everything that isn't nailed down, with magic being used in creative and entertaining ways. There are so precious few stories that I have ever found, and I think I am up to about 15 different fandoms to varying degrees of intensity, that I just enjoy reading. So I think I enjoy reading crossovers simply because the good ones are just a wonderful fresh take on fandoms I do genuinely enjoy, while there are stories I love contained within single universes, my very favourites are almost all crossovers. Here are a few others I have enjoyed, not all are crossovers with Harry Potter but why not.

linkffn(Dragons by Annonimous4862), sadly unfinished and likely abandoned, but 160k words of Skyrim and Eragon crossover and its good fun.

linkao3(There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket), requires a little bit of the anime Bleach to fully follow, but its finished and one of my all time favourites, really funny from start to finish.

linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby? by SpoonandJohn) is still updating regularly, a reasonably mild crossover with Naruto though not absolutely necessary to enjoy the story. Really weird and largely impossible to predict where it is going but very funny.

linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801) is a little different, more serious and worldbuildy Harry in Westeros, not the best but interesting, though nearly a year since an update has left me worried.
