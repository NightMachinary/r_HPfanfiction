Because they're different. There are bad ones of course, but most understand that introducing one or more completely new characters will have a significant impact on the plot. I also find that it helps give a different perspective, you can only do so much with an established cast, so new characters change up the dynamics. For example, if you're reading a crossover wherein some of the new characters are adults, this helps see the war with Voldemort from an adult perspective, different from Harry's narration of events. Or, if the characters you introduce are more Slytherin in mind-set, this might change the way of thinking of certain characters and the dynamics of the war.

However, really, the main interest lies in seeing your favourite characters interacting with each other. It gives you a chance to see the characters from someone else's view.
