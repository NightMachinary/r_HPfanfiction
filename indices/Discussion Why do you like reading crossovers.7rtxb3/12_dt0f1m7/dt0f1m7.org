They're a good way of combining franchises I like a lot. I enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I enjoy Lord of the Rings, I /love/ Star Wars,... and so on and so forth. In combination they have the potential to be very entertaining.

Another plus side is that they challenge authors to rethink and be creative. You still get enough stories that blindly follow the canon plots, but sometimes you pick out a gem.
