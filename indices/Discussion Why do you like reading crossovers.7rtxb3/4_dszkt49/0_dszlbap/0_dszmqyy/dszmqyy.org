Not really, no. It depends on whatever else I'm into at the moment.

Right now I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11975368/1/The-Stormreaver][The Stormreaver]] (HP/Warcraft) linkffn(11975368) where [[/spoiler][Harry gets kidnapped as a baby by a Demon from Warcraft's Burning Legion, and raised by a warlock (basically a demonic mage)]]

I also read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]] (HP/Warhammer 40K) linkffn(8400788) where [[/spoiler][In the summer of his 3rd year, Harry gets transported to Warhammer's 40th millenium, and then he comes back as a 300 year old Space Marine.]] It's much less serious than Stormreaver.

Basically I like the "Character from universe X gets into universe Y and shenanigans happen" trope.

Also, for a non-HP X-over that I can (not) recommend; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k][Shinji and Warhammer40k]] (Evangelion/Warhammer 40K) linkffn(3886999). Any summary I may write won't make it justice, just... read it, if you feel so inclined.
