A little more family than friendship focus, but pretty light-hearted. The basic premise is that Sirius gets Andromeda and her family to look after Harry after a slightly AU 3rd book (Harry got sick of the fights about Scabbers and hung out with Katie and Leanne instead).

The first few chapters are about Harry adopting to his adoptive family, later on more friendship stuff with Katie, Hermione and Leanne. Mostly light-hearted, but I tried to go for a more believable impact of the Dursleys. There are a few scenes with a darker tone, but the overall tone is happy.

I tried my best not to bash Ron, but I don't see a way he wouldn't get mad about Harry in the TWT, so they aren't friends. However, they are not enemies or insulting each other either.

There is a romantic subplot, but I try to keep it a sub-plot. And I try to keep it realistic for a pair of teenagers, so no declarations of undying love two days in or anything like that.
