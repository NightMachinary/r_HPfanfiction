Armed with hundreds of Harrys apiece, Dumbledore and Voldemort meet with their armies on the battlefield. The final showdown looks like it's going to be brutal, but only 2 curses are cast. One at Dumbledore, one at Voldemort. Both fall to the ground, dead. A cheer goes up amongst all the Harrys, laughing with joy. As if they could be convinced to fight themselves. They open a rift to another universe with an Earth void of humans. They then bring whoever they want from their own universes, and within a few hours the whole world has dissolved into a massive Harry-Draco-Hermione-Luna orgy with a few Snapes thrown in for good measure. A sea of writhing bodies billions of people wide. They isolate themselves from all other universes and live happily ever after.
