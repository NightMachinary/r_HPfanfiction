I feel obligated to suggest The Art of Self-Fashioning, linkao3(5103614). It's a nice change from the usual skilled-at-absolutely-everything-he-tries-Harry.

Even stories focusing on Neville are usually about his skill in herbology and not much else, just like when he is a side character. I can't think of anything specific at the moment, but many Draco focused stories have him skilled at potions, but not usually bad at the other subjects except CoMC.
