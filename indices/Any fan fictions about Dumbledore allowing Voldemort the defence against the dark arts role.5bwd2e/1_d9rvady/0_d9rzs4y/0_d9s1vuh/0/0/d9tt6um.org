The way the you experience 'deeply caring' and the way a psychopath does is not the same thing. He wanted to power of being a teacher in order to shape the world into one that made sense to him.

And for teaching to change him completely it would have been completely character breaking. Tom essentially had magically-induced psychopathy, it defined his entire existence. For him to care about the feelings or happiness of anyone but himself would require him to be a different person altogether.
