I find Wastelands just impossible to get into. People adore it. I just get bogged down in the first chapter and then the sections in italics, and then the arrival, and then dislike the older version of Harry that is the MC. The sentences seem overwritten to me, so I get thrown out of the story again and again. It's too much like hard work staying in and I've never managed to read a story people really seem to love.
