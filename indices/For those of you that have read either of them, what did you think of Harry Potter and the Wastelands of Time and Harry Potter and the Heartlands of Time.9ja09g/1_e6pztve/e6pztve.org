Same as the other two have said, Wastelands is the gold standard for some amazing world building and story telling, this kind of continued in Heartlands but the last 1/4 of the story felt very rushed and predictable. Don't let that stop you reading it though, it's still better than the vast majority of fics that try to accomplish the same thing.
