I'd be the first to admit that Heartlands dwindled. I lost the thread years ago when I got caught up in original fiction.

Even re-reading Wastelands and Heartlands whole I couldn't find the thread again. I figured an ending, however rushed or predictable, was more important to folk who had been reading these stories for a decade than leaving it unfinished. :)
