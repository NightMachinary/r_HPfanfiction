I worked my way through Wastelands largely because of the recommendations on this site. And I have to say I wish I hadn't bothered. I consider it to be /the/ most overrated story in the entire fandom.

The writing was, I can't deny, very good. It was the meandering plot that got me. Things didn't seem to happen according to any particular plan - it was like the author had an idea and pulled the story in a totally different direction.

The other problem is that the characters were way too OOC. I see [[/u/Hellstrike]] has already made this point. Combine that with the plot problems and there was nothing that felt familiar to me. I made it through to the end but there's no way I'm going to read the sequel.
