I wouldn't describe Harry, Roland, or John Constantine as "slightly grumpy and or pissed off about the state of things." I'm also not making any claims about how "deep" any characters might be. That's an entirely subjective and ultimately meaningless term.

My point is that the version of Harry in /Wastelands/ is something like a thousand years old, and Joe wrote him as an /adult/ character who has gone around the bend of crazy and come back out the other side. That's why I consider /Wastelands/ part of a different genre of fantasy, separate from the "teenage power-wank" genre that you described.
