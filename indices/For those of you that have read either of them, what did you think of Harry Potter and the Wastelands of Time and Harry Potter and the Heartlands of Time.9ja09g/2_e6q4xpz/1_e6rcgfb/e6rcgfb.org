  It reminds me of certain type of Fantasy novels that was popular a long time ago, with a young, strong protagonist, who has to discover a secret power and save the world. Modern fiction like this usually just adds a bit of grit and edgyness instead of the idealism (we live in times when the lines between good and bad aren't as clear anymore, particularly on the geopolitical stage), but it's basically the same kind of teenage power-wank wish-fulfillment.

It's interesting to me that you associate /Wastelands/ with teenage power-fantasy. Joe's Harry reminded me a lot more of John Constantine in the /Hellblazer/ comics series: old, jaded, and with recklessness bordering on a death wish. The bleak hopelessness of Harry's quest is also reminiscent of Roland's journey in the /Dark Tower/ series (with a possible hat-tip in chapter 25/26).
