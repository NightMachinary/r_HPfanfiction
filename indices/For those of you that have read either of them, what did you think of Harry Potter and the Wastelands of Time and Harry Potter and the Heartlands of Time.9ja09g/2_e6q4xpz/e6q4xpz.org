I couldn't get through Wastelands of Time. The battle scenes and demons were way too anime for me. I think I didn't get into the Denarian trilogy for similar reasons.

It reminds me of certain type of Fantasy novels that was popular a long time ago, with a young, strong protagonist, who has to discover a secret power and save the world. Modern fiction like this usually just adds a bit of grit and edgyness instead of the idealism (we live in times when the lines between good and bad aren't as clear anymore, particularly on the geopolitical stage), but it's basically the same kind of teenage power-wank wish-fulfillment.

I always feel people who write that way are missing the point how JKR subverted that trope in how she wrote Harry. But to be fair, I'm rarely interested in HP fics that verge into a different genre.
