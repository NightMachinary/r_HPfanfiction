While I agree the Hero trilogy does have that exact deux ex machina type of ending, the first 99% of it is fantastic. I can forgive the ending just because of how fantastical and crazy the story gets by the end; the simplest of conclusions honestly was the only way such a long and convoluted (but amazing) tale could end.
