Sorry, something went wrong with my formatting. I wasn't telling you you needed to more spoiler tags, I was trying to hide my answer behind one, but apparently I don't know how to use them. SPOILER AHEAD, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE TAG Atlantis coming back had something to do with Tessa going back in time and becoming Saturnia, but I can't really remember what it was exactly. It was pretty confusing.
