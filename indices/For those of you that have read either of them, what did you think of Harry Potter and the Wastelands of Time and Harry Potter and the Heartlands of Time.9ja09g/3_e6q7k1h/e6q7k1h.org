Wastelands is very good, but it has the issue that it goes way over the top in its effort to be epic, often going far enough to the point of it becoming a chore. It also simultaneously has one of my favorite scenes in any fanfic (the wizarding Rome scene with Dumbledore) and one of my least favorites (the bone construct part). Of course, there's also the issue where Joe doesn't really know how to write a Harry that feels anything remotely like his canon counterpart. He just writes the same character in all of his stories, and that's one that is mostly just a projection of himself mixed with James Bond.
