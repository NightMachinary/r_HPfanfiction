*Just to be clear, I'm on friendly terms with the author, so take that into context with what I'm about to say.*

I loved Wastelands and Heartlands, I wasn't so much a fan of The Reminiscent Exile series, because I too felt they were re-treading the same old ground. On the other hand, his other series, beginning with The Rig is actually a genuinely excellent couple of YA books. They're traditionally published and have all of the refinement that would usually come with that. If you can appreciate YA at all, I'd highly recommend reading them.
