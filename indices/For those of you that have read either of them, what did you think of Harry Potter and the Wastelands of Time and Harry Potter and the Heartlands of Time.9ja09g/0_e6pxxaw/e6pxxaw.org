Wastelands of Time was /amazing./ Not just one of the best Harry Potter fanfictions, but one of the most striking /stories/ I've ever read. Joe Ducie has a way with sculpting the English language into the manliest thing possible. However, Heartlands of Time was a meandering disappointment, with a few very interesting worldbuilding threads that went nowhere, further dragged down by Voldemort and Harry's peer-age-group of Hermione, Ron, etc, etc, all being two-dimensional caricatures. By merit of having more screen time, this was far more apparent in book 2 than in book 1.

Anyway, I also tried buying Joe's first published book, but I thought it was disappointing compared to Wastelands; just a /lower quality/ rehash of the same general ideas. Has anyone had a better experience with his published books past book 1?
