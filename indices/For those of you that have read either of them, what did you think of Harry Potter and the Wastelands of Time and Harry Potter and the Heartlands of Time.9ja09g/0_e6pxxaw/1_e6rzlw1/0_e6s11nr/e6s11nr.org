I'll be honest in saying I didn't finish book 1 of the Exile series. For Harry Potter of Wastelands, being a whiskey-drinking, suit-wearing, gun-and-wand-toting badass worked because he was a critically depressed, thousand-year-old deathless immortal. Exile's main character - nah, just, nah. He wasn't grand enough to fill those boots. That being said, because you're such an imaginative author, I do owe it to that book to try again. But from this thread, it also sounds like your Rig series treads some new and more original ground. I'll check that out soon.

'Fair reviews' inherently means it was flawed. The very way that you wrote Wastelands and Exile, the way that you craft ideas and words, means that you were at the edge of actual greatness. 'Fairly good' fantasy is something like the Ryria Chronicles; respectable, but nothing to write home about in terms of ideas or language or worldbuilding. You have the potential for something far greater. But I distinctly felt like I wasn't getting that in Exile.
