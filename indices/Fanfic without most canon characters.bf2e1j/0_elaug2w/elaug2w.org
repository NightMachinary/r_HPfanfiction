I can highly recommend stuff written by the fanfic author Slide, whose early stuff was focused entirely around four Slytherin characters that she made up. Her writing is sweet and sly and clever and a ton of fun to read, and I've grown to love these characters as much as I love the canon HP characters. Their story begins with a series of one-shots called linkffn(Latent Anguis In Herba) , which takes place during books 2-5. Then some more plot-driven stories continue with Shade to Shade linkffn(3353818) , which takes place during Book 6, and Falls the Shadow linkffn(6726813) , which takes place during Book 7.

Also, she's from Lancaster, so her stories are authentically British.
