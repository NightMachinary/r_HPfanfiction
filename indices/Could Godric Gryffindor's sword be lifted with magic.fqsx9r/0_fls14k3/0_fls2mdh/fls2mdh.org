That's not what he said. Obviously some goblins and I think Snape were able to lift the sword, but it could still be magically protected against magically moving it (like the horcruxes were).

  More like hogwarts gave it to harry when he asked for help had it been a member of another house they would have received something else that would help them in that moment.

Doubt it, the hat used to be Griffindor's that's probably why it was linked to the sword.
