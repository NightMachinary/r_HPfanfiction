Can't apparate to some place you've never been before, and I'm not sure pictures would do the trick. They might, but who knows? There was also a massive country wide ward-wall in A True Daughter Of The Blacks, I think it was. I'm sure something similar could be put up at the behest of the ministry. Other countries might have something similar, even, so it wouldn't be so much about Britain's border control as everyone else's. I would enjoy reading about Harry and co. earning a living as blockade runners.
