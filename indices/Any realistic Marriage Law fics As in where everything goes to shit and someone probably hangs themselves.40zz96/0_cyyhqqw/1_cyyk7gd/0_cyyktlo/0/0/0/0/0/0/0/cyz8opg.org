For one, I'm talking in general rather than about the specifics. But yes, you are right, it would have to be both done and explained properly, it's just that the job would be an author's and not mine.

For two, I am not relating it to the marriage law or anything like that, just adding to the idea of a border control story that this branch of comments derailed itself to. So whatever whoever would write, I do acknowledge that they would have to think up a good reason for this, yes, and a marriage law would not count, but you talking about it makes me think that you /might/ be perceiving me as someone who would try to justify nobody getting abroad with such a law taking place when really it couldn't be further from the truth and I wanted to make that clear.

And for three, ignoring the fact that the whole camping trip in the last book was ... not the best thing ever, they only really moved in the country so the issue of border control is moot there. I mean, yes, I have no doubt that on the continent border control would be much more difficult and that even with moving from (or to) Great Britain to (or from) the outside it would require quite some resources to be spent, but for as long as you aren't actively searching for them in a way that leaves the target with no ability to move onto the areas you had already scoured through, it's much, much easier to find someone trying to cross borders than it is to find them in just some area if they don't want to be found. And in any case, we don't know because the last books had failed, scope-wise, to show the big conflict that this was supposed to be.

So yeah, it really does depend.
