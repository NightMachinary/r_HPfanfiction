It depends. Harry, Hermione and Ron evaded the goons of Voldemort for months and rather easily. If it's possible to erect border controls that they can't get through, why weren't they caught back then? And where were those skilled and numerous border guards when a Dark Lord was taking over Britain? Waiting on the Knight Bus?

You need a reason why such a border set up is possible. And you need a reason other than the common "We need babies or we die out" for the marriage law as well, if they have enough manpower to seal off Britain.
