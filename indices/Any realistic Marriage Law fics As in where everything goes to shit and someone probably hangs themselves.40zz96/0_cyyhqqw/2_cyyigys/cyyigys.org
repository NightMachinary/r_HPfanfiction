I have no idea, either, as I can't speak for everyone, but from my personal experience, I was /really/ into marriage law fics when I was about 14-15 years old. Something about the idea of a taboo relationship with an older man combined with the angst of being forced to do something unwanted by a Cruel Higher Authority really spoke to my whiny teenaged self. It certainly didn't matter at all that the whole concept is illogical. I never wrote one, but I read so many I forgot for a while that it wasn't an idea with any basis in canon. Now I'm 28, and I regret the time lost, as I no longer understand the appeal.
