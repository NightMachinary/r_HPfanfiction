Not a rec/suggestion, so much as an agreement with the sentiment you seem to be exhibiting, but...

I really never understood the logic allegedly supporting the idea that people would go along with something like a 'marriage law'

It's never struck me as being terribly enforceable from a legal standpoint because anyone who wasn't gung-ho for it just... leaves. If you're preventing them from leaving it stops being a fic about a marriage law and starts being a fic about border controls.

Am I missing some key aspect of the genre?
