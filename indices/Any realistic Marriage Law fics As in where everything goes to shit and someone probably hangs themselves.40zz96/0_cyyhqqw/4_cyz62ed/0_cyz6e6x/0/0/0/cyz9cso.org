Well to turn your argument around on you - Marriage Law fics aren't set in real Britain, they are set in a tiny parody of Britain and they are always set under the premise of extreme need to a very real problem of oncoming extinction.

So any and all arguments about how acceptable forced marriage is to British people who are *not* desperately clawing their race from the jaws of extinction, are likewise meaningless.
