themselves. not "a society". Their society. They live in it, are part of it and if it falls apart they are likely to go with it.

People have in the past and are right now letting themselves 'be raped' (as you insist on putting it) to save themselves from things like that for as long as humans existed and people born on that particular island aren't special in that regard.

by the way - your premise of 'save such a society' is yet another example of a mindset accustomed to the privilege of modern convenience. So easy to move around the world nowadays, isn't it?

"If things start to really suck over here, that's not MY problem, because I can awlays say 'fuck this society' and go elsewhere"

Now try to consider the situation from view point of someone who doesn't have the luxury of sidestepping every serious problem. What if they can't leave?

(either due to immigration policies of other countries or laws governing that whole statute of secrecy)

Anyway - getting really tired of arguing what is and isn't possible in fiction. I've long ago come to realize that as far as human behavior goes, 'anything is possible" *under the right conditions*. I see no reason to exclude Marriage Law premise from that.
