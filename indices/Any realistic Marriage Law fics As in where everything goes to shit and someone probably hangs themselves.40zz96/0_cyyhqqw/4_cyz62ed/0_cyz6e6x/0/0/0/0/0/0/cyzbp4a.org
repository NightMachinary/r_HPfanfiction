  Anyway - getting really tired of arguing what is and isn't possible in fiction. I've long ago come to realize that as far as human behavior goes, 'anything is possible" under the right conditions. I see no reason to exclude Marriage Law premise from that.

I think the big complaint is that since most marriage law fics seem to be about smooshing two characters together as fast as possible... we never see those conditions portrayed in a reasonable manner.

Worse, I think the logic is somewhat flawed in that wizards marrying and having kids with other wizards isn't the most practical way to increase your population... Weasleys aside. Wizards knocking up muggles so that you get a whole slew of halfbloods would make more sense... I think? It would double the number of people making babies, and the various students with one muggle parent would seem to indicate that the resulting offspring would be magical.
