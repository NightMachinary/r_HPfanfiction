  Britain's population doesn't think arranged marriages are acceptable.

for a whole 2 centuries now? interestingly that seems to be about how far back in time the Wizarding world is stuck.

Also arranged marriage isn't dungheap material. It's a useful tool for society under certain conditions. When those conditions re-emerge, the tool is used again - eg. see Japan.

([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage]] - see Late Marriage section and the supporting sources. Funnily enough that was also a country that has long discontinued this tradition but than a population crisis + conditions created by modern society is bringing the practice back)
