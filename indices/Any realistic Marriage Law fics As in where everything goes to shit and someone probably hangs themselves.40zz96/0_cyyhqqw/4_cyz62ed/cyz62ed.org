  Am I missing some key aspect of the genre?

the part where arranged marriages was the norm for vast majority of human history in many places on the globe and things got along just fine without any mass exodus. (see majority of our civilization up to last few centuries)

Also the part where 'average citizen' is sometimes both attentive and patriotic enough that the government's justification for extreme measures is accepted by majority despite those measures being a huge pain in the ass.

Again something that happened quite a few times in human history. (eg: Soviet Union lasted 80 years, and the shit they demanded their people to put up with, makes arranged marriage look like a minor inconvenience. Took 3 generations for patriotism to wear off enough for that to fall apart)
