I understand that forced marriage isn't optimal for happiness, but people seem to seriously overhype the bad factors and the likelyhood of bad outcomes.

Significant portions of the globe had people living for centuries practicing various forms of arranged marriages and it wasn't *that bad*.

I get that arranged marriage is a worse option vs picking your own mate, but to the people who harp on it and expect it to aboslutely fail miserably - our civilization literally grew on this concept for centuries and society still advanced into modern era without falling apart.
