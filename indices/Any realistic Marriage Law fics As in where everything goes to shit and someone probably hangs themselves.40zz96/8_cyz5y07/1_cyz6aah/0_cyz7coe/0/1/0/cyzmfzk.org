Yeah - the Roman Empire had such "Marriage laws". But "I have to marry, or I'll have to pay more taxes" doesn't really lend itself to the kind of "I have to marry my worst enemy who wanted to kill me for years, so I can discover that he's actually my true love!" plots many Marriage Law stories have. (Not to mention that marrying to save money is as unromantic as it can get :P)
