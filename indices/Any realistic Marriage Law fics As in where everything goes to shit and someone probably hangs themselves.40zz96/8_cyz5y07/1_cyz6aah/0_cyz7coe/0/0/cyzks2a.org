  I'd say that as long as you have Harry, Ron and Hermione, the heroes of the war against Voldemort, you have enough to topple any government in Wizarding Britain

That's probably true, but as in the muggle world, there's a difference between making a change and keeping a change. That's why your story was effective - it showed them doing one of the only things which would likely cause deep, widespread changes to stick quickly.

Short of something that drastic, they might be able to use their fame to force proponents of such a law to back down, but that wouldn't change the underlying culture any time soon. They could keep using their fame to make others back down every time something awful comes up, but that would lose effectiveness over time. And if they didn't have enough popular support to change the system peacefully, from within (by "change" I mean the awful things stop being proposed), the question they'd have to ask themselves is: why are we beating ourselves up trying to save this society?

You can win a violent revolution with a smaller number of committed fighters, then pull in support from those who are willing to accept any government that keeps them warm and safe. Non-violent shifts in political and social culture will need a larger base of support to push back against centuries of inertia. So absent the revolution you described, and without the large base of support for peaceful change, I imagine that they'd find a way to leave. Harry especially doesn't have deep, personal ties to Britain.
