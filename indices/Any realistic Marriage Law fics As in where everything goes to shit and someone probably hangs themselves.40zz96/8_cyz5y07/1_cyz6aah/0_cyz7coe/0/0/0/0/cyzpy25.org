  The question why people do not simply leave Britain for greener pastures is a problem for many plots, including the canon one.

Well, even in the muggle world, people don't change countries very often or easily. It's no minor thing.

Granted, there are ways that it would be easier for witches and wizards, but only up to a point. Packing and travel are the things that are probably easiest, and they are the initial barrier that everyone thinks about. But what about when they get there? Will they be able to get a job? Will they be able to find housing? How will the locals view a foreigner? I won't even get into language issues.

Other magical governments and communities might be wonderful, but they may not be very welcoming towards immigrants - especially those who just pop into the middle of the street! :)

Then there are the intangible things that tie people to their home country - things that make it hard for someone to give up on entirely. I can't see the Weasleys, Longbottoms, or many others being able to leave Britain so easily.

But that's what makes questions about Harry and Hermione leaving especially important - they aren't like the others! Neither have deep ties to magical Britain, and Harry's ties to muggle Britain are just as poor. Both could manage in the muggle world, so wouldn't need to worry about magical restrictions if they are worse than the muggle ones. And after the way Sirius and Remus have been treated, I can see them supporting a move (more so than Molly, Arthur, or any of the other adults).

Most 14/15yo kids don't think about such things, though. Even just the prospect of moving out of their home would be rather daunting, never mind picking up and leaving the country. It's realistic that they wouldn't explore that option, but it's such a terrifying threat to those who need those kids to stay that it's too interesting to ignore. :)
