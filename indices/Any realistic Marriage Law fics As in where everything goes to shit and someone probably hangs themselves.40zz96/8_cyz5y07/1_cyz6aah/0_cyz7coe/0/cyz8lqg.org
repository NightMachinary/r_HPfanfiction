I'd say that as long as you have Harry, Ron and Hermione, the heroes of the war against Voldemort, you have enough to topple any government in Wizarding Britain, especially if you take their fame and reputation into account. You need a lot of changes to their history and characters to make them accept a marriage law. and even if tehy didn't raise their wands in rebellion, you'd Need even more changes to make them actually marry whoever the law says they have to, instead of leaving, plausible.

Wizards, due to their individual power, make for poor "trapped in an arranged marriage, but learning to love the Partner I was forced onto" stories. Unlike female "protagonists" in bodice-rippers.
