1. Freedom to choose? I'm not sure we know what marriage and courtship customs are like in canon. We assume that they are much like muggle Britain, but we have few examples to work from - almsot everyone is already married when we see them, so we don't know what steps were taken to get to that point. The only examples we get to see anything of are the Weasleys, who are well-established as different from most purebloods, and the Tonks family, who are also different.

We don't know if divorce is permitted or not, or how easy it is if permitted. We don't know if prenuptial agreements are common, necessary, or what. We don't know if there are required counseling sessions. We don't know if magic might create some extra problems that muggles never have to deal with.

On top of that, even if there is at least some freedom to choose, at least among the non-aristocracy, we don't know if that's a relatively recent development or not. So it could exist, but long-lived wizards and witches might not yet have a deep attachment to it. If it were established anywhere in the last two centuries, I could believe that people's attachment to it would be weak.

1. Civil war? I'm not sure how much of the canon population actively fought - and even those who didn't like Voldemort didn't necessarily object to a restrictive government coming in afterwards. How many of those who didn't like Voldemort, but kept their heads down out of fear, would be willing to accept restrictions that didn't affect them much personally so long as the government was promising that those restrictions were part of keeping everyone safe and preserving their way of life? My guess would be: a depressingly large number.

And muggelborn? They would have the deepest commitment to being free to choose whom they'd marry as well as the strongest passion for fighting against a restrictive government, no matter who was in charge. But how many of them are there? Precious few in Hogwarts, as far as we know. Mabye that's a tragic consequence of the previous war, or maybe it's the norm. If the latter is the case, then there won't be many muggleborn in the community to lead a charge against oppressive marriage laws.

All of these unknowns create a perfectly acceptable foundation for a story about marriage laws. That doesn't mean that it would be easy to write such a story well, just that such a plot idea isn't coming completely out of nowhere and with absolutely no precedence or basis in reality.

It's just another example of playing in the large, empty spaces of what Rowling left unsaid in her books.
