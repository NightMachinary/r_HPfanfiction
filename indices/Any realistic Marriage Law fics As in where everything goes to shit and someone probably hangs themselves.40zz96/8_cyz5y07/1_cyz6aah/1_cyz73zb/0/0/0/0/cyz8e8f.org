going to have to disagree on that with you because as a human being I am against declaring 99% of the history of my species to be 'inhumane' and I rather hope 'evil' as well.

This whole 'romance and let everyone choose their partner" thing is a privilege of modern economic advancement. It came because conditions for people in many countries got much easier. It will leave just as fast if it ever goes the other way.
