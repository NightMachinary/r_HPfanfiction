you are interpreting the premise in the worst possible way. If it was implemented it certainly wouldn't be done as 'lets rape kids' - to assume so is to try to build a strawman argument.

as for Hermione - you are talking about a girl who mind-wiped her parents 'For The Greater Good' and forcibly relocated them to another continent. She sacrifices ideals just fine when she thinks it's justified.

If arranged marriage laws come about, she will likely be the one front and center supporting them if she thinks that is what it will take to save/fix this society.

"an inhuman, evil system" - that may be your head-canon, but it's not everyone's and definitely not that of canonical characters. If they considered the British Wizarding world to be such a system, they wouldn't stick around to fight for it. They have, which indicates they see its value and are invested in preserving/saving it.
