I disdagree completely. According to canon, muggleborns are a significant part of the population. The idea that they let themselves get raped just to preserve a culture that demands that is insane.

Hermione especially has shown that she'd not give a damn about Magical Britain's norms if they do not correspond to western democratic ideals. She stood up against the enture school and endured ridicule for her SPEW campaign, for example. She also stood and fought the worst Dark Lord of Britain. She'd not sacrifice her ideals to protect an inhuman, evil system just because "it's magic".

A society that's willing to have children raped to save itself has already lsot all right to be saved.
