  We're talking about a society where a big part of the population was raised in the western world, with all the freedom to choose that entails.

are we actually though? because the source material gives us next to nothing about Wizarding society outside of school and if we judge things by the general era of development that we do see (things like Wizarding Britain being so small, there being only 2 news sources mentioned in the books, the relatively clumsy bureaucratic apparatus, having only one major bank) than the closest we could link that with our real history would actually put that society well into the territory of archaic practices like arranged marriages being the norm.

as an additional point of contention:

Also people from the western world keep looking at ides like that from the perspective of those who have never know true danger to their entire way of life being just gone - and from that perspective any extreme measure is automatically rejected in favor of personal freedoms and liberty...

But that is not the perspective that would be shared by people who are seriously looking slow extinction in the face. (which is the premise of most such stories)

I grew up in Soviet Union in the 80s where the whole patriotism thing was dying out already. But even glimpsing the last vestiges of it, it's really easy for me to understand how a population can be convinced to do some really extreme self-sacrifices "for the cause" when the right amounts of obvious necessity aligns with a few receptive mindsets.

Think of it this way - everyone looks at muggleborns in the books and say things like "Well a strong young woman like Hermione, who is product of our society (despite her being basically out of it since age 11) will surely just tell that idea to fuck off..."

That expectations ignores things like the fact that muggleborns like her would:

a) Be seriously aware of how soul-crushingly MUNDANE a world without magic truly is and how important it would be to preserve a magical society

b) Be just as aware that extinctions of a species isn't just a possibility - its the default fate of vast majority of species that has ever existed

c) be aware that without magical society to back them up, they are seriously lost in the Mundane world - even a smart girl like Hermione isn't going to be accomplishing much if she drops out of magical society considering she has been out school since age 11, learning medieval alchemy and astrology. Which means they will be really invested in the world on which they have bet everything not just dying out.

And as for you point about them fighting a civil war and that affecting their reactions:

- first they really haven't if we go by the books - that wasn't a "war", there is literally a single major combat that happens over the entire course of it

- second, putting one's life on the line to save a country also makes one really invested in that country not dying out despite everything you saw sacrificed for it. So their 'civil war' experience would actually make them more likely to support sacrificial ideas like a eugenic program than they otherwise would be - especially if it's framed as "if you don't, Voldermort ends up winning anyway. Instead of ruling our society, he just destroyed it and and everyone who died, died for nothing"

To reiterate, people have been sacrificing themselves to arranged marriages for the good of their family and country for centuries - that capability to put something else over one's own potential happiness isn't something that the human race just lost. The modern world just doesn't tend to require that sort of sacrifice from us - that doesn't mean people lost the strength of will to make such a sacrifice if they think it's necessary.

edit: to support my last point, remember that Soviet Union - a regime that has demanded the most self-sacrifice out of their population than any other - was born out of a revolution and it is in fact that public wave of opinion created by that revolution that made Soviet Union possible to exist. So we have a case in real history that exactly fits scenario of "everyone fought a war for their lives and than sacrificed (or gave up, considering there was plenty of opposition) all said rights for an ideal, en-masse". It wasn't smooth and more than a million of suspected dissident were executed in the aftermath - but even with that clumsy and inept handling, the change still happened.

So in light of that real event, a few thousand young, impressionable people being convinced to give Arranged Marriage a try isn't nearly as unlikely or doomed to fail as most people first think.
