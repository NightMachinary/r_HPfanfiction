Arranged marriages are contracts and agreements made between individual families and people, and they often work out well.

Marriage Laws, however, are a totally different beast: they are enacted by governments to force couple together against their will, and in many cases enforced by the police (aurors). They are nothing but government sanctioned rapes, and an abuse of power in the worst form. Even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't go that far (although marriages in Maoist China often required party approvals).
