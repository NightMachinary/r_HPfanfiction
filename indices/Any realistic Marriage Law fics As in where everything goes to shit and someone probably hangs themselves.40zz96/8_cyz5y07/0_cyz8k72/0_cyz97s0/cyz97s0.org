the epoch of human history that was Feudal and than Monarchy revolved around the 'government' forcing couples to marry for the interest of said government and the system functioned for centuries. Those types of marriage form a rather big bridge between your definition of 'arranged marriage' and 'marriage law', considering that rather frequently the interests of the couple being wed were of little concern to anyone.

It happened in real life and people went along with it, it can happen in fiction.

Marriage Law fics are just another example of fiction revolving on idea of 'extreme solution to extreme problem' - any attempt to evaluate the concept out of the context of said 'extreme problem' is ignoring the premise on which it's built.

Those countries didn't go that far because they had no need to. They definitely could have though.
