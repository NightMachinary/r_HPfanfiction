This is the only marriage law fic I can stand. Also one of the best fanfics I've ever read. HG/SS, be warned. [[http://www.mirrordance.net/aashby/bnw/ChaosIndex.htm]]

Summary: Chaos is Come Again has been cited as a response to the WIKTT Marriage Challenge, but is not: it's more a reaction to many of the rosier and more unrealistic stories that challenge produced. It was also written not long after the invasion of Iraq and institution of the Patriot Act -- not to mention during the prison abuse scandals of Spring 2004 -- and is chock full of political frustration, and examination of and commentary on those matters as well as more general Social issues such as Reproductive Rights and Marriage. Therefore, caveat lector: if you like Romance and more escapist fare, this is probably far too gritty for your taste.
