Not really. The actual revolution is handled in the first chapter. Then follow chapters dealing with the aftermath (as in the French Revolution, attempts to change the country, which the smarter purebloods expect not to last because you can't simply take muggle laws and apply them to magical societies, there are reasons other than "someone bribed the Wizengamot" for a number of weird-looking laws), but the vast majority of the story focuses on the political consequences and reactions to the revolution - by muggle Britain's PM, who thinks this might be an opportunity to make sure he'll never again be at the mercy of genocidal and stupid wizards, by the rest of Magical Europe, whose pureblood governments don't like "uppity mudbloods" toppling the "natural order" and by various groups of wizards who think this is an opportunity to promote their own agenda (like continuing where Grindelwald failed, or getting rid of the Russian hegemony in Eastern Europe, or simply getting rich by starting a war etc.).
