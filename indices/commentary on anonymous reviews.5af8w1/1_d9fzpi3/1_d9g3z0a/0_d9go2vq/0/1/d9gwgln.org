But surely any review worth leaving is going to take a while to write out anyway? Or you could come back later. It's not too bad when you leave your proper screen name, but I had someone who just called themselves me that has left a guest review under almost every chapter I've ever written. I appreciate that they're a loyal reader but they ask me questions, accuse me of getting the timeline wrong, and try to engage me in conversation. I guess they want me to mention them in an authors note or something, but I don't understand why they don't just get anew account.
