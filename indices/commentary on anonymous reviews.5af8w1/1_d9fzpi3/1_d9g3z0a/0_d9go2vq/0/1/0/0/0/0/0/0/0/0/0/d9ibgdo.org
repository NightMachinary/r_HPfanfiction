There are a lot of recommended stories that I don't read because I can't be bothered to create an account and log in; when I only have a few minutes to read and thus gravitate toward a short fanfic, I don't want to have to jump through hurdles. I can only speak to my writing when I say it's not worth password protection to view it. :)
