That's great if they know who you are, though it still slows them down responding directly to you, but that is not the case for most guest reviewers. I think certain questions and criticisms do need the author to be able to engage - there needs to be a dialogue for them to improve, or it could be a simple misunderstanding/missed a small moment on the basis of the reader.

I guess I just don't think it's a big deal to login or make an account. It's free and takes very little time and helps the author. Yes, there are some cases where it's fine, but in general guest reviews are just unhelpful at best.
