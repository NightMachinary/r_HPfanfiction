I suppose it comes down to an individual vision of the author/reader relationship. If someone takes the time to write a kind, thoughtful review, I feel I owe it to the reviewer to thank them for taking the time to do that, because social niceties keep us from devolving into savages, I suppose. But I do not owe my readers anything else, nor do I think they owe me anything at all. There are loads of people who would argue otherwise, I'm aware.
