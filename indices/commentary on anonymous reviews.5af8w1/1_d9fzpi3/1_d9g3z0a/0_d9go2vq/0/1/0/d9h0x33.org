But if they know who I am---I'm using my fanfic name, why on earth does it matter if I run a guest review? I also don't really care if I get guest reviews, though. If someone were to write something problematic, I don't feel the need to engage anyway, and if they write something kind, they've just waved a thank you. And if they ask a question, they just won't get it answered.
