It could be that they don't know any better, in which case being upset they didn't log in is sort of moot, or it could be like people who go on social media and ask for someone to explain something that could be more easily Googled. I just can't imagine wasting energy being upset or disappointed these people don't follow through. I have zero interest in justifying my writing to anyone. If they like it, fantastic. If not, welp, we all have those moments we can't get back, I reckon; I guess I get to be part of someone's lost time. Ask a question, and they better let me get back to them, or else it wasn't really meant to be. Ruminating about it seems like energy misspent.
