I've gotten updates on stories and clicking through on my phone, I'm not logged in. These are people I know; I will sign my reviews with my fanfiction name, and they know it's me, etc.

Why not take the ten seconds? It's probably more like thirty for me to go out and in, and I choose to only be industrious and dutiful when I beta. I am unapologetically lazy with the rest of it. That thirty seconds is exhausting. :)
