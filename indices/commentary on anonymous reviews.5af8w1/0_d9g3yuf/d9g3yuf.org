I may be a special case, but I've received plenty of valuable, meaningful reviews from anonymous readers. I'm particularly amused when they sign their reviews with a net name.

The only case where anon reviews grates me is when one has a really good question that I'd like to answer, but can't. If it's a finished story, I'm not likely to add the reply to the next or last chapter or anything.
