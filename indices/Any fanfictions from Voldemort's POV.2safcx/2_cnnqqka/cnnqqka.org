Neither of these is quite what you're after, though both are told through Tom Riddle's/Voldemort's POV:

[[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] by Sam Storyteller, an outstanding "alternative universe" (AU) story where Tom Riddle chose a different path, becoming the Defense against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts instead of the Dark Lord Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8892557/1/The-Chronicles-of-the-Dark-Lord-Ginnymort][The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort]] by Respitechristopher is another AU story from Voldemort's POV starting after he successfully possessed Ginny in /HP and the Chamber of Secrets/.
