[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8706297/1/Professor-Riddle-and-the-Quest-for-Tenure][Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure]]: More than two decades ago, Headmaster Dippet made the fateful decision to hire Tom Riddle as an associate Hogwarts professor. And now, at last, Riddle's double life as Lord Voldemort is threatening to bring the Wizarding World to its knees...if only he can convince his students to leave him alone.

Basically, a smart canon Voldemort rising to power from within a position as Professor. Has some vaguely crackish elements, and quite short, but what's there is very good, IMO.
