  Lily Evans was not what you might call a sentimental person. She did not get weepy after hearing a sad song, she did not hang on to useless things for the sole purpose of looking back on fond memories and she was certainly not the type who would ever find herself crying alone in an empty train carriage simply because, by some cruel twist of fate, it happened to be the exact same one in which James-Bloody-Potter had so unceremoniously dumped her three years prior.
