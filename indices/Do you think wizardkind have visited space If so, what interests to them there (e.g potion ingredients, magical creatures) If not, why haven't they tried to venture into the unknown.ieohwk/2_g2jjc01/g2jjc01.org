No indication that they have, but it should be within their capabilities. They have astronomy, so they know what's up there, more or less, plus they'd know from Muggleborns/half-bloods. Levitation/weightlessness charms would be immensely useful for getting into orbit, bubblehead charms on a larger scale for life support, enlargement spells to fit a lot into a small ship, maybe a modified portkey spell to get you to your destination. Unless there's some metaphysical reason why their spells can't work beyond Earth (no evidence of this), then they should be able to at least reach or even colonize the Moon.
