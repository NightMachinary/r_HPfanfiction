A personal headcannon of mine is that only the earth-side of the moon has werewolf powers. So, you set up a werewolf colony/moon base/research center on the other side.

Related question: Can you travel around the world so you miss the full moon? Canonically, werewolves turn with the rising moon over their part of the world, so can you take a speedy jet to Australia, then back to England, avoiding the whole thing altogether? Can you take a series of portkeys or disapparate internationally to the same effect? Why don't wizards do this???
