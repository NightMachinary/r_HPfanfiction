I imagine sometime in the 1400s a wizard may have visited the moon to test the cheese. Upon tasting said cheese and finding it to be of inferior quality to Wensleydale, the wizard returned to Earth to share the sad news with the rest of wizardkind. Ever since then, wizards have held no interest in travelling to space. After all, what's the point if the cheese isn't good?
