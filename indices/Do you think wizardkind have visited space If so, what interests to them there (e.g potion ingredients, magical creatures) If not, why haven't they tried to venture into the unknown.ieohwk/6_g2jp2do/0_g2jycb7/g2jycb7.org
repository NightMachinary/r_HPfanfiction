You can buy a complete model of the galaxy at Diagon Alley (PS).

However, in more interesting tangents, you do realise that "the earth orbits around the sun" is the perspective taken for convenience? The laws of motion governing the solar system become very easy if you look at things that way; however, that is the only way the sun as the centre is distinguished. Not least because the sun itself would be moving through the galaxy, and the galaxy through the universe etc.

In principle, it's no less wrong to assume the standpoint of the earth at rest. You have to calculate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle][epicycles]] (or even worse, do the full-on General Relativity treatment with weird-ass gravitational fields), which is arbitrarily complicated, but yields equally good results; and I always found it charming to consider that wizards might look at the solar system that way, because they can use magic to help or replace the calculations.
