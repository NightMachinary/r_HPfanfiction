I don't think Draco Malfoy realizes the planet orbits a star tbh. I think that magic can't tell you everything and most purebloods don't understand solar system models because they never bothered with muggle means of observation. It's just a hc, but the idea of rich Slytherins mocking a muggleborn for offhandedly saying the Earth orbits the sun to awkward silence is just too funny to me.
