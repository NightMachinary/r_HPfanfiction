It was 5+ years of reading fanfiction, a good 300+ were webcomics I either was reading or wanted to read, for reasons I can't even remember I had a folder full of tvtropes pages, another full of shit I looked up on Wikipedia, another full of games I would like to play when I could actually afford them... I can't remember if there was anything else.

Something like half were fanfiction though, I know because I took them one by one and categorized them in a Google sheet document. It took me a week to do it, and I ended up with a little less than a thousand entries.

And I don't bookmark porn, I like finding new things :)
