Linkao3(Her mother's love by inwardtransience) Linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17) A Long Journey Home as so many have recommended. There's a lot of time travel/dimension hop/crossover fem!Harry by Tsume Yuki. An exception to this (which I enjoyed) is linkao3(Flecks of Rust by Tsume_Yuki) Autumn Souls has a few nice pieces. Linkao3(The Archeologist by Racke) <- No crossover knowledge is needed.

^{All} of these feature more-powerful-than-canon Harry. Most are OOC.
