Okay, here we go:

- linkffn(The Long Journey Home): is quite honestly my favorite fem!Harry story in the whole fandom, even if it meanders a bit. But its quintessentially an embodiment of the phrase "its not the destination that matters, but the journey getting there."
- linkffn(Victoria Potter): probably heard of this one, but its one of the most canon-like stories with a more magical world you will find in the fandom. Taure's appreciation of canon while acknowledging its flaws really shines through as the story progresses. Currently in 2nd year.
- linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise): this one is a bit obscure and died a sad death, but I will admit its enjoyable both for the prose and the over-the-topness of the whole text. Bonus is fem!Harry is for once gay, though its a bit annoying how much focus this takes up at times. Her other fic Tales of Three may be worth a read for you as well.
- linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool): also way over-the top fem!Harry, but has some pretty good action storywise.

There are quite a few others that are noteworthy, such as the Black Queen series by Silently Watches or a ton of HP fanfics that pair fem!Harry with either Severus Snape or Tom Riddle. I won't recommend the former type because it takes dark up to 14 (ex. child prostitution), nor the later because its fundamentally out of character for both of Snape and Riddle (not to mention nausea inducing).
