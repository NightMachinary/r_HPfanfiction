  Because he isn't confirmed gay in canon
#+end_quote

I'll spare you the usual /'it's called/ *fan*/fiction, of course the pairings aren't canon'/ spiel and say this: He isn't confirmed gay OR straight. In fact, I don't remember Albus having a romantic relationship with anyone in CC (and don't say he was pining after Delphi, she was in her twenties when he was barely a teen wasn't she? It seemed more like he looked up to her because she was the first person to really praise him for his magical abilities more than anything). There are a lot of Scorpius/Abus fanfictions because there is more subtext between them that Albus/Delphi or even Scorpius/Rose, despite Scorpius explicitly asking Rose to go out with him (to which she said no), which felt undeveloped and tacked on to the end for the sake of 'happily ever after'. I'm not really a fan of most gay ships in HP (I don't like Harry/Draco, or Sirius/Remus, or any others, really), but I do like Scorbus because I could easily see it being canon, and judging by the quantity of fics, a lot of people seem to agree. Hence, I disagree with OP when they say this:

  really would that pairing exists if one of their last names were changed

I haven't read Cursed Child since it came out so forgive me if I'm remembering bits a little wrong, but my point still stands. Calling a character "sad" because he is often perceived as gay is going a little too far, when it seems you just don't like the ship.
