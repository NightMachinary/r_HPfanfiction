Well I never intended to go on a rant, but now that I've started I might as well respond:

What are you talking about canon pairings? My point is that Albus isn't paired with anyone, there is no canon to uphold in that regard. I understand what you mean when you say changes must be made in order to ship two characters, it's one of the reasons why I don't like Harry/Draco and other unlikely ships. Part of the original appeal of next-gen fics was that very little was set in stone - authors could pretty much ship anyone with anyone else they wanted. Now that CC is out, the author must take into account the 'new canon', but none of it really sets up any pairing except for the one sided Scorpius/Rose relationship which isn't even resolved at the end, so most pairings are equally viable (I've even seen some more esoteric pairings such as Scorpius/Hugo).

And yes, I'm sure they don't actually hate homosexual relationships and just worded it badly, but you also can't talk about 'mangling canon pairings' which don't even exist.
