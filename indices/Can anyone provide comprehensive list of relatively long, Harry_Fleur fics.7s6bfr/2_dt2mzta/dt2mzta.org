"Sticky Situations at Shell Cottage" by Elven Sorcerer if you're OK with smut. 30,000 words in 11 chapters, post-Hogwarts setting.

Bonus: to give you an idea of a long story that could (and should) have been, here's "Pardon My French" by Tintern Abbey, a delightful farce that unfortunately ends at 8,000 words and three chapters.
