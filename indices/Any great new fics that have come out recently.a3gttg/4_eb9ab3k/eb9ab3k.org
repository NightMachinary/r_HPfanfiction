I've been really enjoying this fic which came out in June. Basically 5 versions of Harry (1 same as canon otherwise, 4 slightly AU), can communicate with each other mentally. Other than minor differences in their background their universes all seem to be basically the same, so they help each other with the challenges they end up all facing by sharing information. It does a good job of still being easy to follow while showing the 5 worlds and giving each Harry a distinct personality. Also it seems to update at least once a week which is nice.
