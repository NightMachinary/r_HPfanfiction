Oldie but goodie (if you're into independent Harry Fics) is "Honor Thy Blood" on Fanfiction.net Harry gets Avada'd in the graveyard scene in GOF and is saved by someone everyone thought was dead, he gets stronger and takes an active role in the Second War; I recommend it to everyone and would reread it anytime.
