The problem with that is that Dumbledore is in education /and/ he's part of the wizengamot.

I'm going to assume that outside of Harry's direct experience (of which is the only real direct knowledge we have of the Wizarding world), Hogwarts and the Ministry are otherwise at least functionally competent.

As an Educator. Schools in general have teacher training, some of which is likely training in recognising the various forms of child abuse. Even if Dumbledore hasn't been teaching students regularly since he became Headmaster (and thus doesn't have the pulse on more modern beliefs on the subject), it's likely (again assuming competence) that even as Headmaster, he'd have received that same training. Regardless of whether Dumbledore considers Harry's childhood to be good or not, his training would tell him otherwise.

As part of the Wizengamot. The Wizengamot is a body that both sets and enforces the laws of Magical UK. Given that corporal punishment is canonically no longer allowed at Hogwarts, we can assume that, at the least, the Wizengamot must have passed at least /some/ child abuse laws that would force Hogwarts to end Corporal Punishment (and if that's not actually the case, then that would mean that that rule change was likely implemented by Dumbledore himself, which would mean he'd know that at least physical punishments of that nature were not good).

Since Dumbledore is effectively at least the Head Speaker of the Wizengamot, he'd /have to know/ about the laws that are proposed, and he'd also have to know about those laws when someone inevitably breaks them. This means that there is no functional way that Dumbledore wouldn't know that whatever abuses Harry suffers is considered to be bad, regardless of Dumbledore's feelings on the subject.
