I actually wonder if that's even true. Dumbledore hasn't been a teacher for like half a century by the end of the books, and you don't really see him interacting with the students. He works an administrative job. He has no real reason to ever directly interact with students outside of Harry or a student being sent to his office for severe rule breaking.
