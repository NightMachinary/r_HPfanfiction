Harry only did "gardening" in CoS, as a punishment for scarring Dudley with "M - - - -". Most of the time, the Dursleys are more than happy to ignore Harry and letting him do whatever as long as he is not being freaky. Harry was also more neglected than outright abused (outside of the incidents involving magic, which were few and far between).
