Dumbledore could have done many things ranging from placing the Dursleys under Imperius to basically extorting them into taking care of Harry. From a plot point of view, Harry had to suffer the hardships of the hero. From an in world point of view, Dumbledore was not the type to do that. Dursleys might have been pieces of shit but also try to put yourself in the situation that you are given a child you didn't want from a world you want nothing to do with and every so often an old weirdo shows up at your door telling you that he'll hurt you if you don't treat that kid like a prince. I think that eventually Dursleys would just move and leave Harry behind so that the crackpot can take care of him himself if he holds him so dear.
