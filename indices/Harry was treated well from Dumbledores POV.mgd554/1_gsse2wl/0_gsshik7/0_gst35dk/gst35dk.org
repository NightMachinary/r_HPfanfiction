  Yeah, for some reason people like to give Dumbledore a pass for being a complete peace of shit in regards to Harry's life even though he outright tells the readers he knows exactly what he was condemning Harry to

Yeah because he clearly said in the same scene that, while he knew it would suck, it was still the "least bad" choice?

The protection would only activate if the Dursley "allowed" Harry to live with them, which means that it was impossible to threaten the Dursley into taking him without risking the whole protection. And he even took the pain to place a Squibb nearby to keep an eye on things and make sure Harry was not in mortal danger (which never happened in canon before the Dementors of OotP.

And where was Harry supposed to live if not with the Dursley? With some magical family who would either spoil the "Boy-Who-Lived", try to kill him for their old Master or raise him as his replacement? Maybe someone like Moody who would teach him how to defend himself (or make him totally Parano√Ød)? Or maybe some Ministry lackey who would absolutely not try to use his guardianship of the BWL to advance his career.

Harry childhood may have sucked, but he still came out from the Dursley way better adjusted than he would have been with most other guardians. A snarky but otherwise normal kid is better than a mini Moody or that arrogant prick we always his brother as in pretty much any WBWL fics.
