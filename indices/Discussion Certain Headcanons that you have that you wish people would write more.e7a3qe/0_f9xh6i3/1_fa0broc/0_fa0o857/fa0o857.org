This is one I've been reading on HPFT: Saboteurs by Aphoride. I don't know that she's on AO3 or FFN.

I wrote a Percy during DH fic where he's much more passive because it's more focused on the internal struggle and his complicity in what the Ministry is doing, but after I learned of the spy Percy theory I frankly think I like that more than my own headcanon! There are a few stories on AO3 tagged “spy Percy,” and I hope to read them all soon. Might be a good place to start!
