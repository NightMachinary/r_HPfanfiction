I like varied opinions in Slytherin. I know the token good guy in the bad house is overdone but I would like to see some of the house prefer not to join Voldemort. Not necessarily becoming a hero (who ends up dating Hermione) but being somewhere in the middle ground. I really have a soft spot for Theo and Blaise being indifferent to blood politics and just wanting to do well in school and have fun.
