Agree, there are many alternative story routes for the "blood question" to take.

Imagine purebloods who are only too keen to bring Muggleborns deeply into the fold earlier in their lives, because they recognise the need for a wider gene pool but want to neutralise the cultural threat. Not hard to see how that could become a villainous "greater good" scheme.
