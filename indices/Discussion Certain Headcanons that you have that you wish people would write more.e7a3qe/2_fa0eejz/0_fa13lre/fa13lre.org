Better yet an explanation for their political beliefs other than 'fuck you mudblood, you're dirty.'

I've always found that plot potential fascinating. There are very good reasons to integrate muggleborns into society- the gene pool is small so more genetic variance helps, and if you want to keep magic secret you can't have a bunch of untrained magicians running around casting accidental spells.

On the other hand there could be legitimate tensions bringing them in. The Wizarding population has been separated from the Muggle world for 300 years by the start of the story, and considering how much our own culture has changed since then it isn't unreasonable to assume Magical Culture could have varied nearly as much, with the minimal contact many had with Muggles. (Even Arthur, a Muggle Enthusiast, is comically under-informed).

Think of Hermione as kind of an examplar of the best and worst Muggleborns have to offer. One on hand academically brilliant and magically powerful, on the other hand unorthodox and reform minded. The underlying History, magic and lore of the House Elf bonds are never really explored and Hermione's S.P.E.W. campaign wants to upend it entirely. Irrespective about how we feel about House Elves, I can see a lot of traditional Wizards saying "Who the hell are you to tell us how to run our society, upstart?"

There could be tensions over socioeconomic status as well- Purebloods and Halfbloods are more established in the system where Muggleborns have to jump right in without the connections or access to magical resources. Muggleborns could resent policies that hold them back while Purebloods could fear them being overturned.

The blood question could actually be mined for a lot of meaningful political discourse if it wasn't centered on a psychopath who is more or less exploiting the tension for his own gain and the most batshit crazy of his followers.
