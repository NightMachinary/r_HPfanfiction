Time turners being actually quite useful and safe. The stories of people wiping themselves from history are just to prevent people from messing around with very expensive items.

Edit: Headcanon about time paradoxes is that they just don't happen, if there was any danger of that happening they wouldn't give time turners out to third years. I think if you tried to go back to change the past things would just happen coincidentally just so that it appears that everything happened as it already happened.
