That'd honestly make the most sense with the Professors at any rate. I'd imagine Hogwarts to have anywhere from 800 to 1,000 students, the Professors would have to use Time Turners in order to not only teach, but to stop fights, be there for detention, grade papers et cetra.

Would explain how Umbridge would be in the Defence Class, while also looking over the other Professor's jobs.
