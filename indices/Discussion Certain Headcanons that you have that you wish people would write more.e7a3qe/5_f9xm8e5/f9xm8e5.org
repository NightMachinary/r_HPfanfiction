Fred is (and I can't stress this enough) */ALIVE/*. It would've been a perfect scene if Percy had died just after returning to his family and apologising. He makes his first (and last) joke- and boom- dead. Fred and Ron are crying over his mangled body, Harry and Hermione are shocked. Then some random Death Eaters come along and Fred and Ron fly into a rage (with dramatic music) and absolutely destroy them. Seriously, it's like Rowling never watched a war movie.
