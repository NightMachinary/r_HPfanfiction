Remus is by and far the rarity, most Werewolves are either mindless beast men or they are closer to Greyback, same things with Vampires and Sanguni, these gentle men are rarities.

Everyone says Gryffindors are idiots when in reality Gryffindors are really taking measured pushes and moves, even ones that sacrifice themselves, it's easy to theorize a battle plan with no risk to anyone or sit back and dictate a live one without putting yourselves at risk or trusting those who you are loyal too not put you in danger but it takes a fucked up Individual to see a plan that will get you killed, know this and still go "yeah its better this way than if you asked someone who will chicken out last second" basically Gryffindors who believe the needs of the many out weight the needs of the few or the one and are capable of being those few or one to save the many
