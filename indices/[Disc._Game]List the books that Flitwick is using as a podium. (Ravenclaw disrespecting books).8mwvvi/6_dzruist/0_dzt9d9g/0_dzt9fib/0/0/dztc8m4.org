It wouldn't have been a case of hedging their bets. Plenty of Norman noblemen - finding that they had rights and duties on both sides of the channel now - split the inheritance among their children. All it would have taken was for Armand Malfoy to have two sons. When he died, one son, (probably the elder) would get his French possessions, and the younger son would get the English stuff in Wiltshire where our contemporary Malfoys live.
