Yes, yes, I know this. :)

But we were talking about Armand Malfoy. if we're talking about Armand specifically, he predates /Quia Emptores/ by more than a century. Just because the modern Malfoys that we know of have had just the one son per generation is no reason to assume that the Malfoy progenitor who came over with William the Bastard would stop at one. Armand is actually arguably better served by having several, as it allows him to divide the inheritance and the feudal duties that come with it into much more manageable chunks.

It would be totally believable for there to still be a Malfoy branch in France after Armand left for England - even if there wasn't one on the day he left, any sons he had after that date would very likely have claim to lands in France as well as England, and take possession accordingly. How long that branch /survives/, I have no idea, but it would be there for a while.
