  A powerful pureblood family would probably want a lot of kids, as lots of kids means lots of ties to other prominent families through marriages, ties to the government, in earlier times before the Statute of Secrecy probably ties to the church..lots of kids gives them lots of opportunities to gather influence.

It ... does and it doesn't. History of The English Legal System time: up until the statute /Quia Emptores/ of 1290, having a big family isn't a bad idea. You can subinfeudinate new manors* out of your land grant so that land split between several sons remained 'in the family' because the cadet branches of the family become your liege people. After the Statute, newly parcelled-out manors (if any) are held of your liege lord, not of you as tenant-in-chief. Which means that cadet lines, if they come up spendthrift, end up selling out to bigger players and you get 800lb gorillas like York and Lancaster.

That starts the trend toward the practise of "an heir, a spare, and a daughter" becoming the ideal. Second and third sons can be sent off to the church or to make their fortunes overseas, but they still require maintenance - late mediaeval/early modern 'remittance men' - which are a net drain on the family wealth. Wouldn't do to have one of your brats turn up a pauper somewhere, after all. Your grandchildren you can be a bit more lackadaisical about, but poor relations are still something of an embarrassment for later generations. Best to keep the cadet branches of the family to a minimum: connections and power are all very well, but they are things of the moment. Keeping the land and wealth in the family was far more serious business.

The dodges and legalities required to tie down an estate more than you could manage with simple inheritance-by-primogeniture gave rise to Uses, which in turn begat Trusts, Settlements and Entailments which in the corrupt and scheming cauldron of the Court of Chancery** became modern estate planning law which, up until the 1925 reforms required the very supplest of legal minds to navigate. It's still a bit of a maze of twisty little precedents, all alike, but up until the 19th Century Chancery was its own separate jurisdiction with its own rules and now I'm having horrible flashbacks to my Equity And Law Of Trusts final so I'm going to stop.

* Which is NOT a big house, umpty million fanfics about wizarding homes notwithstanding. The Big House of Blackacre Manor might be called Blackacre Manor House, but it usually wasn't. Naming traditions vary by region: where I live they're usually called Whatever Hall, or if fortified, Example Tower.
