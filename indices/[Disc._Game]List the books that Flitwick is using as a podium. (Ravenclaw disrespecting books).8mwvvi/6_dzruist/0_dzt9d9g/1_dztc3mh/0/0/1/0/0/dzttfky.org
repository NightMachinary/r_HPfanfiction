Totally not going to touch french mediaeval estate planning :) My ability to spin horror stories about generational resettlements and the fiendishness of Chancery pales, /pales/ I say, against the insanity that the Kingdom of France practised among its upper crust. Not least because they didn't have a common law for the whole nation until Napoleon's time, so inheritances could and did become dodecahedral conflict-of-laws problems, when a lord had holdings - as mesne tenant or tenant-in-chief, and that was /another/ wrinkle - in six different jurisidictions, made his will in a seventh and died on crusade. You could be forgiven for thinking that a lot of the warfare was down to sheer frustration.
