The only Malfoys we've met are Lucius, Draco and (sort of) Scorpius. Before Lucius's birth in the 1950s, we have no idea what the family looked like, and no reason to assume that they've only ever had one son at a time.

A powerful pureblood family would probably /want/ a lot of kids, as lots of kids means lots of ties to other prominent families through marriages, ties to the government, in earlier times before the Statute of Secrecy probably ties to the church..lots of kids gives them lots of opportunities to gather influence.
