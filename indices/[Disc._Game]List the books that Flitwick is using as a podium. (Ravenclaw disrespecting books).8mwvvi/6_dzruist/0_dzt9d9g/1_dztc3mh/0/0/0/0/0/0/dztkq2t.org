It's a bit more complex than that.

Thorne, Tiffany and Rowling co-write a short story. It was always collaborative - which makes it very different from the original books - and Rowling's input seemed to be mostly in allowing them to use characters and concepts she'd already created, rather than adding anything new. All the new stuff came from Thorne and Tiffany.

That's where the debate comes in. If all the new material the play offers is made up by sources that aren't Jo, is that canon or high end fanfic?

We don't usually consider /Death Comes to Pemberley/ as canon for /Pride and Prejudice/ for much the same reason. We COULD, but we usually don't. Legal permission from the copyright holder to use the existing stuff, but any new stuff cane from a new author, so what is it?

Thorne then later adapted the short story into a script for the stage.

Personally I have no clear opinion. I haven't seen the play yet, and I don't want to make up my mind until I do...BUT I can see why debate might exist, and until that's resolved I'll call it a maybe rather than a definite yes or no.
