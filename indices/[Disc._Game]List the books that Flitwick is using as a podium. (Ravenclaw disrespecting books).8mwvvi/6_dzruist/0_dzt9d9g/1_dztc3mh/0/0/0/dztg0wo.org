What do you mean, "sort of"? He /is/ a pretty major character in Book the Eighth, isn't he? All discussions of said book's quality aside.

  A powerful pureblood family would probably want a lot of kids, as lots of kids means lots of ties to other prominent families through marriages, ties to the government, in earlier times before the Statute of Secrecy probably ties to the church..lots of kids gives them lots of opportunities to gather influence.

A fair point, but my thinking for /why/ the three generations of Malfoys we know only had one child each is that they didn't want to risk splitting the family fortune and estate.
