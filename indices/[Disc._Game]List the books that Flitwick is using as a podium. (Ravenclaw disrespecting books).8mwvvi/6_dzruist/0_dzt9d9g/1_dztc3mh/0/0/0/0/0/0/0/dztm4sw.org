The comparison with /Pemberley///Pride and Prejudice/ might not be entirely valid, however, because of a point I made that you didn't adress: Jane Austen didn't (indeed, phyiscally couldn't have, due to, er, being dead for a century) make a tweet where she specifically told her fans that /Death Comes to Pemberley/ was canon. Whereas Rowling /did/.
