Hm, I see. Personally I'm always inclined to a wide canon; but either way, Rowling /has/ said that /she/ considers the story of /Cursed Child/ canon, so I don't see why the loose plot of it wouldn't have the same level of canonicity as any other Word of God we've gotten on Twitter or /Pottermore/. Note that she said "story", which conveniently allows us to fudge any details that are too ridiculous; Delphini doubtless exists, but maybe Ron holding his wand backwards or Albus Severus saying he doesn't like Quidditch was just an embellishment.

(Also and thirdly, didn't Rowling write down the plot of /Cursed Child/ before Thorne and Tiffany expanded it into a play?)
