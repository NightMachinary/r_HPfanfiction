Almost certainly. William's force that he took to England was not very big, about 7000-8000 men by most estimates. Armand Malfoy would be one of these, but he'd have left plenty of relatives behind - brothers, sons, etc.

If Armand had two sons, he might well have given his French lands to one of them and his English lands to the other. Plenty of real Norman noblemen did this, and in at least one case it solved an incipient problem - that of Robert de Beaumont, who had twin sons. Robert gave the larger, more valuable and older French title of Count of Meulan to the elder twin Waleran, and most of the English possessions (Earl of Leicester among them) that he'd scored through the Norman Conquest went to the younger twin Robert.
