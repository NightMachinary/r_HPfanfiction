Eh, Hermione has a general competency paired with attention to detail that gives her a lot of standard solutions and some clever tricks. These things escape Harry because he doesn't have a studious nature.

However, with knowledge that he already knows Harry is far more competent at application. He's also better at decision-making under pressure and courage under fire. I'd also argue that he's a better teacher, but that can't be proven one way or another.

Also, flying.
