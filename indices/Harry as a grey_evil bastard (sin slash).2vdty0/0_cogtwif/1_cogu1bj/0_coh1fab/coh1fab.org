I can't explain too much without giving away spoilers, but through a big chunk of it I just wanted Harry to get back to the Harry we love, the Harry that wouldn't DO that, dammit!

It's a very well-developed story, with aspects to magic I haven't seen elsewhere, new characters that I didn't mind because they were so well written, and a lot of plots and subplots going throughout the whole thing.
