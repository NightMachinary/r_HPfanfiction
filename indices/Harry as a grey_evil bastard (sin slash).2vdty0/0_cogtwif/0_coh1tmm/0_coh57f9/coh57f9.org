I'd have to go back and look, but that sounds about right. Harry's still in school for part of the first one, and then starting Auror training. It isn't until he's a bit into his training that his demons start to overpower him. I read all three back to back so I don't quite remember where each one starts and ends, but I enjoyed them all.
