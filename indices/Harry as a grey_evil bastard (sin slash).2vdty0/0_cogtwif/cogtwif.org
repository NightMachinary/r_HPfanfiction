I haven't read the denarian series, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/562135/GreenGecko][Greengecko's]] Resonance/Revolution/Resolution series is one that I enjoyed, but at times was really uncomfortable with Harry's lack of control over his...less moral leanings. I hated seeing Harry act like that, but couldn't stop reading because the story is so engaging. He's really quite evil for a time. Harry is adopted by Snape, and both are straight--wonder of wonders!
