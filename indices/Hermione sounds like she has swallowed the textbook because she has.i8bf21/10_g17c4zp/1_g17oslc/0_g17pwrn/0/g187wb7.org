You just come on threads to throw shade for absolutely no reason. No joke, literally every comment I see of yours, whether on the discord or this subreddit, is either about how much you hate hermione, how much you hate Harmony, how much you hate fans of either or sneakily throwing shade in requests or comments by doing the same covertly.

But you are so calcified in your opinions that you will just ignore people telling you, and/or call them stans when it cuts particularily deep. I have never met a harmony fan that is so obsessed with hermione as you are.

It's just unnecessary. Stuff like your first comment on the post - why make it? It's a specific, tailored request, and you come in to spread hate under the guise of some haha funny joke.
