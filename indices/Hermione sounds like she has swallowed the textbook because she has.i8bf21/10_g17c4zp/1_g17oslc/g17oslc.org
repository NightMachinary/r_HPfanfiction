I have no problems with this prompt.

just- Dude, seriously, don't you have anything better to do than comment on every single thread about Hermione how awful she is and how everyone who doesn't hate her like you obviously do is a rabid fanboy and a terrible person?

Even your flair is about Hermione. Cringe.
