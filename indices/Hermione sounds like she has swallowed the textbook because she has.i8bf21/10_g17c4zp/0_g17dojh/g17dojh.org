I think it would be a cool piece of accidental magic for her.

Other types of accidental magic I could see being cool thing for kid Hermione to do is stuff like Animating her books so they can read themselves to her or doing something like Legilimency on a book and diving into it to go on adventures with with her favorite characters or visit the places in her books.
