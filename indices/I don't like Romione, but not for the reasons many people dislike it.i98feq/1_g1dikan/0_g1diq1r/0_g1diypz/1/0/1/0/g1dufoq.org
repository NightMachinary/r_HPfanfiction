Dude, that ain't true. And I don't mean that those ships are terrible, because, to each their own and all that shit even if I don't agree, but SIYE, a site exclusively for a canon ship, has survived for 17 years if I'm correct. Canon fics can survive quite easily, and add in some AU and it is invincible.
