An inherent aspect of fiction is its complete lack of originality. Stories are just continuations of age-old literary traditions that were defined thousands of years ago, they're all built on moral platitudes and preexisting narrative structures that have become synonymous with writing itself. I don't fucking care if you borrow elements from the works of other writers so long as you transform their ideas into something unique that lends credibility to your own creative nous. GRRM nicked entire character arcs from other authors without really doing anything unique with them; they were just absorbed into his amorpheous blob of a story which is void of both potency and intellectual profundity.

Compare Paul Atreides to Jon Snow for example:

  The Fremen are a group of people in the fictional Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. First appearing in the 1965 novel Dune, the Fremen inhabit the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), which is the sole known source in the universe of the all-important spice melange. Long overlooked by the rest of the Imperium and considered backward savages, in reality they are an extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers. The Fremen had come to the planet thousands of years before the events of the novel as the Zensunni Wanderers, a religious sect in retreat. As humans in extremis, over time they adapted their culture and way of life to survive and thrive in the incredibly harsh conditions of Arrakis. The Fremen are distinguished by their fierce fighting abilities. Paul and the Atreides come to the desert planet Arrakis, but Paul's father Duke Leto is soon killed by the Harkonnens and Paul and his mother Lady Jessica are forced to flee into the desert. They are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the planet's native Fremen, and Chani is the Fremen woman put in charge of protecting and guiding Paul. They soon become lovers, and Paul rises as a religious leader among the Fremen, and is called Muad'Dib.

  I read this book series entitled Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, and Game of Thrones is a complete rip-off of it. So many similarities it is almost like a incest loving fan fic. There's a Storm King (Night King) who brings the winter and wants to wipe out mankind. He used to be a person. He has the semi-immortal white haired Norns working for him (White Walkers) and he raises the army of the dead to fight for him. He also has giants. There's a one handed prince, horse lords, a red comet in the sky, a princess who escapes north dressed as a boy and disguises herself later as “Marya”, there are dragons, white haired “Targaryen” fairy like folk called the Sithi, there are three special swords that the main character, supposedly a peasant boy named Simon (You see where this is going Jon Snow) weilds one of. The other is made from a fallen star (Dawn).

IMO this goes beyond 'borrowing' structural elements from your fellow peers, but I suppose that's up for debate depending on who you ask.
