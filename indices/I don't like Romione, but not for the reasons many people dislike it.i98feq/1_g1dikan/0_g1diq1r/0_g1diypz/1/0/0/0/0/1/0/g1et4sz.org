Oh, so Dune has the Going Native Trope too? You know, that thing that is also done in Dances With Wolves, and James Cameron's Avatar, as two examples right off of my head? It's a relatively common plot thread in story telling.

As for Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn,

#+begin_quote
  he raises the army of the dead
#+end_quote

Wow, a necromancer in a fantasy series! How Crazy! Aren't Orcs in LOTR just undead Elves? Right?

#+begin_quote
  He also has giants.
#+end_quote

Giants in a fantasy series! How unique!

#+begin_quote
  There's a one handed prince
#+end_quote

A one-handed character is not a rarity in fiction. Jamie Lannister is also not a Prince.

#+begin_quote
  horse lords
#+end_quote

The Mongols would like a word with you. Also the Riders of Rohan.

#+begin_quote
  a red comet in the sky
#+end_quote

A celestial body as a sign of, perhaps, a promised Savior? Now Jesus would like a word with you.

#+begin_quote
  princess who escapes north dressed as a boy and disguises herself later as “Marya”
#+end_quote

Now that's just common sense for a woman in any medieval based fantasy with bandits and cutthroats as a threat. Also, a woman dressed as a man? Lord of the Rings did that too!

#+begin_quote
  there are dragons
#+end_quote

Again, common fantasy trope. Also in Lord of the Rings.

#+begin_quote
  white haired “Targaryen” fairy like folk called the Sithi,
#+end_quote

That's not at all what the Targaryens are, but okay. Not sure how an incest ridden line of mentally unstable dragon tamers can be compared to faires.

#+begin_quote
  there are three special swords that the main character, supposedly a peasant boy named Simon (You see where this is going Jon Snow) weilds one of.
#+end_quote

Wow, a special sword. How very unique to this particular series, and to no other series or historical myth in all of history. /s

Seriously, though. Excaibur. The Sword in the Stone. Every Hero on their hero's journey has one, especially if they're from a royal/ magical bloodline. It's not at all unique. Aragorn had one too.

#+begin_quote
  The other is made from a fallen star (Dawn).
#+end_quote

Again, Space Swords. Not exactly unique. It's a concept that captures the imagination. In fact, there are four known blades in real life that are actually made of meteorite.

Look, sorry for the mounds of sarcasm, but seriously, the fantasy genre gets inspiration from a few main sources: Lord of the Rings (And through it, Christianity), world mythology, and world history.

Everything's been done before. Half the things from Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn that you listed, was probably inspired by LOTR.
