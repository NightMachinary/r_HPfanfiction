Man, if I ever got published and people wrote fanfics of my stuff I'd be so honored. Even if they butchered everything.

Hell, to help with learning my characters I've written “fanfictions” of my own stuff as writing exercises. It's also something my friend and I do when we have writers block, we'll write our characters interacting to give us a jolt again.

I'm so offended. Fanfiction has helped me so much in writing to keep my characters in character and my plots consistent!
