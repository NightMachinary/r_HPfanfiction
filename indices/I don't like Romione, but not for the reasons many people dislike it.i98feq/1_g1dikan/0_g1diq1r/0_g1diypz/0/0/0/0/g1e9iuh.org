Ah right. Now that you mention it I think I read something like that before.

Its kinda funny through. How the only whose reputation was ruined by that past story was James. While Sirius is still loved by everyone, even when he was always egging James or directly doing bad stuff to Snape himself (Probably because we at least got to know his adult charismatic crazy self, while James was just dead from the start).

And the same with Lupin, who even without participating never did anything to stop them and even laughed about it from a distance.
