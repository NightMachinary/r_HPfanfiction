Yeah, these days. It wasn't long ago that the opposite was true, and any mention of Romione was downvoted (sometimes happens still), and there was at least one popular post per week about how the bad the ship was. The downvoters swing both ways in this instance, and you'll find that Harmione posts without Ron bashing or diminishing do fine still.
