I've always felt they were simply wrong for each other. Good for a teenage fling, maybe, but if it was real life they'd never get married.

He needed someone who would appreciate and admire him, while Hermione often scolded him over every little thing and treated him with condescension. And she underestimated him, like /a lot/.

She needed someone who would challenge her, someone as driven and passionate about stuff as her. Someone who would support her instead of laughing at her dedication and ambition the way Ron often does in canon.

I love them both as characters, just not together.
