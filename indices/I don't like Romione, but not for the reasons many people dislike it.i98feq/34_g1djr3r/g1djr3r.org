I'm not sure. I dislike Ron/Hr also, but that's mostly because Hermione is my favorite girl in the series, so I want her to have a really great hubby.

Ron and Hermione, though, might actually work /because/ Ron is so mediocre. I mean, we all agree Hr is super ambitious and extremely intelligent. Ron - unmotivated, humorous, average in every way - might be someone that can just exist to emotionally support his wife.

I mean, Harry or someone with more ability and intelligence would also have drive and ambition. Ron is the kind of wizard that ends up stocking shelves at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. He'd have nothing going on but keeping Hr happy.
