She never actually /did/ his homework for him. She, helped, yes, correcting mistakes. But if she'd done all his homework, he wouldn't have known shit, and wouldn't have performed the way he did on those tests. And he most certainly would not have become an Auror or a prank inventor without that knowledge and intelligence. (I'd say that inventing stuff requires originality, innovation and thinking outside of the box, a different sort of intelligence that Hermione doesn't seem capable of. She is a by-the-book girl)

I do definitely agree that Hermione would overshadow him, but then again, she overshadows everyone academically anyway, and that Ron might be feeling insecure because of it. I also do agree that they're not a good fit as a pair, but I don't agree that Ron is stupid or unintelligent.
