I'm not going to address the issue of their compatibility, aside from a note of my belief in their compatibility.

But I'd note that by definitions of competency, Ron is competent and skilled with magic. His OWL scores are firmly above average and he qualifies as an auror, a branch noted for the difficulty of entrance. He does this well after spending a year with an unideal wand and a year with a wand that is straight up broken. He does this maintaining a healthy life/study balance. Additionally, like it or not, chess skill is correlated with intelligence.

Compare this to Hermione, whose vaunted intelligence and extreme study habits net her imperfect OWL scores, no academic accolades of any note, and and whose combat performance is incredibly horrid for the supposed magical skill she possesses. Hermione mutes a death eater and immediately disregards him, having studied to a level where silent casting is taught. Ron duels three death eaters and ends up with a less severe injury than Hermione. While clearly not in the right mind, he manages a summoning spell.
