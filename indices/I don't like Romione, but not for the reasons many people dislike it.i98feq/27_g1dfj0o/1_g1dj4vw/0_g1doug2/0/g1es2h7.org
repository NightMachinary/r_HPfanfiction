Yeah, that might have been a bit hyperbolic on my part. I was one of those people that saw an A minus as a bad grade.

Yeah, she outperformed Ron and Harry. But she also spent incredible amounts of time studying. That's not what I consider to be intelligence. High intelligence is Sirius Black or James Potter, where you can achieve exceptional grades with little to no studying. High intelligence is Dumbledore, researching and earning awards.

I truly do not mean to bash Hermione. I consider bashing lazy writing. But I also truly don't believe that Hermione is that much more intelligent than Ron or Harry. Sure, she may possess far more knowledge than either, but that comes through dedication and hard work rather than natural intelligence. This isn't a bad thing.
