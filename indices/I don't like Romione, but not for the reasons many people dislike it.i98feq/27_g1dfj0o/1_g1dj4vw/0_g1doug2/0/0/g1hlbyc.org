  Yeah, that might have been a bit hyperbolic on my part. I was one of those people that saw an A minus as a bad grade.

I know how you feel. By any chance were your parents the kind who upon seeing an A- asked why you didn't get an A+?

  Yeah, she outperformed Ron and Harry. But she also spent incredible amounts of time studying. That's not what I consider to be intelligence. High intelligence is Sirius Black or James Potter, where you can achieve exceptional grades with little to no studying. High intelligence is Dumbledore, researching and earning awards.

  I truly do not mean to bash Hermione. I consider bashing lazy writing. But I also truly don't believe that Hermione is that much more intelligent than Ron or Harry. Sure, she may possess far more knowledge than either, but that comes through dedication and hard work rather than natural intelligence. This isn't a bad thing.

I think dedication is part of it, certainly, but I don't think you can look at ten Os and 1 E and say that it was mostly down to dedication rather than intelligence. Especially not when talking about a girl who seems to have a perfect memory, has never had trouble understanding magical theory, got 120% on her first Charms exam and managed to---among other things---successfully brew Polyjuice Potion at the age of 13 and cast a very good Protean Charm that, we are told, is N.E.W.T. level stuff before even taking her O.W.L.s.

I think the difference between Hermione and, say, the Marauders and Dumbledore can be explained as a lack of desire to experiment, not to mention that if Rowling had shown her getting awards and doing research she would have been, compared to everyone else around her, too overpowered.
