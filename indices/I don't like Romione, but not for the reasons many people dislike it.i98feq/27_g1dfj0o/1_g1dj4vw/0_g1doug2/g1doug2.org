  Compare this to Hermione, whose vaunted intelligence and extreme study habits net her imperfect OWL scores

I am all for defending Ron, but there's no need to bash Hermione while doing it, especially if you're going to lie while doing it. Imperfect OWL scores? She got ten Outstandings and only one Exceeds Expectations. She outperformed both Ron and Harry, and probably everyone else in her year.
