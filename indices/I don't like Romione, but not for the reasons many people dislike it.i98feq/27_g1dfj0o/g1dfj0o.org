Ron isn't very motivated, skilled with magic, or intellectually competent(chess isn't everything). Just because he makes Hermione laugh a bit means he is suited for her. Their arguing just shows that they can't stand to be around each other. He would be overshadowed by Hermione's INTELLIGENCE and her outperforming him. We all know Ron hates it when she does that. He simply isn't suited to her because of his lackluster abilities. And they are always arguing. Even if they somehow got together, they'd break up. She's be too annoyed about him complaining too much. Or that he was playing too much chess. Long story short, I agree.
