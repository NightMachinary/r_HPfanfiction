Well, we know they had feelings for each other throughout most of the series, so if we ignore the question “whether or not they like each other” we can focus on “Would they work well together?”

And I think they would. Hermione pushes Ron to be better at things, and he in turn shows her that she needs to lighten up sometimes. They're always keeping each other in check ( Think: “ARE YOU A WITCH/WIZARD OR NOT??!” ) Also, I think you're right that Ron wants to be recognized on his own and not overshadowed, but I think he might not care as long as SHE have him the recognition he deserved.

Not to mention, she WOULD support him and believe in him whenever he does stuff (Think: Quidditch tryouts, she wishes him luck, gives him a kiss on the cheek)

In the end, they're not perfect, but what couple is?
