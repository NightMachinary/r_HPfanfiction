I think Ron grew a lot throughout the series. That's the only reason I can even see Ron and Hermione together in the first place. I definitely think your points are valid, but only up to a certain point. Ron became way more mature mentally and physically by the end of the series, and most likely even after that. I think he was less focused on being overshadowed and most focused on just finding a way for himself and his friends to be happy after all they went through.
