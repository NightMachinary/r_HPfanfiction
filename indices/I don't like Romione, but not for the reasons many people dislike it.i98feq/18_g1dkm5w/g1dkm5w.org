I always had a hard time seeing why Rowling put Hermione with Ron. Harmony is one of my ships and I honestly always thought she'd end up with Harry at the end of the series and was shocked to see her with Ron. Hermione needs someone who can keep up with her and Ron just never seemed like he could, despite his admittance into the auror program. How much of his admittance was due to him being a part of the golden trio and how much of it was based on his intellect? I mean, he would have never turned in his homework if it wasn't for Hermione nagging him about getting it done.
