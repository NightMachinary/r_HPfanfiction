She does make her decision by choosing Ron, yes. I personally am not a Romine shipper but I don't hate the pairing. I did find it interesting that Rowling later admitted in an interview that she regretted putting Hermione and Ron together. Sometimes authors keep characters together and not everyone agrees with that. Luckily there is fanfiction and there are tons of pairings that I probably don't like nearly as much as Hermione and Ron together.

I believe in the interview she said “for reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it Hermione ended up with Ron.”

And you're right Ron is a war hero and a successful businessman. I'm not saying that he's not successful in his own right I'm just saying that in my personal opinion which of course doesn't mean anything on the Internet I don't see them as a good pairing.
