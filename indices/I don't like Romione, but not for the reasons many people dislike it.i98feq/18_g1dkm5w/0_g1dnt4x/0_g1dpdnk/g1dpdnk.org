From what little we see in the epilogue (when they aren't teenagers), their relationship seems odd. Like, especially the whole driving exam thing proves that there's some kind of mismatch in communications and so out of place.

Like, if you want to dump on Ron and have him act with the casual disregard a death Eater would show a Muggle, why bring him back in the first place? I don't get the purpose of the scene, Ron commits fraud (cheating on a driving exam is fraud in the UK as far as I can research), magically assaults a Muggle and what for? Bragging rights to his wife.
