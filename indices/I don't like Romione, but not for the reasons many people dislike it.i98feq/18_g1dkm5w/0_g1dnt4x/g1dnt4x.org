Why does she need someone who can keep up with her and what does that mean exactly? Ron was a war hero, accomplished Auror and later successful businessman. How is that not "keeping up" with Hermione's successes?

The other thing that's important to note is Hermione is going to decide for herself if she needs an ambitious partner. And funnily enough, canon tells us that Hermione does not actually care that her partner be as smart or ambitious as her. She was into Ron pretty intensely despite knowing exactly how "lazy" or "dumb" he was.
