First off that's BROTHER, singular, I know you are trying to downplay Ron's achievement but you don't have to blatantly ignore canon while you are it.

Second - All indications we get via Pottermore or expanded universe plants Ron as an equal to his brother when it comes to the joke shop. Sure there are jokes about his brother thinking little of him in Half Blood Prince - but a war won and some maturing done he proved himself to be as loved and as much of an equal as any of the other brothers.

Lets ignore that the "joke shop" is largely stated to be the most successeful business in magic britain as of the end of the series - almost expanding to Hogsmeade per the time of Half Blood Prince and making enough money for the twins to use real dragon leather skin jackets, but it pisses me off how you not only throw shade at Ron for working for family (despite the fact that he is good at what he does -) but also that you need to throw him under the bus.

I'm not a fan of Ron in particular - he reminds me too much of me - insecure, easy to anger, jealous - I see in him a reflectino of my worst qualities - but this is what I hate about shippers - they can't love a pairing without throwing a character in the shit.

Why can't you write Dramione or Harmony without making Ron to be a monster? It's perfectly feasible - immensely so, that Ron and Hermione tried it, it didn't work out, they remain friends - It's very much less believable that Hermione found Ron was still cheating on her with Lavender Brown and oh by the way - he's suddenly a blood supremacist who thinks someone like "her" should not be better positioned than her (and yes, while I won't name names -. I've had that happen in a fic I read). People grow apart, sometimes things don't work out - but that doesn't mean the ex is a monster the likes never seen since Umbridge. C'mon!
