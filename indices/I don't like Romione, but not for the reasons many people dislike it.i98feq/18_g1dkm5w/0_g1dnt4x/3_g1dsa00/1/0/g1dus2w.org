  First off that's BROTHER, singular,

Oof, right in the feels

This is an important point though. Ron's youngest-son syndrome isn't helped by being an employee of an older brothers' business as opposed to striking out on his own. Even Ron, fellow auror felt a bit too much like remaining Harry's sidekick.

I'd prefer Quidditch for Ron, that's where he got self confidence on his own towards the end, it's a well established interest regardless of his siblings' sharing it, and the never followed up on chess-as-strategist thing could serve well as a Captain or coach.

DeliverMeFromEve is an HHr author who seems to like Ron more than JKR does

I agree, Ron bashing is super unnecessary and more common than I'd like.
