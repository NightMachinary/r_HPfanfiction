Agreed. Ron and Hermione don't even have anything common other than Harry and Hogwarts. Ron is very laid-back, preferring play over work, and has deep insecurities and doubts about himself. Insecurities that'll only become more self-destructing if he remains under the shadow of someone who's indefinitely better at everything than him. Hermione on the other hand, is very focused and determined and doesn't like to waste time. She'll find it nothing more than a waste of time if she stays with Ron, it'll feel like she's getting dragged back by his slowness.

Ron would be much better off with someone who, first and foremost, likes him for who he is, rather than who he should be. Hermione doesn't have that for Ron - he barely scratched E.E. in his OWLs with her help, and didn't bother to finish his NEWTs - she doesn't shy away from making her stance clear on what she thinks of his laziness. I genuinely think that Lavendar would've been a great pair for him. She loved and respected him, and was more drawn towards Ron's personality rather than Ron's abilities.
