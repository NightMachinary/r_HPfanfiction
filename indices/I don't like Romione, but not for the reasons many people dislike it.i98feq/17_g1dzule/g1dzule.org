  Ron was a bit of an underachiever who wanted to be recognized for his skills instead of being overshadowed.

I disagree with this statement. The idea that Ron is a underachiever or an everyman has always baffled me. He found him to be neither of those things. As early as the first book, we see a bravery in Ron that is certainly extraordinary. He voluntarily gets hit in the head by a stone sword at the age of 11. There is no reason for the reader or Ron himself to believe that this wouldn't kill him, but he does it anyway. That is not a characteristic of an everyman.

Secondly, I disagree with the idea that Ron wanted to be "recongized for his skills". I thought that up until the locket scene in book 7. It was there that I realized that Ron felt that he had no value. He felt like he never really had a seat at the table. We see that growth in the epilogue. He makes a joke about the people at the train staring at him, when they are really staring at Harry. He's comfortable not being "the guy".

  I think Rowling mentioned somewhere than Ron and Hermione might need couples counceling.

I hate that this line is treated as the end of relationship, and not just in this instance. Marriage counseling is common, probably more so for two people who have fought in war. I don't find this to be as big of a deal as others.

No relationship is perfect, doubly so at 17. From a literary standpoint, none of the relationships are written particularly well. So, shipping is really up to personal experience and preference.
