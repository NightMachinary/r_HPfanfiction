Just sit down and think about and how manipulated harry was. Dumbledore admitted to placing him into that home to abuse and mold him to die. So once harry felt love something that would feel foreign to him from the Dursleys.

So If he was given heavily diluted love potions to only reinforce the feeling and then they stopped the potions he would still be addicted to feeling loved for who he is.

No matter if he starts losing that feeling of love and more for another they only have to give the diluted portion to him again to reinforce theirs.

Everyone comes at this as a stupid opinion but just sit back and think about it with an open mind after taking a philosophy or psychology class and you'll look at it differently and from a more clear picture that can show the different strings that are connected, but keep branching off.

J.K. Rowling encouraged fanfictions for people to create a different story or ending. She's not being greedy in protecting her art.

Instead she's encouraging others to start their own stories whether based off hers, or as a new creative story. Because if one person can inspire so many others to write about it, they pass on a seperate hope and encouragement others themselves need to get their wheels turning. An avalanches always start as a trickle.
