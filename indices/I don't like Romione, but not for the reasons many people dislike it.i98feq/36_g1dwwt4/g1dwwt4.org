I just think Molly and Dumbasdoor trained Ron and Ginny to try and befriend Harry and for Ginny to marry him via love potions. There's different parts in the books and movies where you can see that when Harry and Hermione aren't around Ron and Ginny there is a different demeanor in the way the characters act. Especially since Harry didn't really return Ginnys feeling then all of a sudden he did.
