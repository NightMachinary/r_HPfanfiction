I personally love Ron and Hermione as characters. However I hate them as a couple.

Hermione is book smart, she's driven, ambitious. She doesn't play around and is brutally honest when it comes to her opinions, and she's also a bit vicious in her actions (doesn't mean she's a bad person, it's just true).

Ron is more street smarts, he isn't an idiot but he's nowhere near Hermione's level. He more of an emotional guy than academic. He's laidback and easy-going.

Hermione needs someone to kind of banter with? Like someone that challenges her opinions, that keeps her on her toes? Somebody that pushes her to keep getting better. That doesn't make it easy for her. Someone that understands her ambition, her thirst for knowledge.

Ron like I said is more into the emotional aspects of things. He needs someone that's supportive, that values him, that doesn't underestimate him (which love her but Hermione does a lot). Someone caring, not too bossy and that believes in him. Someone that trusts him to take the lead.

So to me while Ron and Hermione make great friends, as a couple their dynamic feels kind of unbalanced.

Hermione can just kind of steam roll over Ron which would get annoying eventually. While Ron wouldn't get Hermione's need to be one of the best, or be able to keep her engaged mentally.

This is just my opinion though so... ðŸ¤·
