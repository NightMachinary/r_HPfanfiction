That's a valid opinion. Similarly, I think there's nothing wrong with being overshadowed by your wife if she is much smarter, much more accomplished, and in general, much more successful than you. While people may think that Ron and Hermione are incompatible because they bicker, they don't seem to have much in common, and Hermione is surrounded by men who are seemingly a much better "fit" for her, I don't think those people have seen enough relationships.

I've seen couples who are completely different people, who seem to argue all the time, but at the end of the day love each other deeply and bring out the best in each other. Anyway, at the end of the day, these are fictional characters. You can imagine whatever reasons you want for them either working out or not.
