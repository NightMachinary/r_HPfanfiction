Allow me to put in my oar for Ron and Luna.

Ron needs someone whose loyalty matches his own, someone with Luna's quiet fierceness. She needs someone with a big heart who can draw her out of the world she inhabits by herself, but also join her there. They make each other laugh. Luna is certainly not a Quidditch fanatic, but she is an enthusiastic supporter and her commentary is golden. She genuinely finds Ron's impressions hilarious. They are both kind and generous souls who place a high value on friendship. They both understand being overlooked on the sidelines and would make the other feel as though they were the only one in the room -- Luna with her singular focus, and Ron with open affection (once his self confidence has ascended from rock bottom, of course). They could also learn from each other -- Ron not to care what others think, and Luna to be at ease in a group.

Lastly, I think Luna joining the Weasley Clan would be absolutely adorable! It would certainly be overwhelming at first; Molly fussing over her, getting four older brothers, stumbling across experimental joke merchandise, the chaos that is the Burrow. I can see her getting along with Arthur well -- they're both fascinated by things that others scoff at and Arthur is more of a quiet soul, in contrast with Molly. But I think that, after growing accustomed to the Weasleys, Luna would thrive like Harry did. (Luna and Harry both spent most of their childhoods alone and a little overlooked. While Xeno loves Luna dearly, I imagine he would often get lost in his research, experiments, or grief for Pandora; I think that when she died, a great deal of joy and light left with her, causing Xeno to dull and Luna to spend a lot of time alone.)
