Teenage Ron and Hermione don't suit, you're right. I could see their characters evolving to become more compatible though. I think as an adult Ron loses his inadequacy complex and Hermione relaxes a bit. Ron makes her happy and soothes her worries- she's never not going to have too much on her plate so he's really good at bringing her back from a stress spiral. Ron can in turn talk about his achievements with her and relax, make her laugh which makes him feel good, etc. Once they're not teenagers going through a war and become more well-rounded adults, I could see them being capable of a strong healthy relationship.
