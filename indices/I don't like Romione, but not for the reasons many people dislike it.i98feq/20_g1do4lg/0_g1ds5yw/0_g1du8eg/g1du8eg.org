  That's my main issue with Hermione - her being intelligent is not enough to make her a good romantic partner, other characteristics need to be involved.

Some of the characteristics i listed above are not even something you find in a good friend also like nagging and physically assaulting them.

  She is a fan favorite mostly because she is the female protagonist and the only girl that is explored in-depth. Her stealing some of Book!Ron's character development in the movies and being played by an actress that is more conventionally attractive than how she was intended in the books also boosted her popularity.

Yep. This is how malfoy got so popular too. And how twilight got popular as well. Teenage and young adult girls lol. Maybe a sweeping generalization but no one can deny there isnt a pattern there.

  To me, Romione would be like Molly and Arthur - Hermione is in charge most of the time, but when it comes to things Ron cares about, he'll put his foot down. No matter how nice she seems, not many people can put up with a Molly Weasley in their life.

Agreed. Majority of men wouldn't want a wife like molly and majority of women wouldn't want a husband like malfoy or maybe the opposite if the reader demographics of "50 shades of grey" are to believed lol.
