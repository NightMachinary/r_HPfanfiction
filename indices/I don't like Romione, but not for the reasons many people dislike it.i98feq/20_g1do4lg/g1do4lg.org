I agree. But my reasons are different. I think hermione is the one who is not good for ron.

- Firstly she seems very controlling and domineering. This can be seen from how much she nags him and harry. No man wants a nagging woman.

- Secondly, she has show that she is not above physically harming him. In half blood prince both of them were free to go with anyone else, there was no contract between them. Yet when she saw him with lavender, what did she do? She attacked him with sharp pointed beaks of multiple birds. What if one of them poked his eye and turned him blind?

- Thirdly, I dont think she would be very supportive of ron even though he would probably be supportive of her.

Now onto Ron's supposed intelligence. Ron is almost at the level of harry intellectually. Both got the same number of owls. Harry did a bit better in defense though. Harry has the upper hand on both ron and hermione in terms of raw magical power. Now OWLs were standardized tests and ron got those score due to his own ability only and not not hermiones help. So if harry can keep up with hermione intellectually then ron can as well. Now about hermiones help with homework. I dont know why but people seem to forget that almost everytime she helped ron she helped harry too.

Hermione is someone who while brilliant at school would not be as brilliant outside of it. She has the least amount of instincts among the trio, and has shown to freeze up in crunch situations( no matter what the movies made you believe, that didn't happen in the books).

I would have been perfectly happy if JKR had not included this romantic BS altogether in the story and focused more on world building and a more solid plot. There is so much that can be done with this story but I feel a lot of the content in Books 6 and 7 was focused on bloody relationships.
