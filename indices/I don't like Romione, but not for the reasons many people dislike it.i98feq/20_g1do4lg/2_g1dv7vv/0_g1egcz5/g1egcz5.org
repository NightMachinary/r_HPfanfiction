I guess it depends on your interests mate. As a guy I find romance to be the most boring genre of all. I literally never pick up anything related to this genre and literally gloss over it when it comes up in any other stuff of some different genre I take up.

Also most teenagers dont think about relationships everyday. At least where I grew up. I didn't and I was a mostly normal kid where I grew up. Some of the people did but most of them just concentrated on other stuff.

But as I said earlier, it's highly opinionated and subjective. If you like romance, cool. Awesome. It's your interest and I respect that. But I find it boring and mostly unnecessary to the plot.
