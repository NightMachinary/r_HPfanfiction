On your last point about "bloody relationships", read the back cover of the paperback version of HBP. The reason this happened was because they are teenagers. Do you really expect that Hermione, Ron, and Harry would each never get a real relationship(Cho wasn't really a relationship, and Hermione and Victor don't seem as if they were a couple in that sense long either)? The point is that, yes, while they are heroes, they're also kids.
