  Given that Harry cleaved through Malfoy's chest and he was patched up in a few minutes, I don't think that the risk for permanent injury was quite as high as you make it out to be.

Malfoy would have probably died if the creator of that spell hadn't saved him. Harry and malfoy are enemies and it makes sense something like this happened between them. And I think malfoy mostly deserved it.

Now ron and hermione are best friends. They are not in a relationship. So ron is free to go with lavender anytime. What gives hermione the right to attack him? In real world this would be physical assault and is punishable under law in almost every country.
