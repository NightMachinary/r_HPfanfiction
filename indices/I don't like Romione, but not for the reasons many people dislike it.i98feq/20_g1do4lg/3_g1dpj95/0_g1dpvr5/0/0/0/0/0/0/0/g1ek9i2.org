  the distinction between what can be fixed with magic and what cannot is fuzzy and totally dependent on the whims Of the author.

this. since rowling never specified, we will never actually know whether or not bird pecking could render someone blind permenantly, we can only guess based on canon. in hp uni its not whether or not an injury took place, rather whether or not the injury is permenant. so you cant confidently say that Hermione was endangering Ron if we dont even know if bird pecking is dangerous (remember whether or not it causes blindness is irrelevant if the hp uni could fix it like skelegro). And in my opinion, since I chose to regard that spell as something fixable like the bat-boogy hex, due to it being an injury from a non-dark magic spell and not something born with like short-sightedness, it is the EQUIVILENT as a slap/punch since both things are temporary and fixable (imo).
