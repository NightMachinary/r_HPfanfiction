  im pretty sure it would take more than a bird peck to make someone blind.

  they can literally regrow bones. given that madeye was an auror, we can assume there was some sort of magic involved in his injury.
#+end_quote

Magic can't fix everything. Otherwise no one would be wearing spectacles would they? I'd they can grow eyeballs out of thin air then they can surely heal myopia and their ilk right?

#+begin_quote
  the basilisk isnt really a good example because you are only proving that birds can blind animals which isnt the point.
#+end_quote

Why isnt it relevant? If someone as big as a basilisk can get their eyes popped by a bird attack then surely humans are easy pickings.

#+begin_quote
  in the wizarding world, injuries are the same, but they are given much less importants and weight because most are curable.
#+end_quote

Yes but not all of them. And the distinction between what can be fixed with magic and what cannot is fuzzy and totally dependent on the whims Of the author.

#+begin_quote
  If we are going to say pecking birds going someone is important than you are ignoring the vast amount of references of other injuries regarded without a second though.
#+end_quote

Who disregarded them and how is it relevant here?

#+begin_quote
  ex. bat bogey hex, stinging jinx. these are all common spells that could do worse damage than a pecking bird yet we see them commonly cast on/by bullies.
#+end_quote

I have shown above that a pecking bird is literally dangerous and hermione set multiple of them on ron. Yes and that's why we call those people bullies. So hermione is a bully then? Works for me.

#+begin_quote
  In the context of the wizarding world, hermione did the equivilent of a slap/punch
#+end_quote

Yeah right. A slap/punch hard enough to take someone's eye out or at the very least leave some long lasting scars on the face.

I fail to understand how quickly people jump to protect Hermione lol.
