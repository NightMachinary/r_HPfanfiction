UK law calls for actual damage being done. The British assault charge is actually assault and battery in the US. To quote the most relevant verdict:

#+begin_quote
  Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling
#+end_quote

And the birds do not fulfill that, especially not in an environment where such injuries are dealt with in seconds.

It was pretty dick-ish and probably some kind of misdemeanor, but not a criminal offence.
