  this. since rowling never specified, we will never actually know whether or not bird pecking could render someone blind permenantly, we can only guess based on canon.

Lets assume what you are saying is true. So it's alright if it's done temporarily? Would you be saying the same thing if ron had done something similar to hermione at the yule ball for example? Just a small injury which a little magic can't fix? Lol.

  in hp uni its not whether or not an injury took place, rather whether or not the injury is permenant. so you cant confidently say that Hermione was endangering Ron if we dont even know if bird pecking is dangerous (remember whether or not it causes blindness is irrelevant if the hp uni could fix it like skelegro).

You are delusional. Just because an injury is fixable doesnt mean it is not painful. Is it alright to poke someone's eye out just because it can be fixed later on? Also I'm pretty sure magic can't fix a popped out eye. There's enough indication for that at least as I stated in earlier comment. If magic could heal a popped out eyeball then why couldnt it heal myopia and related diseases since most wizrds use spectacles? This leads us to assume that eyes are a special case and magic is not very effective there. The one making assumptions is YOU and not me.

  And in my opinion, since I chose to regard that spell as something fixable like the bat-boogy hex, due to it being an injury from a non-dark magic spell and not something born with like short-sightedness, it is the EQUIVILENT as a slap/punch since both things are temporary and fixable (imo).

Will poolpping out your eyeball cause similar pain as a slap/punch? Is it something you do to your friends in real life? Now let's assume it was a slap/punch. What gave hermione the right to do even that? Will you be okay with that if ron did the same thing at the yule ball?

You are justifying something which is pretty hard to justify. This is one of the lowest points of hermiones plot. I am surprised ron remained her friend after this happened.
