Well there was a good chance that something like this would have nicked his eye because in books if i am remembering correctly it is said that he brought his arms up to protect his face from the canaries. Losing an eye is not recoverable even by magic. For proof, ask MadEye. Btw recall who blinded the basilisk and how? Right. It was a bird and they poked its eyes out with their beaks and talons. So something like this has already happened before and hermione knows that. She does it anyway.

I would say it was much worse than a dick move. She is lucky ron was still her friend after that.
