Lol. Okay let's leave that out. That doesnt change anything anyways apart from completely removing the motive of hermione's assault. But okay.

Let's assume they weren't best friends. The question still remains : what gave hermione the right to physically attack him? Was he cheating on her? Nope. He was free to do as he pleases just like her. So why did she physically assault him? As I said this is a crime punishable by law.
