Honestly, I think that Rowling only put them together because Harry was too perfect for Hermione as a boyfriend. At least, most expected Harry and Hermione to end up together since they have good chemistry.

Ginny had too little personality in my opinion. She was basically just a girl that was a little bit obsessed with Harry in the beginning, and they ended up together because she had no competition due to Harry's /adventurous/ lifestyle at his time in Hogwarts. Yes, she was literally the only girl that could end up with Harry. His environment and lifestyle only allowed her or Hermione as a potential partner, everyone else couldn't meet the standards to join the resistance against Voldemort and his lackeys.

And Ginny is more the kind of girl you get together in your puberty just to have a girlfriend. Her only connection with Harry was through her family. She could use her brothers to get close to him. Take that away and he would never really paid much attention to her - maybe just a little since he might be worried of her mental health after the Chamber of Secrets incident.

Hermione, on the other hand, experienced a lot of crazy stuff with Harry. They were like siblings in some way, like family, and some might say that this was the reason they never developed romantic feelings for each other. But my experience is that girls that are such good friends that you see them already like a family (as a sister, but let us not say that because it's weird) are the best you can hope for (if you want something serious, and lasting).

Anyways, I dislike Harrinny because it felt too forced for my taste - as if Rowling planned that before she even finished writing the first book. It was so damn obvious in most scenes that Ginny was only in the room since she needed a stronger presence in Harry's life so that their relationship could be justified.

Harry should have fallen for Hermione during the Yule Ball... but nooooooooooo... >:(
