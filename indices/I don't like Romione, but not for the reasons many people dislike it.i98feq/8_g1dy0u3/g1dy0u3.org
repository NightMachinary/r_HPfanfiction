Oh I agree. It's not Ron not being good enough for Hermione in a "he's evil/he's a dick/whatever" way, but rather that I always figured that they both wanted different things, and I can't see a relationship between the 2 work well. Hermione would (just like she always were) be annoyed over some of Ron's day-to-day behaviour, while Ron would be annoyed over a wife that seems to put work over marriage. Not that Hermione would do that per se, but that I could see Ron feel that way, simply due to how she is as a person.
