I agree with you, although my main complaint about Romione is that their hardcore shippers treated Hermione as a prize for Ron so much of the time (Ron did x and y, so he /deserves/ the best girl in the series. Ron liked her first, so she should be his OTP). They didn't even seem to /like/ Hermione as a character. In a lot of R/Hr fanfics from the early 2000s, she was a caricature of herself, extra bossy and judgmental.

Times may have changed, I don't know. I have wartime flashbacks to the great shipping wars of 200whatever, so I'm not all that active in the HP fandom anymore. But even as a 15-year-old, when I read GoF and realized that Ron had a crush, I never once thought it would be a lasting relationship. Ron cheating on his driving test by bewitching a defenseless Muggle was not a shining testament to his maturity, either.
