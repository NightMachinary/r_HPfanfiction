I absolutely agree! I really think if he was with Lavender or someone who admired and respected him, he'd be happy. I feel like Hermione doesn't respect him much, and would have been better with someone else (but not Harry - I think Ginny is more suited to Harry than Hermione is). But I feel Hermione enjoys Ron's sweetness and for Ron, well I don't really understand why he's into her; she's pretty yes, but so are others. And I do think he'll always be overshadowed by her academic intellect and ambition.
