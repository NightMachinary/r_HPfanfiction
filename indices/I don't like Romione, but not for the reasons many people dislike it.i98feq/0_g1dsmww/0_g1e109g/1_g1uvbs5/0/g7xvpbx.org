Lavender got thrown under the bus as a character so that the readers would hope Hermione would win out.

If we interpret that Lavender survived the battle with some werewolf scars then she could fit really well with Ron. Give them a post-Hogwarts adventure where she learns her new skills and he gets to lead the agenda away from Harry/Hermione.
