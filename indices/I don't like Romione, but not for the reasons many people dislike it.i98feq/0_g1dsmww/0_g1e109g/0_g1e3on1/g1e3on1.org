Glad to see my comment resonated! Yeah I think Hermione is the type who wants someone who can match her more; I don't think she wants someone to simplify her life or hold back her ambition, even if she might need it. And as for Ron, I think he needs to feel strong and capable in order to gain self-love and confidence. Hermione doesn't compliment him enough and is so intellectual, whereas Ron is more about the heart. I think that -could- be a good, balanced relationship, but I just don't see Hermione respect Ron enough to feel that she deserves him. Ron may be horribly unreasonable, obnoxious, stupid sometimes, but at his core he is a tender heart that wants to dote and be doted upon, in my opinion. So even though Lavender seems ditzy, I think she suits Ron more. She is more than willing to dote on him.
