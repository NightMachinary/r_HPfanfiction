Totally agree! i always felt like hermione was the kind to need someone who could challenge her intellectually and ron was finding his identity, away from his family and harry's shadow. and after we saw the jealousy he acted on for Hermione, i think Lavender would appreciate him caring that much while hermione would feel constricted. i think its less on -could- they have a relationship (yes imo if they both worked at it), but -should- they, when they could match someone else so much better
