Yeah, I agree that Lavender was a better option.

And it's not that Hermione didn't respect him, they were just oo differed and had no interest they shared. They were arguing all the time, and Ron was basically looking down on Hermione because she spends so much time with her eyes glued to books. She did the same and looked down on Ron when he slacked off again to play chest or marvel about the wonders of Quidditch.
