Yup. Lav Lav was a bit cringy with the baby-talk pet names and the sucking his face instead of getting to know him better, but they were teens. They're /supposed/ to be cringy, and at least it was sweet. Hermione might have been capable of sweetness, but she'd been bossy with him so long that's a hard habit to break.

And really, their school days is where Hermione and Ron would make the /most/ sense to me. I myself was a bossy national merit scholar who dated a dropout. Those idealistic teen years are the perfect time to develop a sweetness that looks beyond the superficial to find the best in a person. Even if what's best turns out to be the hot sex ;)

But the reality of that kind of relationship is really hard. Major mismatches of intellect, work ethic, and long-term goals, altogether as a package, is nearly insurmountable. I just don't see Hermione and Ron making it work.
