I don't think it's about grades, but ambition, Hermione wants to do big things, Ron is content with a good job. Ron doesn't seem to like to be overshadowed.

There's also the fact about personality, but Hermione always does this to him, she's bossy and for a time wasn't that supportive.

People say, "Oh, but married couples fight all the time!" well, if one spouse conjures birds that attack the other to the point of making them bleed, it's not a good kind of fight.

I think that bothers people, Hermione is always bossing Ron around, at time dismissing his opinions, and he doesn't seem to like it but ends up just accepting, I guess this leaves a bad taste in some's people's mouth.

My opinion is that for each their own, if that makes Ron happy, then all the more power to him, I think canon Harry would've ended better with Hermione at times, rather than Ginny, the girl Rowling almost Mary Sue'd out of nowhere and wrote their relationship really weirdly.

But say that to some people and it personally offends them to when they start saying you are "attacking" Ron, or something to that effect.
