Hermione was friends with the Minister and other high ranking officials, she had fought in a war that had disgraced or killed many of the people in power that would oppose her.

It also made her somewhat famous, and she was friends with Harry Potter, the big hero of the people.

She had a lot of political clout AND the favor of the people. So she had a lot of opportunities to do what she wanted to do.

She also had even more control of Rita Skeeter.

She later became the Minister herself.

So yeah, I think she had a lot of opportunities for success.
