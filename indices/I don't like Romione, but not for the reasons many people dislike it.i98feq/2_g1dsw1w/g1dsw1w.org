I didn't see much chemistry either. But I'm just relieved Hermione didn't end up with Harry. It's become this rule that the lead male and lead female HAVE to get together, and JK not caving into this almost mandatory "rule" felt like a breath of fresh air. Besides, I could never see Harry and Hermione having a romantic relationship. They're dyanamic always felt exclusively platonic to me.

And although I don't see Romione as perfect, it's still feasible. Maybe it takes counseling, maybe it's got its share problems, but it still works in the end.
