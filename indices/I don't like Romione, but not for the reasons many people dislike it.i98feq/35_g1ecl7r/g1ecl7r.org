I feel like Ron wouldn't be able to catch up with Hermione and her complex mind. I absolutely love Ron's character but honestly I'd rather have Hermione with Tom Riddle rather than him. My guess is that JKR didn't want to pair Hermione with another dude because it would steer away from the plot and distract readers. Dramione would've been an amazing pairing, yet too powerful, and would require a book or two.
