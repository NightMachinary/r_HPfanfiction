They lack any common interests outside of Harry and the conflict with Voldemort, and both chronically show a lack of respect for each other: Even as of the crapilogue, Ron apparently feels it perfectly OK to use mind-affecting magic on a defenseless Muggle just so he won't fail his driver's test, showing that even at that point he doesn't truly respect Muggles or even consider them real people. Throughout the books he's constantly dismissing Hermione's opinions, beliefs, interests, and work ethic. Hermione, on the other hand, takes a holier-than-thou attitude towards Wix and their culture and looks down her nose at anyone (including Ron) that doesn't Follow The Rules, or who doesn't share her academic mania, or whose interests don't interest her.

Mutual respect is absolutely /fundamental/ to a healthy relationship, whether it's a romantic, familial, friendly, or professional one. For romance, it also helps if you have something in common other than your enemies.
