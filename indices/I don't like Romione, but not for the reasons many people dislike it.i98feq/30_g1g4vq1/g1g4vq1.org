I absolutely agree with this too!! Hermione would be bored with him. She needs someone to intellectually stimulate her (I'm writing as a Dramione shipper but there is canon proof that Draco is intelligent) and Ron just wouldn't be able to do it because he's never been able to. He's smart in his own way but not the sort of book smart that Hermione needs to push her forward. I feel like he would also expect Hermione to play the stay at home mum role to Rose and Hugo because he was coddled by a stay at home mum as a child of 7 his whole life. Like remember how frustrated he gets with her when she's unable to make “good food” when they're on the run? This is just one example of his domestic dependency on women (which lots of other women, including Lavender as I see in the comments, would be happy to do). Hermione is a career-driven woman.

They would both live to resent the other and probably divorce.
