I think that Ron would likely be the one to end his relationship with Hermione.

They both had insecurities about their value as a partner, but Hermione's issues are mostly resolved in-story whereas Ron's insecurity about always being in the shadow of Harry/his brothers is mostly left unaddressed - the only thing that shows Ron that he is 'good enough' for Hermione is that Hermione picks him and Harry explicitly tells him he isn't interested in Hermione. It wouldn't be good for his self-worth to be so tied to his relationship.

Hermione can often get carried away with her passions in a way that would make Ron feel forgotten, and I think Ron would respond to that feeling really badly, causing Hermione to respond badly in turn.

Hermione would dismiss these problems as Ron being immature and something he'd grow out of, but I think Ron would more clearly see that a lot of his happiness is wrapped up in someone who doesn't naturally do things that make him happy.
