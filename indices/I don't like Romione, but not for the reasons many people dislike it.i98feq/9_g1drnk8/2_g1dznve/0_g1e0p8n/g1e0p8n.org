I honestly like the forgiving nature of Harry. Especially I thought that the chapter "The Forest Again" illustrates very well Harry's appreciation for life and seeing how short it is to spend it being petty. While I agree that Ron is always at fault, the fourth book is a good lesson for Harry. He learns for the first time how fickle his fame is and how easily everyone can turn against you. I think he finally learns that the only people who have ever truly cared for him were Ron, Hermione and Sirius and jumps at the chance of forgiving Ron, when the latter swallows his pride. In the seventh book, Ron atones by saving Harry's life and destroying the locket.
