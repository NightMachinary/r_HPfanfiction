I would disagree with you. I think that a big part of Ron's character growth arc is to learn to value those close to him over his desire for glory. We see this both times when him and Harry have a row, him always being the first one to want to make peace even if that means staying in Harry's shadow. It is also seen with the Hufflepuff cup because despite being his idea to go into the chamber of secrets and him being the one to figure how to open it without being a parslemouth, he still lets Hermione have a go at destroying the Horcrux. He also doesn't take credit for it, even if it's one of his more significant achievements in the series, when they meet Harry. It's Hermione who tells the story.

I also don't think that Ron and Hermione have a bad dynamic. They bicker a lot but he always defends Hermione, even against Harry, something that Harry never does when Ron is especially mean to her. But I would say that they also act awkward around each other, quite like anyone around their crush when they are uncertain if their crush likes them back. However when they open up about their feelings, they become supportive of one another. I would think Hermione would never allow Ron to feel outshone, as shown by the example above.

Finally I think all the members of the trio achieve their different kind of fame:

- Harry - as the legendary hero who defeated the darkest wizard;
- Hermione - as the rights activist and eventually Minister for Magic (which, while an achievement, is not always a great thing seeing as what people usually think of politicians);
- Ron - (assuming he achieves the same notoriety as Zonko or the Weasley twins) as a beloved famous figure to whom common people can more easily relate.

Which I think is really befitting of the way they were initially written. Despite JK coming back and forth in later years on them, I always felt like they really completed each other with Harry being the moral compass, Hermione the intellect and Ron representing the humanity.
