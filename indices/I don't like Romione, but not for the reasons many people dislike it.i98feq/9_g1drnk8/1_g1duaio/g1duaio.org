Hermione once stated "Ron's most proud achievement was when he got his own Chocolate frog Card"

Now I initially thought that this refered to his insecurity - with how he is now in such companies as Flamel and Dumbledore - and how this means he will be remembered.

But you got me thinking - maybe it's not about the fame, at least entirely. Think of Ron's growth throughout the series, how he always stood in the shadow of his friend.

It took a lot of growth, as I see it, for the fact that his reaction to his greatest achievement worth celebrating - helping his friend destroy Voldemort - doesn't make him angry, anymore, that he's a "sideckick" to Harry, but rather proud, proud of the part he had.

He did grow.
