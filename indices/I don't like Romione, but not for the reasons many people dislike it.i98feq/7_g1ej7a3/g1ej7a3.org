Ron was always the ordinary guy surrounded by extraordinary/special people. Or at the very least they always stood out.

-Harry is the Boy-Who-Lived.

-Hermione is 'the cleverest witch of her age'.

-Bill is the 'coolest' family member, and the eldest sibling.

-Charlie was the Quidditch captain who could've gone professional. But instead he became a dragon tamer(I forgot what the job is actually called).

-Percy was the Head Boy and academically the most brilliant. Became 'the prick' of the family for some time.

-Fred and George were the 'Practical Jokers' who were brilliant wizards from whom Flitwick was so impressed he left little of their magic effects as it is in Hogwarts. They started a highly successful business in a time when most of the shops were closing.

-Ginny is the only girl and the youngest sibling. She went on to become a professional Quidditch player.

-Fleur, his sister-in-law, is a quarter veela and a Triwizard Champion.

And Ron is... good at chess.

Ron is too real, too relatable, he hits too close to home. He reminds us of our ordinary selves.

If you want to write a good Ron. Give him something special, even a gimmick, even if it feels superficial. But he needs to have something to make him stand out, something to make him unique.
