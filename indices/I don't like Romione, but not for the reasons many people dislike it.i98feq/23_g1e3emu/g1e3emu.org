I don't trust anything JK says, /but/ I never thought they were the best fit. But then again maybe they are. Hermione could loosen up for sure, and Ron could use someone to keep him forced and on task. I can see how they'd be good for each other in that regard. I can also see other ships where Hermione is with Theodore Nott or Draco Malfoy or anyone besides Ron who takes their jobs and life seriously and can detect when something is really wrong not just going “huh what happened?” And Ron was paired with someone who was more go-with-the-flow and less stressed about life. Smell the roses kinda people. So it's basically opinions at this point- do you believe opposites attract or think people should be with people more like themselves? I learn more towards middle ground. If someone is just like me I'd probably kill them, same with if they so unlike me and we butted heads /all the time/.
