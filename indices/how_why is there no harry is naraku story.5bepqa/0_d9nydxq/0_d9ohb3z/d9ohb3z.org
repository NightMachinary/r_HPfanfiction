It's not the current connection between the two, but the chance to connect the two.

As far as I could tell in the countless of fanfics Harry is severely by his family,and in some of them leads him to becoming a dark lord. In Inuyasha, Onigumo is beaten and/or burned leading him to eventually selling his body to demons and then becoming Naraku the Spider demon lord.

I've read fics where a dark harry done the same rituals voldemort had done and scientific Harry had done a modified horcux ritual.

So why can't a truly dark harry or Darkish grey Harry do the same but with a spider-ish angle in mind leading him to eventually becoming Naraku.

I mean I read one where the the only connection between harry and another character from another series were eye color or hair style, so why not this?
