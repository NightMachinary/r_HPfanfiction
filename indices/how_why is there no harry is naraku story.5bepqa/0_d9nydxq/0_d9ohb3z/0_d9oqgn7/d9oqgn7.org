Because to most people it probably sounds like “eh, well, stuff happens so stuff, and well, there's a connection because stuff and some fanon rubbish which is also stuff, how can you not see it that stuff and thus a connection because stuff?”.

In other words: when you say that it's “right there staring you in the face”, most people see you speaking gibberish in an attempt to present a probably inane idea. Whether or not they are right there is irrelevant, what matters is that this is how they see.
