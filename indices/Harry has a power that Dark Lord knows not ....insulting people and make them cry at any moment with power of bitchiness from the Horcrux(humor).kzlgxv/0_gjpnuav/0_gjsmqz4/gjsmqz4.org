/Victim 1: Marge Dursley/

"Petunia, your family is wonderful, but your sister was of a bad seed," said Marge, " and unfortunately this child didn't seem to have any good traits."

"I guess your /good/ traits are the reasons that you are obese and compulsively drinking alcohol as you ironically disparage my dad a drunkard," said Harry as he rolled his eyes, "then again, you probably know it yourself because the reflection on the mirror that you see everyday reminds you the uncomfortable, true reasons of Colonel Fubster refusing to reciprocate your feelings - the total absence of everything considered as feminine beauty, which you chalk it up as /whorey/ and /promiscuous/ even though that is what Colonel Fubster desires, not someone whose gender can be only clarified by examining a pair of X chromosome in your cells because of your mannish mouth and your brisk beard. The whispers you hear in your dream are so vivid because it really happened when you were in a bathroom while those women ridiculed your body - but you just pretend it didn't happen and helplessly hope that you are going to find your true love when all the men in your social circle is repulsed by your demeanor /and/ your appearance. You are not a proper English lady - you are a vulgar, lonely woman whose existence is tolerated because of your wealth and does not deserve the meaning of your name. "

All the traces of exuberance and malice were quelled from Marge's face, and the three other Dursleys froze in place as Harry finished his eloquent and quiet tirade. Harry knew that he would most likely be beat the fuck down, yet there was a resilient joy of seeing the lardy woman's arrogance being shattered. Harry gulped, expecting an explosive anger.

Instead, Marge's mouth trembled and tears flowed down on her face. She swiftly lurched from her chair and strode to the hallway door, banging the door shut. A loud weeping was heard beyond the door.

"Marge!" Vernon went after his sister.

"How could you," Petunia asked, still petrified, "how could you say such hurt things? Not even Lily or her blasted husband would say such thing!"

/Victim 2:/ /Petunia Dursley/.

"Please," Harry continued onto his next target, controlling his unexpected victory, "everyone in the parent-teacher association thinks of you as an unlikable loner because nobody in this neighborhood or the PTA is na√Øve enough to buy your charade of politeness. Do you realize that they know that you are the reason that biweekly PTA meeting was moved to different time just so that you can't come? You can never socialize with the mothers whom you consider "proper" because you were obsessed being "normal" so much that you became a paragon of mediocrity and boredom. The only form of joy that you can ever deliver is a derisive entertainment that those /proper/ mothers get as they laugh at you trying to emulate them. How many calls have you left to invite them to your home that were never returned? And how many letters did you ignore from Dudley's homeroom teachers who cared to inform you that Dudley is obese and bullying other kids? You can't face it, can you? You are still hung up on the fact that you couldn't get into Hogwarts even though grandma and grandpa did everything to cater to your petulant demands to make up for it, even writing letters to your first choice university to accept you. But you didn't get in. Because you are not good enough, and you will always remain in a state of an tepid languor with no one to care for you outside your family."

A tea cup and a tea try came flying to Harry's face, shattering into pieces and cutting his face. Petunia started scream and throw everything on the table at Harry in a fury like never before, prompting him jump out of the chair and run to his room, barely escaping Petunia's claws that sought Harry's shirt. The door locked itself - probably out of Harry's magic as a self protection, and Petunia violently banged on the door with streams of expletives. Dudley was heard crying in a dining room.

"I am going to /kill/ you, you little Shite!" Petunia /shouldered/ the door to break it open with croaking wails. Harry panickingly looked around his room and packed absolute bare minimum - wand and a few galleons.

"Hedwig, fly to Ron's family!" Harry opened the cage. Hedwig hooted in fear. "GO!"

Hedwig flinched but obeyed his command as Harry opened the window. He jumped out of the window and landed on the grass with no bruise thankfully to his magic. The relief was gone in a second as he saw Vernon charging at him like a freightrain.

"WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING YOU FREAK MONSTER!" Vernon screamed, making other neighbors to look out of the windows in shock. "I am going to wring your neck and bury you in a dumpster!"

To be continued....
