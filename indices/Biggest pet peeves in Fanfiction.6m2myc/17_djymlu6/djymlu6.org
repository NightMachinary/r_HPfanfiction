When well known things are ignored. Like canon history if doing partial AU (meaning diverging from a selected point compared to a world built with major differences starting prior to story start in Canon or crossover).

Also stories that are well written at start and last two chapters or so become trash with rushing deus ex machina.

Last peeve would be ones that say its a/b pairing but change it without updating description to show them change.
