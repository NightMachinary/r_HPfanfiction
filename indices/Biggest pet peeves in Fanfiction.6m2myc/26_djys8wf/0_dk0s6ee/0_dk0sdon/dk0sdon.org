If I had done nothing to distance myself from racists, if I had let racists represent me, if I had stood by when racists were harrassing other students, if I hung out with said racists and therefore giving the impression that I supported them, then I'd deserve to be seen as a racist.

Same for bullies, and jerks and assholes.
