The "We're Slytherins, but we're not bigots, we're unjustly persecuted by those bigotted Gryffindors!" drivel - usually sprouted by Daphne Greengrass to Harry, or Zabini, Nott and Davis.

Newsflash: If you let your house be represented by scum shouting Nazi slogans whenever possible and acting like Nazis when the opportunity presents itself, everyone else will assume, and rightly so, that you support that kind of shit.

If Draco is acting like in canon, then either the other Slytherins are supporting him, or they are cowed by his and the other Death Eater families' influence - and too scared or too stupid to go to Dubmledore and have him rectify the problem with a few visits to parents and a small demonstration why Voldemort feared him. Either way, the rest of the school is not to blame for treating all Slytherins like junior Death Eaters since for all they know, they act like it.
