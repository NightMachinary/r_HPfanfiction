One of my biggest pet peeves is actually with canon. There is barely any setup in the stories for magic uses. The only ones I can think of are parseltongue being explored at the start of book 1, then being useful in book 2. And the diary horcrux being used in book 2, then being explained in book 6 (seems convienient though)

Everything else was introduced in the same story it is used in, and stops being used afterwards. Portkeys are a great example of this, Introduced at the start of book 4, and then being the plot point for the end of the book, and never seen again. Other examples are Thestrals in book 5 Deathly Hallows in book 7 Time turner in book 3 I would have much prefered the magic to be foreshadowed in a previous book, rather than be a one and done thing
