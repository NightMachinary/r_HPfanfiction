Just...I absolutely hate when a story with a good plot and a good concept is ruined by so many grammatical, punctuational and orthographical mistakes that it immediately turns me away. I mean, I can easily condone a few typos and mistakes, and I even expect them (it would be hypocritical to say I don't make them myself), but if there's a mistake with spelling or quotation format (this one annoys me a lot) once every sentence, then there's definitely something wrong.
