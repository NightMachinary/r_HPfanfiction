My biggest pet peeve is when Slytherin!Harry manages to get the other Slytherin kids to abandon the pure blood ideology by pointing out "Hermione is Muggleborn, and she's the best in our year!"

That's it. That's all the reasoning he gives. Some fics at least add the part about Lily Potter being the one actually responsible for defeating Voldemort, but even then someone who spent their /entire childhood/ listening to the pure blood dogma would at least attempt to provide a counter argument. They wouldn't just drop their beliefs immediately just by seeing two cases, especially when one of those cases is something as relatively trivial as being best in the year for grades.

Inb4 well you know that's racist.

I'm not defending the Pureblood ideology or anything of the sort. I'm just pointing out that these sorts of beliefs don't magically disappear overnight.
