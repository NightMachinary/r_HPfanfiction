Especially not when you try to use logic against a bunch of idiots who can come up with a lot of (magical) explanations for Hermione being smarter than the entire Slytherin house.

"She's an adopted pureblood"

"She cheats"

"Dumbledore cheats for her"

"She's not that smart, she just can learn well, if we worked as hard, we'd be as smart"

"Dumbledore doses the Gryffindor tea with Luck Potion"

If racists would respect logic, they'd not be racists to begin with.
