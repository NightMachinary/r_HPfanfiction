Agreed - it's however WORSE when said parents either come back from the dead or they've been in hiding (especially when Harry forgives his parents if they hid...sorry, no, nay, never! He was freaking treated like Dobby the houself by the Dursleys (including abuse - hitting him with frying pans is canon after all!) because his parents didn't have the stones to either leave Britain with him or to stay and fight (which would of course lead to the canon outcome most likely, but nobody in such a fiction knows that!)) and then think they can boss Harry around!

Sorry dipshits, Harry grew up WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT and HE DOESN'T NEED YOU and your meddling in his affairs! You don't have the right to try to control Harry anymore, you were declared dead after all!
