over use of the word "actually". Would it kill an author to find way to add emphasis rather than this stupid verbal affectation? (AH...actually, it just might)

historical inaccuracies. I read a fic where Harry time traveled to 1989 and he had the Internet hooked up and invested in Google stocks.

utter nonsense in the wizarding economy. A cup of tea and a week at the Leaky can't cost the same amount.

the use of the phrase " he let out a breath he didn't know he was holding". This is completely insane that I hate this phrase, but I do.

Not tagging a romance fic as romance. I prefer my Harry too busy trying to save the world to have any angst over a love interest.
