The mandatory Graveyard resurrection plot is getting nauseating to me. If you ABSOLUTELY have to do it with your super!grey!lordPotter!Harry, do it at least as in "Seventh Horcrux":

  We bowed, raised our wands, and began. "Avada Kedavra!”

  The following fight can best be described as very green. Avada Kedavras flew wildly through the air. His were weaker than mine as he was still cheerful after gaining a new body while I was carrying a grudge over his sabotaging my time in the tournament.

  We effortlessly dodged each other's spells. But they found targets easily enough.

  One by one, Death Eaters fell. A few realized what was going on. Lucius, for instance, was using Crabbe as a human shield. Yet their numbers kept thinning.

  Voldemort's spells took out more of his people than mine did, which was surprising because I was actually aiming.

  Eventually, I maneuvered myself close to a wide gap in the ring of my former and apparently current followers. With one last Avada Kedavra in Voldemort's direction, I sprinted away, headed towards the graveyard's gates.

  However, I took a small detour to grab the Cup because it was mine. As I snatched its handle, something tugged at my navel and the world began to spin, eventually solidifying into the familiar grounds of Hogwarts.

  Greeted by the surprised faces of my teachers and classmates, I knew immediately that I had to tell them. After all, I knew something incredibly important, something that mattered. I could not allow them to wallow in ignorance for a moment longer.

  I held my trophy aloft and shouted, "I declare victory!”
