Exactly. What's the point of writing a fanfic if you're just going to write the books again?

The most egregious offending scene of this in fanfiction is the graveyard scene because a lot of the authors that do this aren't creative enough to find a new way to revive Voldemort. Not to mention I'm of the opinion that even canon Harry could have put up a decent fight against Pettigrew if he had been a little less tired and a little less shocked at Cedric's death. Therefore if you have your ultra-lordship Supreme Magical Duke Harold Potter-Slythinpuffclawdor, who has been trained in magic, wandless magic, blood magic, pyromancy, necromancy, spidermancy, shoelacemancy etc since he was a baby be caught and used for the ritual in the exact same way I simply lose all respect for your creative writing ability (not that I read that far in these fics these days anymore).
