Mindless canon rehashes, especially when Harry had a different childhood, when protagonists are altogether different characters, or when protagonists are time travelers. I remember one fic in which Anakin/Padme took over Harry/Ginny respectively, and the 2nd Year played exactly as in canon. I say FUCK those writers without a shred of creativity and originality!
