I'm American and I can't stand it. Using the word "bangs" for "fringe" grates like nails on a chalk board. It's the thing that covers his most prominate feature, the scar. anyone paying even a modicum of attention would know that the word is FRINGE. Jumper vs Sweater also annoys me mostly because sweater is a weird word for a piece of clothing.
