I actually do my level best to work this into my writing. It's my subtle way of letting the reader know when the plot is in Britain (as it takes place around the world), and when it's not. Furthermore, I also try to have characters that were born/raised in America 'speak' with the American spellings of words, versus the British born/raised characters.

Mainly because it amuses me.
