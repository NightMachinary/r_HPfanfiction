Oh hmm... But sometimes there are small details that do turn out to be significant later, and when they're covered as a flashback it sounds a bit like you're trying to take an easy way out.

For example, if several of your character's plans in year 3 and onwards require a slightly better Slytherin-Gryffindor relationship than canon, it might not be very convincing to just say "Oh, I sure am glad everybody started to get along better in year 2" when it comes up. I think it would be nicer if the author shows how this development happened by actually writing out the series of minor differences that led up to it in year 2, even if it would mean following the main canon conflict for 10k+ words.

Of course, bonus if the author can write a whole concurrent plot in the shadow of canon during the year 2. Maybe some sort of side quest while the canon main quest is happening?
