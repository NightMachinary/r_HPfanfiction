Covering a ton of the same material as canon when it's not needed. If your story doesn't diverge much until 3rd year, why the hell would you start in 1st? Cover the minor differences in conversation or flashbacks, don't retell 2 years for no reason.

And for God's sake, don't introduce us to the poor little boy under the stair. We're familiar with the backstory.
