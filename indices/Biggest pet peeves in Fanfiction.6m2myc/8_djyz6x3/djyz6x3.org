Most obnoxious pet peeve is actually misspelling character names. I've seen several stories that were going great, seemed to have a good momentum, and then went: Voldermort. VOLDE- r? - MORT.

Several other fics, different writers, and all of them end up using this one very incorrect spelling. Why?

I hate when people throw out abandoned stories as complete. I once ran across a story that author himself had changed the status to complete on, but only when you hit the final chapter, did it have an "update chapter" saying, "Hey, I've abandoned this."

Crazy town.
