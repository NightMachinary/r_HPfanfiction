1)When they write a smart and clever harry but he refuses to discuss or talk about his problems (dreaming about voldy during 3rd year summer and through the 4th year) with sirius.

2) When the author writes " he wanted to ask what he ment but shrugged it off". Everyone shrugs like 69 times a chapter.

3) When they write that harry discovers about magic and is very excited but is not in the least interested to learn more about it or even take subjects which might help him even when he realizes that voldy is definitely alive and will come after him sooner than later or if and how it might help his situation with his relatives.

3) ron and Hermione do not know the meaning of boundaries.

4) minerva referes to harry as "potter" instead of "Mr Potter"

5) everyone and their aunt sneer 322 times in one conversion like a ping pong match.
