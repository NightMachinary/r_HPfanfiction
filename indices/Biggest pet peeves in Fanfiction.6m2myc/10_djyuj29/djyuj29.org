Abandoned fics in general are a massive problem. Authors please.... if you have no plans to complete a fic at least allow others to take it over if they wish.

However as bad as that situation is, its not my biggest pet peeve. No... that would be authors tagging a fic with EVERY GOD DAMN TAG KNOWN TO MAN to attract more readers instead of tagging accurately.

PLEASE don't over tag. PLEASE dont tag inaccurately. PLEASE don't tag with misleading tags. It is frustrating, irritating, and strait up hurts the FF community. I really wish FF sites would severely limit tags so that you have to tag with the most important features and not 50 different things even if they only show up for 3 sentences in some random chapter.

Other annoyances: Excessive authors notes, excessive use of cliff hangers, and authors who clearly hold back a fic's possibilities to go for a T rating over M for fear of turning off readers. The cannon books (mainly later ones) are easily M rated. Please dont babysafe your fics simply out of rating fears authors!
