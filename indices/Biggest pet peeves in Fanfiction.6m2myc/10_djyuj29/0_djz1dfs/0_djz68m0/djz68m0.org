I feel like its surprisingly common. Probably became even more common post the FF.net purge.

Its the same thing as a big budget movie trying to keep their movie from being rated R and instead aiming for PG-13 because they want a larger audience. In the end though by doing that they often compromise the quality of the movie.

Some fics its harder to tell but others.... it can be fairly obvious. FF with darker themes that skip over any violence, instead choosing to simply "imply" things happened. Or FF that treats teen (or even adult) relationships like they are full of chaste kisses and rainbows instead of more realistic depictions. Stuff like that.
