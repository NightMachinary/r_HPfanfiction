Bad writing. Misusing sayings: jury rigged instead jerry rigged just makes me lose respect for the person. Indiscriminately adding prepositions everywhere because somehow it sounds more mature or posh. People who rely entirely on spellcheck so that their work is littered with the wrong homophones, or when they decide to spell a word phonetically when it'd be so easy to look it up. I recently read something that spelled Reese's, as in the candy, reces. Face palm. Although sometimes it makes me laugh: writhed vs withered.

Gary Stuing. Completely changing a character's personality for no reason (not because they're exploring an AU version of that character). Insane power ups that basically make the character god, which usually follows with that character never taking advantage of said power ups. Indiscriminate bashing that is just juvenile instead of writing a character who is legit fucked up because they're human. Conversely, excusing everything a character ever did because Slytherin=awesomesauce. Making a character super feminine because they're gay.

Being racist without even realizing they're advocating things like eugenics. Because apparently British wizards are just born naturally better at battle magic, no matter that other cultures have traditions of being warriors. Because Riddle, and Dumbledore, and Grindlewald (never mind he's not British), and Harry Potter all lived at the same time somehow equals British superiority. Too bad for every other society on earth, they're just always going to get stomped because they're just not as good as the British, so they're going to act like dumbasses. Or, when writers are even more blatant about it and make muggleborns less powerful than purebloods (and halfbloods because we mustn't make Harry weak) because those purebloods must be on to something if they believe so staunchly in their bigotry that they're willing to die for it.
