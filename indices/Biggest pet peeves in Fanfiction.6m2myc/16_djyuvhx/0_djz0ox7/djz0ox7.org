  Being racist without even realizing they're advocating things like eugenics. Because apparently British wizards are just born naturally better at battle magic, no matter that other cultures have traditions of being warriors. Because Riddle, and Dumbledore, and Grindlewald (never mind he's not British), and Harry Potter all lived at the same time somehow equals British superiority. Too bad for every other society on earth, they're just always going to get stomped because they're just not as good as the British, so they're going to act like dumbasses.

Really? Is that a thing? Very few fics I've read put Magical Britain in a good light vs other countries. Ironically, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] wrote several of those very few fics that made Magical Britain look good vs others.

  Or, when writers are even more blatant about it and make muggleborns less powerful than purebloods (and halfbloods because we mustn't make Harry weak) because those purebloods must be on to something if they believe so staunchly in their bigotry that they're willing to die for it.

Trust me, Purebloods bashing overwhelmingly topped Muggleborns bashing, especially those fics with the highest numbers of favorites/follows.
