I wouldn't be surprised if some were, I just suspect a lot of them don't realize they're being racist. It can be hard to recognize when you're being racist when you grew up with certain beliefs being spoken like gospel or blaring from a TV. That doesn't make their racism okay, just harder to identify and stop those behaviors. So I suspect they're just writing extensions of what they grew up learning without realizing what they're doing.
