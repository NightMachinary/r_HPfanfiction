Alright, I've googled it.

The problem is I'm from a city that's known for being corrupt, so jury rigging, as in jury tampering, is not out of the realm of possibility. So whenever I've seen it in a story when someone means the character MacGuyvered something, I've rolled my eyes and wondered if the person actually paid attention to what they were writing.

But, according to the Great Google, jury rigged isn't necessarily wrong since the etymology comes from a sailing term.

Thanks for making me look that up.
