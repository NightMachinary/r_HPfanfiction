I believe Starfox5 uses everytime Voldemort appears in a story he/she writes Voldemort uses a different way to become immortal. In linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) he uses ancient egyptian curses to become immortal, in linkffn(Divided and Entwined) wierd Voodoo and in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) he becomes some sort of vampire.
