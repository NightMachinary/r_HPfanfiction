Only fic with amnesia in it is linkffn(your my density). Its a time travel harmony fic where they go back to troll incident. Its one the few harmony fics which weren't cringe worthy

There's also linkao3(swung by seraphim) where Lockhart manages to obliviate harry

Edit: there's also one fic where an unregistered potion from Snape wipes out Harry's memory the night of Halloween fourth year... He runs away , is brought back, doesn't remember any1 and thinks his wand is a tricoder. Very humorous fic , sadly I don't remember the name rn
