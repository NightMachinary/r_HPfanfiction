  My thoughts exactly if she's Merlins equal there's no way voldemort could even come close to the magic she knows.

  It's freaking Merlin!

Do we actually have anything that suggests that Merlin was so obscenely great?

It seems like it's just as possible that he was a talented wizard whose reputation got overblown over time.

Edit: I mean, people were afraid to say Voldemort's name over ten years /after he died/. 1000 years later, Voldemort could easily be considered the Dark God of Magic.
