Morgana would have existed around the time of the Arthurian Cycle which is actually around the 8th century(Norse invasion of Britain). Hogwarts was built ~1000 years ago at the start of canon. Both Merlin and Morgana pre-date Hogwarts by at least a century. That is not to say that HP is compliant to the Arthurian Cycle however. But given the lack of contradictory evidence we can assume Morgana can do anything she did in her original myths, which is basically anything Merlin can do because they were considered equals in magic. Personally I'm of the opinion that Morgana would curbstomp Voldemort for having the temerity to claim any sort of dominion over Britain, magical or mundane.
