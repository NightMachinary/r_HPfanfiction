Yeah, Voldemort's pure glass cannon. Cruciatas DOT, AK skillshot, and Imperious stun is short term, if Harry is anything to go by. Assuming the Rift has an Anti App jinx set up, the only mobility he has is his flight, and that wouldn't kick in until he gets out of combat. Easy prey for Morgana's root.

Though I bet he and Annie would get along well. One's got a demon bear and the other has a fiendfyre snake.
