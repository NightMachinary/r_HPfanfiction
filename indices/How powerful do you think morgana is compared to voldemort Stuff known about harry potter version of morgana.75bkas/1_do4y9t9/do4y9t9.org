There is not much on her in canon. You could maybe assume that some of the Arthurian myths are true about her, but as far as actual HP canon goes, she was famous enough to get on a chocolate card. That's it.

Compared to Voldemort? Well, I am a believer of the opinion that in the HP universe magical theory and practice is getting developed to be better over time; that there is research being done. So, if you put 20th century Voldemort against Morgana, he'd just wipe the floor with her. A lot of wizards and witches would wipe the floor with her, because they know modern magic.

Comparison. Its like setting the greatest medieval swordfighter there ever was against an soldier with an SMG. Were they on equal footing equipment-wise, the swordfighter would win every time. But like this the soldier is just gonna blast the swordfighter full of bullets and be done with it. Voldemort has 800 (?) years of magical research over Morgana. She is simply out-equipped in a fight.

But even all this is just bla bla. We know nothing about her. For all we know she could've just been a really revolutionary magizoologist in HP canon.
