It's possible some magical artifacts like Hogwarts may have grown in power over time as they absorb magic from their surroundings or simply have layer after layer of new enchantments added over the centuries.

Another factor to account for is survivorship bias. This is where the powerful artifacts are the ones that have survived all this time while all the weak ones broke and got forgotten.

Maybe there are plenty of powerful modern artifacts around but you can't tell cause they don't stand out due to not having accumulated any fame and the weak ones not having been weeded out yet.

Also, we know new spells and potions get developed all the time. Wolfsbane potion is actually a fairly modern invention created in the 1970's. Riddle is known to have invented the unassisted flight spell. Snape invented the powerful sectumsempra and several other spells.
