I think the last one was in maybe 2008 so your tense there is off by about a decade.

As for why they used to happen: back then, indy!Harry was a tiny niche. The obnoxious mainstream (which indy!Harry has now become) back then was intensely fluffy, soul bondy, Harry/Ginny SIYE-type fics.

The kill-off was a cathartic expression of frustration at the choke-hold Harry/Ginny had on the fandom.
