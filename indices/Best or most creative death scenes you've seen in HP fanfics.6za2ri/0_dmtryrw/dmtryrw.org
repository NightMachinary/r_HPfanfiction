  tl;dr Harry, Fleur, Tonks and Sirius are exploring an Egyptian tomb. They are attacked by an lich, they all fight it and it sandblasts Sirius. No buildup, no foreshadowing (that I remember). He's just dead.

  I might not have liked much of the fic but this was definitely one of the high points for me. The out-of-nowhere nature of it was absolutely fantastic.

  I'd forgotten how much I love that fic. To anyone who hasn't read it you should definitely give it a shot. Adult Harry goes back in time. He has 7 hours to find and destroy Voldemort and his horcruxes.
