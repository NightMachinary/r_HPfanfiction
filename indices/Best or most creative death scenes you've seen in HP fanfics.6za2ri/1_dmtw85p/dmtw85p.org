Dumbledore's death in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred Sixty Nine]], linkffn(8581093), earned my top spot for most funny death.

Umbridge's death in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] was the most karmic one however. She hadn't done nearly as many evils as in Canon due to her opponents' competence, but her greed still did her in. [[/spoiler][The Locket was highly radioactive in this story, and she eventually died painfully of cancers caused by radiation poisoning]]
