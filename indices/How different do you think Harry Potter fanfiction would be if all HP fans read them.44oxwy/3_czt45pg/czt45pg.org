I can think of one fandom which has already experienced this (fanfiction becoming mainstream and seen widely) and that would be the original Sherlock Holmes stories. So what could we expect:

- Updating the books to be more modern ([[http://imgur.com/m8d9ogz][mobiles and the internet]]), or the future ([[http://imgur.com/gWkXvKZ][robots etc]])
- Changing the [[http://imgur.com/RyfLGCN][setting]]
- Moving to [[http://imgur.com/qdU1bD5][AMERICA!]]
- Changing the [[http://imgur.com/AegjtNi][sex]], [[http://imgur.com/YEEAER6][race]], and/or [[http://imgur.com/gds2Mcb][age]] of the major characters.
- [[http://imgur.com/Vy7htaX][More romance]], or at least the [[http://imgur.com/Gn1R0kv][suggestions of it]], especially between [[http://imgur.com/bO9h7y4][the main characters]]
- 'Twists' on canon, for example (*spoilers* for Elementary and Sherlock): making a [[http://imgur.com/BzuY7hc][friend an enemy]] (or the other way around), or giving a boring character [[http://imgur.com/qefuPde][new background or motivations]]
- Changing genre, for example making it a [[http://imgur.com/FA6JT1k][comedy]], or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Emerald][horror]].
- Changing [[http://i.imgur.com/VK64a87.gif][species]] of the [[http://i.imgur.com/zlhaX1j.gif][charcters]]
- More [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beekeeper's_Apprentice][SI]]
- More [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552534.Good_Night_Mr_Holmes][minor POV]]

But not really more smut. Nor extensions of canon (there is [[http://www.amazon.com/The-House-Silk-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/0316197017][some]] but for the most part /new/ writers adapt rather then add). The same sort of pattern is seen in other out-of-copywrite stories, like Pride and Prejudice or Wizard of OZ.
