Exactly the same, if not worse. As a standard rule for anything, quality almost never increases as whatever in question becomes more popular/accepted; you should count yourself lucky if it doesn't get worse. It would maybe create a few more niche reads that are really good, but the top fics would remain largely the same: shippy, wish-fulfillment-y fics, because that's what most audiences want out of fanfiction, and what many people want out of original fiction, as well.

As for canon ships? Maybe. But I don't necessarily think that would be a change for the better. The narrowed focus would just "saturate the market", so to speak, where canon-pairing fics are concerned. We'd just have to wade through more poorly written rubbish to get to good stuff. And, the infestation of shit fics that would make up the H/G and R/Hr archives would probably end up creating a backlash to the canon pairings, which would cause writers to start experimenting with other pairings, which would eventually lead back to where we are now.
