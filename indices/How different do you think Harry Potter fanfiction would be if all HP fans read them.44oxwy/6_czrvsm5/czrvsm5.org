Eh, I'm not a huge fan of Harry/Fleur but even if 100% of Harry Potter fans read fanfiction, nothing would really change unless a large amount started writing too.

I'm not sure much would change to be honest- super powered Harry and Hermione/Harry fics abound due to wish fulfillment for an even larger amount of fans. General fans tend to have less in depth knowledge of the universe too so if everyone read/wrote I think we would have a harder time finding deep/complex settings and characterization... Maybe I'm being cynical, its not like it is crazy common now, but I just think we would have a lot more crap to shift through to find good fics.
