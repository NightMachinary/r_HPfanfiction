I disagree with your assessment of this pairing being shoved aside. I think it's discussed so little because people don't really think about it until they start reading fanfiction. I certainly didn't.

Additionally, I think nothing would change in terms of highly rated fanfiction. Most "top" fanfiction in terms of favorites in the Harry Potter fandom is utter tripe past the first page or two.

If anything, I would be horrified by a sudden influx of more Harry Potter fans. Just the very thought disgusts me. Communities who receive a lot of new people quickly lose a lot of quality. I'd rather see a slow and steady trickle.
