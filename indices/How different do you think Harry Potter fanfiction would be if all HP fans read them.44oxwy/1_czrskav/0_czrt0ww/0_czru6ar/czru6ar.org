I suppose, but I think that it wouldn't even be 10% of them being at least average. What I mean to say is that much less of this percentage will be good. I think the people inclined to write good fanfiction will already be in the fandom. We would get some good new additions, but even then it would take quite a lot of time. If you've ever looked at an author's writing early on, it's often pretty meh, or even bad. They need time to hit their stride, read a lot of fanfiction, and realize what makes good or bad fanfiction.
