---angst porn/abuse porn

---game of thrones level rape and misogyny

---feminisation of characters just because they're a bottom (this just in: anal sex doesn't change your physical make up lmaooooo). Gay men come in all shapes and sizes and that is a good thing.

---like, ridiculous levels of not understanding biology and sex misinformation. Soaping up a coochie is like the worst idea ever. Pouring melted chocolate on a cooch is also a horrifyingly bad idea on several levels. Making a woman wear underwear that is too small isn't hot, because she ends up too sore to have any sex with anyone. Blood is not lube! This kind of thing makes good smut immediately very unsexy and take you out of the scene because there is /nothing/ sexy about yeast infections
