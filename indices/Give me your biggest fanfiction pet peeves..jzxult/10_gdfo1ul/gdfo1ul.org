- Inconsistency (I just read a fic that couldn't commit to a last name for married Drarry. It was really annoying. Also in the same fic a major story point was a dept between Harry and Lucius + Draco. Halfway or so through the story the dept suddenly was "healed" and had "vanished", but the rest of the story relied on the dept being there.)

- Uber violence (sometimes I feel the authors need a few sessions with a shrink. There was one fic where Harry was negatively influenced by Grimmauld Place and he did disgusting things like ordering Kreacher to bang his head bloody until near death). I'm getting nauseous just remembering this. Needless to say I quit the fic once I realized how bad it was

- Just bad writing in general (no need to over explain, for example, or repeat situations and dialogues between different characters over and over again.)

- Characters crying all the time. I.e. Draco constantly being in tears for nor real reason. Where's his pureblood pride ?
