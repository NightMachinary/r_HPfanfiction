They're probably used to reading books where “this is talking” and ‘this is thinking'. I feel like a lot of people find it difficult to go from “this” to ‘this' because their brains been trained to use the different quotations to differentiate between dialogue and internal monologging. Sometimes people skim over the characters internal thoughts, but generally everyone reads dialogue. Accidentally skipping past important dialogue because the quotation marks used made you think it was just the characters thoughts can get frustrating.
