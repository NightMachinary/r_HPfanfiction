...it's a bloody quotation mark mate, I grew up with (“), and found reading (‘) easy enough albeit odd at first. You either learn that people across the world do things differently and that's okay, or you stay the way you are and just don't read books with (‘). I'd like to point out, if you're the one tossing a good book away that's well written because of its quotation marks that's on you, not the author.
