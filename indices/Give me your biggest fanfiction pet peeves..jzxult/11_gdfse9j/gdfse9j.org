When unsafe/abusive relationships are romanticised. This is especially common in BDSM themed works. This isn't about characters in abusive relationships who can't/don't leave, either. This is about those fics where the author writes a relationship that is clearly abusive, while also portraying it as super romantic, or some kind of ideal.

For example: Dom beats sub, to the point of causing lasting damage, in an attempt to make the sub Safeword, all while knowing that the sub is so devoted to Dom that they would pass out in pain before Safewording.
