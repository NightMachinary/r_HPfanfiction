When Harry has secret abilities or knowledge that can save or improve his life and he immediately shares this very important information with whoever he sits with on the train usually Ron and Hermione in return for nothing, not even a secrecy vow.

The Dursley family getting off scot-free.

Dumbledore getting off scot-free.

Remus showing up after not even sending Harry a letter to see how he is and going on about how Harry is his cub and Harry not being slightly upset that he was basically a child slave in a cupboard while Remus wallowed in self-pity

Harry not even waiting for an apology from Ron and Hermione to forgive them when they blow him off.
