▪ Harry is heavily abused by the Dursleys. As in rape level

▪ Extreme Pureblood customs specifically in Slytherin house. E.g. if you sit in a slouched position at the Slytherin tabel, everyone will look at you in disapproval

▪ same as you, I don't like fetishised characters

▪ Dumbledore/Weasley bashing

▪ When Hermione and Harry mention each other a lot but not Ron but they are still best friends
