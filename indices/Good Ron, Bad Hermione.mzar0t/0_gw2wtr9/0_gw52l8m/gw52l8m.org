Before the troll incident? You mean when they weren't even friends in the first place? And the broom incident? Hermione was in the right. A serial murderer who(to her knowledge)was SPECIFICALLY out to kill Harry is on the loose and Harry randomly receives an unmarked present and it just so happens to be something he really wants. She was right to snitch and the kind of person who disagrees has a literal childs mentality.
