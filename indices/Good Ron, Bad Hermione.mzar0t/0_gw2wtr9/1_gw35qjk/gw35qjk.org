Not at all im guessing you don't like hermione(honestly neither do I)but let's be real here Hermione has 2 friends ron and harry she's socially awkward and scorned by most of the school as a know it all book worm mudblood etc the broom incident while yes is Hermione fault was in no possible way an indication she would straight up ditch harry. However im not the person who excuses characters faults and actions because so and so did so and so ill acknowledge the fact that the was in the wrong again but could you and me have a discussion about this id like to hear the thought process behind this type of thinking since imo its illogical and based on opinion but
