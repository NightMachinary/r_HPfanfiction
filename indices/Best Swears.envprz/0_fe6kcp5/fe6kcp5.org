Most of the swearing in HP fics is really tame imo. Usually if Ron says "bloody hell" it's followed by Hermiones indignant screech of "language Ronald." In my teens that would just have made me swear more.

I read a fic were Ron kept saying Merlin's sweaty ball sack, made me laugh more than it should.
