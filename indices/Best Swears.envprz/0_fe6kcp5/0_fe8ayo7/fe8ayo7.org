The bloody hell bit is probably lifted from canon to an extent, I know that Molly seemed somewhat strict on swearing - and I don't remember if Hermione was similar.

In general it's hard to have lots of swearing in a way that feels organic to the setting and not too distracting. I guess I'd probably lean towards the Sanderson route and make up a bunch of cultural swear words to show the evolution of them... So more based on wizarding history/figures and magical creatures/spells and whatnot.

Or it could be fun to pick up on older swear words and extensively use them. Eg, finding common swear words from 1600-1700 (basically, right before the statute of secrecy) and having those be the primary ones used in wizarding society could be funny :P
