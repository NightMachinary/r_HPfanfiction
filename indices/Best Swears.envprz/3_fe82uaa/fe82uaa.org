Olivieblake's Drunken History stories are filled with some of this - especially when the swearing person is a very drunk McGonagall.

"...I know what the fuck I said, Albus, you cunting shit..." And so forth. Truly a delight.

I'll link it. Chapters 65 and 68 are what you want, but everything is good.
