I really hate cliched worldbuilding -- Sanderson is good for me because he works new concepts in all the damn time, I didn't like Jordan because nothing felt new -- so if I don't want to spend the time learning a whole new magic system or mythological background, I'll read fanfiction. It saves time and lets the plot move faster. I read about ten times as much fanfiction as paper-and-ink fantasy these days.
