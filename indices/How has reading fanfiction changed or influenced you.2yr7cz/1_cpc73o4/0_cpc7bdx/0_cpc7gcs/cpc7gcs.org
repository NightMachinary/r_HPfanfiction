I don't read bad fanfiction that often. There's enough good fanfiction that I don't feel like I have an excuse not to be reading the good stuff. Then again, some of my personal preferences in fanfiction don't jive well with the "Community's" view. I like HPMoR a fucking ton, for example, and I haven't seen anybody speak positively of it on this sub.

At the same time, I'll literally go to Barnes and Noble and grab books off the shelves with my eyes closed. Maybe I'm just backwards.
