Author tract is what the author calls it himself in several places. Nothing wrong with that per s√©, but it does explain why the fic is what it is.

I absolutely do not wish to imply that I feel Less Wrong is sociopathic, let's be clear. I just have serious issues with a world where people like his version of Harry Potter exist.

Sociopaths are unable to respond to emotions and hardly show them. As it is popularly portrayed, it can be seen as a subset of autism. From what I read of HPMOR, up to almost chapter 100, /most/ of his characters have this trait and their decisions are purely based on what he considers to be logic, without any concern for what I feel is common morality.

I read a lot of fics and will not read a lot of others. I simply do not care enough for HPMOR to continue reading it. Perhaps once it is complete I will read through it again.

I know a lot of people adore the fic and subscribe to its values. A lot of people also love reading fics where Harry gets m-preg with Snape's child. I don't care for /those/ fics either.
