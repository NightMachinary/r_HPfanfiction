What about the characters in HPMoR seems 'sociopathic' to you, to the extent that you'll decline to read /that/ story but not others?

Same question about the author. He seems to me like a man with grandiose and unlikely goals, but an ultimately well meaning one, putting aside his personal character.

And I strongly question your objection that 'HPMOR is a self-insert author tract', since most of fanfiction follows that line.
