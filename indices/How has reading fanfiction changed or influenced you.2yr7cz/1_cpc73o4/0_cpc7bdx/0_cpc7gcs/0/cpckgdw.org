HPMOR is a self-insert author tract and that is pretty much the entire point behind it. Since I do not agree with the author's world view, the Harry in this story (and many other characters in it) are to me absolute sociopaths and the story is as unpalatable for me as a Darth Marrs fic.

But if you like it, good for you.
