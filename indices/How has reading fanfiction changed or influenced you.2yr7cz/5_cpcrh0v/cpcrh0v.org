It's made me more sympathetic. I've read all sorts, gone through so many scenarios, seen so many consequences play out, that when crap happens in real life I'm /slightly/ better prepared for it. Actual tangible books hadn't really done the same (with the exception of a few choice series, like HP), and I think a big part of the reason is that it's a place and people you already know. Things you're already attached to. It's like having an imaginary argument with someone in your shower.

It also drastically reduced (or was a contributing factor in reducing) my gross-out level for age difference relationships. Growing up, I didn't know of any differences greater than three years. My entire family was within that range, adults tend to not reveal their ages (back when I used to think of twenty year olds as adults... Lol). But my #2 OTP features a large age difference. I've even shrugged off age differences in my own life as being unimportant in the grand scheme of things.

As a whole I don't think it was fan fics that did it, but the repeated exposure to ideas and situations with these characters and this universe. Made me think about things early on, before they became an actual concern in real life.
