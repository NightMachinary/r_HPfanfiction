It's made me much more cynical I think. I see cliches and tropes in every form of media, and am constantly looking for the evil manipulative motivation in every move, searching for the overarching plot even when there is not one. On the one hand, not every motive is evil (morally or legally wrong), but on the other, I see that there is a lot of manipulative bullshit, and I often see through it. Unfortunately I "see through it" only slightly more often than I see something where there is nothing lol
