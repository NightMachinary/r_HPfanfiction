It's very empowering, I think. Fanfiction can sometimes have a very bad rep (looking at you "Fifty Shades of Gray"), and while it's definitely true to think there are some horrible stories out there, there are some REALLY good ones. I just finished what exists of the Alexandra Quick series, and it's like a whole different level of awesome...and the people who write fanfiction (I talk to a lot of them, even on here) are just normal people. So it's very empowering to think, "If I can do this, I can do anything." Plus, I have friends who majored in Creative Writing and want to be the next Great American Writer...and I've written 10x more than they have as a casual HP fanfiction writer because I just do it for fun. And I enjoy it so very much. It's my sanctuary. I'm a graduate student and I work very hard, so sometimes it's just nice to escape for just an hour or two a day.
