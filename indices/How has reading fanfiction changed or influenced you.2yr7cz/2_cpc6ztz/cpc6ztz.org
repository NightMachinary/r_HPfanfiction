I started reading fanfiction at a young age and was very naive and sheltered. I remember the first time I stumbled on slash. I was so shocked! I had to close it immediately and felt ill. It was foreign to me-guys like girls and girls like guys. That's the way it works, right?

I wonder how I would have reacted to friends coming out as gay if I hadn't read slash at some point. Probably poorly. It's weird to think about. So, thanks fanfiction?
