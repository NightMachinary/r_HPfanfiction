I think that's indicative of the Harry Potter fandom in general. It's a very accepting community.

But totally agree with you, fanfiction was the first place where I was really exposed to anything LGBTQ. At first I was horrified (starting reading fanfiction when I was 10, religious background), but it was so accepted in the culture that it just became normalized. So it made me think critically...that what I had grown up with was just completely wrong.
