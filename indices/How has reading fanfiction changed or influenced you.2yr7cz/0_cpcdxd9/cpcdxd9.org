I started evaluating independent books the way I would be reviewing simple fanfiction. So I don't care any more how famous the writer is, how much of a bestseller the book itself is or how many awards it has received --- if it is poorly written, I just say that it's poorly written instead of unconsciously trying to still glorify it for some merit or another just to not seem to be not understanding “what the author wanted to say”.

This affects my perception of films also --- sometimes I stumble upon a film with top ratings that would've sucked in comparison to really good examples of fanfiction (plotwise and tropwise), and all I can manage to think is “that's it?”, “this is what all the fuss was about?”.
