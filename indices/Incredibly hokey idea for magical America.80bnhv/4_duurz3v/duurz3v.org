O dang. That's a pretty cool idea.

What if there was a version of the Constitution for magicals, that was slightly different. Since there are much fewer magicals, their government is still pretty small. The whole 'blood sacrifice' is actually a popular event - every fourth of July, the members of MagiCongress, the Arcane Court, and the magical President (hey, clever names are hard) all give blood for the tree? Or some sort of hyperpatriotic Blood Drive system?
