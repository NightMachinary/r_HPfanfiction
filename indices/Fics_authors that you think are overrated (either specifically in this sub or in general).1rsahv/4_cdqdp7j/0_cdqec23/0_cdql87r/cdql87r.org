It's a little bit hard to pinpoint. But I'll use Grave Days as an example.

That one centers around funerals, but most of the characters seem to be almost back to normal. Harry wakes up on the first day after the battle, speaks to Kreacher, takes a bath, and speaks with McGonagall and Kingsley in very rational tones about the future of Hogwarts. We're told that Harry and the others are grieving, but this grief doesn't seem to affect their behavior or reactions to situations. Lines like “Can we talk [about the horcruxes] on the way to the tomb?” on the morning after the final battle strike me as very odd. People grieve in different ways, but most people show signs.

Rita Skeeter infiltrating a private party is very IC for her, but she recklessly insults everyone present, doesn't bother to even /fake/ remorse, and is apparently buddy-buddy with Umbridge. Wheras in the books, she's calculating and information-hungry, but rarely outright rude to anyone's face and certainly not evil or in league with the likes of Umbridge. Not to mention the astounding presence of mind that everyone (including Harry) displays throughout Rita situation and the confrontation at the grave that follows. Harry orders people into positions like an old pro, rather than an auror trainee who hasn't worked with the DA since fifth year.

It's really a matter of personal taste, I suppose. Harry's interactions with Ginny often don't "feel" right to me, especially in Hunters.

Strangers I do like, as a kind of guilty pleasure, but the premise of the story involves Harry/Ginny confiding in a random muggle neighbor and letting her be privy to private details of their life. Despite the fact that they have every reason to be private people, wouldn't want to go through the hassle of muggleproofing themselves and their home, and have a solid social circle already. They threw a housewarming party and invited all of their close friends and a bunch of muggle acquaintances, which forces their friends to put on a performance and fake their way through conversations. And it's apparently impossible for them to lie and pretend that Harry has some very boring job. Contrived premises are generally okay if everything from that point on makes sense. But Harry and Ginny (and other characters) continue to make decisions regarding Jacqui that don't really make sense.
