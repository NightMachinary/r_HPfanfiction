I've also previously read the Psychic Serpent and found it lacking. But if you want to know why it is mentioned so often: the fic's */old/*. It started being written in 2001. To put this into perspective, the fic's author finished the fic-version of year 6 shortly before Order of the Phoenix (canon year 5) came out. This was one of the pioneer big-fics of the Harry Potter fandom.

So in terms of quality, it doesn't compare too well with some other fics that have come out in the past 10 years. But it was very early. Some of the things which are now tropes of the fandom were new and innovative when Psychic Serpent introduced them.
