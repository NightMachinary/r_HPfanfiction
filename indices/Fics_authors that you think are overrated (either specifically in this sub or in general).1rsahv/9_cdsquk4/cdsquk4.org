The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville and Rannaro's Snape Chronicles.

It's like some fanfic authors don't understand that you /don't/ need to villify the other characters just to make your favourite characters look better. The chapter where Arsinoe's little self-insert has a little get together with Snape and the Malfoys to wax lyrical about how /terrible/ Harry and his friends are was just embarassing.

And the whitewashing. Ye gods, poor misunderstood Snape the Potions Master who never did anything but make potions for the Dark Lord. Vicious, malicious Marauders, shallow Lily Evans and well-intentioned Malfoys who "really just made a terrible mistake, oh dear us, we wouldn't have done it if we had /known/".

It's like they spent too much time looking at Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs and forgot that Snape and the Malfoys were both petty, vindictive bullies who /earned/ their Dark Marks and moved in social circles that thought it was funny to torture Muggles. God only knows what they thought Snape used Sectumsempra for, they probably believe he used it to dice vegetables or something. It wouldn't bother me if they thought they were writing AU fics or alternate character interpretations, but they seem to be under the impression that their fics are fully compatible with the books.
