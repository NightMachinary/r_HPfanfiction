On ff (dot) net, I enjoy Anne M. Oliver; but sometimes I feel like her fics are way too similar. They remind me of Nora Roberts romance novels, where some aspects are different, but the entire romance story is the same rehashed thing over and over again. Don't get me wrong, AnneM.Oliver is a great writer, but I stopped reading her stuff because it felt very repetitive and I wanted to see some more variety. There are some, more or less, different/unique fics, but I feel that she needs more creativity when writing her plots.
