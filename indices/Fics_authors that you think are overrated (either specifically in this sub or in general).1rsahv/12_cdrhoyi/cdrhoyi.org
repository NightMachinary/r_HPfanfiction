Resonance, by GreenGecko. Also the sequels. They kept popping up on rec lists and they had a lot of reviews and favorites, so I kept trying them. I must have read the first ten chapters or so of Resonance six times, trying to figure out what people saw... If you want a good mentor Snape, try The Guiltless, and the sequel, The Poor of God, by Branwyn.
