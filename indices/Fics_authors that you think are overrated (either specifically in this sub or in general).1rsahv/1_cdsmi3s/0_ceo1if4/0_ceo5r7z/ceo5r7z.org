If you haven't read it, Nugar's brutal (and legendary) takedown [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?s=10166bcabd49d0a5aef1f2e66ba4e399&p=353502&postcount=193][Perfect Lionheart is a Sociopath]] (excerpted on DLP), you owe it to yourself to remedy this.

Incidentally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/768029/Nugar][Nugar]], who wrote the review in question, is probably my favorite fanfiction writer in the Naruto fandom; his /People Lie/ and sequel are brilliant.
