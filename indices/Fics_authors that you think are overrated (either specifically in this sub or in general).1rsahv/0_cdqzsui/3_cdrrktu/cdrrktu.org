I read robst's stuff because it's H/Hr. It was kind of painful. Soul bonds, Harry becoming a Lord and getting married at, like, 12, Dumbledore getting constantly outsmarted by a little kid, and... I don't really remember much else.

I haven't read Harry Crow though. And after your comment, I don't think I will.
