Got to second this one. I have (guiltily) enjoyed some /robst/ fics before, but /Harry Crow/ is just... after the first 30 (!!) chapters or so, it just seemed to consist of nothing but an endlessly repetitious, stream-of-consciousness style mix of character bashing, crudely employed power fantasy tropes, and half-legible plot notes being read from a Denny's napkin, all typed up as fast as possible then uploaded.

After reading another 30 (!!) chapters, I couldn't take it any more and quit. It is now up to 80 (!?!) chapters and 553,332 words, and shows no signs of slowing down. I almost want to know what the hell is happening in it now, but not enough to start reading it again.

It's... it's like it is being written by a computer AI designed to make fanfics, but the computer doesn't /really/ understand dramatic tension, subtle humor, deep characterization, genuine human emotions, or plot pacing and design. It just knows to give some things glowing swords of power, have other things shit their pants, and that parents hate boyfriends and other such sitcom pablum.

If you want a Gringotts-raises-Harry fic, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry-amidst-the-Vaults-of-Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] instead. Has its issues, but is much, much better.
