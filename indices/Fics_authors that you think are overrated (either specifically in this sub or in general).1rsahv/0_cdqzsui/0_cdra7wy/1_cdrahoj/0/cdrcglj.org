Yeah, I vaguely remember that one.

If you quit early, you missed Ron being turned into a girl as punishment and against his will (!) to stop him from being a crazy rapist (?!), and the always oddly out of place weddings-ever-after ending. Dumbledore is also insane, and not in a fun or deep and interesting way.

My favorite part, I think, was how all the female characters were transported from scene to scene Hannibal-Lecter-style, unable to act or speak unless a man (Harry) asked them a question or told them to do something. It wasn't...good.

If I remember correctly. Which I might not, as it wasn't...good. At all.
