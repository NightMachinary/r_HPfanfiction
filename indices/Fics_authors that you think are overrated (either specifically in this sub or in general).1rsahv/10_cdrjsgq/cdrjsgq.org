Now that I've starting writing my own fics, I find it a lot harder to criticize others for putting in the effort into it. That said, I do sometimes wonder about Rorschach. I mean, I really enjoy his one-shot series, but the guy seems to lean too heavily on his beta readers/editors. I read his Make a Wish fic, and found a lot of the ideas alternately funny and whimsical, but it doesn't seem like its ready ready to be published. Despite being one of the most popular HP fics in existence (over 9000! reviews) the whole thing is rife with grammatical, spelling, and word usage errors. I eventually had to put it down. I wonder if he even bothered to give it a verbal read-through before posting.
