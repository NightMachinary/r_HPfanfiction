Are you familiar with walkingtheplank.org? It's a Snarry-only archive and was very big back in the days when the HP fandom was HUGE, though it still gets new works added every now and again. There are a lot of good, well-written Snarry fics being added to AO3.org as well, though quite bit of those contain explicit sex scenes which would violate FF.net Terms of Service.
