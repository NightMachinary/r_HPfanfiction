I think the problem is (or one problem is) that most people here like HP canon. Really, really like it. Like, /serious business/ like it.

Another could be, a lot of people who read fanfic nowadays really hate shitty slash fanfic. Really, really hate it. Like, /jihad/ hate it.

Main character slash is not even /vaguely/ canon supported (no love for you, Dumbles, sorry) and most experienced readers have seen *mountains* of /eye scarringly bad/ slash fanfic (because there is so much of it). Compare that to the amount of, say, canon-sexuality (if tortuously plotted) Soul Bond drek and you start to see the issue with the sheer quantity of bad experiences to be had. Gut reactions come into play.

More context. HP slash is, essentially, kink pandering. I've got nothing against it myself, and it is one a *huge* number of readers share, but it isn't main stream (though it might be the most numerous).

It is also a black sheep in a lot of circles. A lot of people are embarrassed to talk about reading fanfic because people /assume/ they are drooling over poorly written Harry/Draco slash done by horny 13 year old girls. They don't like that assumption, especially when they consider their interests more literary in nature. Bringing up slash means bringing up porn fics. No way around it.

So people react negatively to even the suggestion that someone thinks /not/ reading slash is unusual, unless it is handled carefully. When people start throwing around slash-specific or centric terminology, it gets worse. That's strike two.

Finally, that original post started, middled, and ended with what could easily be seen as a "/HA, HET FICS, AM I RIGHT?/" type of comment. Which isn't going to get the good 'ole boys/girls (of HP) on your side, know what I mean? Strike three.

I know, fuck you for not reading fics you don't like, in a totally different genre, with the regularity of a banker with the Financial Times, then expressing your casual opinion in a public forum, right?

Still, that is the context as I see it. Doesn't mean you have to bow and scrape. Maybe if you'd said instead something like:

  "So, I like penises in my HP fanfic. But I keep it classy and high-brow, little fingers raised, wot? So I've never read these before as mostly I read X het pairing fics. Also, some newer fics being mentioned here, so TIL, I guess. /Also/, fuck MOR and the horse it rode in on. Etc."

That last is usually good for a dozen easy upvotes or so.
