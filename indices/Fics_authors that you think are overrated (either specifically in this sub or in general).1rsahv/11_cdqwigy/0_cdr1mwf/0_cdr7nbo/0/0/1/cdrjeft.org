I'm less about pairings and more about quality of writing. It's less important to me that a character wind up with someone, and more important that things are internally consistent and fairly logical, so that I can maintain suspension of disbelief. That said, anything is preferable that doesn't just throw out background. For example, in any Snape/Harry pairing, there's a ton of misplaced animosity towards Harry on Snape's part, and Harry's certainly not a fan of the older man either. Any fic that ignores that, or uses the fine line between love and hate to shelve that anger without dealing with it isn't something I'm interested in reading.

Does that make sense?
