I agree completely with this assessment; the author comes off as an arrogant douche and his Harry is basically an author insert.

Others whom I think are overrated:

jbern - while he has creative ideas, his writing lacks polish.

Jeconais - for an author so influential early in the early fandom, his later work is strikingly mediocre.

Rorschach's Blot - some of his ideas are genius, but much of the time his writing comes off as sparse, more like a plot outline than actual prose writing.

Perspicacity - one of the most inconsistent writers out there.
