Me.

I've only finished 2 or 3 fic, and have 2 or 3 open in progress... my smut is good, and my plot ideas are decent, and my characters are awesome...but I have trouble keeping them all together.

I tell a good story though...at least I think so. It's hard for me to criticize any other author.

I'm proud of my finished stories though.
