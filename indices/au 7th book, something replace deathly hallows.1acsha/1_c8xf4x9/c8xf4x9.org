Try Bottle Fame and Brew Glory by Rannaro: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3824385/]] -s/he's has an incredible capacity to write novel-length. It's not easy. Snape's POV. Not first person.

By the same author, A Difference in the Family is Snape's biography and a bloody good read. Incredibly well thought out. And at 648k words, possibly the longest book I've ever read. It just keeps going! All good stuff though, very interesting and almost necessary background to some of tr stuff Dumbledore and Snape were doing while Harry was busy doing schoolwork and trying to get himself killed.
