The fact those are what comes to mind is kinda sad, as most of those are pretty shitty, extremely OOC setups.

An in-character setup would be for Harry to be adopted after abuse by his aunt, and want nothing to do with his former life.

linkffn(12212363) has some elements of this. He has a curiosity about his biological family, but as soon as it threatens his connection with his adopted family he shuts it down quick. So he does want to know about the potters, just not enough to allow it to threaten his priorities.

Although it does have the stupid, troperific, "Harry conscripted as a mini soldier as a kid and starts an army unit on campus". Story would have been much better without that shit.
