Tell me about big berserk curse!

I think the easiest thing to do would be to make vampirism take precedence; whatever force is turning humans to werewolves doesn't work as well on vampires.

More interesting things might be bizarre interactions:

you can turn into a wolf at will, ala Dracula, or

the side of your neck where you got bit stays humany when you wolf out, as well as a gradient radiating outwards, so your fur gets more dense as you get further from the site the vampirism first showed up

The place the wolf bit you is the only part that transforms, but it transforms for fully half the month so you see vampires with one big wolfy arm

The wolf and vampire curses are in constant combat and sometimes you're basically just a vampire and sometimes you're basically just a wolf

The wolf and vampire curses are in constant combat for the ten minutes it takes for the strain of said combat to kill you horribly
