I think it would be funny if applying a curse to someone lifted the last curse they were under to make room, and the curse on the Defense Professor counted. So werewolves and vampires who signed up to teach Defense would find themselves miraculously cured. I mean, clearly that doesn't happen. But wouldn't it be great?
