Yeah there's that. However I imagine that if being an Animagus could indeed prevent lycanthropy, James and Sirius would have tried to find a way for Lupin to keep the leaf in his mouth during transformation, even if they didn't succeed.

I don't remember wether it's stated being bitten by a werewolf as an animal does nothing but I guess it makes sense because Sirius didn't become a werewolf after his fight with wolf Lupin in PoA.
