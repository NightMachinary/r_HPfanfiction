It's not a major part of the story, but linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66) has Harry, as well as prior Potters, being a potter.

I've read a one-shot in which Harry talks with Voldemort in a mindscape, forming things out of clay that are actually memories, but I can't come up with a title or link for that one.
