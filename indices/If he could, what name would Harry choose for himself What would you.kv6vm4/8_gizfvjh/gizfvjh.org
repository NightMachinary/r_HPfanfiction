Questions:

- Does Harry know Muggle literature/pop-culture?
- Does Harry put two-and-two together?

If yes to both, I could see him naming himself after a wizard in muggle pop-culture - or, in the case of Merlin, trying and getting talked out of it. If he's even aware of the series' existence (I wasn't, at 11, but then I couldn't actually read English yet) he might try Sparrowhawk or Ged, from the Earthsea novels - the parallels between Ged/Sparrowhawk (same character, Sparrowhawk's a nickname) and Harry would be very striking.

If he doesn't know any Muggle-pop-culture wizards, it'd probably be of the "sounds cool to an 11-year-old" variety. Or he'd just stick with Harry and tack something edgy on.
