Honestly you would think that Magical hookers would have tons and tons of polyjuice potion ready. Polyjuice allows them to participate in the industry regardless of their own physical beauty and it allows the customer to tailor his own experience.

According to economics this allows a huge market because it completely eliminates a significant barrier of entry, being personal beauty. Now, the only factor left is having a supply of polyjuice. This creates a secondary market for hookers needing polyjuice from potions shops. This large demand incentivizes potion shops to accrue and mass-produce a large quantity of those products. This would in turn completely reduce the cost of poly-juice ingredients. Now, according to the determinants of supply this would increase the number of sellers greatly and temporarily decrease the price until the demand for sex in the Wizarding world increases to match market equilibrium.

Now you have a world where GOOD sex is affordable and everyone is doing it!
