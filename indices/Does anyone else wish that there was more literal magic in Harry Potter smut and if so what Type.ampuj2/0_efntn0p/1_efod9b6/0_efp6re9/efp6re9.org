I am sure that there is a way to make Polyjuice Potion permanent, after all If it happened to Hermione by accident in second year, I am sure a potion master could make it permanent on purpose.

The only thing that crossed my mind would be that it could be abused by dark wizards, by doing something like make a Polyjuice Potion that can transform muggles and then Kidnapping them and Polyjuiceing them into harry's form and then playing there own much darker version of harry Hunting. were the Let the Polyjuiced muggle lose in Knockturn alley and then compete in hunting them down.
