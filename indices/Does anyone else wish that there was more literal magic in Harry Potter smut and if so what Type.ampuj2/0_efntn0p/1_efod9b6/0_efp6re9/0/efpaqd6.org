  I am sure that there is a way to make Polyjuice Potion permanent, after all If it happened to Hermione by accident in second year, I am sure a potion master could make it permanent on purpose.

It was a fluke and turned her into something she didn't want to be, not to mention that we don't know whether or not there would be any health concerns if it was left as is. I'm not saying a permanent polyjuice isn't possible, but I really doubt it's anywhere near as easy as just hiring a potion master to work on it.

Then there's still the possibility that a perfected permanent polyjuice might be obscenely expensive.

  The only thing that crossed my mind would be that it could be abused by dark wizards

Who's to say this sort of thing doesn't happen already? Not just with Harry, but with anyone. There could very well be a horrifically dark underworld to wizard society, and that scenario is just one of a great many possibilities. I mean, how hard would it be for some sick wizard to kidnap a third world tribal muggle child and keep them dosed with amortentia and (if they're rich enough) polyjuice?

Though I kind of doubt that Knockturn is lawless enough that a full on manhunt and torture session could go down without notice. Seems much more likely they'd use their own estate or just the wilderness somewhere.
