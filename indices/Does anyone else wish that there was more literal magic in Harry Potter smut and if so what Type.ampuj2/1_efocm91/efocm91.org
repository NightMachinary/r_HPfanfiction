Nature of sex and sexuality really is under explored in fanfiction.

The various hi-jinks that can be accomplished with mutable forms (transfiguration), conjured toys, and various performance enhancers should affect societal views of such things in some interesting ways.

As for cursed objects, they'd probably be more creepy than sexy. Tracking/surveillance spells to track who the cursed individual is with and possibly harm them, or 'grooming' spells that cause feelings of disgust when feeling attraction to anyone other than the chosen target, when looking at the subjects chosen 'love' they may get hit with a cheering charm or something. There are also the classics such as spells that cause miscarriage, impotency or increased potency.
