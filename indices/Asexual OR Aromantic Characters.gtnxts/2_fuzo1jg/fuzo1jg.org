This isn't very helpful but a while back I read a drarry fanfic with asexual and sex repulsed Draco. I think either he or Harry was a legemis (sp). It was on ffn and it was notable for being pretty respectful w/ aroace. You can probably find it by googling asexual Draco rec list. it being very popular.
