  George was afraid of heights, so Fred dared and dared him into going higher and higher--patiently, kindly, gently--until at nine George didn't want to get down from a broom, even for dinner. When one of them set it up, the other had the punchline. When one of them started it, the other finished the sentence, or the sandwich, or the job. When Fred stared after Angelina in the Great Hall, George noticed, and looked to his plate. When Fred waxed eloquent about the grace of Angelina's passes in practice, George thought about what that meant for Oliver's game strategies. He remembered what it had been like, being afraid of air beneath your feet. When Fred talked smugly about the gardens outside the Yule Ball--the little niches and nooks, shadowed and cool, Angelina's backless dress--George fiddled with their latest recipe for Puking Pasties.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

  When Harry Potter sorts into Slytherin, Parvati hears whispers.He should have been a Ravenclaw, she hears, He's gotta be a smart kid, right?She recognizes the way that people underestimate Harry Potter, the way they downplay his bravery and cunning and stubbornness in favor of focusing on his brain, his grades.Sure, he may be the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, but he is expected to be a very certain kind of Chosen One. He is expected to be a smart one, a brilliant one, not a brave one or a valiant one.She knows their expectations of Harry just as well as she knows the expectations that she and Padma and Cho and every other Asian kid get. It's the same thing everybody expect when they see the slant of Remus Lupin's eyes, the turban Parvati's father wears, the sari wrapped around her mother's body.
