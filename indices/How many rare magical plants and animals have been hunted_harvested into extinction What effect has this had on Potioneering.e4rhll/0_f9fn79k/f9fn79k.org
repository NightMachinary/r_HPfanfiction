I doubt plants would be much of an issue, considering that there's probably a large amount of spells and enchantments to assist in controlled growth outside of where they would be found naturally. Personally I feel creatures would be the more viable option for extinction either for their parts, or for the challenge and thrill of hunting down dangerous and exotic creatures, as the Wizarding World, as shown in the movies, doesn't seem overly concerned with preserving species; outside of the dragon reserves which I feel would be more for the sake of keeping a dangerous creature under control.
