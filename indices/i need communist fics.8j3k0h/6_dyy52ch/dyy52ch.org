Wouldn't it be more interesting for a "communist Harry" story for Harry to decide that he was too weak on his own to defeat Voldemort and his death eaters so he, Hermione and Ron would work to create participatory magic that required many wizards and witches to cast together to create a magnification effect and that magic required empathy and group practice to pull off. The power that the dark lord knows not would be.... magical communism!

The danger of it might be maybe that this magic could be corrupted by a individual who tried to utilize the power of the group to his or her own ends and that the magic when it was at it's strongest could suppress your individuality.

Maybe something like this would be more interesting. What do others here think?
