I just realised that a society of free house-elves would likely be a communist one: they feel compulsion to work, so everyone will perform according to their ability; and they have very modest needs, so providing each according to their need is easy.

Unfortunately, I would expect them to develop a currency in order to allocate available work: a house-elf earns "money" by resting and spends it by bidding on the chores that they would get to do.
