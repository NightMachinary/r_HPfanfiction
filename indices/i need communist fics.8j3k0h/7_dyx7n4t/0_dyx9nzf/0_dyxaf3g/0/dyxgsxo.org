Careful saying that out loud if you live in America. There's a lot of people here who have very strong feelings against communism - or anything even remotely resembling it. The reasons why are a bit too complex to go into on this particular sub (since there's a ton of historical context you'd need to know), but suffice to say that you could get beat up if you said you liked communism (or "socialism", for that matter) in front of the wrong crowd. And they wouldn't care if you actually knew what it was or not.

Just be careful in your non-online interactions, that's all.
