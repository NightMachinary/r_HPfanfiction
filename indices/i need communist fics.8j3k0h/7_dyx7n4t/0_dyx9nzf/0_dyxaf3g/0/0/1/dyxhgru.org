It's a type of government that has the potential to work in theory, assuming that every single person in a country would be on board with the idea, but how it has ended up working in practice - historically speaking - has turned out quite different. Places that have adopted communism, such as China, Cuba, the Soviet Union (which has since split up into Russia and several smaller countries), and North Korea, haven't been very good places to live - but at the same time, we should note that they've followed a modified version of communism that is different from the system as it was originally theorized (by someone named Karl Marx, whom you may have heard of).

As to whether any form of government is "bad", that really just depends on how well its people implement it. Nothing's perfect, and anything will reveal some internal flaws if it's left to develop long enough. Is the Ministry of Magic a "bad" government? Depends on who's running it. Under Fudge, not that great. Under Voldemort, even worse. Under Hermione, pretty good. There's still plenty of people out there who think that communism / socialism has only failed so far because the previous countries who tried it got Marx's ideas wrong - and there's plenty of other people who are anti-communist because they think Marx's idea just can't ever work in a way that would produce an enjoyable life for people.
