Oh. Okay. Well I mean the government doesn't have to be BAD, right? Or is communism specifically creating a BAD ONE? Cause I thought it was just any random government, like it doesn't matter if it's like a democracy or a union or a kingdom or whatever? And I didn't know it was BAD. It didn't sound bad anyway. :(

Also yes I do live in America. :)
