  Well I mean the government doesn't have to be BAD, right? Or is communism specifically creating a BAD ONE?

We don't know yet how good a government we can make, communist or otherwise.

All communist countries to date have been dictatorships, and dictatorships suck. (But then, most governments have been dictatorships or oligarchies of some sort.) Communism was good for Russia because it replaced the Tsars, who were brutal to almost everyone, with a government that was far less brutal to most people. But it was still a dictatorship, and it still had a lot of problems. It also got Russia to become an empire, and countries benefit from being empires, at the expense of all the countries they're being empires toward.

Russia tried to get a central planning office to tell everyone what to do to make the economy work. This wasn't great. On the one hand, they built up their ability to manufacture goods very fast. On the other hand, people could game the system in ways they couldn't in capitalism. For instance, a factory had to make a certain number of shoes per year. But they couldn't get much leather. So they made shoes too small for anyone to wear, just so they could make as many shoes as the central planning office said they should. Another factory had to produce tractors, but the planning office only checked how many wheels they made, so the factory made wheels and not tractors.

All the other communist countries were also dictatorships, working closely with Russia and trying to use the same sort of economy.

What we learned from Russia is that planned economies are hard. What people say we learned is that communism doesn't work.

Once Russia stopped holding up its empire, the remaining communist countries struggled to find trading partners. It's hard to be prosperous without trade.
