Wow there buddy, you might want to recheck some of your facts. Firstly the Bolsheviks didn't replace the Tsar's, they replaced the Provisional government in a bloody coup, who had peacefully demanded the Tsar step down. Not to mention that Tsarist Russia wasn't as brutal as you say, some things were very backwards but they were certainly on the right path before the war started.

Now with the Bolsheviks ousting the Provisional government this is a much more murky mess as the PG was making progress, they were setting up a democratically elected system and moving towards a more western style of government, of which the Bolsheviks were a political party in. Their major failure was not pulling out of the war when they took power, a reasons the Bolsheviks used as an excuse to take power. Hell the PG even let the Tsar and his family live in exile, where the Bolsheviks had them killed in the home, even the dog, I mean really bit far with that one IMO.

Now in regards to what they did after taking power, they plunged the country into a bloody civil war, and then set up a system that directly led to Stalin taking power as a brutal dictator who had over 20+ million people killed. As far as I know only really eclipsed by Mao with his 50+ million killed in the dictator kill list, also communist btw.

Empire wise, the USSR didn't turn Russia into an empire, it already was and it also owned the majority of the land they took back after WW2. Might be wrong but I'm pretty sure the Russian Empire under the Tsar's owned more land then under the USSR.

Just wanted to add on to the end though that while I don't even believe that Communism could ever work, I do avocate for a hybrid Socio-capitalist system similar to what is currently used in Scandinavia and parts of Europe, and as a European (for now at least) I don't really get much flak for this.
