Why? Because communism does not scale well.

At the 'commune' level, it works well enough. There are plenty of examples in all sorts of places, where groups of likeminded people join. The problem comes when you start scaling up, once you get beyond the 'everyone knows everyone else on a first-name basis', or when people with a different set of values are forced to join, it all breaks down.
