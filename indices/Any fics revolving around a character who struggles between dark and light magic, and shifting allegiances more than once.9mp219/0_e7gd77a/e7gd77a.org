I have a big problem with the light/dark distinction in HPverse. It just sounds too much like Star Wars, as the HP Books never once mentioned "light magic".

In fact, JKR even condoned the use of Avada Kedavra in context of euthanasia. It seems to me that the Books placed character intentions and motivations over the means anytime. For example, Tom Riddle merely used a Confundus on Hepzibah Smith's house-elf to murder her. Similarly, the first year entry level spell Wingadium Leviosa could easily be used to levitate a big rock and bash someone's head in.

Therefore, I want to see a somewhat different kind of struggles by the characters, in which they have to make difficult choices between morality and operational effectiveness. For examples:

- An inner circle Death Eater has been spotted in a particular location with his family. Harry has to decide whether to take him out by blowing up the area, thus killing potential innocents; or risking the lives of his own people by ordering a direct assault. How should Harry choose?
- An alternative way to kill Voldemort exists, but requires sacrificing innocent children in a horrible ritual. It's guaranteed to work. Because Voldemort created Horcruxes and greatly weakened his soul, it's possible to reduce the cost of this ritual as not to involve any human sacrifices. However, the modified ritual is not guaranteed to work. Which option should Harry and his friends choose?
- A decade after the War, it was found that in addition to the Longbottoms, up to several hundreds of potential Cruciatus victims might lay around in Muggle hospitals. A potential cure is in development at DoM, but requires testing on live humans. Several Unspeakables propose to use Death Eaters convicted of murders and torture as test subjects. Some vindictive DA members also support this proposal, saying it's just fair turnaround, but they want the Trio and Neville to have the final word. How should they decide?
- After a major engagement, the DA and Order lost several people due to other's side use of the Killing Curse. Some members suggest to retaliate in kind, since Avada Kedavra bypasses the shield charm and offers significant tactical advantages. On the other hand, Avada Kedavra is still very much a taboo among the populace and its use means losing certain popular support. The leadership also worries that liberal use of this curse has adverse psychological consequences. How should they decide?
