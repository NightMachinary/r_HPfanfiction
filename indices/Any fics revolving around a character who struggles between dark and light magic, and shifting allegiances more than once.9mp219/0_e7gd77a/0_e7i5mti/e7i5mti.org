Lots of trolley problems here, but I agree with your disdain of light and dark. Also, the aversion of the killing curse has never made sense to me. Possibly because I'm American. Also also, why is it a problem that Voldemort is immortal. It's shown that for him to become corporeal again isn't simple. As soon as he pops up, avada kedavra him, rinse and repeat.
