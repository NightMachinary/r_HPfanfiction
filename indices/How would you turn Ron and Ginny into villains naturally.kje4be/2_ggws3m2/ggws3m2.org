I think I would have them make a tough choice and the consequences would drive them mad. For example, they're forced to choose between Harry and Percy. It's so easy to choose! Until the guilt of the easy choice. The empty chair at the kitchen table. The hand on the family clock. Harry knows the cost. He feels survivor's guilt. He starts to avoid the Burrow, making the Weasleys feel abandoned and regret their choice. A particularly pernicious variant of this could be if intel shows Percy is in danger but they can't act on the information withour compromising a valuable source. That would really give the baddies a foothold.
