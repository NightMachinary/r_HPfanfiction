I like the way Kreia from KOTOR puts it. "It is such a quiet thing, to fall. But far more terrible is to admit it."

So, that's how I'd take it. Think about what they want, and what they (in their right mind) would be willing to do to get it. Then work out what it would take to make them just... bend it, ever so slightly. A little thing at first - maybe cheating on a test they're so desperate to pass, maybe warning another girl off of Harry (for his own good, of course, she's such a slag) - just a slight bending of morals, and then have it slowly grow and grow, thinking they're doing the right thing all the while, until something big happens to catalyse it into villainy. Either they embrace it and feel justified in doing so, or they feel regret and convince themselves that they can't turn back or make up for it. The Fall is so much more interesting when its a slow burn, or when the Fallen truly believes they did the right thing.

Or give Ron everything the more anti-Ron side of the fandom thinks he wants. After all they went through, Ron is the one to take down Voldemort. Harry might still have to kill him afterward, but Ron is the one to /beat/ him. So, Harry, being a good friend and a perpetually shy soul, steps back and lets Ron take the spotlight. He goes into the Aurors, lauded as a hero, and even 'gets the girl' in Hermione. But then it starts to sour. The fame keeps dragging him away from Harry and Hermione, the job is long and hard and egad there's so much paperwork. Hermione gets upset at him spending so much time at work - but it's not his fault, it's his boss, demanding wanker who keeps treating him like this - creating some stress at home too. All his dreams aren't quite what he thought they'd be, and he's under so much stress. The little seed of resentment starts, and starts to grow. After that point, the sky's the limit. Get him into drugs, get him angry, send him to the Fight Club, whatever. If his life is getting him insecure and angry, there's so many potential falls right there.

Could also have someone seduce them into it. Maybe Daphne draws Ron or Ginny in and convinces them down that path. Or Ginny, while she did lose the possession, never did quite lose that little voice in her head, the one that reminded her of everything she didn't have, everything that her circumstances denied her, everything she could simply /take/ - she is the Greatest Witch Who Ever Lived, after all.
