Ron do to having so many siblings thinks he is finally going to out shine them when he becomes Harry's friend (as harry ended the war that took his uncle's and Molly only brothers) but instead he just gets pushed out of the way as everyone dolts over him (only getting worse when he, Fred, and George being sharry to the house for the first time). "Hell even his sister is obsessed with him and all she talks about his harry this harry that" resulting in him becoming vary bitter and jealous of everything that happens to Harry good or bad.

On the same pass

Ginny after growing up with the Harry Potter books (the ones like lockharts books not the irl books) and putting herself in the books as whatever "Damsel in Distress" is in that book. Her childish mind has desided that she is his and they are ment to be together. This thought is only strengthened after he almost dies saving her her first year at school. After this she becomes obsessed with Harry (intensified by the damage done by the horcrux and her not getting a mine healer for the whole ordeal) she finaly became violent with any girl close to harry.
