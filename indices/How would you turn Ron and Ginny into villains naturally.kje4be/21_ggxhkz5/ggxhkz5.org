People here are overdramatic, there is no need to have such drastic events cause the changes, when subtler ones could b√©e far more effective.

Take Ginny for example, let's say she has great difficulty making friends at Hogwarts which combined with the Diary's influence leads her to befriend some slytherin students. Then just give her the standard dark!harry plotline and boom done. I'm sure some Slytherins would love to 'corrupt' a pureblood member of a family of blood traitors into the dark. Of course, there are plenty of ways that this could realistically work or fail, but that's up to the author's discretion.
