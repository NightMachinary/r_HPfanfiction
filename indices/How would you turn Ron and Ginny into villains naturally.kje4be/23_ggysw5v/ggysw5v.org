If we're doing a fairly canon accurate run up, I don't think we can turn Ron into a Death Eater. We can, though, probably make him into a villain in his own right, assuming what we mean here is "Ron is an obstacle facing Harry":

1. have the Triwizard Tournament be only marginally more dangerous than Quidditch with events that force Harry to show off
2. Ron starts taking studying more seriously as a way of avoiding Harry
3. have Voldemort use Cedric to assist the cover up by implanting false memories, so the whole resurrection thing is much more ambiguous
4. the Weasleys still go to Number Twelve so Ron's entire life is now subsumed by Harry... when Harry turns up, Fred & George should be used to have Harry vocalise his expectation of becoming the male fifth year prefect... also, Harry should be there first (so, no Dementor attack)
5. Harry /does/ get the prefect badge and, remember, this Ron has had a very different and more academic fourth year so actually deserves it in a way canon!Ron doesn't (and for that matter, neither canon!Harry nor this version of Harry deserve it... the difference this time is that Dumbledore gives Harry the prefect badge specifically /because/ Ron's not his friend any more)
6. Umbridge is not a cartoon villain but, instead, Arthur's third cousin and how Arthur originally got his job at the Ministry... but she still takes Fudge's side strongly and still does the inquisiting. Thus, Ron becomes a member of the Inquisitorial Squad and uses it to show off that he should've been the prefect. Harry lashes out claiming the only reason Ron likes Umbridge is because they're related. Umbridge should also teach stuff that's practical but not relevant to Defence Against Voldemort (so... let's say lots of vampires, goblins, centaurs and so on... "being defence" as it were), meaning Hermione still encourages Harry to create DA
7. have this non-reconciled Ron buy into the horcrux!dreams as attention seeking
8. (as I can see for sure is already suggested) have Arthur be killed by Nagini (because Harry and Ron now sleep as far away from each other as possible in the Tower... and the delay is critical)
9. Ron now /hates/ Harry and is aligned with the Ministry... just like Percy (whom he's actually not that different to even in canon; just like how Petunia and Harry have surprisingly many similarities)

While Ginny nominally seems easier because we know less about her and we've got the Diary, with those events she'd probably be closer to Harry than usual. Indeed, point (8) should cause her to blame Ron not Harry. Thus, if we want to do this in the same universe as the Ron above, I think we need to look at villain!Ginny as being a dark!Ginny who goes /way/ beyond what's necessary. To this end, it'd be useful to still end up in the Department of Mysteries to conclude Harry's fifth year. The thing is... it's not /just/ Death Eaters that throw around unforgivables like they mean it: Ginny does, too.

So... if Ron becomes Umbridge/Percy, Ginny becomes Crouch snr.

Frankly, I'd use the Ron situation and Mr Weasley's death to make Hinny happen in the weeks following the latter. This then transitions into Harry's deliberately lying to protect Ginny from Azkaban, which legitimately does create frictions with Dumbledore as well as creating angry Harry (remember: Dumbledore doesn't distance himself from Harry in this AU). Thus, Ginny is a villain in the sense that she embodies all the "worst choices" Harry can make and she encourages Harry to fixate on what's meaningful to him personally (i.e. their relationship), which has the side effect of making him less altruistic than in canon.

Of course, Voldemort's not a total idiot so he's going to learn things from this state of affairs. And I think the chief lesson is this: if he ignores Harry, everyone will eventually become like Ron. Voldemort can be patient.
