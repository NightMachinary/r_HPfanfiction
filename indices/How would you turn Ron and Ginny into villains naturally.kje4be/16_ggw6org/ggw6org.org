There was one I read recently that had psychological reasons. It started at CoS, Ron said "let's get Lockhart", Harry disagreed and they split up, Lockhart botched the memory spell and because Ron was angry at Harry, his brain blamed Harry for everything bad. Ginny had been brainwashed by Molly (she was a bit nuts from losing her brothers) so was like a stalker.

They were both a bit villainy but got help in the end, it was pretty good. Ron and Harry realised they didn't actually have much in common, Ron just wanted to be friends with the boy who lived, not Harry himself.
