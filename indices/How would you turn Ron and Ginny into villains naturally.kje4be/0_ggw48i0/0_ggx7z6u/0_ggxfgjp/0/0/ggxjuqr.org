I like stories where I am truly unsure if it will end "good" or "bad"while reading them. And I prefer if things end generally happy, but not every tiny detail gets wrapped up neatly and you do get the feeling that things are better now, but not perfect. There are still problems to deal with but that 's not the story we were focussing on, so how these things are dealt with is up to the reader's imagination.
