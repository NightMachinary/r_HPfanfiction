My personal experience with people "going bad" has mostly been drug related.

To that end, Ron was perfectly willing to cheat with liquid luck to get on the house quidditch team. It's really not a stretch that he would risk other potions--maybe at Lavender's suggestion. And personalities change fast once someone is unbalanced.

Ron doesn't have the cash to sustain a drug abuse habit. And they've already stolen from Snape's stores. Ron starts to steal, gets involved with other thieving kids, and eventually falls into a dark arts addiction.

If you want to have Ron and Ginny both fall in the same story--she could hook up with one of Ron's junky friends in a vain effort to make Harry jealous, and then follow the crowd to the same place.
