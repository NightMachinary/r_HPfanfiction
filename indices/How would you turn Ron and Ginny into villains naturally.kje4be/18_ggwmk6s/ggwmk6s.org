Have it grow naturally over the course of at least 2-3 years. Also, it should be built on a solid foundation- a real grievance that can escalate when the offending parties refuse to apologise or make up for the slight.

1. In 4th year- Harry DOES enter the tournament without telling Ron. Then makes excuses for it.

2. In 5th year- Harry, perhaps worried that he will be dismissed, doesn't mention the attack on Mr Weasley and gets defensive in the aftermath, rather than admit fault.

3. In 6th year- Harry doesn't tell his friends about horcruxes, despite Dumbledore explicitly allowing him to. I can actually imagine Ron taking it more personally than Hermione too. This one does not allow him to go 'full Anakin' on Harry, as the lines for the conflict are already drawn, but he will no longer be friends with Harry and things might get more ugly after Voldemort is out of the picture.

If you want it to start it earlier in the story, you would have to imagine a completely new plot point, because the timeline until the 4th year doesn't have anything that would justify such a radical change. The same goes for Ginny in general, who is, for most of the books, a complete non-entity.
