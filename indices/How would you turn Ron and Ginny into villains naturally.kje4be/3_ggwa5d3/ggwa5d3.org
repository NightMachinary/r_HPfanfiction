If you start at the train, I can imagine a slighted Ron holding a grudge that grows with every tiny thing that he percieves as offensive. Maybe Harry is reading a book or something and ignores him on the train, Ron assumes Harry thinks he is better than him and it grows from there. Harry doesn't even have to do much, he is just naturally antagonistic. Ginny could follow Ron or have lingering effects from the diary ect.
