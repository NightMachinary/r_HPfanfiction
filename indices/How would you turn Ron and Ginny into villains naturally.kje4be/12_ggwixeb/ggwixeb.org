1) Ron was a pretty insecure and jealous Person. It's not hard to imagine him becoming consumed with thoughts about what he is owed. If Harry in 3rd (edit: 4th) year for example didn't forgive Ron after the first task. I could see that being the start of a long spiral downwards. 2) Or maybe petigrew could have done something to Ron. Either molested him and poorly obliviated him leading to suppressed mental trauma and manic type behavior/ or cast some botched spells on him. 3) Ginny could be from the diary, or maybe just an obsession with “her” prince Harry, and being “just like James and lily”.\\
4) Or maybe Lockhart oblivates the youngest weasleys one too many times throughout the year.

5)Or maybe molly or Arthur got hit with a spell at the end of the war that affects any children they have from then on. (So only the youngest two are affected). A literal curse on the bloodline that makes them slowly become insane. Maybe cast by one of the lestrange or black brood.

6)Or maybe they just get a taste for blood shed/ or dark magic.

7)Maybe Ron and Ginny are tired of being considered blood traitors, they are pure bloods who shouldn't want for anything after all.

8) Or being a villain doesn't necessarily mean you are evil. It could just mean you have different political ideology. Maybe they have looser morals (ones that pure bloods have no problem with because it's what they have always known/how it's been done), things like love potions being a ok, squibs being shunned and mistreated is normal, abuse of house elves, disregard for magical “creatures” such as werewolves, centaur, Veela, etc, purebloods being able to get jobs not based on skill but name while muggle borns and the common man are bared. So not evil and plotting murder and betrayal, but different standards for what is acceptable/expected behavior. So they are villainous to the muggle raised people as they are part of the system.
