In the Harry Potter universe being evil doesn't inherently mean being a death eater or in the same league with Voldemort.

One instance I can think is that during the final battle, Molly dies. Ron and Ginny were both close to her. They were in a state of mental trauma. They think Harry responsible for not saving her. So they make plans to kill him. They have to be given therapy or taken to a mind healer.
