Mainly because of Harry's canon thoughts. He suspects Snape 'can mind read' at least once before he even learns what legimency is and I think authors have run away with the Dumbledore's x-ray like gaze.

There's also the fact that they're 2 of the best at legilimency and fans want to make them extra manipulative.
