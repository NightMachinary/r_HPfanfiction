It's been a while since I read the last book but I don't think it specifically says he uses legimens. It states he had difficulty extracting the memory, if I'm not mistaken... Which would make sense to me because I don't think legimency would be able to see that a memory has been tampered with but shrugs

Now I did forget about Bellatrix potentially teaching Malfoy though again we have one line from Snape saying she was teaching him occlumency that Malfoy didn't say was the truth... So she probably did know it but it's not 100% sure Though she should be listed with the other two, she's just normally not a major character in fanfictions
