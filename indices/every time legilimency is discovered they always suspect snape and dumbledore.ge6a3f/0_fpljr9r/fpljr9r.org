Because Dumbledore and Snape are the only two characters in the entire book series outside of Voldemort that know it (though it is just a guess that Dumbledore knows it because the books never state he does, just him saying he should have taught Harry not Snape the mind arts)

And people love bashing Snape and Dumbledore

Edit: the books do state Dumbledore is practiced at legimency... End of the order of Phoenix so that ramble is incorrect but the gist is still correct

And Snape guesses that Bellatrix was the one teaching Malfoy occlemency in HBP though Malfoy does not agree it's the case, though that would suggest Bellatrix knows Legimency unless there's another way to teach occlumency
