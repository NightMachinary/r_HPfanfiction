You were looking for a lengthy fic? Try finishing this sucker if you haven't read it already.

It's AU with Harry being an unwilling protege to Voldemort, who is Britain's charismatic but vicious ruler/dictator, after winning the first war.

IMO, it's one of the best written fics out there, with a complex web of politics and magic for Harry to navigate if he wants to survive.
