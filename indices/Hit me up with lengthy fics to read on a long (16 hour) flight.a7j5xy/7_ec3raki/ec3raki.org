Just had a similar request yesterday. I recommended linkffn(Divided and Entwined; Patron by starfox5; Backwards with Purpose; Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality; Daystar's remix of hpmor).

Patron is really AU, in the sense that the whole setting is recognisable yet different, not just a point of divergence.
