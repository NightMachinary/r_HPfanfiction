If you haven't read The Redemption Series, you should check it out! It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3662420/1/Save-Me][Save Me]] and continues with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3701756/1/Brothers-and-Sons][Brothers and Sons]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3801134/1/A-Foreign-Language][A Foreign Language]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3934136/1/A-Few-of-Our-Favorite-Things][A Few of Our Favorite Things]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3975880/1/I-Am-Gryffindor-s-Daughter][I Am Gryffindor's Daughter]].

And if you don't mind Drarry (It's a super slow burn one, very plot heavy) try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]].
