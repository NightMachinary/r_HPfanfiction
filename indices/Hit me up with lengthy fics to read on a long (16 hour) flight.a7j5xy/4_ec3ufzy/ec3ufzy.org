One of the longest fics I've finished is a 2-parter by Bobmin (~1 mil words):

As always with Bobmin the technical skill is pretty good, but it depends on your taste whether you can enjoy the types of stories he writes (this one has a bit of an OP Harry, who still has to flee from Voldemort for plot reasons).
