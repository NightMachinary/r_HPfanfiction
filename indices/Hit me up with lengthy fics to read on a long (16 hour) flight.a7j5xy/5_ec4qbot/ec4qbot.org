[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - Summer before 2nd year, Harry prays to Loki and he answers. The series is complete and is 400k+ words in total. Slash warning is for minor characters, not Harry, Sirius, Remus, etc. Bashing happens but only because a lot of people take a while to get used to a more confident, independent Harry who's willing to stand up for himself.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - 900k+ and complete. Very AU as it starts with Harry making random trips to Naruto universe to learn at the ninja academy when he's young (like, 7? 9?). Again, bashing is due to people having expectations of Harry that aren't true anymore. There is a whole book on Harry travelling to the Avatar: Last Airbender Universe and helping out the gang there. It does end up with Harry/Tom slash, but that's in the later books.
