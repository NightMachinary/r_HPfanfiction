So much potential you could do with this! If you wanted to ignore the abuse that Fanon writers like to do, you could still wonder why Harry was trying to escape his cousin Dudley in the first place.

Would he wind up in front of a whole lot of people/Certain people/maybe a person who could help or hurt him. Use it for their advantage, etc.

It wouldn't even need to be a Slytherin. Harry is The Boy Who Lived. I'm sure a lot of people would like to use a little boy who apparently doesn't even know he's a Wizard who just so happens to be The Boy Who Lived.

Or what if he comes across Andromeda, Ted and Nymphadora in Diagon Alley? That'd be interesting for the fact that Sirius Black is his Godfather and a supposed mass murderer.

Or if you don't want to go to the typical meet up with the Weasley's or Draco Malfoy, there's still SO much you can possibly do with this.
