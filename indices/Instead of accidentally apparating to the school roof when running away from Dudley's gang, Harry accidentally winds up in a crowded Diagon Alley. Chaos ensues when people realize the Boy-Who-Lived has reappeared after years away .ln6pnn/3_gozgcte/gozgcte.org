​

Harry Potter hated recess. Most kids his age loved the chance to be free from lessons for an hour and to play out in the sun. Harry would have loved it too except for one thing, his cousin Dudley Dursley. Despite being only about a month older, Dudley was taller, wider, and stronger than Harry and his favorite game was Harry Hunting. Dudley's gang would chase Harry across the schoolyard and if they caught him they would beat him up. Harry's cheap wire frame glasses were held together with sellotape because Dudley so often punched him in the nose.

Harry had one advantage over Dudley. Perhaps it came from living in a small dark cupboard under the stairs. Maybe it was that Dudley was allowed as many sweets as he wanted and so was by far the fattest and slowest boy in school. Or, it could have just been that Harry had a lot of practice running away. But, as long as Harry could see Dudley and his gang coming, he could almost always outrun them. Sometimes, it felt like he could run fast enough to fly. But today was different. Last night, Aunt Petunia had decided that the kitchen floor was insufficiently clean and he'd been made to spend most of the night on his hands and knees scrubbing. He'd been so exhausted that he'd nearly fallen asleep in class. Then he'd opened his packed lunch to find two moldy bread crusts. He'd done his best to eat around the worst of the mold without letting anyone see. The last time a teacher had taken issue with his lunch he'd spent a week locked in his cupboard. Punishment for talking about what went on at home.

So there he was, exhausted and starving, leaning against a tree trying not to think of food when he realized that Dudley was entirely too close to him. Harry turned to run but quickly realized that Dudley's gang had him cornered and they were closing in. His knobby knees were shaking. The last thing he needed on top of everything today was a pounding. He tried to see a way out of it but he couldn't. He'd have to run away from Malcolm, the fastest of the lot. But, doing that would force him to run right at Dudley. He looked around for a teacher. None of the teachers liked him at all but they would still stop Dudley from pounding him if they saw it happening. Mr. Wadsworth was the closest but his back was turned and he was too far away for Harry to get to without being caught. Heart racing Harry desperately wanted to be anywhere that Dudley and his gang weren't. He closed his eyes and when he opened them he wasn't in the schoolyard anymore.

Harry was in the middle of a busy market street that he knew was nowhere in Little Whinging. There, buildings were planned so that they all looked alike. Shops on the same street even had matching signs and everything was neat and orderly. This place was wonderfully haphazard. The buildings were all unique and a few seemed to have grown at funny angles. He looked around him, eyes wide trying to see everything at once. One shop had a stack of cauldrons sitting outside of it and a sign that read “Cauldrons - All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver - Self-Stirring - Collapsible.” Another looked like a grocer's with trays piled high with things outside the door but they weren't selling fruits and vegetables. The signs in front of each tray said things like asphodel root, 3 sickles an ounce and dragon liver, sixteen sickles an ounce. A man was standing over the trays muttering about the absurd prices. There was an owl emporium and a broomstick shop and...”

"Hey there. You lost?" The voice came from a man standing over him.

Harry nodded. "Where...where am I?"

The man gave him a curious look. "You're in Diagon Alley lad. I'm guessing you had a bit of accidental apparition."

"Um...what?"

"Muggle-born are you?"

"What's that?"

"Yep, muggle-born." The man sighed and knelt down so he could make eye contact with Harry. "Let me guess. You were thinking about being anywhere but where you were? Maybe something was chasing you?"

"My cousin."

"Great bullying git I imagine."

"Yeah."

“Well, you wanted to get away from him and just so happens you're a wizard so you moved yourself away by magic.”

“I can do magic?”

“Sure kid.”

Magic. He could do magic. Suddenly a lot of little things made sense. Like that time his teacher's wig had turned blue. And the one time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a particularly revolting old jumper of Dudley's and it had shrunk down to doll size.

"Well, tell you what, why don't we go to the Leaky for a bit and then we can figure out getting you home. I imagine you've given everyone a bit of a fright."

Harry didn't dare say that his aunt and uncle would be glad to be rid of him. Instead, he just followed the man to a brick wall. The man pulled out a thin stick and tapped at a few of the bricks in what looked like a particular pattern. The wall sort of folded away into an arch and revealed a rather plain door with the words Leaky Cauldron painted on around a picture of a cauldron with a crack in the bottom.

"Come on then lad. I'll buy you a drink."

They went in together and sat down at the bar.

"Hey there Atherol. Usual for you today?" Said the barman.

"That'll do nicely Tom and a pumpkin juice for my young friend here. By the way kid, what's your name."

"Harry. Harry Potter." Two things seemed to happen at once. First all talking in the pub ceased and second there was a crush of people around him trying to shake his hand or pat him on the shoulder. A few of them asked questions.

"Are you really Harry Potter?"

"Do you have the scar?"

"Where've you been Harry?"

"Is it really him?"

"Said he's Harry Potter."

Harry felt himself being pulled in several directions at once by strangers. It was like they thought he was some kind of celebrity. Just as he thought the crowd might pull him apart firm hands grasped him around the shoulders and a loud voice shouted.

"All right, that's enough you lot. You vultures have pecked him enough. Back off now.”

Of course, no one moved. Harry saw a flash of bright light and then everyone moved away from him. The hands moved him through a door before he could say anything. Once they were through the door, Harry got a look at his savior. The shabbily dressed man looked like someone Uncle Vernon would cross the street to avoid. His face and hands were covered in scars and his sandy brown hair looked like it hadn't seen a comb in some time.

“Colloportus”, the man said. He had a stick like the one Atherol had used on the bricks and was pointing it at the door. “Well now, that should keep your adoring fans away for a while.”

“Thanks.” Harry panted. “Who are you? And why did they react like that?”

“My name is Remus Lupin, Harry. I was a friend of your father's.”
