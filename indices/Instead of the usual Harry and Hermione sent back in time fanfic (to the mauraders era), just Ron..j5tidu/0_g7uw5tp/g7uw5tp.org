I could imagine that as funny.\\
Ron in his head "Bloody ... shit ... bloody ... fuck", you already know with his stage fright.\\
He tumbles from one faux pas to the next, sweating bullets all the time.\\
Was Jenkins not a colleague / friend of Arthur Weasley's, Ron accidentally gives Jenkins as his name and then sticks with it ... hehe.\\
Then he remembers his greatest strength ... the Cannons and all the games they lost and then he remembers other results and gets rich.\\
Just to finally understand how Harry feels all the gold in the world, just not his family with whom he can share his life, because he has live the lie too long.
