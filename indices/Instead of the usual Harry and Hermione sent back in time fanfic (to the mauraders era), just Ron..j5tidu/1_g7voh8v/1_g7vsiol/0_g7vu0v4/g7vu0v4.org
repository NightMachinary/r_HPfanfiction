One of the annoying ones too.

"Alright people, gather around and present your reports. Ravenclaw, any luck on the Tom Riddle front?"

"He was a prefect and Head Boy, but he just vanishes after taking a job in Knockturn Alley."

"Yeah, fair enough. Slytherin, clues on the whereabouts of the chamber of secrets?"

"Maggie found something about piping? We still haven't figured out the relationship between that and 'bloode moste pure', but we think it's probably indicative that blood vessels are involved somehow."

"Ha, no. You're on the right track, though. I suggest you go ask Myrtle."

"What, Moaning Myrtle? What would she know about the Chamber of Secrets?"

"After decades just listening to bathroom gossip? Your guess is as good as mine. Now, Gryffindors. "Operation: keep the nerds alive! Status?"

"They're still alive, just a bit injured."

"That's the spirit. Don't coddle them or they start to think that running a resistance movement is a good idea. It isn't, by the way, so no trying that. Any concerns?"

"Lily keeps running potions experiments with that Snape kid!"

"It's alright. I'll talk to Sev about it, make sure he follows safety rules and stuff okay? Just stay out of it. Baby Gryffindors need space to grow. Now, Hufflepuff!"

"Sir!"

"Mapped out Hogwarts as I asked?"

"Here!"

"Great work, you win this week's round and get 10 points! Now, next challenge is for 20, so here goes:"

"Yeah?"

"Learn how to drive a car!"

"A what?"

"A car, sort of muggle broom... Thing. Can't fly though. I will give some lessons over the weekend, you'll get it in no time! Dead easy."
