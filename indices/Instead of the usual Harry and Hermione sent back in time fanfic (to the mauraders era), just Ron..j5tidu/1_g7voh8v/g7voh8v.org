"Right, so welcome to Defence Against the Dark Arts. I'm Ronald McKentucky and I am here to teach you all how to stay alive in the face of incredible danger. Today, we will be learning about the many different highly illegal items that can be used to stay alive, learn how they could be used to stay alive and go through every step of making them in detail so you know when one of your mates is making something illegal so you can tell them to stop doing that."

"Umm..."

"Yes, Miss Prewett?"

"Isn't that... Illegal sir?"

"Surprisingly not. Anyway, gather around everybody so I can show you how to make this highly illegal magic carpet for the purpose of identifying when a magic carpet is being made. Ideal for escaping death eaters, but highly illegal. Now first, you need a carpet!"
