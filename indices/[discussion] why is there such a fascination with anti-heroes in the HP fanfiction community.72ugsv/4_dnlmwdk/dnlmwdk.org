Nowdays, I like to read fanfic that is somewhat different than canon. So it's more interesting to read about antiheroes or villains because there is so much that we don't know or can only speculate about.

Afaik, in the Star Wars franchise, there are some people who contend that the Empire did nothing wrong. It's a different perspective that's thought-provoking in some ways.

Like others have said, redemption plots are very popular because bad->good is way more fun to read than good->winning.

In the HP canon, Snape is presented as nuanced. Reading through the first few books, there can be a few interpretations of why he did something. I don't think Draco was truly redeemed; he seemed to develop some sort of conscience halfway through HBP. And Riddle is interesting because his backstory brings up so many questions regarding nature vs. nurture and whether or not his rise to evil could have been prevented by any number of factors.
