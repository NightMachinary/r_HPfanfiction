Probably because Harry in canon is exactly that? I mean we all know he'd rather play quidditch or hang out with Ron, who IMHO is the worst slacker in Harry's year, instead of learning new magic (he had to be freaking forced into running the DA by Hermione after all!) not to mention that he isn't really getting any stronger over the course of the canon story! Harry in 7th year doesn't know much more magic than Harry in 4th year and it's not like he learned most of the stuff because he wanted to! Nope it was the freaking tournament that forced his hand!
