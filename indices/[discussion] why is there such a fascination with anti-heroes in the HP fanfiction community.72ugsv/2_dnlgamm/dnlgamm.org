I've always assumed it was something to do with the general demographics of who writes and reads fanfiction. At least when I first got into fanfiction as a teenager, I was super into edgy, angsty anti-heroes. So I assume its something similar for the those who got into the fandom. It's interesting to watch an author over a long period of time, because from my own anecdotal experience, they tend to move away from the angst and anti-hero focus.

Now this is just my own personal theory, but I think a lot of writers like to try to "redeem" some characters in some manner, to justify their like or attraction to one of the characters. There are so many fanfics that have the cliche "Oh I was an evil douchebag just to fool everyone, I actually am a super good person" and that just writes itself as an anti-hero and I think that has to do alot with it.

Its also good to remember that that fanfiction is alot of peoples first major efforts at creative writing and most people will tend to imitate things they like in these attempts. And I think it's much easier to write an anti-hero than a proper hero, since there is a whole lot more leeway with characterization.
