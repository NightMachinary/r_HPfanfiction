You are correct in that. Villains that aren't grounded in reality or have understandable motivations aren't compelling characters. And in a "villain" focused fanfiction, giving them a understandable motivation and backstory is a tenet of a good story.

But my point rather isnt that villains shouldn't be compelling, it's how authors tend to excuse characters. For example, Draco is "redeemed" from his sexism, bigotry, and vileness as being misunderstood, confused, or scared of his father. And not that that isn't a good motivation, but it's done very weakly, tries to have their cake and eat it too, or even just doesn't follow the characters own logic. It isn't that writing a villain is bad, it's that a lot of the attempts in redeeming a character seem more like wanton impulses than actual character arcs and motivations.

It isn't that villains are always bad characters, it's that too often in fanfiction, people don't understand how to write a logical, compelling antihero/redeemed villain. At least that's the crux of my argument.
