  Now this is just my own personal theory, but I think a lot of writers like to try to "redeem" some characters in some manner, to justify their like or attraction to one of the characters.

Counterpoint: This is, to some extent, /necessary/ for fleshing out a character, because [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/][nobody believes themselves to be the villain]], and (metaphorical) comic-book villains are therefore ridiculously unrealistic.
