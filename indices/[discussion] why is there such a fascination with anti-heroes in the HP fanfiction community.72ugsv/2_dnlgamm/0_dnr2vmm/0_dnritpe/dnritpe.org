Rebuttal: that isn't fleshing the Character out, it's answering for all their bad actions like cold blooded murder, racism, sexism, bigotry, genocidal actions, torture and other things that would violate a person's human rights with "But my parents didn't love me so I get to do all this, say sorry and get to be a good guy... Plus I got abs" Draco doesn't get fleshed out but gets rewritten from a sniveling coward into a man with a nigh indomitable will who has a back story extremely similar to Harry only without having to wear rags.

It's bad writing
