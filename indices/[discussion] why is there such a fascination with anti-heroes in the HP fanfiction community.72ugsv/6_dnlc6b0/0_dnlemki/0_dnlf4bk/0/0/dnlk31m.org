I'm not impressed with Voldemort either. Canon Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain.

Dumbledore could have easily killed off best of his supporters in the DoM and derailed his plan by who knows how long. But of course, the 'good guys' must not kill or they might sink as low as their enemies! Even with 'good guys' fighting with both their hands tied behind their backs, this guy barely managed to hang onto power of a medium sized country for 10 months, before being overthrown by mostly teenagers. He got killed when trying to take back a high school.

On the other hand, he was a genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills. In the end, his own foolishness (for example the excessive reliance on Avada Kedavra) got him killed and he was sent to rot in hell forever.

The pre-Horcrux Tom Riddle, however, could be far more interesting. I often wondered how much more he would have achieved if he had just followed more 'conventional' routes to power.

But then again, I like to view Hermione as the good version of Tom Riddle, and that's part of the reasons she is by far my favorite character.
