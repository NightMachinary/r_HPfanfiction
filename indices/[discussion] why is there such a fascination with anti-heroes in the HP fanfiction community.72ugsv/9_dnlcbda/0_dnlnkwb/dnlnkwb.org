Going back into fandom history archives, there seem to have been fans of Snape before the movies came out (I think I came across some posts dated 99-00). A lot of the rationale seemed to have to do with Snape's "protective nature" of the Trio (searching for them when he thought they were in danger/trouble in the first 3 books). After the fourth book, rich!pureblood!Snape tended to feature in fanfic, which lasted until OotP.

As for Draco, in Chamber, some fans thought he was weighed down by the expectations of his father (based on that one scene in Borgin and Burkes). Some interpreted the whole Hippogriff saga as a cry for attention. Ofc, based on the end of the series, these interpretations aren't entirely true. But he did become a sympathetic figure in HBP with the bathroom and tower scene.

Based on anecdotal evidence, Snape fans tend to be middle age women, and Draco fans tend to be teenagers. However, Daphne fans and harem/multi fans tend to be men/teens. Obviously this isn't the case for everyone, but demographics clearly play a role in what someone likes.
