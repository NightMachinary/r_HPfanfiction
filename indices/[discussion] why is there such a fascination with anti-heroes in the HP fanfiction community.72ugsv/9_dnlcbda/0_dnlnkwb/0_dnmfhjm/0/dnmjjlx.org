I kinda felt sad for him.

He was ordered to do something way out of his league as a way for Voldemort to punish his parents. While Draco is confident and boastful in the beginning of HBP, he's overwhelmed and terrified in the last two scenes. Even Dumbledore noticed that Draco lacked the intrinsic will to kill him before the other Death Eaters showed up.

Before HBP, Draco is really annoying and presented with a "non-weak" personality. There is some complexity added to his character in HBP, which can make him more sympathizable depending on the interpretation
