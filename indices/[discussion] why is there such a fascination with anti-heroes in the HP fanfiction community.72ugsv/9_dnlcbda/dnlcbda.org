Too many edgy teen girls/women fell for Tom Felton and Alan Rickman. This demographic is EXTREMELY OVERREPRESENTED among fanfic writers.

If the fandom had a similar demographics like this sub, which is mostly adults and 50-50 in gender distribution, there would be far less appreciation for those villain characters.

Also according to our surveys, male teens seem to like Voldemort, but none of male adults.
