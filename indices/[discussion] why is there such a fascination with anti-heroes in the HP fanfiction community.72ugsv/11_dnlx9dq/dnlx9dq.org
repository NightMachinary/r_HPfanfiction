I've been reading and writing fanfiction for over ten years now (sometimes more, sometimes less and in many different fandoms) and I've discovered that anti-heroes are often much more interesting to play with. There are just more possibilities to develop and to change a character. There is often not much more to them than being 'evil' and unless one sits down and tries to interpret every single action or thing said they can even seem a bit dull at times. The possibilities just seem endless with anti-heroes.
