Personally I don't care for Draco (although I do have some sympathy for his situation in HBP) but I love Snape for several reasons.

One of which is that he clearly illustrates the difference between good and nice - nobody said Snape was a nice person, but on balance we can say with a fair degree of confidence that he was good, in the sense that he thoroughly redeemed himself after his youthful mistakes.
