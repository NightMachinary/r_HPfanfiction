Imo the villians propel a story more than the hero. They are better characterized as well. The hero by plot, must do things that are right, or be labled as an antihero. To me a Draco, who does terrible things and repents and builds a family is 10x as interesting than a Harry who never does wrong or if he does its omce because plot and he has to have a flaw.

Then for dark crazy or pure evil villians we have to ask why and how? How did they get that way, and why do they make the decisions they do? Does Voldemort have a soft side? Or is he the madman the entire time?
