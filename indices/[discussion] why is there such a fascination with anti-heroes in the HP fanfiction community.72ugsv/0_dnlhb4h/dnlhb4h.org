Anti-heroes are everywhere in popular works from Wolverine to Holden Caulfield. The bad boy or the curmudgeon forced into something he would normally rail against. You can even see Carl from "Up" as an anti-hero.

One of the driving forces for characters in fiction is change. How does our hero change over the course of the story?

When you look at Harry, he changes a lot from a little boy bewildered by this magical world he's been plopped into to a confident powerful young man fulfilling his destiny. Looking at Draco, there's not a lot of change there. He starts out and stays a sniveling shit with practically no redemption in canon. This leaves a void to be filled by eager fan fiction writers. A chance for redemption for the writer's favorite bad boy. This also plays out with turning Harry Dark. Light, powerful, happy Harry is boring. Dark, powerful, brooding Harry is exciting!

I'm not involved in any other fandoms apart from HP these days, so I don't know if the anti-hero thing in the HP fandom is disproportionate, but if you look, you'll see them everywhere.
