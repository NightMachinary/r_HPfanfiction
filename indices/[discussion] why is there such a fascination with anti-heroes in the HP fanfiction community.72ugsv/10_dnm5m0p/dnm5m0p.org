I enjoy reading about them because I find them way more interesting than straight up good characters who have everything going for them. I like seeing them overcome their flaws, I like seeing reasons for the way they are. The world isn't black and white and I feel like it's nice to see things from another perspective where even bad people may have good qualities and reasons for being the way they are.

Plus, for characters like Snape I just love his sarcasm, cynism and intelligence. I also like the more slytherin approach to problems, breaking rules when needed, using subtle manipulation and careful planning vs. rushing straight into battle head on.

I am a huge sucker for redemption story lines in general which don't really work unless your character is an anti hero.
