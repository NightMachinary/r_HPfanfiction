While I do agree with you that redemption fics for Draco are usually lacking, in canon he is not fundamentally evil: he is a child, paroting what his father said, raised to be arrogant, who lives in a fantasy where the good and powerfull pure-blood protect society from the evil muggles, their magic-stealing spawns and the defiler of his culture. While having him shedding his whole upraising like an old shirt is unbelieveable, it is possible to have him leaving the fantasy his father teached him through years 5-7.\\
We frequently, and conveniently, forget that HP characters are barely adults by the end of the books, only children and teenagers through them.
