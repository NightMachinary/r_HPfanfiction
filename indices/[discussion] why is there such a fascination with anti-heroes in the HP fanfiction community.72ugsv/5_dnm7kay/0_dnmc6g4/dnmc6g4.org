Yeah, I just can't buy the Draco is a Good Guy Deep Downâ„¢ story. His most defining traits are his spinelessness, his stupidity and his racism. If you take those away, he's not actually Draco, you may aswell create an OC (or use Theo Nott. */Why don't people do this???/*).

If Draco had mentioned offhand that he wasn't friends with Blaise because he was black, there wouldn't be 1/10th the amount of these stories, and yet, when he spends the whole series wishing death upon Hermione because she's muggleborn, it just means he secretly likes her.

He's essentially Dudley Dursley with magic and racism.
