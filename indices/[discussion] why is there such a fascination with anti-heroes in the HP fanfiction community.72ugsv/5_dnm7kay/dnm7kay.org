Anti-heroes and interesting flawed characters are fine. The problem is that Draco is neither of these things, and I do not understand why people like him. Draco is an annoying piece of shit and doesn't go through any sort of redemption, he just gets terrified at the modus operandi of the Death Eaters, after eagerly awaiting it for years. Come on, are you telling me he wasn't aware they tortured and killed people? The guy wouldn't give a shit if mudbloods got murdered, unless he was doing the murdering. I can accept Snape being a decent person somewhere deep-down, but with Draco it would take very strong character development. However, most fics just start out with him already being a decent person who got put into a hard spot, and hey he's also totally in love with Hermione. Yeah, pull the other one.

The only good Draco story I've read is Turn by Sara's Girl, and that's mostly because it's well-written and uncommonly good slash. Still, it takes quite a bit of suspension of disbelief.
