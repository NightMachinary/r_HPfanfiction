It's very easy to dislike McGonagall, but it's also pretty easy to turn her into a good character, too.

And it's worth pointing out that McGonagall was correct; the stone WAS safe. If it weren't for Harry, Voldemort had no chance of getting the stone out. There was zero hint as to how to get it out, and a good chance that it would have kept him busy for far longer than it took for Dumbledore to get back. The first set of protections were clearly a trap. Dumbledore himself was surprised that Harry was able to get the stone out. I mean, my number one hearts desire would probably be for Voldemort to never figure it out....not to figure it out and take the stone first. Being that I was tied up and all.

I'd also like to point out that the protections were mostly one way. I suspect if Quirrel tried grabbing the mirror and running - assuming they escaped it's delights - they'd find the traps became much harder. After all, how do you get back through the fire? Potion would have worn off. How do you get through the locked door? Flying key is on the other side. What about getting through the trapdoor? Sure there's brooms, but that's after you escape the attacking keys. Did you think to grab one?

The black players probably are enchanted to be better players, so while white got beaten by Ron, going back could be way harder.

Basically, Harry ruined the Mirror protection by assuming HE could protect it better than Dumbledore, and of course, it was so traumatic and Dumbledore is such a softy, he had to pat him on the head and tell him he did well. Because you don't tell an 11 year old that they nearly ruined everything and killed for nothing.
