Also, McGonagall never gave any indication she believed there would be abuse. She watched them all day, and thought they were the worst sort of Muggles...because they were so cookie cutter, unimaginative, and mundane. She watched them spoil Dudley all day. She just thought they'd raise Harry to be boring and bland, not chuck him into a cupboard and try suppress his magic!

Do you remember what 90s fashion was? Oversized, battered clothes were cool. Harry probably looked like one of those white hip-hop boys, not a Charles Dickens urchin. Fits the bad boy image, and I bet you anything cool cats like Lee Jordan dressed similar.
