What's to like about a craven "woe is me" coward, who pities himself for 13 years, while the orphan son of his supposedly best friends deals with life threatening situations and ... you know.. being an orphan? Did he ever visit? Did he write even a single letter?

Oh, and then, he doesn't decide he's been an idiot long enough on his own, no, he gets hired by Dumbledore and is basically *forced* to interact with Harry Potter. Of course after being slapped awake by Dumbles he immediately tells Harry who he is and how close he was to Harry's parents... oh wait no, that's what a decent person would have done ("Oh hey Harry, nice to meet you, I've been basically inseparable with your parents for 7 years, lets have a cup of tea I'll tell you about them"). Maybe he just got mad, because he didn't get the Godfather job and is acting out of spite ("Hah, they gave Godfather to a murderer and betrayer, those idiots, fuck 'em and their stupid child").

If you need to know more about the man just look how he jumps at the chance to abandon his pregnant wife too.
