Dude, come on. Where on earth do you even get the idea that Remus Lupin knew where Harry was? Nowhere in the story are we told that he was with the Potters or even around their home on that night, and afterwards Hagrid collected Harry and took him straight to Dumbledore waiting on Privet Drive. I don't think there was any detours made just to inform Lupin what was going on so that he could not write letters for 13 years.

Why would he go straight to Harry and tell him who he was? Who just goes up to random teenagers and starts talking about their backstories? He knew that would completely freak Harry out and so he tried small interactions first.

You think he was pissed that he wasn't asked to be Harry's godfather? Again, where are you getting that from? Remus, Sirius, and Harry's parents were all living through a war at this time, I doubt that was foremost on his mind. He spent thirteen years mourning the loss of the only people that were ever accepting of who he was, all while living with the terrible effects of lycanthropy and not having enough money to help himself in any way.

As for the last statement, you cannot just say that he jumped at the chance of abandoning his wife. As far as we know this was the first instance of a werewolf reproducing - can you even imagine how terrifying that must have been for him? To not know whether the horrible condition you live with was passed down to your child, to not know whether your wife would survive childbirth? He was terrified and made a mistake. The important point is that he came back.
