Disliking McGonogal is a good step towards being absolutely redpilled in regards to HP. She's a complete disgrace, "while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts", what a useless diatribe.

Remus Lupin is another character that takes a while to hate properly, but that's exactly what that whiny man-child deserves.
