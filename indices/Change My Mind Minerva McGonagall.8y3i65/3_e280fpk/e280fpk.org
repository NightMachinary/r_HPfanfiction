It's a children's book. You and a billion other people are taking the story too literally. /Of course/ McGonagall is doing nothing about these things; if she were doing something about them there wouldn't be a story. If you don't agree with it, the solution isn't to discard all of their canon characterization and pretend they're evil, the solution is to write a piece of fanfiction where their motives and actions are self-consistent, and then build the story up around that. "I can't forgive this character for neglecting Harry." and "It's in canon, so it's undeniable that they're neglectful." are both incorrect attitudes, because they ignore that you're very obviously /not supposed to notice or care/. Not to say you can't care, but treating them as deliberate is a deliberate misread of the source material.
