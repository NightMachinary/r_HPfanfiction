There are two ways to look at Harry Potter. Everyone is an idiot is the first and the second is maybe there are reasons behind things that Harry as an unreliable narrator doesn't notice.

Harry's placement? You mean the placement with his relatives who spoil their child? The people who also in the real world would have gained custody and the people who in the real world would not have received a visit of an old school teacher of the biological parent?

Legally mandate? Not in the UK which is good because the mandatory reporting system doesn't do the children any good while its prono to abuse. It was a symbolic gesture at best...

Why doesn't she report it? Because while it's very visible from Harry's eyes its most likely not something others noticed. Neither his friends nor his muggle school teachers.

Does she ignore them in first year? Dumbles gets informed while traveling to the ministery. While the Stone was perfectly safe in the mirror. She just doesnt share her actions with 11 yr olds.... As she shouldn't.

Harsh charcter building was and is in no way uncommon in English boarding schools

Bullying is an interesting topic and a topic that gained a lot more attention since the Harry Potter books came out. Here is an important cultural difference between the USA and the UK. Especially in the USA there has been a rise of a whole anti bullying industry. (Which has really no impact on the problem) The english attitude against bullying is very different especially in boarding schools where what american's call bullying is actually instituionalised character building. And the English lack the school shooting problem which has been partly attributed to bullying they arent so hysterical about the issue.

Umbridge? You mean the powerless school teacher should do something against the ministers right hand who got full power to clean house at Hogwarts? She did what she could to keep her students out of trouble. Harry doesn't see that he only sees a target to fight with......Minerva tells him to keep his head down...... What does harry do get detention almost on purpose..... While telling nobody about the blood quill....

Do what about Draco Malfoy? An important piece in Dumbles plan to die and have Snape do it. Would have been pretty unresponsible of her.

You mean the year in which she shields the children as much as she can? Instead of walking away and let another DE in the school ?

Nah she does what is right not what is easy.
