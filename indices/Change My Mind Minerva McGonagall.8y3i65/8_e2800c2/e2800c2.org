  The placement of Harry Potter with his muggle relatives.
#+end_quote

"Placement" nothing. She walked away from a 15-month-old baby abandoned out-of-doors at night in November. Child abandonment, could easily have been negligent homicide (cold, animals, people, etc.).

  She ignores Harry and Co year 1 about the Philosopher's Stone ... forcing Harry to confront Voldemort
#+end_quote

He asked to speak to Dumbledore. She told him Dumbledore would be back tomorrow. He gave her no reason to think this was a matter where time was important. She hardly "forced" him to do anything.

  Snape's treatment of Harry
#+end_quote

This was completely normal teacher behavior in England as little as 50 years ago. Parents considered it proper discipline.

  Bullying is not acceptable

Again, considered normal behavior in many schools. Toughen 'em up!
