I agree that it isn't shown in the books, so it probably didn't happen, I merely meant to say that no matter what exactly the dangers are, there should be something that Dumbledore could have done against them (although he probably didn't). Should have written that different.

As for whether a warming charm exists or not, I think we can agree that a lot more charms exist than is shown in canon, we just didn't get to see all of them. And HP characters not using all the means available to them for whatever reason is also not especially uncommon. I mean, you would think that a group of wizards on a lengthy camping trip could just pack a few flavours of canned food and duplicate them whenever they're hungry...
