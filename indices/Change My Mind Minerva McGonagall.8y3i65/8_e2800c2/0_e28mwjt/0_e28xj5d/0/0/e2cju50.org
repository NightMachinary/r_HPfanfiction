No, but there's just no sign at all of it in the books at all. Everything is narrated, moment by moment, until they just walk off. So you have to add something to canon to make everything fine. I mean, silent spells are plausible, but you have to add it in.

Of course, there's no warming charm in canon either - the nearest is a hot-air charm Hermione casts. In fact, as with time-telling charms, characters undergo a great many inconveniences that make no sense if such a charm exists.

But, you know, fine. Just, not having him do that is also plausible and doesn't add anything not there in canon. It just accepts the book as written.
