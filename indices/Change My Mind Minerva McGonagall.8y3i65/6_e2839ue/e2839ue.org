  She ignores Harry and Co year 1 about the Philosopher's Stone. That is inexcusable. The very vaunted defenses she is relying on are obviously compromised; how else would a group of first years know about them? Surely she should take action. But no. She does nothing, forcing Harry to confront Voldemort.

And arguably, she was right to. Keep in mind that it was Harry & co.'s interference that, if Voldemort wasn't a /blithering idiot/, would have led him to get to the stone.

  Years 2 and 4. The mistreatment and bullying of Harry Potter. Bullying is not acceptable, much less on a schoolwide scale. How can you allow this to persist? What part of you thinks this is acceptable? Yet again I (a teacher) would lose my job if I did nothing to curtail the rampant bullying of a child. This is her responsibility, she is after all the Gryffindor Head of House. Doing nothing is far easier than taking a stand is it not?

I don't recall the bullying being especially bad either year. I haven't read them in a while, though.

  Year 5. Umbridge. Before you say it isn't her fault she's the Deputy Headmistress, it's her responsibility for what Harry had to go through. The repeated detentions were obvious signs, if one cared to look closer. As to Harry not going to her? Why should he? When has she ever stood up for him before? She cared more for her position than for the safety of her students.

Why exactly do we assume there's anything she /can/ do? It's common fan-logic to assume that blood quills are illegal or not allowed at school. There's no evidence of that, particularly since apparently she invented them herself. And that's beyond the fact that she was literally the vice-minister for magic and was appointed by ministerial decree despite the headmaster's wishes.

  Year 7. Allowing Death Eaters to torture students within the confines of a school setting. This goes without saying; if your maintaining your position is more important than standing up for (the safety) your students you are not a teacher you're a coward.

What do you think would have happened if she did anything? She'd have gotten killed and replaced by another sadist, most likely. If she's lucky she'd have been able to escape, but that still wouldn't really help the students. While she was there she could covertly help.

In general, a lot of your issues come down to that there's really nothing she could have done. Snape, for instance. She probably did speak up about him, even though I don't really think he was especially bad. Where are they going to get another potions teacher, though? It's no secret that Hogwarts has a severe staffing shortage, due partially to the fact that the magical community is so small. McGonagall, for instance, teaches at least 12 classes, grades essays for those 12 classes, patrols the hallways at night, helps with the administration of the school, and if she has any time left she acts as head of Gryffindor house. Now, I can't say I actually understand how Hogwarts scheduling works, but at my high school, teachers were only allowed to teach three classes --- though they did have each class every day. Snape, in addition to working as the head of house of Slytherin, patrolling, and also teaching and grading 12 classes, presumably also brews potions for the hospital wing. In order to replace him, you need to have someone who is a good enough potioneer to take on the position, which requires an interest in the material, raw talent, and significant training, but not so much interest in the material that they'd prefer to actually brew potions as a career instead. They'd also have to be willing to work extremely long hours for very little reward, where the slightest screw up means that a child might die. That type of person isn't exactly a dime a dozen. And even if you could, they might be a bad teacher. All available evidence (which admittedly is quite limited) shows that Snape's teaching results are excellent.

I'm not saying that McGonagall doesn't have the "plot-induced inactivity", but pretty much every character on Team Good has that, because Rowling thinks of inactivity as a virtue and ambition as the greatest evil in existence. This /is/, after all, a book series where the seventh book literally relies on them sitting around in a tent until the bad guys screw up again.
