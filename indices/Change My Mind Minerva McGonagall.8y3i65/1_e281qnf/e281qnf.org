1. McGonagall takes her misgivings to her superior from the start and he persuades her. Dumbledore then places Mrs. Figg to watch over him, so as far as she knows, Dumbledore has it handeled.

2. She sends him back because they are his guardians AND he shows no outward signs of abuse. Harry keeps almost every single bit of it to himself.

3. McGonagall isn't given a reason it would happen that night or soon, just that they know about it. Furthermore, she DOES catch Harry and Ron standing "guard" so she also DID go to the corridor afterwards.

4. Snape's treatment of students would be filed to Dumbledore who does nothing to curtail it. She already knows the Ministry is corrupt and would not go to them.

5. The students did not outwardly bully Harry in Chamber and the closest they got in Goblet was the badges. Otherwise they flat out ignored him and whispered behind his back. Neither of which she could stop - you can't force people to be like someone.

6. McGonagall did not know what Harry had to do in detentions AND she knew he got them because he kept rising to provocations. Furthermore, Harry answered this to his best friends as "doing lines". She isn't omniscient.

7. No one believed Harry that year because Harry accused a sixteen year old of being a Death Eater. PLUS Draco had an alibi during Katie's bad fortune (he was in detention).

8. We don't know what McGonagall did during the last book to even judge this. The only ones we saw hurt were those that point blank defied them. Furthermore, an open defiance would have brought the Death Eaters and possibly Voldemort onto Hogwarts without time to properly prepare and without a means to win. Lastly, when the Carrow WAS going to harm innocent students she geared up to attack right then and there.
