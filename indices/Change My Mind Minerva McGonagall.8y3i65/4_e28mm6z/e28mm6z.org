I thought I would add my two cents to this discussion because your view of McGonagall seems to based entirely on things we only know because the books were written from Harry's point of view.

We don't know whether or not she checks up on him during his tenure at Hogwarts. All we know is that when the initial question of leaving Harry with the Dursleys came up, she strongly objected. She couldn't do more than that because she didn't have the authority to, it's not like she could have just snatched the baby from Dumbledore and run off with it.

Why on earth would any reasonable adult believe that an eleven year old had not only figured out an extremely sensitive and convoluted plan put in place by talented wizards and witches but also knew that those same defenses would be penetrated and when? She didn't send Harry off to face Voldemort, she had very little information to go on and didn't know that Quirrell was under Voldemort's control. Come on, man. She's not all knowing.

McGonagall wasn't present for every single interaction that Snape and Harry had together. How was she to know that Snape mistreated Harry in his own class? Furthermore, as someone else in this thread already brilliantly brought up, everything we're reading is from Harry's perspective. Teenage angst does not mix well with perceived wrongs - some situations could be exaggerated.

What bullying are you talking about? The fact that people would sneer at him in the dorm rooms and the hallways sometimes? The Potter Sucks buttons? I'm not saying that Harry had an easy time growing up but being socially ostracized at certain points of his academic career does not equate to rampant bullying that McGonagall could do anything about. You can't force teenagers to like each other. And I feel this has to be said again, McGonagall was not present at every, or even the majority of events that occurred between Harry and his classmates. She is the head of Gryffindor house, not just of one student.

What you said about Year 5 is just bullshit. McGonagall stood up to Umbridge frequently throughout the book, most famously when the subject of Harry's career advice came up. Harry did not have obvious signs of what was happening to him in detention with Umbridge and he told everyone that he was just writing lines. How was she to know?! Also, the reason Harry didn't go to her is not because she hasn't stood up for him before (SHE HAS), but because Harry never goes to anyone with anything. Why start in year 5?

When Harry confided his suspicions to her, all she heard from her side was a teenage boy with a chip on his shoulder and a small bout of paranoia. It was an outlandish thought that Voldemort would really pick Draco Malfoy for a task, why should McGonagall have believed him?

Again, what was she supposed to do?! Had she started fighting against the death eaters they likely would have killed her and then what kind of help would the children have? She stayed at the school and didn't cause an immediate scene so as to be able to help as many children as possible. By not sending them to detentions with the Carrows, for example. And when she had more resources at her disposal, she joined the fight with vigour.

The answer to your question is that she always stands up for what's right.
