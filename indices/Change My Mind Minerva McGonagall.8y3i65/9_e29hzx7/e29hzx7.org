How can she help him when he never went to her? The only exception being first year with the philosophical stone, but let's be honest, anyone with half a brain would already have guessed that the castle was hiding it when you have the clue of Nicholas Flammel. Plus Harry was wrong about Severus wanting to steal the stone. Why should she believe a whiny 11 years old boy?

And, why would she check up on him during his ten first years. Imagine if she had to do that to every kid who will go to Hogwarts... And again, Harry never went to McGonagall asking her to protect him from the Dursleys.
