I'm going to level with you here dude.

When I read this diatribe, I am reminded of something I often here. People in the modern world balk at how stupid or backwards people in ancient times were. How the Egyptians used to worship cats and possibly bury their servants with them alive. How Chinese emperors were fools to believe ingesting mercury was the key to immortality.

Or how people today look poorly at other societies because they are "backwards" or "uncivilized." I can name a half-dozen countries I saw on the news *today* where exactly this was insinuated.

Thats what this sounds like to me. You really don't know the circumstances here. What we do know though is that the shit Harry gets up to during the year is so far outside the norm that you couldn't spot it with a pair of binoculars.

McGonagall didn't listen to Harry about the stone. Why would she? He is an eleven year old kid that just helped commit an act of possible international animal trafficking across multiple countries.

On Harry and Snape. See, the thing about it is its really all told from *Harry's* viewpoint. When your a teenager, its always the teacher's fault. They are always at fault, and stupid, and inept.

Why didn't McGonagall believe Harry ever? Here is Harry's track record on predictions (there is a pretty obvious red herring in every book, even when I was eight it was obvious):

Snape's trying to steal the stone? Nope it was Quirrel. Snape was saving Harry's life.

Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin? Nope, just an loudmouth ponce. Turns out it actually was the quiet one for once.

Sirius Black betrayed Harry's parents? Nope, it was his best friends pet. No, really, its just as dumb as it sounds.

Snape might have put Harry's name in the Goblet (Harry really wants Dumbledore to tell him Snape isn't reformed)? Nope, polyjuiced defense teacher in the form of the last person you would believe, which means it should have been the /first/ person to believe.

Snape is weakening Harry for Voldemort? No, he may have actually been trying to teach Occlumency, but Harry didn't care that much and/or didn't possess the temperment for it (which Dumbledore pretty much admits later).

Draco was doing something sinister in Hogwarts, and Snape was helping him? Yeah, see here's the thing. The one time Harry was actually right, it turns out to be ANOTHER red herring and Snape was acting under orders to prevent the worst outcomes.

In short, Harry is not a good source. He jumps to conclusions and dives in without looking. I wouldn't trust him either.

But more importantly, what authority does McGonagall have anyway? She basically manages the sorting as Deputy, and takes over if Albus is out galavanting around. Thats it, thats all the power she is shown to have besides head of Gryffindor house. And the houses are notoriously competitive, so its likely they were set up by the Founders to not have authority over one another except in emergencies.
