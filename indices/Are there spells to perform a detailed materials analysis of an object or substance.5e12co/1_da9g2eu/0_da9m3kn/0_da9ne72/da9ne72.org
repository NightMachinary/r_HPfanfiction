I don't like the glowing letters.

If you do want to do it, then I'd suggest something like a magical object instead of a spell. Have the user put a small vial of the potion into the machine. The machine whirrs, bops, puffs a puff of smoke and dinkydinks, before it blurts out a strip of paper from a little slot containing all the materials and chemical breakdown of the potion.

Its upto you, but I kinda like to avoid glowing letters or direct information spells, since they don't really fit with the charming, kinda old timey aesthetic of the universe.
