The only one from canon which comes to mind is the one that Slughorn mentioned in the antidotes class in HBP. It's called "Scarpin's Revelaspell" and it allows you to discover the ingredients in a potion. The spell works by physically separating a potion back into its ingredients:

  "She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials."

The incantation may be "Specialis Revelio" as that's what Ernie Macmillan used in the same class, but it's possible Ernie was winging it with a different spell. In fact it's more than possible, as we've seen the spell "Specialis revelio" used in other contexts that have nothing to do with potions, such as when Hermione cast it on the Half-Blood Prince's book to check it for hidden curses etc. So that would be another example of such a "diagnostic" spell.
