  Ingredient breakdown of a potion (for example, "Bubotuber pus, Monkshood, etc.")

The second half of Chapter Seven from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8101469/7/Hermione-Granger-is-Stupid][Hermione Granger is Stupid]] has Harry use a [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/scarpins-revelaspell/][canon spell]] in Potions class to identify ingredients in a poison. I think it's a remarkable scene from an author who only glanced through HBP.

As far as your other requests, there's nothing in canon as JKR doesn't know anything about science. The only hard and fast rule is that a spell can do whatever the author wants it to do.
