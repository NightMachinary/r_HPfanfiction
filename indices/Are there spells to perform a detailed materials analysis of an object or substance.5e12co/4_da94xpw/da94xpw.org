If you create your own, you might consider doing something more interesting and arcane than glowing words in the air saying "88% Copper, 12% Tin".

For instance, you perform the spell. A colored blob of light appears. The shape and color of the blob give you information about the material. Additionally, for transition metals, the spell emits a "whoop whoop" sound; for halogens, it buzzes; for lanthanides, you taste salt; if it's alkaline, your teeth vibrate. There are books full of tables describing effects and what they mean.

I know magic is typically convenient, but I like it on the idiosyncratic side.
