Three that I enjoyed so far: Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game of Death) Still being updated.

Linkffn(12965602) Might and Magic is just now at the point where he's entering Hogwarts. It's going for a Saturday Morning Cartoon or early Dragonball vibe.

Linkffn(Harry Potter Game of the Year Edition). Uses somewhat different mechanics as you'd probably guess from the title.
