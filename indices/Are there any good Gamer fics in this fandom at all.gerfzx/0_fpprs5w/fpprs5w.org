Kinda weird at first, I almost quit it because they use a few weird pureblood titles (it mostly goes away) and mentions sexual abuse a bit too much for a generally light-hearted fic. Overall, though, it's pretty solid. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/]])

This one is hands down one of the best fics I've ever read, but it's OC-centric and technically a crossover. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]])
