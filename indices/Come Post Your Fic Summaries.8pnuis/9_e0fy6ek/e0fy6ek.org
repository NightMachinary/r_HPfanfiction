I have a couple of potential ideas I'm brainstorming:

*Potterworld*: Welcome to Potterworld! It's Westworld meets Ready Player One set in a Harry Potter theme-park, where guests can find themselves thrust into a setting at any point in the books and play out the story-lines the way they want them to be played. But when the hosts start malfunctioning, the stakes feel more alive than ever. Can three protagonists put their differences aside and figure out a way to escape this new nightmare alive?

*Never Tell Me The Odds*: There are these fics about what would happen if Harry watched Star Wars and ends up becoming a Jedi. But what if rather than becoming a Jedi, he modeled his look after Han Solo and decided to run away from the Dursleys to make a life for himself on his own? How will Hogwarts handle a Harry Potter who grew up on the streets and knows every trick in the book?

*We All Float Down Here*: Crossover with Stephen King's IT. James Potter is returning to Hogwarts for his third year with his best friend Sirius Black. But something is different about this year at Hogwarts. There is a monster lurking beneath the Castle, a monster named Pennywise the Dancing Clown, that has awoken from a deep slumber, and has a whole host of school-children to feed on.

*No Man's Land*: DC Comics Crossover. Not knowing who he is or how he got there, a young man with a lightning bolt scar awakens on the streets of Gotham City with a simple wooden stick. It's a city under quarantine, with no available access to the outside world. And all kinds of horrors are about to come closing in on him.
