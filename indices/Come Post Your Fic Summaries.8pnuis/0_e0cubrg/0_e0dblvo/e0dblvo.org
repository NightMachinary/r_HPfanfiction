Perhaps I'm a bit stuffy about this sort of thing, but reading terms like "Alt" in a sentence make me want to stop reading. It seems somewhat lazy. If you wanted me to read this and be excited about reading how the Wyrd Sisters will raise Harry, it should be closer to something like "Harry, under the guidance of the Wyrd Sisters, is excited to be the best witch he can be!"
