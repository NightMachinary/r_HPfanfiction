I thought he needed to. :)

It struck me as frankly weird that we knew so little about Lily. Aside from Snape, we don't have names for any of her friends, even though the way she's described makes it sound like she was probably widely liked. We don't know her interests. We don't know what music she liked, what books she liked...we don't get much on James either, but the little we get on him is still a lot more detailed than we got for Lily.

My own mother died when I was very young too, and I'd give my kidney to have something like I'm giving him. Harry's practically starving for a family. He deserves a chance to see a person rather than an ideal.

I published the first two chapters a few days ago on ff.net, under the same name I use here.
