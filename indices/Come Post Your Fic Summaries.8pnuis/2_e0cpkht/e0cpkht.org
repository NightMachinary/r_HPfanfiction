(Ranked from closest to farthest from being ready for publication. Those that don't have titles attached to them, I haven't yet /thought/ what they might be titled.)

------

*/Voldemort in Neverland/*

It's 1953, Tom Riddle is a young man with great plans, and he won't have any of that broomstick nonsense. He wants to /fly/, unhindered. His quest takes him to a forgotten magical realm home to secrets and creatures... and damn it all, he /will/ find that Peter Pan and wring the secret out of him!

(/A one-shot Peter Pan crossover./)

------

*/Violet Baudelaire and the Mysterious Magicians/*

"Hello, hello, hello, Hogwarts." Count Olaf has become the Defence Professor, just in time for Klaus, Violet and Sunny Baudelaire to wash up in the Great Lake. How did he survive? Where is the Sugar Bowl? Just what does V.F.D. know about that conspiracy of witchcraft? And most importantly, who, /who/ in Snicket's name is this Harry Potter bloke everyone keeps talking about?

(/Crossover with the television series of “A Series of Unfortunate Events”. Not that book fans will be disappointed.../)

------

*/Dalek Invasion of Hogwarts/*

A Second-Year crossover. The Founders put enchantments on the Castle Hogwarts to protect it from all known perils. But the unknown lurks in every corner of the universe, and its name is the Daleks. Harry Potter, Dr Who /and/ a certain time-hopping Gallifreyan must rise to the challenge while the Voldemort in the Diary struggles to take advantage of a situation he barely understands...

(/A fast-and-loose Doctor Who crossover./)

The Dark Lord's plan seemed so simple. He had broken into the Department of Mysteries once. Breaking into it again wasn't the hard part. Stealing the Time-Turner wasn't the hard part. Even shattering the timeline that had created the Boy Who Lived wasn't the hard part. No, the hard part was putting Time back together before all of creation unraveled. Will the help of Salazar Slytherin and that infernal Lovegood girl be enough?

------

An incident in Time has the Trio all wash up in the River Styx. Relying on half-remembered bits of mythology to get by, they soon discover that in this day and age, they are Gods... and King Zeus is as much of a Dark Lord as Voldemort ever was. Must our heroes, soon joined by mysterious Ariadne, let the evils of history take their course? Or have the Fates brought them here for a reason?
