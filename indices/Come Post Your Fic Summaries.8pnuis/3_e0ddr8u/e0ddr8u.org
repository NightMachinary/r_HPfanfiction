For the longest fics in my folder, thus the nearest to being published. I'm not the /best/ with story names, admittedly...I'll figure it out.

--------------

- *Harry Potter and the Changeling Queen:* While wandering the castle late at night, a familiar young girl pulls Harry Potter through a mirror into the beautiful nightmare world of Faerie. Trapped and with no easy way home, Harry must adapt to this vicious new world and the discovery that his mother wasn't quite human, all while looking for a way to get out -- but can he escape in time to help his friends defeat the monster his abduction unleashed into Hogwarts?

- *Untitled Death Eater!Lily fic:* There's more than one way to give your life for your son. As the Dark Lord's newest unwilling recruit, Lily Potter must decide how far - and how dark - she is willing to go to ensure Harry's future safety, and whether Lord Voldemort's protection is worth the cost of her soul.

- *Untitled Dark!Harry fic:* When Lisa Turpin invited him to join her unsanctioned night flying club in 4th year, Harry didn't expect to find himself tangled up with a budding coven of young dark wizards engaged in a covert takeover of the Hogwarts grounds - but he's not complaining. After all, he's not exactly a light wizard anymore, himself...

- *Untitled Percy Jackson/Harry Potter crossover:* Pursued by swarms of Ministry Dementors and monsters more mythological, permanently grounded and with only Hedwig by his side, Harry Potter isn't having the greatest summer - but at least his dad's alive, right? That is, if you consider the Lord of the Underworld alive.
