I think you should probably trim that run-on sentence a bit. I was getting pretty lost and I don't think that you really explained any story points in your summary. It also goes far too in-depth regarding fem!Harry's personality. There's nothing here that draws me in. If you want readers, you have to bait them. It's like feeding an animal. You have to draw them in. Make them want to come to you!
