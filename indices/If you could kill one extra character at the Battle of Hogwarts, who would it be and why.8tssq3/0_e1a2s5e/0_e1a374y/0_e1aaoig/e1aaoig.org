Draco would have been the best one I think.

The Malfoy's are still horrible people and having their own past horribleness result in the death of their son whom they then failed to protect is a bit of a full-circle narrative comeuppance. It would also, I believe, mark the end of a Pureblood family which could be seen as highlighting the pointlessness of the 'war' as it were.
