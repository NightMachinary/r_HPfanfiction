i like that they all lived. It's in character, since their family is known for their self-preservation instinct dominating, particularly in the later books. And all the bad guys dying wouldve just been annoying. I mean, bellatrix and voldemort already died. Killing off the only other noteworthy death eaters wouldve been annoying. Just in the same way that saving all the good guys would've been annoying in an unrealistic way.
