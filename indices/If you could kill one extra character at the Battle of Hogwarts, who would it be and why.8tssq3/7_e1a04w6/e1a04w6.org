Trelawney

Why? Every time she makes a big deal about a prediction (both prophecies, Harry seeing the Grim, the thirteenth person at the table, the lightning struck tower), it turns out to be horrible for Harry and/or others.

And personally, I would have Harry or Ron or Hermione do it (because its a question, not about what's realistic). They all have a reason. Harry, every time Trelwaney predicts something people get hurt. Hermione, she hates divination and thinks its bunk (despite everything). Ron, he went through three years of stupid bs along with Harry about recording dreams when divination appears to be useful to only certain individuals (Harry could say the same too).

And I just imagine one of them pointing their wand and saying to her:

"Look into my wand and tell me what you see" or "Don't forget your tea leaves" or something to that effect.
