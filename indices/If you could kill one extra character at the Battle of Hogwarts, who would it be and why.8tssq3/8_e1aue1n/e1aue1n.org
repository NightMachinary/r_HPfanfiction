Umbridge. Don't ask me to explain HOW she's there, but she is. And she dies. She slips on some debris and broke her neck or maybe accidentally gets in the way of the curse meant for Colin Creevey (Because that fkn kid was only fifteen and Jo killing him was a load of crap) and dies. I don't care why, but Umbridge ends up dead.
