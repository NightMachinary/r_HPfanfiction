Can I say a re-do of Voldemort's death? The last fight was basically two men seeing whose wand was bigger. I would've preferred that Harry actually killed Voldemort, and then the Epilogue could be two years later, where Harry's still coming to terms with the idea that he killed a person, and Ginny slaps sense into him.
