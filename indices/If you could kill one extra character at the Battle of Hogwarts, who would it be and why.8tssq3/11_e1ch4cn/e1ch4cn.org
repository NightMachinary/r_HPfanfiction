having voldemort kill neville after neville victoriously slayed the snake woulve added some tragic depth to the story. Neville finally grows into his gryffindor skin during his seventh year leading the DA in harry's absense. This builds up to his moment of shine, where he kills the snake making voldemort mortal, only to die moments later. Was it worth it. Also, Neville had the potential to be the boy-who-lived, but he was never the one chosen to defy all odds (including death) when it comes to facing voldemort. Him slaying the snake without being injured by voldemort was a bit of potter-like luck that should only belong with the real chosen one. Or maybe thats what JK is trying to potray by this scene. That harry isn't that special, but succeeds because of bravery and a refusal to give up
