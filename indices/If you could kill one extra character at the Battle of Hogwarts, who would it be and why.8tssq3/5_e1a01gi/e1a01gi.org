Her large, blue eyes stared vacantly into the ceiling. Their innocence preserved even in death.

Mentions of nargles and blibbering humdingers would never again pass her lips. Never again would she tell them of how she almost caught a Crumplehorned Snorkack.

There was no mark upon her body, but a single spell had managed to touch her. The king of the Unforgivables, the killing curse.

*AVADA KEDAVRA*

It somehow seemed appropriate. Seeing Luna looking anything but completely unconcerned would have been /wrong/.

Her body lay in the very halls she had wandered for years, looking for shoes that the nargles had stolen. Every hall in the vast castle was filled with flashes of light and shouts, the walls falling apart from the hexes and curses. But not this corridor, no spells were spoken here. Everything was perfectly still, the massive pieces of stone that had been torn from the ceiling lay broken upon the floor.

No sign of humans could be seen. Except for the lone body of Luna with her blonde hair spread around her head like a bright halo.

So passed Luna Lovegood from this world, the likes of which would never again be seen.
