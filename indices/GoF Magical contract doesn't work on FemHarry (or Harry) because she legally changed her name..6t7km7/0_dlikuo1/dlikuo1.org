I know I've read a couple where this has happened, though not necessarily with a girl Harry. I think it might actually have been a Sirius adopts Harry one.

Anyway, most recently, linkffn(like a red-headed stepchild) did it, but it does not feature a femHarry (yet...you never know though), and it actually worked. It's also not a crossover...technically. Has a fair amount of intersections though.
