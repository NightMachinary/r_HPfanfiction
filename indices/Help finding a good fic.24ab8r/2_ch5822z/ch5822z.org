  Remus Lupin has long believed that love is a luxury beyond his means. Nymphadora Tonks has been too busy proving herself as an Auror to pay any attention to romance. Their strong if unexpected friendship is a source of comfort in difficult times---until it threatens to turn into something more. (Eventual RLNT. Sirius Black, Order members. Set during OotP.)
