It /could/ be a fun, highschool like series, with some exciting sub-plots and dramatic ending. Like you said, /cool, more HP/.

The Founders Era would be my favorite setting for future, official HP content. Maybe whoever will be in charge of it will write a Slytherin that's more than the canon version proto-Klansman.

Second favorite is Riddle's school years and rise to power. Not even the first war per se, just the transition into Lord Voldemort.

Fantastic Beasts currently deals with another favorite character of mine (Grindelwald), though the way it handles the whole thing is so so.
