For me, the Marauders Era is interesting because it has potential. You can explore the interactions the Marauders had, between Peter and the rest, with James and Lilly, even maybe some Sirius and Remus. The events that led Peter to join Voldemort are interesting ones and never truly explained in canon.

The interactions between the Marauders and Severus Snape aren't explored fully in canon. In canon, we don't know how James and Snape came to hate each other, or how James wanted Lilly for himself. I think this, if done right, is a major reason why people like the Marauders Era.

Additionally, the Marauders Era is during the rise and peak of Voldemort's power. The war reaches its peak during their 7th year and beyond, and stops 3-4 years after. The War has immense potential, because there is very little canon material on what goes on during that time.
