I think one of Rowling's strengths as a writer is how she implies that really interesting stuff is going on just out of our view. That way she gets credit for all this interesting stuff without having to go to the trouble of actually writing it in detail. She told us these Marauders were brilliant pranksters, but she didn't actually tell us any of their brilliant pranks. How did they figure out Remus's furry little problem? How did they become animagi? Why did Sirius play such a dangerous prank on Snape? It all must have involved some tense conversations and scary scenes, but Rowling just implied them rather than writing them. There's a strong framework to build on.
