As a group theyre fascinating. I tend to like james the most - a lot of snape apologists forget that james fixated on lily very early and that snape in canon was hanging out with and getting along with people who advocated she be raped and or tortured and or killed. Given that, it's not shocking James would do whatever he could to snape. he just wasnt smart about t. then theres peter - the reason he changed is mostly left as a mystery. hes the most intriguing one. I think the one who comes off the worst is sirius. he felt like anything he did to slytherins was okay as it was a blow against the black family. and he was a careless womanizer. And while Snape was gunning for Remus, what Sirius did wasnt funny at all. He nearly committed a double murder. REmus had a tragic story. And as they finished school, the Malfoys, Notts, Snapes etc. were in the ascendance. So they (Marauders) were heroic.
