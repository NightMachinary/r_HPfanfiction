I think it's because in the books you get tiny little glimpses (from the stories Sirius, Remus, and other older characters tell) into what life was like for the Marauders in their youth, but you never get a full recounting. They had adventures, good times and terrible times, and the tiny glimpses you get jus make you (or me, anyway) want to see more. This, in conjunction with the fact that Sirius and Remus consider that the happiest time of their lives, makes me very curious about the way things played out.

Also, I think Harry himself is almost desperate to know about his parents' lives. Any little bit of new info counts and fills this gaping hole he inevitably has growing up as an orphan, and this desire to know more has definitely rubbed off on me.
