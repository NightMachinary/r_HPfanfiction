Hah, the founders we have almost zero information about, and yeah, it does seem too different for me at least, to have an interest in. There's no attachment at all there, about as much as the next generation of Harry's kids. We know quite a lot about Harry's parents and there's potential for tons of drama. The founders... they're basically OC's and you have to invent a whole society because you know nothing about their time and what else was happening around then.
