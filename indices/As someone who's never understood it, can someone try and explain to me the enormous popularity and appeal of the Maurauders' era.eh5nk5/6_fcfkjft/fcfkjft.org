From what I understand of the Marauders-story desire, it's a mix of about four things. In no particular order:

First, I suspect a dominant motivation is a semi-headcanon war one. People bought in big time to the Marauders vs Snape thing and for those who care about it they usually feel passionately one way or another. Snape is a monster who deserved his treatment or Snape is a Draco-in-Leather-Pants type who the Marauders mercilessly bully. They theorise and feel and imagine and thus want a definitive canon display of that which justifies their perspective on things.

The second you've mentioned. "Oooh, more Harry Potter stories!".

The third, someone below mentioned - seeing the rise of Voldemort and the political interplay as a background to the Marauder-era adventures. The Blood Purists are kept really simplistic in canon; they're magical Nazis that hate Muggles and feel Muggleborns are invaders and deserve to die. As a psychologist and amateur socio-cultural obsessive/nerd, I can tell you that the reasoning behind the rise of the Nazi regime is one of the most terrifyingly fascinating things ever and seeing something that reflected that in a fantasy setting would definitely appeal.

The fourth, which is where my mild interest would come from, would be in development of world and character. Whatever you think of Rowling as a storyteller, there's a pretty damn good argument to be made that her current worldbuilding is thinner than most lunchable meats and has more holes than the cheese, holes which become outright contradictions most times. Giving her the opportunity to write books alongside the TV show (a la Game of Thrones) would give her an opportunity to build up more world and shore up some inconsistencies and such and also allow her to develop characters better. The Golden Trio-era characters either go from not having a character to becoming one (Ginny) or remain basically the same from beginning to end (Ron). Neville is the only person I think has a traditional character development arc in the entire series. But people like James are supposed to have changed a lot (Prankster to 'Worthy of Lily') and such, so seeing that would humanise the overly-idealised-ghosts of the Potters (I quite like the 'Lily was a hellion when her temper was roused' idea, for instance) and extended cast that we get bugger all on in canon due to Harry being a lazy, disinterested prat that took four years to find out what the surviving and still-active followers of the man who killed his parents were called.

I actually think that if Rowling was to do a fanfiction-competition to get someone else from the community to write the plot for this Marauders thing, we'd probably get a ridiculously good story out of it.

Personally though, I'd prefer either a Founders story or an alternative 'Voldemort won' story in the vein of The Man in the High Castle where Harry grows up under Voldemort's regime and has to fight back against it. Or even just a fanfiction-inspired anthology - one or two episodes to explore each story and just keep building a series of them.
