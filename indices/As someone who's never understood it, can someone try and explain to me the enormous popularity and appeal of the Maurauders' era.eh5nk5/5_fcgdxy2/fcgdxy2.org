You know just enough to intrigue and that leaves people wanting more. For me at least, the trio is completely uninteresting as a fanfic basis because their story is told in the seven books. I don't care about NextGen because we effectively know only the names. The Marauders are where there's room to play while hitting the major events and base personalities that we know.

It's also dramatic as hell. I'm writing in 1979 now, and it's plausible to me that in this one year, James and Lily get married, the elder Potters die, Regulus becomes a Death Eater (and dies), Sirius's father dies, the Death Eaters begin to recruit Wormtail, and Lily gets pregnant...and that's /before/ you even get to the fact that they were actively fighting in a war, the ministry was falling around them, and everyone was terrified and dying. Every single one of them will die before forty. Their relationship is the reason for the events of the seven books. They're all talented, apparently at least on the level of Hermione, so you can have fun with the magic. And the personalities are known but not set; is Sirius darkly moody like he is after Azkaban, or was it prison that made him that way? Is James a bully or actually a morally upstanding guy? Peter is always shown as the syncophant but he's still the "group idiot" who managed to successfully spy and plot his way to safety (well, sorta). In school, they're running around with a werewolf, inventing strong magical objects and the war is ramping up.

That said: I wanted nothing more than a Marauders series when I was young but now I need WB and Rowling to stay the fuck away. I'll stick with my fanfics, thanks.
