  For me at least, the trio is completely uninteresting as a fanfic basis because their story is told in the seven books. I don't care about NextGen because we effectively know only the names. The Marauders are where there's room to play while hitting the major events and base personalities that we know.

This.

I'm happy with the story in the books, I have no unanswered questions with those characters and their journey seem closed to me. I don't love the Harry/Ginny ship but I don't care enough to ship him with anyone else. I don't have strong feelings about Ron/Hermione, and everything is so nicely wrapped up its just... Done.

With that said, I really dislike the last chapter of DH which is the Genesis of NextGen so I just ignore that that exists.

With the Marauder Era there are tons of unanswered questions about... Everything. We are given a starting point showing that Lily and Snape are best friends and they hate James, but seven years later Lily is about to marry James, and has fallen out with her former best friend. How did that happen? Meanwhile, there's this huge social and political upheaval going on that Snape, James and Lily become enmeshed in where Voldemort becomes so feared people stop even saying his name. Did that all happen during those seven school years? How much did this wizard war spill over into the muggle world? How close was Voldemort to taking everything over? How wide spread was sympathy for his cause? Then there is Remus being a werewolf that has its own story in how his friends found out, how close he came to being outted, that he was suspected of being the spy, how Peter came to be apart of the Marauders, how Peter came to switch sides and when it happened, etc.

Then there is simply a canon romance story that hasn't been told and some people like romance stories. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
