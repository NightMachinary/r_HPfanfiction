I think a big part of the interest is the characters who feature in the Marauders' era. We get Sirius, Lupin and Snape who are three of the more complex characters overall and three characters that get their personality explored quite fully in canon. Of course in canon, we see Sirius after Azkaban, Lupin after a decade of being alone and shunned from society, and a Snape who got the love of his life killed, but going back to the 70s' writers get to explore what these people were like before all of this happened, basically working backwards from those traumas along with using the few clues we get from Snape's memories as to what they were like at school. Filling in the blanks, as it were.

James and Lily can basically be written any way the author wants; they're almost just names that ended in tragedy with a few clues to their personalities thrown in. And Pettigrew somehow went from awkward, worshipful, trusted friend to murderous traitor, and that is obviously a pretty intriguing leap to explore.

The 70s' and early 80s' are interesting culturally; lots of clothes and music and films and popular culture muggle-wise that is fun to add to fics. Then the whole AIDS epidemic and its obvious parallells in Lupin, which makes for great social commentary. 1979 is when Margaret Thatcher gets elected, so the lead-up to that is another bit of muggle social and political history that may or may not have influenced/had parallells in the magical world.

The teachers at Hogwarts are mostly the same as in Harry's day, so Hogwarts is easy to write about, you get to make some new people up but not too many. We also have names of wizards and witches in the original Order, which can be used for supporting cast to make it feel more authentic, both for writer and reader. We have JKR's names for the parents of a lot of the typical main characters of the Marauders' era and know where in the country they grew up.

On a similar note, we already know a few very big events for the well-known characters; Lily and Snape fall out, James becomes Headboy, Sirius almost gets Snape killed, Snape tries to get the Marauders expelled, Voldemort rises to power and begins recruiting in Hogwarts which means there are teenage wannabe Death Eaters in the school, Sirius runs away from home, Lupin's mother dies, etc.

There are also people that remind us of Harry's time, for instance James and Sirius are described as a comedic double act and as predecessors to the Weasley twins. People who enjoy writing humour/pranks and practical jokes can do that with them. James is on the quidditch team, just as talented as Harry, so it's easy to write about that. Remus and Snape both appear to be bookish Hermione-types from what little we see from Snape's memories. It also seems as if the same Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry existed back then too.

Another part of the appeal is that a lot of the writers of Marauders era seem to be older, which usually means higher quality writing. Not always the case, especially not nowadays when there's such a wealth of stories, but you do find a lot of really well-written prose for this era.

Yet another part of the appeal is undoubtedly Wolfstar, which has got to be one of the most popular pairings in the fandom. I think it's fair to say it's mostly women writing gay porn for women, but there is a lot out there and it remains immensely popular.
