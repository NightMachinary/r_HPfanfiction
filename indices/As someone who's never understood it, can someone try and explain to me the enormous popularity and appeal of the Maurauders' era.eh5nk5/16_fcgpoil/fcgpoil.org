Personally, I like the marauders era because it's full of “missing moments”. We know the broad strokes of their time at Hogwarts and after, but there's a lot of room for authors to play with. So the marauders era has lots of creative canon and AU fics to enjoy. Plus I find the characters from that era to be some of the most complex.
