Harry's war with Voldemort is the second war, and I think it's a little strange that we know little about the first war with the Death Eaters and Voldemort. I think the Maurader's Era is great to explore the events leading up to the first war and how the consequences from those lead to canon events.

Plus, we get to know Remus, Sirius, and Severus pretty well in canon, so it'd be amazing to get to know them as young adults making decisions amongst the backdrop of a war. That's just a good story setting.
