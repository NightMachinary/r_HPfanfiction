I always found the Marauders era tragic. Most of the characters from that period do not get happy endings. I like the fanfic because you can delve into what was going on in the First War and what it was like for the Marauders growing up then. I love fics that have a good balance between the humor of the Marauders and the growing horror of Voldemort's rise of terror. I also really enjoy fics that are about minor characters that are briefly mentioned in canon like Marlene McKinnon, Dorcas Meadows, the Prewett Brothers, etc.
