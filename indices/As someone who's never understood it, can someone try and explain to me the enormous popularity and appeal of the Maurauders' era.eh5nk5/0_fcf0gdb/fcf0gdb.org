I'm not someone who wants a TV series or anything, and I'm not particularly interested in the Marauders at school, but I do like them in those few years between school and James and Lily's death.

I think the appeal is that there's a lot of relationship and character potential suff there. We're just kind of told that James matured and Lily fell in love with him, but we don't see it. We're told that Sirius ran away from home and found a second family with the Potters, but we don't see it. We're told about Remus's fear of rejection from his friends, but that they accepted him, and the extraordinary lengths they went to in order to make sure he didn't have to go through all that alone, but we don't see it. We're told that they were friends with Peter, and that they trusted him enough to make him secret keeper later, but we don't really see any evidence of friendship or why he decided to turn against them. We're told that they made an amazing map, but we don't see who came up with the idea or the work that went into it, or why they did it or how they used it. We're told that James rescued Snape and that Sirius did something that would have caused utter devestation, but we don't see the fall out or the consequences or what was going through anyones mind.

Basically, we're told all this interesting, exciting, dramatic stuff happened, and more than that it happened to some of the more interesting and best loved characters in the series. People want to see it.
