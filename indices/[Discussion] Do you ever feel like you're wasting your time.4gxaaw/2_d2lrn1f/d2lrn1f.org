Once, perhaps. Then I realized that at the end of the day, when you find the 1% that's worth reading, it doesn't feel like a waste at all. Sometimes you even learn a little about writing though it--what makes a good story/plot/narrative, and what makes compelling characters. You even learn a little about trends in online fiction.

I do read other novels as well, but they're all in the same boat, to me. I used to feel a lot of pressure to get into literary fiction, but never acquired the taste. I mostly read fantasy novels, essays that analyze popular media/books, and poetry.

At the end of the day, you're the one that determines what you get out of it. Is it purely for hobby and enjoyment? There's no shame in that. If you still feel the stigma of it being a waste of time, try to figure out a method of deriving something else from it too. Does it help you develop as a writer? How has it aided you as a reader? Perspective, perspective.
