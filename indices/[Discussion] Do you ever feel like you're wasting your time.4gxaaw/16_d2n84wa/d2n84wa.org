I'm late to this thread, but I had to comment because this is so very relevant to me. I'd been feeling guilty about that for a long time, and at the start of the year I resolved to begin reading real books again. Since then, I've read 26 novels while only reading updates from Favorited fics. To be honest, it's been rather refreshing to have a break from continuously slogging through heaps of horrible fics in order to find something worthwhile to read, or just rereading my favorites over and over. I did just indulge in a reread of Applied Cultural Anthropology and The Long Journey Home, but I also have a mountain of books that I'm looking forward to reading.
