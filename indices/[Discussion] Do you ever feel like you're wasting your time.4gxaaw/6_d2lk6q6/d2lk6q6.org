HELL NO! It's never a waste of time to do something you love as long as you aren't letting your responsibilities fall by the wayside. People need to have hobbies to deal with the stress of the real world.

I used to be really secretive about fanfiction because I thought it was super nerdy and people would make fun of me for reading it, but since then, I decided it's not a big deal, and it isn't. There is a bit of a misconception that fanfiction is about sex/porn, but that is easily remedied with a 30 second explanation.

Spending a couple hours a day reading fanfiction isn't a bad thing. Reading is a common hobby, and fanfiction is a subset of literature. Sure you might get more, intellectually, out of other types of literature, but if those don't interest you, then there's no harm in sticking to fanfiction.

Reading of any form stimulates the mind and keeps your creativity sharp. Don't ever feel like that's a negative thing.
