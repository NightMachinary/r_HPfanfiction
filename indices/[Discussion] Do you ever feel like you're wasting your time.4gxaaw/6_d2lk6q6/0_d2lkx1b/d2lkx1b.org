Haha yeah I totally know where you're coming from with the secretive reading. I used to be pretty embarrassed about it but now I'll happily tell all my friends about fanfiction.

A major problem I see with fanfiction is that it's quite a limited conversation piece. Mainly because everyday people aren't that interested in Harry Potter and everything I read is based off one universe. If I read literature that's more varied, then each novel is a potential conversation topic. This is a pretty big factor for me since I struggle a lot with finding things to talk about.

Thanks for your reply. Makes me feel a bit better about reading fanfiction. But I really think I need to find the motivation to start reading proper novels. Fanfiction has become pretty stagnant for me.
