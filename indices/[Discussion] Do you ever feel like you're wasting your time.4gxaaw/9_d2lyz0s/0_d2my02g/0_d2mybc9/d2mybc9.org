I wholeheartedly agree with you! I'm very shy about actually getting my fanfics out there, but aside from having the innate want to piddle around with characters that I adore, it's a very easy way for people to connect to your writing and thereby easily provide constructive crit. As I said: I do have moments where I just question everything when it comes to my artistic pursuits, but that's more just me having a crisis as opposed to actually hating dabbling in any sort of fandom. Haha.
