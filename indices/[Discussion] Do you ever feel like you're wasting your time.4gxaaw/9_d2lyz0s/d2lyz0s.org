I don't know why (I probably do know why - it's probably because I wonder about this a little), but I think I expected this to be from a writer's perspective. I.E: Do you ever feel like you're wasting your time writing fanfiction that obviously has no chance ever of getting published because it's... fanfiction? (I'm in a writing rut, do not judge me!)

Eh but no. In reply to your question in of itself: I think a lot of people summed it up better than I ever could - do what makes you happy! I have had somewhat the same thoughts as you - I have so many novels on my to-read list, but I just don't get around to reading them because... fanfiction. It sometimes bothers me that this is the case, but ff is normally a phase for me anyway, so I'm sure I'll calm down from the utter binge reading that I've been doing as of late. I hope so, anyway.

As for Lotr in particular, I can completely sympathize! I have been meaning to read that for literal ages. We should create a support group! Or, you could use [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0][this]] to motivate you!\\
Warning: loud.

Anyway, I hope my nonsensical ramblings helped in some sort of degree!
