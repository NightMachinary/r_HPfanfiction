I think we keep returning to fanfiction because we know the characters and love the world. We are willing to put up with some crappy writing because we are invested in Hogwarts.

Moving to 'real' stories would require us to find a story we could get invested in just as much, but it requires wading through loads of different worlds and writing styles to find that one book we like.

We stick to fanfiction because it is safe and familiar. Putting in the effort to find a new world just isn't that appealing.
