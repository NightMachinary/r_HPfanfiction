No really, in my free time i do what i enjoy doing. I have read Tolstoi, Nietzsche, Kant and so on but i just dont really enjoy them that much. So for as long as i enjoy reading fanfics more ill read fanfics.

If i would read fanfics instead of "real" stuff (scientific stuff for university) during study time i would certainly feel like i am wasting my time though.
