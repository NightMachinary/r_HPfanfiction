I completely feel you. I only got a way from it naturally, to be honest. When I was literally in places where I couldn't access it. Then I'd come home and want to read it again, though...it was only after I went through a long time of being unable to find good, new fics that I was able to stop reading it. Everyone here is saying enjoy the things you enjoy, but I also kind of see (for me) fanfiction as an addiction. I can't stop when I want to stop, I feel this need to keep reading. It interrupts my sleep cycle at times, and I feel like I'm putting off my life. Not to say everyone who enjoys fanfiction is like this, but I find this phenomenon occurring for me.

What helped getting back into regular novels was picking up books I already knew I enjoyed and rereading them. From there, I could read other titles by that author, explore similar literature from authors, and so forth. That really helped. Now, I only read fanfiction when I'm seeking comfort. If I feel myself going back down the rabbit hole, I force myself to get out of my house and do other things I enjoy.

So to answer: yes, I feel my addiction to fanfiction prevents me from pursuing other literature, and keeps me from living my life to the fullest.
