I know totally what you mean. It makes me feel absolutely awful sometimes that I could read other things.

But I've concluded that maybe I don't love reading so much that I love how therapeutic reading HP fanfiction is. Fanfiction gives us a semblance of control. Reading fiction from others... It's hard to choose your outcome.

I think it's why super!fics, independent!fics, time travel/doovers, and ships do so well.
