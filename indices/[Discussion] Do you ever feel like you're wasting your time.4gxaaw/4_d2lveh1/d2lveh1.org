I've spent most of my life reading "real" literature. I only started reading Harry Potter fan fiction a year ago (I'm 30 years old) and I have torn through it. Reading will always been an addiction for some of us no matter what the content. There is /no reason/ that reading fanfiction should be considered a better or worse addiction than reading literature, because most people do not read at all. Even if you compulsively read classic novels, you're probably still doing it to escape reality. It's just slightly more socially acceptable. But it's also just as likely that people will be unable to relate to you if you talk about it. I've read War and Peace 3 times and enjoyed it, but I have met more people who want to talk about Harry Potter than Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky.
