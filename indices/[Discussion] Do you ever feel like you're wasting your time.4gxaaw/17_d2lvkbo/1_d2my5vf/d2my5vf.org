Yeah but it's not an endless struggle to find good literature. There are novels that are widely regarded as worth reading. That is what I want to read.

I have already exhausted most well-written, original fanfictions. I don't want to have to traul througb endless crap to find a story that might be good but then turn out to be abandoned or feature an out of nowhere terrible plot shift. Think Darth Marrs.
