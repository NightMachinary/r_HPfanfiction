On the one hand, I sort of agree with you, but on the other you're just completely and utterly wrong. The truer thing to say is that 99.9% of fanfiction is complete and utter shit. The remaining .1% ranges in quality between lower professionally published novels and the very occasional middle. It's nice to make ourselves feel better by saying that we're not really sacrificing any quality by reading fanfiction over professionally published work, but that's just delusional if you really believe it. If you picked up a book and it was equally as good as most fanfiction you read, you'd put it back down immediately and scoff at anyone that liked it.
