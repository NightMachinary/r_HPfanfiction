Lol @ the idea that novels are any more thought provoking than fanfiction. I mean, sure, if we're comparing the top tier 0.01% best of the best stuff, novels beat fanfiction. But the 99.99% that's left are probably similar in quality.

The only difference might be that with novels, there's greater quality control so we hear about the shitty stuff less often. But make no mistake, they are out there and in great numbers.
