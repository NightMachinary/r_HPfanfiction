Sometimes. I have a copy of Les Miserables on my shelf that's been on my to-read list for a while now. My goodreads to-read list just keeps growing. +Unfortunately, my salary does not+

With regards to reading for leisure, I feel that as long as I enjoyed it, it doesn't really matter what I'm reading. For example, I also like reading historical articles on wikipedia for fun.

But I do feel guilty about choosing to read fiction over the career-improving stuff I /should/ be doing in my free time, haha. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
