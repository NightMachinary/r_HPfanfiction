Thanks. Not exactly stressing out, I just do inane things like binge watching TV, reading HPFF, mindless internet browsing. Yeah it's basically just procrastination... But procrastinating everything including the personal goals I've set myself! Like finishing goddamn LOTR. Which I really really want to do, because it's so good. But HPFF is so much easier so I never bother. I just need to do it.
