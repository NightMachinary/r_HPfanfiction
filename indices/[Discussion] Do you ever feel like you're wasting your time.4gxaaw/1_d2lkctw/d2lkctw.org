"Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted." - John Lennon

But on the other hand, I see where you're coming from. It's nice for personal growth to expand outside of your comfort zone. Personally, I read fanfiction to relax. I'm a grad student, and I read things that make me think way too hard every day. But, like you, I branch out to reading published novels and etc. on the holidays.

Overall, I think you shouldn't put too much pressure on yourself to read things that are "better". Reading is a hobby, why stress yourself out about it? Just enjoy. :)
