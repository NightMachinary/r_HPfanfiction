I get where you're coming from.

I read HPFF because it's /familiar/. I know the characters, I know the world. When I read fanfiction it's all for the love of the game, the game being the characters.

It's not that I wouldn't enjoy reading other original novels, I just would much prefer to read more adventures about a set of characters that I grew up with and love.

It's no different than wanting a sequel to your favourite book or movie, not really. You just love the franchise so much you just can't imagine a world without more of it. I read fanfiction because it gives me more of what I love so much.

So maybe some stories aren't amazingly written, or have been done before. It doesn't much at all to me, because I'm in it for the characters.

Life is so short, just do what makes you happy man.
