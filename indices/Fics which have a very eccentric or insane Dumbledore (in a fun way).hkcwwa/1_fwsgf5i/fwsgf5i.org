Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Dumbledore is competent, yet also completely silly - highlights include taking Harry to a restaurant "owned by a famous Scottish chef" (they end up at McDonald's), half the plot hinging on how badly he trolls the Ministry regarding non-human students, and literally everything he does in Harry's fifth year.

The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond: linkffn(9818387)

Dumbledore takes basically any excuse to dodge paperwork and have fun. Sadly unfinished fic, but the highlights include him getting into a snowball fight, sneaking into the kitchens, and basically trolling McGonagall.
