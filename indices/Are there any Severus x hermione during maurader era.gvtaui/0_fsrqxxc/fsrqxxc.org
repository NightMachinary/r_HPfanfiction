Okay, so it turns out I didn't have hardly any saved. I forgot that they're usually terrible (because time-travel is really hard to do right, and so are teenagers, honestly.) The Poison Garden is actually in 1987, which makes it definitely not Mauraders era, but still, it's a younger Sev and and older Hermione.
