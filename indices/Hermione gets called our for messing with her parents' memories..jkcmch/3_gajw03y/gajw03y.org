[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/636071][Hermione Before The Beit Din]] is a series of interlinked stories.

It's mostly an exploration of how Judaism intersects with the wizarding world (in these fics, Hermione's family are Jewish) but her actions around obliviating her parents create a specific problem in that context. There are legal and spiritual consequences for a Jewish witch or wizard who does what she's done.
