I read about half of one where he put Molly and Fluer in charge of his vault. They made tons of investments, set up a research institute that Ginny was in charge of and Hermione was the head administrator. He bought an island and built a resort for magical people and put Gabrielle in charge of that. Frankly, it was horrible. There was no conflict at all.
