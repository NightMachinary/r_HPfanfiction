Maybe at the end of the series when he is 17 and an adult. But prior to that?

People that young don't do that. They aren't even legally allowed to live by themselves. 13 year olds don't start businesses by themselves. (Cue the one story of some boy/girl in a million who did do that)

If such a story were to make sense it would either be when he's already an adult or -like Fred and George- starting as a small school business where he sells stuff to fellow classmates.
