Thank you for reminding me the name of this fic! I read it ages ago and have often thought it's worth a reread but could never remember it's name. I honestly think it's one of the best written, interesting and novel fics I've read. It's a unique take on the events following the books but not unbelievable, an outrageous plot but written with subtlety. I do agree with you that Harry portrayal is a weak point, but the exploration of Draco's character and the way his life takes a totally different direction makes up for this for me. Great write up!
