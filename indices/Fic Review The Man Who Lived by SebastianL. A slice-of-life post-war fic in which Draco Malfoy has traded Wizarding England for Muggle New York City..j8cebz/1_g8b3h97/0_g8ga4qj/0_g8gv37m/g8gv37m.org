Let Go is nice because (lol I'm about to feel like Stefan from SNL) it has a murder type mystery, loss of magic mystery, world/character building with Albus and his siblings and all their flaws, eventual Scorbus but with some angst building up, an awesome Harry vs Albus fight that made my cry, and one of the most badass Draco's I've read. If you do read it, let me know how you like it!
