I've read this story a few times and I absolutely agree with your review. It makes me want to re read my favorite fix of all time Let Go (by the same author) which is an Albus/Scorpius pairing. It's been a bit since my reread but Albus also feels kind of mouth-piecey in that one as well but since we never see a canonical adult Al, it's more believable and acceptable than Draco in Man who Lived
