Yep, I basically agree with all of this. The fic was strongest when talking about Draco and his post-DH story, both past and present, whereas many things to do with Harry were weaker. From a relationship perspective it was kind of one sided, in a way that's not uncommon in fics: one character (here, Draco) draws the other into his life and introduces him to new things that he comes to have strong positive reactions to, but there's not much in the other direction. Admittedly Harry's kind of a depressed hermit, but I'd have liked it if he'd brought more to the table.
