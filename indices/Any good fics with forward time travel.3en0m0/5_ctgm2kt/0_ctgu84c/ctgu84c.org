You're going forward in time at a rate of one second per second right now. But if you want to go forward in time with less subjective time and without aging, the most straightforward means is Draught of the Living Death.

This does require you to find a safe spot to sleep for years on end, and I don't recall if canon says that you don't age. It might also require a confederate who will wake you at some point in the future using the Wiggenweld potion; canon isn't clear on whether Draught of the Living Death wears off.

Basilisk petrification is another option.
