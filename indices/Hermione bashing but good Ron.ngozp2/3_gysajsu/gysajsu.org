There are some hints of this in Motivations, by Jeconais. Nothing as bad as some: no love potions, evil plots, or such, but it does imply a few things with Hermione. Rather understated as 'bashing' goes and I'm not sure it counts as bashing, as Hermione's issues look a lot like her canon ones.

Ron on the other hand is very much book Ron, though he grows up a bit at the end too, so bonus.
