"Magical Guardian" is a pure fanon concept, and the Magical World recognize the authority of Muggle guardians (which is why Harry had to ask Vernon to sign his Hogsmead permission).

Dumbledore also doesn't have any authority over Harry during the summer. As the Headmaster of Hogwarts, he can refuses to let Harry stay there during the Holidays, but that's all. In canon, he only "asked" people to leave Harry with the Dursley for at least 4 weeks, but there was nothing he could (legally) have done if Harry had ignored his advices and went somewhere else.
