The James bashing does not really go away, but he is given more depth and reasons are given for how he is towards Harry, even is they are twisted. The Sibling bashing is not given much focus, and last I remembered, they were something xlise to friends at the beginning of third year.

The story is above average in the first year, epic in the second, and the third year is great. The author is consistently improving his writing and there are quite a few twists and turns and a lot of original elements in the story. If you get over the first year, the story turns into something that's almost a masterpiece.

Note: Watch out for Lockhart
