Yes, I have never been able to get into a single WBWL fic. I even tried starting the highly praised ones like antithesis but I just can't get over Harry's parents being so OOC. It's just too ridiculous for them to ignore their child and all the bashing and dark Harry plot points just make me stop reading very quickly.
