WBWL from an author's perspective is ridiculously hard to write. I'm not trying to defend myself in any way, but this sort of backlash and discontent is super evident from the author's perspective. A lot of comments or reviews or private messages pop up after chapters, and the story has to constantly adjust given these issues or risk the rising backlash of the community. WBWL isn't for everyone, and in my personal opinion it shouldn't be either. In comparison, Diablerie is easier because it's deviating from the common tropes of WBWL writing, and fails to “stir the pot” so to speak because it's something not commonly done.
