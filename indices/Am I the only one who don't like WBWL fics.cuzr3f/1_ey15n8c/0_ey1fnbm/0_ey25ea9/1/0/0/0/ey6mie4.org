I'm glad!!! I've put a lot of time, heartbreak, sweat and tears into my writing. As well as antagonizing a few English professors who want to start locking me out of their offices. The next chapter I'm already brainstorming and I'm hoping to start drafting either tomorrow or later this week, it all depends on my computer.
