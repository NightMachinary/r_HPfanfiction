Yes, there is enough suffering in this world, and when i read/see the real life stories/documentaries, even though it's very selfish, I find myself wanting to distract myself by picking up a book or watching something light hearted! As humans, we often don't want to face or acknowledge all the suffering unless it personally affects us or our loved ones.
