I agree with all of that, actually that was incredibly well put. A lot of stories don't dedicate the time and thought necessary to fully embrace the story of trauma and neglect. It's almost offensive to individual who have felt it before. I often say that writers have a obligation to their readers. Authors have the ability to hurt their creations and characters so so much, but they then are required almost morally to then pull that character back up from hell. When we hurt characters, we hurt our readers. If we then allow that character to heal or find some sort of peace, then we have an incredibly rare opportunity to possibly help someone in the real world- a chance to allow someone to grieve in company of a story, but then guide them through it. Stories that don't do this, that focus on neglect and pain and refuse to find the brighter side or the redemption, are the types of stories I struggle to read simply based on the principles of the one who wrote it.
