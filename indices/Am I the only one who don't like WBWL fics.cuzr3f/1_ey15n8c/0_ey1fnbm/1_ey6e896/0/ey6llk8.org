I understand that sad fics in general tend to take the darker route, I do avoid fics with tragic ending or when the MC suffers a bit more than what I think is allowed (in my mind). The popular, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, is a good example of the limit of MC suffering that I'm okay with.

As for as HP fanfiction is concerned, this may sound stupid- I blame Dursleys, Death eaters, Voldemort primarily responsible for his misery. This is probably why Harry's Parents (the only ones in the world who would love him for what he is without judgement) causing him abuse directly, puts me off and I avoid fics like that. Because if they turn on him, for me personally, it has crossed the line of suffering a human - a child can experience, and it's just very tragic.
