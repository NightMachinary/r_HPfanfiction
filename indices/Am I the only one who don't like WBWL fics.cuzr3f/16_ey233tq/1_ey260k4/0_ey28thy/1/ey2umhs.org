  For Snape to be good, in these writers' minds, James and the rest of the Marauders have to be bad.

This is a premise I've never really liked. Now, I usually read SS-centric fics and while I'm not blind to his faults, I'm definitely far more sympathetic to him than the majority (which I think is a result of my own past in school, and the fact that I watched the movies far more recently than I read the books where he's portrayed as far more cruel). However, that doesn't mean I hate the Marauders. Sure, I dislike the bullying (reasonably, I think), but I prefer fics where they grow up from it in the end, and where the author doesn't continue making them into bad people for the rest of time.
