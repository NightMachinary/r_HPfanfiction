Because Alan Rickman was an attractive man and the movies made Snape a lot more sympathetic than the books. Also, many people who were bullied at school in their own lives have a very knee jerk response to the flashback scene in Snape's Worst Memory, uncritically taking Snape's side, despite this scene happening immediately after Snape having a session of mindraping Harry and humiliating him over what he uncovers. When Snape saw Harry's life through his own eyes, including his mistreatment during his childhood, and didn't have a Damascus road moment, he became trash in my eyes.

For Snape to be good, in these writers' minds, James and the rest of the Marauders have to be bad.
