I thought the sentinent was basically the opposite -- that most people seem to /dislike/ WBWL fics?

My issue with this trope is twofold: while I don't like bashing at all in first place, this trope is especially bad about it. It has a habit of bashing basically all of the "good guys". The other issue is an issue I also have with Marriage Law fics -- they're all /exactly the same/ with very few deviations. Both of the tropes follow very consistent rules about how things go. This makes reading more than one fic of this kind more or less pointless. Now, fics with similar plots that go similar ways isn't automatically bad -- sometimes I just feel like reading something simple and safe where I know how things will go and can enjoy the ride. But I'd rather have at least /some/ sort of deviation making the fic unique and original -- which these kind of fics usually lack.
