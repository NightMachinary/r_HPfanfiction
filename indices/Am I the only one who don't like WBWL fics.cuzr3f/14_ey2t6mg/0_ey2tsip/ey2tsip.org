I found this fic yesterday *,* the premise of it Alive!Potters and siblings from 'another dimension', the story was pretty bad and I can't help but wonder why this has 1500+ favs in ffnet. linkffn(12307886)

It's not WBWL, but seemed to be popular when the entire fic does is bash everyone except Harry and Hermione.

If you take a look at other WBWL fics, they do have good number of favs/reviews in ffnet.
