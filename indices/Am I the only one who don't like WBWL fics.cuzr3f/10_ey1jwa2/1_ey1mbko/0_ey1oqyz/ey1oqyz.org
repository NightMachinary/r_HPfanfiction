You are right, This is another reason I dislike the term WBWL . I simply assumed it means Harry is not the BWL or Harry's twin/bro is mistaken as BWL. (as in both type of stories)

This is one of the few fics with no bashing and with refreshing plot and introduction of complex magical terminology as well.
