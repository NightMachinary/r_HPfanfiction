It's just so impossible and predictable.

Impossible because I can't comprehend how Lily or James could ever ignore a child. I mean, I'd understand favoritism, but not to the extend where they forget they had another kid.

Predictable because the trope follows this pattern:

Some injury befalls the other child, causing a scar. Dumbledore somehow, despite his century of experience, assumes that scar is the super, dark, evil scar and ignores Harry. Lily/James agree to raise the kids differently. They either send Harry off to the Dursleys or ignore him. Sirius and Remus either roll with the punches or are super anti-Lily/James. (Don't forget the 'Pup' and 'Cub' diminutive.) Fast forward to Hogwarts, Harry is either in Ravenclaw or Slytherin. He is a prodigy and quidditch pro. Super popular with the girls and edgy/mysterious. Snape realizes that Harry isn't his father and respects him. Daphne, Tonks, or Fleur pairing. Harry's sibling Max/Andrew/Skylar/Rose is a conceited pompous dick that doesn't know how to hold a wand correctly. Let the bashing commence. Harry is better in every way and has to do everything. Did I forget super edgy? Parents find out Harry is like 400 IQ and decide to pay attention again. Harry hits them with the fat */NO./* Yelling, yelling, yelling. The End, it's incomplete.
