There was one I read, which only got a few chapters in before being abandoned, that seemed a bit less bashing and slightly more plausible than usual premise wise. James and Lily thought Harry was a squib, and set him up in a nice townhouse in London basically by himself, and only visited occasionally. He basically fully integrated into the muggle world, and was super surprised, and fairly angry at his parents, when he got his Hogwarts letter.
