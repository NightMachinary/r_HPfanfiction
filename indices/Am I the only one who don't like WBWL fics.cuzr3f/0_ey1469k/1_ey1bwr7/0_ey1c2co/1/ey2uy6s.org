Nobody ever goes with a malignant and subtle curse centered around the whole Boy Who Lived business cast either by a Death Eater very soon after the announcement or by some rival or someone who haste Lily or James. Not necessarily Snape either, its too cliche and unoriginal.

So as time passes the insidious nature of the Curse makes people pretty much ignore Harry or give him the bare minimum of attention.

Now you have two options. Harry goes to Hogwarts blahblahblah or decides to go to another school to try and forget his cold and indifferent home life.

Now as for removing the Curse and entering the Act 2 of the story you can start it after the first meeting with Voldemort on first year. Voldemort either mentions the other kid and because he is the bad guy somehow it shatters the Ignoration Curse going on and suddenly everyone starts the usual denial trope in this stage of the story and trying to reconnect or some such crap.

​

Of course, by then Harry is already in Second-Third-Fourth year quite happy being with friends doing hormone riddle teenage stuff (non of that super genius edgy shit superstar shit) so he will not want what they are selling. He is a teenagers, we were all insensitive, edgy, woe is me asshole once.

Just to make the story different his young-er brothers-sisters are just regular kids too without acting like shitheads like 100% all other stories make them be. It was all the Ignoration Curse at work until that point.

​

Got nothing else after this. It will always return to being some generic canon copy/paste at the end.
