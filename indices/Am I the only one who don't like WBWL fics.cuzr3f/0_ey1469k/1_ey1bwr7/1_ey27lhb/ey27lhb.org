There is some fics that does a pretty good job at dodging the usual cliches in my opinion. One common points in all these fics is that the Potter are pretty good parents who either don't treat their children differently, or when they do, don't go full neglect and justify it pretty well :

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cuzr3f/am_i_the_only_one_who_dont_like_wbwl_fics/][Fraterculus]]
- This fics where Harry's sister, the Girl Who Lived is a big associable who hate almost everyone except her family (including the remaining Maraudeurs) while Harry is some kind of social butterfly, but can't remember the name of the fic at all.

The sad thing is that all of these good fics are unfinished (and if we are honest, abandoned) while the "/Abandonned Harry take Hogwarts by surprise and show everyone he is the best banging half the girls on the way, oh and he will yell at this parents exposing how much they suck at one point/" reach the 400k words and are finished.
