Yep, Exactly, I can't have put it better myself and this:

#+begin_quote
  Snape realizes that Harry isn't his father and respects him.

It's like the the entire canon character arc written for Severus Snape is thrown out of the window, i.e. He only did things for Lily's sake and here that is taken out completely.

And everyone except Harry has less than average IQ , especially his Family. I don't get it at all.
