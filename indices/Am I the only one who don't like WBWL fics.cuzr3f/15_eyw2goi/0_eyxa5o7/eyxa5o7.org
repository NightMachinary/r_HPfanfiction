I think the very first fic that explored this supposed neglect may have been good; due to a fact they would have been singularly unique. But then this is definitely not something that is repeatable in my opinion. It loses its shine, plus not to mention that characterizing hateful characters like parents while making the Hero a Mary Sue.. ya real big plot indeed.
