I hate them so much that I rarely give any of them a chance. Especially ones where Harry has a twin or older sibling. Usually what happens I'd the sibling is favored over Harry mostly to extreme degrees with alive Lilly and James either abusing, neglecting, or abandoning Harry altogether. Then there's the part where the sibling almost always turns into some spoiled brat that is actually too much of a coward to fight Voldemort when he returns. I hate these fics so much.
