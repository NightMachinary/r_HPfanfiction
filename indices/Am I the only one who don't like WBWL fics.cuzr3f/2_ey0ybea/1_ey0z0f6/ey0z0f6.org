I like Unique stories, some of the top fics in the Fandom have really unique storyline, which many others have tried to emulate, but then I see trite tropes getting lot of favorites/kudos that irks me, I have noticed a pattern where Light-bashing and Pureblood-Praising fics, always have a lot of followers.
