I don't even know what wbwl stands for... But yeah... I'm not a fan of the twin potters. Some of the stories I read are so far from canon all that is familiar is the names. I get that the point of fanfic is to make up stories but sometimes it is a bit ridiculous how far off track they get. And I'm not even gonna start on the ones that idolize death eaters
