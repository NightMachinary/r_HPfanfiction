I've read this, it's like a parody on these type of fics right? Dumbledore asking Potters to put their son with the Dursleys is hilarious, especially since, without any blood magic he has no reason to do so. It's an insult to Rowling's characterization of Dumbledore especially if these authors know this better, they should know they just lowered Dumbledore's IQ to double digits ( I mean if Dumbledore doesn't recognize that this would create another Tom Riddle, then we have a problem and then Dumbledore isn't Dumbledore at all)
