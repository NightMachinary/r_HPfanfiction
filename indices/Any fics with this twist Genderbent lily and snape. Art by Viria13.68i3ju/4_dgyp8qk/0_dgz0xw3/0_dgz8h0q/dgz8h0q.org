I think it would be cool if she called herself 'half-blood prince' and perhaps have the story line of someone trying to find out who the 'half blood Prince' is (perhaps after some of her notes go missing etc) while completely ignoring her awesome potions abilities because they assume it must be a chap (like harry and Ron did in canon despite Hermione's suggestion of the alternative).
