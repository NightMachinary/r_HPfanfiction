That was a typo. I meant Severina since it's still a Roman, "girly" name. But the name is a moot point. I thought Severa sounded too severe.

I went with princess instead of prince since she still wants to acknowledge her mother's side but finding it odd to call herself a "Prince" since she is a girl. There could be a plot of her trying to be more feminine but still traditionally powerful Slytherin.
