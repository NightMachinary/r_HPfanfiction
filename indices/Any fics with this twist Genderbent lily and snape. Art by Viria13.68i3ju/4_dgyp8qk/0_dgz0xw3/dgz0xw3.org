  Severine would still be drawn to the Dark Arts and curses and name herself the Half Blood Princess

Sorry, but she'd be the Half Blood Prince still, since the Prince was from Snape's mother's family name of Prince.

Plus, if the name is anything like Severus, it's be Severa, which is the feminine declension of Severus.
