When I saw that fan art, a few months ago, I had a burst of head canon inspiration. I think things would turn out very differently with this gender swap. I'm assuming no one else has been gender swapped for simplicity.

Lyle (male Lily) and Severina (female Snape) would still be sorted into the same houses.

Lyle would have to balance his friendships between the Marauders and Severina. James and Sirius frequently tease him for being friends with a girl. There would be five Marauders, four being Animagi. They don't really bully Severina because she is a girl.

Severine would still be drawn to the Dark Arts and curses and name herself the Half Blood Princess. I'd think she wouldn't garner much attention among future Death Eater recruits due to being a witch. She's be some sort of a social outcast due to her looks. However, as she reveals her talents, some of the future Death Eaters may see her as a potential Bellatrix 2.0. Instead of being acquainted with Lucius, she'd see Narcissa as a mentor.

Both possibly have crushes on each other but neither admits it.

Tension in their friendship may come from Lyle being friends with the Marauders and Severina starting to associate with future Death Eaters. This conflict culminates with the werewolf incident in their sixth year. Severina isn't bitten because Lyle and James save her life. Lyle is horrified at what happened, and they realize they have issues in their friendship. [James may or may not start getting the feels for Severina but isn't sure what he feels].

For the remainder of their Hogwarts years (1.5-2 years) they resolve and strengthen their friendship. This develops into something more, and they officially become a couple when they graduate. [Depending on how James feels, there may or may not be a one-sided love triangle).

Lord Voldemort sees the potential of Lyle and Severina as Death Eaters. Dumbledore sees the potential of having spies on Voldemort. Either Severina or both of them become Death Eater spies.

I'm not sure what happens after this, but it could follow canon or go full out AU.

With different genders comes different expectations, especially in the 70s. Severina wouldn't come off as threatening or dangerous. While in canon, Snape would be a bad influence on Lily, in this AU, Lyle being friends with Severina could be perceived as "saving her" from the Dark. SWM would never have happened (imagine teenage boys flipping a girl upside down and taking off her pants).
