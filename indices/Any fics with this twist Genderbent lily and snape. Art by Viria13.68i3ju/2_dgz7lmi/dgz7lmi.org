I had a small idea where Sirius gets a thing for her. Not because of her looks, if we'd assume fem!Snape is about the same on the attractive scala as her male counterpart, but for her dry wit and sharp tongue that enables her, once she leaves her little shell, to give him contra. They develop feelings for each other when they eventually start to connect over their horrible childhood and abusive parents, and the shared wish of getting away from it all.

They're dating and that leads to the Blacks having some hope for their boy to not become as Gryffindor as they feared. Sirius isn't pushed to snap with 16 and remains in the Black family. Push comes to shove later when Sirius is steadfast about continuing his relationship with the halfblood Slytherin instead of following his parents wishes and marrying a respectable pureblood witch. They're both 17 and both flee from their family and seek shelter with the Potters.

James Potter has a family with Andromeda Black. Since he never uttered his wish to marry "Lily" in this AU and doesn't really see anyone, he agrees to be part in the renewal of the Potter-Black connection (which fizzled out due to Charlus and Dorea never having children). The connection is made by Cygnus and Fleamont in secret. The public, and even Druella, Andromeda's mother, thinks that Andi is betraying the family with a blood-traitor. The truth is that Cygnus seeks to have his eggs in several baskets, still unsure where the war goes, while Fleamont genuinely thinks that Andromeda is a good fit for James. Andromeda knows this and never seeks to run away. With 17 she moves out under the pretense of "being with the family of her husband". When James finishes Hogwarts 5 years after her, they immediately marry. 3 years after that, the little metamorph Belladonna Euphemia Potter was born.

Liam Evans is best friends with Remus, and good friends with the rest of the Gryffindor boy dorm. He develops a sort of brother-relationship with the intelligent werewolf and when the Marauders decided to become animagi to aid their friend, he too goes along with it, ending up becoming an raven (super-intelligent predators that take no shit from any eagle. I thought it fit). Liam is then also known as Inkwing (Ink + wing = bookworm and raven animagus). Liam gets wooed by Pandora Ollivander, the quirky Ravenclaw with blond hair hanging to her kneecaps and the brightest smile in Hogwarts. They connect first over a shared interest in Advanced Charms, where Liam kept Pandora from charming her buttcheeks off, and eventually developed romantic feelings in their later years. Being raised in a rather conservative muggle family, Liam was hesitant to further their relationship. Pandora took it in her own hands and snogged his lips raw during a sunny Hogsmeade weekend. They married with 18. Through the urging of his great-great-granddaughter, Ollivander agreed to take on Liam as a wandcrafter apprentice - but only because Liam knocked his NEWTS out of the park - allowing the muggleborn to delve deep into the most arcane arts of magic. 2 years after their marriage, when Liam was already a fixed part of the Ollivander wandshop and Pandora an up and coming spellcrafter, they married and got little Aster Garrick Evans. As an irish twin, just after Aster, followed little Luna Jasmin Evans.

Sirius and Severa married a month after James. They didn't have children, for the longest time, due to both of them thinking they would be unfit parents, deeply afraid that they would become even just slightly like their own parents. Instead they delved into their carreers. Sirius became an Auror immediately after Hogwarts and Severa bloomed in her work as a potioneer for highly complex potion commissions and experimental potions.

All of them joined the Order of the Phoenix during the war (even though Andromeda and Severa were a bit reluctant). The war dragged on, the prophecy never being revealed to Voldemort, and eventually got to the threshold when the Order spoke about cutting its losses. Dumbledore, in order to prevent him from making it self-fulfilling, obliviated himself of the exact wording of the prophecy, only remembering its existence and that it speaks about Voldemort, so that no-one knew what it says, practically making it one of the thousands of prophecies in the Hall of Prophecies that never came to take hold. The Blacks, Potters and Evans, along with most of the Order, hid their houses under charms and moved to safer shores in Europe, waiting for the ICW to move in on Voldemort. Afraid to loose the history of the place, Dumbledore evacuated Hogwarts, all the books, the artifacts, the portraits - everything but the bare, stone walls, into a new location (something like the dwarven cave systems in the Untersberg, above the catacombs of the sleeping Charlemagne) where he opens a new school for the children of the new british enclave.

Sirius and Severa become parents two years after they took refuge in Central Europe. Virgo Alpha and Sirrah Eileen Black are the twins born to the unsure parents.

wew, that got long... and it would only be Act 1. Oh well... imma leave this here.
