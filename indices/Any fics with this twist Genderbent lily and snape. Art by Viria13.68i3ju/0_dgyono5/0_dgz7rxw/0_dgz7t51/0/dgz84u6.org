That was one idea, though I didn't want to shoehorn in someone else to listen in on the prophecy. Currently the idea is based on the assumption that since nobody else heard it, there is no need for the Evans or the Longbottoms to go into hiding.

Though I could imagine a scenario in which it does happen and Voldemort kills the Evans family. Severa would then adopt "Harry" Evans (whatever his/her name would be then) and struggle first with the law, and then with the stigma of being the wife of the traitor. For plot reasons I'd say that he didn't tell her the truth about the change of secret keepers. However, since she does love Sirius she'll seek to have him answer to her directly. He'd of course say that hes innocent and after a few drops of veritaserum, homebrew of course, she believes him.

In any case, I see two hurdles with it here. Snape was the one to tell Voldi the prophecy, effectively starting the process of it in the first place. Second, Sirius had many friends, but no lover during his canon betrayal. There was no one who put Sirius emotionally above Lily and James and when they all believed him atraitor, they all chose to hate him. A lover would struggle with this hate, and maybe be more in denial, seeking answers before judgement.

But then again, maybe Severa would just cynically assume that good things don't last for her and just take on the duty she thinks she bears by raising Harry, never looking back and stirring in her bitterness.

Eh... that would need some brainstorming.
