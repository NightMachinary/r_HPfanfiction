The problem here is just that we assume Sirius wouldn't tell Severa. To be quite honest, that is not the relationship I imagine for those two. He may be aloof most of the time, and Severa an unrepentant cynic, but I do think that they tell each other their secrets /and/ trust each other with everything at that point in time. After all, they bonded over their dark secrets, their abuse and the lack of love from their family. They shared some deep stuff with each other.

Plus, Severa is possessive as fuck. Shes well aware that Sirius is A) way above her league in looks and B) the second person /in total/ she trusts, right after Liam. No way is she letting Sirius go on some traitor hunt without her, even if in her head that's just so she can keep an eye on him. Though, since its Liams death shes looking the culprit for, she's probably on the warpath as well.

Anyway, as I said, that will take some brainstorming. I'm not sure what I want from this and how its going to develop. I'll probably need a few sketches and test-dialogue to get a feel for it.
