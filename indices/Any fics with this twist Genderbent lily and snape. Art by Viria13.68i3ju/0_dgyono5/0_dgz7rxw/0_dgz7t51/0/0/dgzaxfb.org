So we assume Voldemort can't hear the prophecy as set up. Dumbledore knows there is one and it's key to Voldemort's defeat. Right. How cautious is Dumbledore here? How desperate is he to win? So he doesn't leak the bait. But maybe he gets nervous knowing it's one of two babies and maybe he gently urges one family into hiding. Or both. Maybe he informs them of the prophecy. Maybe not. Then Voldemort notices some of the opposing forces have dropped out.

So now. The war goes on a little longer. But he's sharp. It takes a little time but he turns Peter. Maybe starts some rumors about Sirius beforehand once Voldemort puts a few pieces together. I mean. RAB joined then betrayed. So maybe. Maybe RABs death tilts Sirius. At least that's how the rumors would go.

Sev and the others pick up on these rumors. Perhaps Sirius turns a little serious. He may realize and internalize that there's a traitor. And he's fiercely loyal to the Potters/Evans by now.

So. He knows the shits bunk but thinks that there IS a traitor. And he can't deduce immediately who it is but starts acting...out with the rumors. He knows they can't use him as secret keeper but let's every think he is. His opinion of Peter is...well.

The switch occurs like in canon. But obvi we're dealing with a few twists. Sirius is desperate to keep them safe. But he just assumes Peter couldn't.

Now we have Sev and him in a relationship that's been strained, her cynicism taking hold. He's starting to get reckless-ish to find the traitor. Boom. Canon proceeds. It's a piss poor Christmas.
