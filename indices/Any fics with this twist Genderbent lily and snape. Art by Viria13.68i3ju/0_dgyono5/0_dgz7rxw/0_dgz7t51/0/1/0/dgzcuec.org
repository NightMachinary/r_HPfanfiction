That's also an interesting way to go about it. I didn't even have Regulus on my radar, him being younger and all. It could make for some good drama and some great crossroads for Severa's character.

She knows shes an outsider in Slytehrin, but she is also entranced by the power that comes with the Dark Arts. Regulus would offer her an in, towards a well of endless knowledge in that subject.

Sirius on the other hand, I'd imagine is emotionally closer to her. They're the two misfits, not quite where they belong, not quite where they were supposed to be.

I can also imagine that it wouldn't quite compute with her that two boys would compete for her heart, which would be a fun and interesting part of it all.. I keep imagining her a rather plain looking, and we all know how cruel kids and teenagers are. At the age when she would start being interested in boys and starts having crushes, she'd have it well and truly hammered into her mind by her peers that she's ugly.

In any case I'll keep your comment in my considerations. Its a good angle to explore.
