I've read some genderbent Snape fanfiction like this one which is okay.

In all honesty, I'd love to read a fanfiction with a gryffindor male Lily and slytherin female Snape. How would Gryffindor and Slytherin respond to them here? I think perhaps Lupin would be closer to a Male Lily rather than the Marauders and I doubt Lucius would take a Female Snape under his wing. Maybe Narcissa would instead? Would the Marauders bully a girl Snape as viciously? I doubt it. James would probably not be attracted a male Lily so the sexual tension aspect won't be there. And SWM has a a very different context if you substitute Severus for Severina or Sevanna and I don't think they'd go as far. And how would a poor, halfblood female Snape fare in Slytherin? She'd be even more at the bottom and not even be considered by the deatheaters. And then there's the whole dynamic of Snape and Lily and how it would change with different genders. Perhaps Snape's position would be more sympathetic as a girl. I don't think they'd get together though. It's very interesting and I'd definitely read it if someone decides to pick up on the idea one day. The artwork is gorgeous.
