Yeah but Bellatrix was the rich pureblood daughter of the influential Black family. Emphasis on the pureblood and Black. Voldemort seems like the type to view women as weak but would make some allowances if it came to blood purity and wealth. If Snape were half-blood and poor along with being a woman, I don't think she'd be inducted. At the very least, I doubt she'd have the dark Mark. Even Narcissa didn't have one.
