I tend to think it'd be a nature/plant name. For whatever reason, their parents seemed keen on that naming scheme. It makes more in universe sense than turning lily to Lyle. I don't think it would necessarily be Ash or Basil, but something like that. They have a surprisingly wizardly naming scheme for a pair of muggles

Edit- I really do like Lyle though. It's a surprisingly good lily analog
