It's not really "repugnant" to me, I just have absolutely zero interest in reading it. I don't mind changing the gender of a character when it makes sense and is done for a reason- like making Hakku female Naruto fanon (wow I haven't read that fandom in years!).

Just like I don't want to read "goody-two-shoes" Harry, or Harry/Hermione pairings.

It doesn't have any appeal to me, on any level. Is that really so hard to understand?
