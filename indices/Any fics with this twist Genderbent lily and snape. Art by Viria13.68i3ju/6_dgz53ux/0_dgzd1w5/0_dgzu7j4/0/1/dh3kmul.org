Thought you were responding to another comment thread (about fem/Harry).

As for fem/Snape... Any thoughts that stray towards Snape's genital organs are nasty, QED, anything that makes me think about that is nasty. That and Snape's general personality? Nasty.

That's without mentioning how berift of any quality writing or plot a story involving a gender bent character would be, because there's absolutely no reason to do it except for the sake of doing it. It doesn't contribute anything to the plot, it's utterly pointless.

I'm just imagining a lanky, flat-chested, greasy-haired, rude female Snape, and that is definitely one of the nastiest images my mind has been responsible for.

And all of those things you mentioned, if done well, make sense and take time to develop within the story. Changing a character's gender is not comparable to those other things you listed, AT ALL.
