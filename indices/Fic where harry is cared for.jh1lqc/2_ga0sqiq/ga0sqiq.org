A Better Man: linkffn(2531438)

At Vernon Dursley's funeral, Harry makes a wish - wishing that Vernon had been a better man. His wish comes true, in the form of Vernon getting sent back in time with a personality adjustment. That, then, takes the rest of the Dursleys with it - Petunia makes amends with her sister, Dudley gets raised into less of a bully.
