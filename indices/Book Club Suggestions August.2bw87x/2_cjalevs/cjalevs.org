Avoiding Harry? I refer you to [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=2321][Potter Law #1]].

Therefore I will just link stories of Harry paired with interesting characters.

First up is a fantastic story by MattSilver_3k, a fantastic author (and co-author/friend/beta). Here is his zombie apocalypse story, which pairs Harry/Astoria Greengrass on a post-Hogwarts adventure, quite likely one of the best complete post-Hogwarts stories I know of. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]]

I'll throw up a delightful time travel story of Harry/Bellatrix as well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]] by Lord Silvere, which I would consider a work in progress - at least by my own standards it's still being worked on - that is quite long and one of the better romps through the Marauders Era that exists.

And the one-shot to end all odd pairing one-shots: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5642958/1/A-Little-Knowledge-is-a-Dangerous-Thing][A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing]] by vlad the inhaler. Vlad is a great writer who can take a weird idea and run with it better than just about anyone. He's redefined both Romilda Vane in this story, and Cormac McLaggen is his incredible [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][Whatever Happened To Bromance]], which is also Harry/Romilda but a smutfic.

Finally, I'll recommend Silens Cursor's work with Harry/Su Li. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5168768/1/Silence-Game][Silence Game]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6463441/1/Temptation-Game][Temptation Game]]. Both one-shots, both a terrifying look into a well-written Harry.

I doubt all of these are exactly what you were looking for, but they are all fantastic.
