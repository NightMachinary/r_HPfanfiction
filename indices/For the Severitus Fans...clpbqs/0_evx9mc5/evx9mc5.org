I'm reading it right now and even though it's pretty grim overall, it does have some very funny moments such as this one:

  “Yes, but he's my father,” Harry says in the calmest, most friendly voice he can. “So he won't mind if we take some, you see? But you don't have to bother him or tell him. He's still getting used to the relationship.” Dean sounds like he's strangling next to him.

  Dobby considers Harry with solemnity for a moment, then nods. “Dobby can be seeing that. And what does the great wizard want to be called? Harry Snape?”

  “Ugh,” Harry says involuntarily, and this time Dean is chuckling openly. “No, just call me Harry, Dobby. That's all I've ever been. Just Harry.”
