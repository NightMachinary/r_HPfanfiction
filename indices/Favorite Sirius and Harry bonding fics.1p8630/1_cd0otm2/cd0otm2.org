Nonjons [[http://http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] is a rather long and slightly silly but enourmously enjoyable fic in which Harry and Sirius enter a slightly AU world (Harry goes through the veil by accident several years after the war). They then continue to make the world unsafe for everyone who opposes them and grow ever closer (entirely platonic uncle-relationship!) while essentialy mostly having a whole lot of fun.
