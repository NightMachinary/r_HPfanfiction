I can't really see all of this playing out with not just regular government red tape and the whole veritaserum isn't applicable in court, although I don't know if that last one is canon or fanon. Not to mention that Fudge has his strings pulled by Malfoy, who absolutely wouldn't want things to go that way. Maybe without Malfoy, say later in the year when Malfoy is arrested, that might work, but not when Fudge is desperate to shut Harry up.
