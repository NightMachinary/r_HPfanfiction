All we know from canon is that Veritaserum isn't /used/ in the court cases we see (though it is used in Barty Crouch Junior's interrogation in Book 4, that's not a government call), we don't know if it's admissible.

Government red tape, /hell/ yes that'd be an issue. The Minister doesn't want to /admit/ the truth, and his Undersecretary /orders a Dementor attack/ to squash it. I think a plea for Veritaserum would just be framed as negatively as possible - "mistrusting the Ministry? That's treasonous thoughts you're harboring..."

Malfoy is arrested in the same event that /undisputably/ puts the truth out there, which makes it difficult to say whether his arrest would make Fudge more willing to admit things. I think it'd outright take Fudge being out of the picture to get the Ministry to take action earlier - if he was attacked by Barty Crouch Junior before the latter gets outed as impersonating Moody, it might happen.

All of which, of course, is assuming fully canon compliant characters and situations - but this is a /fanfic/ prompt. If this is one of those fanfics where the Head of the DMLE has final say over what happens in court (in absentia of the Chief Warlock), she'd probably overrule Fudge and Umbridge for it if Veritaserum was admissible.
