I'm pretty sure that stuff like veritaserum would work based on what you perceive as true and not a universal truth (made it sound weird but bare with me). I mean if you think it to be true, veritaserum will spill it out. If you don't think it to be true,, veritaserum won't speak it out (consider you 'know' as a fact that Everest is lower than Mt. Fuji, so according to veritaserum Mt fuji is the highest mountain peak as per your truth).

Thus it is easy to fabricate a thought in your mind which you absolutely believe as to be true but in reality its not. That's why veritaserum is not admissible for stuff like these especially when you have magic that can create fake memories and obliviations.
