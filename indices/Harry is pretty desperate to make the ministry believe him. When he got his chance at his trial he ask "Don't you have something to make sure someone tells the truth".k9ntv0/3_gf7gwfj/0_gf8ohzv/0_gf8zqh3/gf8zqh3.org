  He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge's smile widened.

  “Good,” she whispered. “Very good. Now then ...” She leaned forward a little. “Where is Albus Dumbledore?”

  “No idea,” said Harry promptly.

  “Drink up, drink up,” she said, still smiling. “Now, Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr. Potter. ...”

  “I don't know where he is.”

  Harry pretended to drink again.

  “Very well,” said Umbridge, looking displeased. “In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.”

She first asks about Dumbledore, than about Black, when she /thinks/ he took Veritaserum. The Dumbledore question wouldn't happen, because Dumbledore didn't flee yet at that time, but the Black question? I bet Umbridge would ask it, if she had the slightest suspicion that he would know.
