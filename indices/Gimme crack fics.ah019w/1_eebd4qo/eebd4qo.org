I bestow upon you, the ultimate crack fic. It's got it all, sarcasm in spades, chewing bubblegum and kicking ass, Luna Lovegood being twice as crazy as anyone thinks she is, six different versions of Voldemort at the same time without time travel, at least eight Harry's at the same time with time travel, the Hindenburg, an actually surprisingly logical take on the concept of horcruxes and immortality, not giving a fuck, and my personal favourite, the Vorpal Bunny.

Lady and or Gentleman, allow me to present to you: [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_fleur/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]]
