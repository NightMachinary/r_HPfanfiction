Yeah I read it up until Hermione and Draco had a kiss in the library. I thought I could deal with Draco and Harry being friends but the Dramione pairing just creeps me out. I started reading the Grass is always Greener story instead; the romance between Daphne and Harry starts pretty much straight away, and Draco gets put in his place and humiliated like he deserves.
