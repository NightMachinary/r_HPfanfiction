  True, it is suspicious. But it doesn't make sense for the murderer to waste 1000 galleons on a half baked murderplan of jinxing a broom.

Does it not? If I recall correctly, Harry and Ron were enamoured by the broom and didn't consider where it came from and were certainly caught up in the excitement of having the best broom on the world. It would make sense to send a young boy an amazing gift- just when he needs it- that he would want to use immediately. As such, even Oliver Wood was caught up in the glamour of the broom. If the broom had been jinxed and Hermione had not taken it to McGonagall it is likely that it may have killed or harmed Harry. Surely spending 1000 galleons is worth it for a plan that likely would have worked without the intervention of Hermione?
