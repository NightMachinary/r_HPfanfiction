  You got that from where? And is Harry expected to be able to cast a spell while unexpectedly falling at dangerous speeds?

Arresto momentum being thought in second year, that is probably from games.

Also,

/"Dumbledore ...ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground."/

If 100 year old Dumbledore has enough time to /run into the field/ and then cast arresto momentum, while Harry was in /free fall/ (aka with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s^{2),} then I'm not sure why Harry cannot cast his spell as soon as he feels that something is funny.

Besides, And in QTtA, chapter 6, Changes in Quidditch since the Fourteenth Century (> Balls > The Quaffle):

/Chasers were also becoming increasingly irritated by the necessity of diving continually towards the ground to retrieve the Quaffle whenever they missed a catch and so, shortly after the Quaffle's change of colour, the witch Daisy Pennifold had the idea of bewitching the Quaffle so that if dropped, it would fall slowly earthwards as though sinking through water, meaning that Chasers could grab it in mid-air. The “Pennifold Quaffle” is still used today./

It's obvious that arresto momentum can be used at the starting of fall as well. Heck you could even enchant a broom so that arresto momentum is activated the moment it falls. If it works for quaffles then why not for brooms?

Now do you think it is so easy for a single person to tamper with that protection in a world class broom like firebolt? With 14 years of mental torture in azkaban and not having his own wand?

  Harry got a insanely expensive broom, free, without even a note. A broom used for competitive quidditch. And you don't think the teachers would be suspicious? While there's an escaped murderer, who escaped from somewhere no one has escaped from before, and has already broken into Hogwarts at that point (i think) on the loose with a vendetta against Harry.

Again you are merely repeating other's explanation. True, it is suspicious. But it doesn't make sense for the murderer to waste 1000 galleons on a half baked murderplan of jinxing a broom.
