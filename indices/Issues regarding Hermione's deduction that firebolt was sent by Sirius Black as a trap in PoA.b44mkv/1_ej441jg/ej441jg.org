Harry was sent an insanely expensive broom, anonymously, for no reason.

You got that from where? And is Harry expected to be able to cast a spell while unexpectedly falling at dangerous speeds? He'd be lucky if he got his wand out in time, just to see it torn out of his hand by the wind.

That's pure fanon. Ancient runes is a language

  how do you expect an azkaban escapee

He escaped azkaban. It's literally never been done before. They have no reasonable expectations. They don't have any clue what he could possibly be capable of

  He is the boy who lived

Which doesn't give him any protection? If anything it'd make people more protective of him (and did) because he's a public figure

Harry got a insanely expensive broom, free, without even a note. A broom used for competitive quidditch. And you don't think the teachers would be suspicious? While there's an escaped murderer, who escaped from somewhere no one has escaped from before, and has already broken into Hogwarts at that point (i think) on the loose with a vendetta against Harry.

Not to mention that Hermione was right. It was sent by Sirius Black. And no, that sort of deduction isn't that hard to make at thirteen. Had you never read any kind of mystery book at that age?\\
There's no holes. This is ridiculous
