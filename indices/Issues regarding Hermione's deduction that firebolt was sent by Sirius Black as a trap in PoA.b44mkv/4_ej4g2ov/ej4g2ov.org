Ignoring all the other stuff, you're probably right that anything involving the broom would have a low chance of killing him by dropping him from a height. That doesn't mean it couldn't be triggered to harm him in some other way, such as by releasing a curse or trying to abduct him. It could even turn into a portkey at a specific time.

In any case, McGonagall is just being safe. A gift from a Death Eater and madman, the same one who betrayed Harry's parents and caused their deaths, does not make any sense /except/ as some sort of threat. The reasonable response was to keep it away from him until it could be thoroughly tested.
