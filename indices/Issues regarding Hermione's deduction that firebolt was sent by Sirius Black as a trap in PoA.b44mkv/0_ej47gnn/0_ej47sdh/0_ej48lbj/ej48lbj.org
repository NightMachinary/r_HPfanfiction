Explosion was just an example (and even then if it had a specific trigger such as reaching a certain height or speed it wouldn't necessarily be obvious) and remember that McGonagall is not an expert on potions or curses so unless it was a fairly poor attempt I wouldn't expect her to find it with a preliminary exam (I always assumed it was implied that various members of the staff examined the broom before it was declared safe).

Ultimately we don't know enough about HP magic to say what was or wasn't possible in this case so are left with speculation other than McGonagall thought it was worth looking into.
