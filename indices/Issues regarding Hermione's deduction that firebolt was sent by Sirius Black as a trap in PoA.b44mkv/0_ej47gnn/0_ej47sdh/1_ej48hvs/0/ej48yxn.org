  black is seen as a mad man
#+end_quote

Exactly, now can you imagine a madman, an azkaban escapee with no wand/second hand wand that has less compatibility, having enough subtlety/sanity to perform sensitive tasks like tampering with protection charms in firebolt that could even get past McGonagoll?

  hermione made an obivious deduction escaped mad man wants to kill harry
#+end_quote

It's because it's obvious deduction that it is hasty. Still, she was able to come to that conclusion without succumbing to the temptation of firebolt. You have to giver her credit for that.

But again, for a murderplan, it's full of holes.
