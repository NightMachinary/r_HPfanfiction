Q-mort was doing it real-time, wandless and wordlessly while Snape worked against him. And having broom stop working mid-air isn't the only way to assassinate someone with a broom. Dumbledore died because he wore a ring. Harry was kidnapped because he touched a cup. There are ass biting toilet seats, biting books and many more dangers in the world. Sirius, a man raised by the Black family who the man himself confessed as to being amongst darkest of dark families, would be reasonably knowledgeable in cursing an object.

And levitation charm? Really? You expect a kid to be able to cast a levitation charm at a rapidly falling object? Even if Harry himself could cast it, while in an uncontrollable free fall, a levitation charm isn't useful for flight, it would make him stop, yes, but it wouldn't let him do anything else and I don't know about you but staying mid air doesn't sound safe to me.

And your reasoning is ridiculous from the start because a life isn't something to put at risk for a ridiculous reasons like riding 'the fastest' broom. Harry had perfectly acceptable brooms he could use provided by the school. There was no conceivable reason for him to risk his life for a broom.
