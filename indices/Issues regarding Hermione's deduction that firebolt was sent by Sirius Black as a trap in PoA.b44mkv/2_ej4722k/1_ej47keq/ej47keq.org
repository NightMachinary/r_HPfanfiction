  Cursed broom seems to be a legitimate way to kill someone in magical Britain if Dumbledore isn't there.

To severly injure someone or disable someone so that he won't play in next match? Yes. But to kill someone? Nope. Unless you are 11 year old and you have Voldemort jinxing it. Even then Quirrelmort had to maintain /continuous eyecontact/ for what? Nimbus 2000?

And now to think that Sirius is suddenly more capable than quirrelmort in jinxing the /firebolt?/
