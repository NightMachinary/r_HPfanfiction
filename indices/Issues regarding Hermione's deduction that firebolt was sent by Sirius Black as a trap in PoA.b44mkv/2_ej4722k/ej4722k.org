Arresto momentum was first mentioned in the third book when Dumbledore casted it. It's only taught to students in the LEGO games... which are even less canonical than the regular games. And even if it was, in a stadium full of people where ~80% are capable of casting it, only the most competent wizard of the century used it in time to stop Harry's fall. Cursed broom seems to be a legitimate way to kill someone in magical Britain if Dumbledore isn't there.
