Or file false reports of Snorcack sightings in ideal vacation spots... "My Lady, I heard a rumor that the Snorcacks migrate to Fiji in January, I think I should go investigate. Also there's a German muggle tabloid that reported sightings of 'some sort of creature with a crumpled horn' near Munich in October, I think I need to check that too... just to be thorough."

For that matter... I imagine that if the highly reputable American publication "The Weekly World News" were brought to the Dark Lady Luna's attention, she would no doubt recognise it as the closest competition for The Quibbler. And I think the "Bat Boy" creature on the cover would surely interest her, and the article says it's a known associate of one "Elvis Presley", resident in some town called Las Vegas. Clearly the Dark Lady's servants would need to go to this Las Vegas to interrogate him to learn the creature's whereabouts. Should only take them a week or two.
