[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Moldyshorts (I totally support ridiculing your enemies) got whacked early, so James and Lily got to raise Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Moldyshorts was a lot smarter in this one and actually stopped calling himself Voldemort after getting his body back. He has also maneuvered into a strategically very advantageous position by 2024. On the other hand, James and Lily got to raise Harry, who turned out to be another Dark Lord.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): Nice romance in a non-magical AU, Potters and Hermione are Americans, and Harry is a celebrity in his own way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): Moldyshorts never existed, and Bellatrix and Hermione got together. Harry only has a minor in this fic.
