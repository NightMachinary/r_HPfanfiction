I wish I knew more fics of what you're looking for. The only ones that are semi close are goblin raised Harry fics.

I read linkffn(Harry Potter and The Labyrinth (Year one)) about a week ago and it was a decent read. You get some Flitwick but he's not a main character. Interesting read though.

A year ago I read Harry Crow by RobSt. Can't really remember much of it but I'm pretty sure Flitwick is in there since it's about goblins. I don't know if I actually finished reading this one.
