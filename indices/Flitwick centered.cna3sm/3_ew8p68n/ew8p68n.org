Linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) is a four part Fem!Harry story in which Flitwick plays a much bigger role than you usually see. He isn't a main character but he interacts with the main character a lot.

The story is complete, but be warned this story triggers a lot of people. The worst triggers are in the first four chapters. If you can survive that you can read the whole series.
