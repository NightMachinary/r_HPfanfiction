Well this is Flitwick-centered, and while he isn't a professor, he is teaching Tom to duel in the There is Nothing (to fear) series, which centers on a Tom Riddle who was sorted into Gryffindor. It's neither poorly written, nor abandoned.

The whole series is rather short (23.4k words in total), but if you only want to read the parts with Flitwick you'd only need Part 2, Men who are Resolved, followed by Part 5, According to his Own Nature.
