This "gaining acceptance" and "putting their happiness above his crush" might sound great on paper, but it really doesn't translate well into actual human relationships and interactions. And at an age like 16 or 17? No chance.

Two friends of mine, and I daresay they were best friends at the time, happened to like the same girl in high school. She started going out with one of them, and the other guy...well, he was a mess for a month or so. Something in their friendship broke. She was friendly with both guys before going out with guy 2 - her friendship with guy 1 crumbled as well.

Neither of the two guys bothered keeping in touch after graduating from school.

James might not decide to have yelling matches with Sirius in the great hall like an edgelord, but the brotherly camaraderie that's often spoken about James and Sirius' friendship? Yeah, you can say goodbye to that.
