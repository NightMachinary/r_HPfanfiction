At the time, they'd been best friends since eighth grade, so about four years or so. Guy 1 (guy who didn't date Girl) had liked Girl since around the same time.

< Did one of them get thrown out of their house and move in with the other one?

This would just increase the feelings of hurt, disappointment and betrayal, not lessen it.

Not sure where you come from, how your peers behaved, but I've never heard of a "mature" teenager. Teenagers, by definition, are immature. Heck, several adults I know are immature. Maturity is a lifelong process.

Besides, when it's a question of feelings, humans generally tend to behave like humans, not like robots. Also, if you're so curious, you can try it out yourself - hit on women your friends have had their eye on for a while, date them, see where that leaves you. Please do not blame me if you find yourself short a few friends afterwards though.

PS: When I meant their friendship fell apart, I didn't mean they stopped talking to each other instantly. They still talked to each other, but the ease with which they spoke was gone, and there was a slight hesitation in all their interactions afterwards.
