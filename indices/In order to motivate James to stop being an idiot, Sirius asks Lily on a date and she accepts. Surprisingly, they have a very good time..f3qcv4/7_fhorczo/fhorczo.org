The thing is Sirius hurt James feelings in the beginning, not because he had deeper feelings for Lily, but to take the piss out of James and that hurts and breaks trust and even if James is happy for them, it still hurts and it would be healthy for him to get a bit away from them.

So, in the end, I think Sirius would just lose everything because the friendship and brotherhood is the closest and most important relationship for him and if he doesn't break up with Lily in an attempt to get James back (and I can't see James be happy with him for hurting Lily) or stay with her, I think he would start to resent her later on about his lost friendship with James
