One of the most unexplored ships in the fandom.

Pretty wild that the intensity of the friendship and loyalty between Sirius and James is so sacrosanct that even in the wild west of fanfic, there is quite literally more smut out there involving Sirius AND HIS BROTHER than there is Sirius and Lily.

Regulus = fair game

Lily = whoa whoa whoa come on now that's his /best mate/
