I'm asexual, so I don't look at porn, and I'm totally unhip, so I don't really do social media, and most of my actual internet usage tends to be academic research or writing research.

My knowledge/experience does have a lot of random gaps where stuff I just haven't ever encountered lies, for instance I also didn't know what Werther's were until a couple of years ago (I'm 23 and live in England where they're well known). I do know some other general stuff about pornography and sex and whatnot, but I've never encountered the term pegging before and thus never knew it. Well, never encountered it that I remember, anyway. It's quite possible I've seen it before and just forgot it as useless information.
