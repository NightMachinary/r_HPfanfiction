We need to make the cutest name ever. Someone needs to make a post about this. I'm not very good at making up names. I like Haz.

"Hey Haz!" Ron exclaims."You left your pencil case behind!"

"Hello Hazzy" James exclaims to a 1yr old Harry with love "You're a cute little baby, aren't you. You're my little hazzy. My lille haz. Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle!"

Lily finishes her work and looks at a sleeping 5 month old Harry. She starts stroking his hair. "Oy little Hazzy. What are you up to? Sleeping? Dreaming? What are you dreaming about, Haz? Ah, you're so adorably cute!" Lily squeezes harry's ickle hand.

Ouch. I hope that all didn't sound cringey
