I hate it when they call Harry Prongslet. It's so cringy... It doesn't even make any sense either! "Prongslet" wtf is that? that'd be like calling Sirius' son Padfootlet or sth. Prongs is just James' nickname. It would be way more logical if Harry had his own nickname, or if they planned on teaching him to be an animagus too and waited to give him his nickname when he had his own animal form.
