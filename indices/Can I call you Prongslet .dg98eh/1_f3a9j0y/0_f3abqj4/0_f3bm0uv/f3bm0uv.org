I don't mind a fic where Lupin's wolf has a â€˜pack' but it has to be something he really struggles to understand and accept, as per his canon hatred and rejection of his condition. Agree that canon Lupin would never use pup or cub. Fenrir can use it fine the au fics where he's not a slavering monster. And I wouldn't even protest Sirius using pup; his animagus is so much a part of him that I can see him using pup just to be annoying.
