Prongslet, cub, pup, I dislike them all. But Mione takes the cake for me. It's not hard to use one extra syllable and say her full name. Nine times out of ten, if I see Mione anywhere in the story, I drop it. As far as strangling the author, I once saw Harry call Luna "Lulu." I don't remember what story though.
