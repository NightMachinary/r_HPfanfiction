I don't think the book is presenting an arbitrary rule so much as revealing a pattern that many readers appreciate, on a subconscious level, but would otherwise be unable to name.

That is, you're obviously right that most fanfic is so neglected a second reading would pay enormous dividends. But I think you're overestimating the degree to which most people are capable of noticing and isolating sentence-level awkwardness without training or prompting. (Exhibit A: That collection of [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6194031/The-Lost-Symbol-and-The-Da-Vinci-Code-author-Dan-Browns-20-worst-sentences.html][20 terrible Dan Brown sentences]] from a few years back. When I was teaching Intro to Creative Writing I'd have given him a C- and a long talk during office hours if he'd turned a final draft in with any of those, but 10 million people disagree with me very strongly, don't care, and/or don't notice.)

Good writing is even more difficult to grasp, which is almost the point; it gets out of its own way and keeps your focus on the story it's telling you. And while you certainly can't memorize or prescribe your way to it, you /can/ be taught to observe it more closely; as with birdwatching or baseball or anything else, you take in more information once you have a vocabulary and a set of concepts to bring to bear on what you're watching.

I would guess that somewhat less than half of fanfiction writers out there have ever even thought of "balance" as an idea that can apply to a sentence. They might like a balanced sentence more than an unbalanced one, but they probably couldn't tell you why.

To put it in more concrete terms: It's easier to perform a magic trick once somebody's A) told you it's a trick and B) showed you how it works.
