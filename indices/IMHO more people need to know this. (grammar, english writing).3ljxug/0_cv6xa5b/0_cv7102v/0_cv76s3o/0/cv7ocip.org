Not everyone is a native English speaker.

My high school English books had word lists and the grammar was more about verb conjugations, how to count and how to tell time (half seven is 7:30 in English, but it would be 6:30 in a lot of germanic countries).

Things like conditional verb forms, less vs fewer and a lot of other things I just had to figure out from reading books and then googling things I wondered about.

Strangely enough we were taught about who vs whom, even though it seems from my observation that most native English speakers have mostly stopped using 'whom' altogether.
