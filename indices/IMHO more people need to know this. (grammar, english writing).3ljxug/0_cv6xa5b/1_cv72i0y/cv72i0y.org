I like to read well written fan fiction stories but what people need to realize is fan fiction authors aren't making money. Honestly, fan fiction authors don't get much out of committing to writing other than maybe some exposure in the community. 80% of the fan fiction out there isn't considered to be good writing. 20% is probably amazing to acceptable writing when it comes to plot, characterization, and grammar. However, I read stories from that 80% group because I like the pairing or the trope and I don't give 2 shit about the grammar.

Don't get me wrong bad grammar turns me off, especially stories that don't even have concise dialogues. I'm open to reading stories where author is explaining more than he is actually showing the reader through actions and dialogue.

If I don't like a story, I just skip it. There is over 100,000+ fan fiction stories so there is a lot to choose from. As a reader I can't complain about amateurs who have a hobby of writing stories based on the Harry Potter universe. People who want to read well written fan fiction that reads like novels from published authors should look at DLP library (I do so myself when I'm in the mood).

But if I was an author, I'd rather have 1,000 reviews praising my work than like a couple of guys ripping it apart as if I'm trying to be a published author.

I think the best way to encourage better fan fiction is for people like OP to reach out to authors with good stories and provide them with beta services. You want to improve someone else's writing? reach out to them and actually help them rather than reviewing their work under the lenses of some hotshot publishing editor.
