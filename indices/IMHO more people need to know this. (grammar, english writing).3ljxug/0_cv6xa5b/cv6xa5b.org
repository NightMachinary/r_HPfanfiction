I don't think people necessarily need to be taught this. As the book says, the result of bad writing is that the sentence /feels awkward/. It's not bad writing because it breaks an arbitrary rule, it's bad writing because it doesn't feel right when you read it.

So all a writer needs to do to avoid writing in this way is to read their own work in a thorough and critical way and be prepared to perform significant edits to those parts which do not read well. If all fanfic writers did this, then the quality of fanfic writing would shoot up (though of course, bad decisions about content would still persist). But I wouldn't hold my breath. Most fanfic writers will never try to improve their own work. They receive enough uncritical praise that they're happy to just pump out the same work.
