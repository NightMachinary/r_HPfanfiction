I wholly agree with you. The first fanfiction I ever read was, to 13-year-old me, wonderfully written with perfect grammar. So much so that when I began writing my own 100+ page fic at 14, I used similar techniques in the fic I read.

It was only after being exposed to other works (fanfiction and fiction alike) that I realised my grammar was, well, not very good. I also realised that my poor grammar was due to my attempts at copying the author's writing. Needless to say, I wound up deleting my fic out of embarrassment.

The way we write and speak changes depending on what we read and hear. Someone who reads those poorly written fics is more likely to have poor writing skills, whereas someone who tends to read fics with proper grammar and spelling has a higher chance of developing better writing skills. The same also goes with published books. I'm willing to bet a rare Canadian penny that the writing style of someone who reads Twilight and 50 Shades is vastly different than the style of someone who reads Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings. What we experience always has a direct impact in how we develop and many young or new authors try to mimic the writing style of their favourite authors. What they don't realise is that some of these favourite authors have poor writing skills.

By Dumbledore's beard, I still can't get over how awful my first fic was.
