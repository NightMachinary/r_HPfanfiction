To build on Taure's comment, I would add that another issue is that a lot of fanfic authors haven't been exposed to good writing. Let's face it, a lot probably don't read that much, and what they do read is bad writing. So, when they do sit down to write, the model of "good writing" that they've built in their heads is actually not that great. That's why the best writers say that it's critical to be a prolific reader if you want to write - how can you recognize bad writing if you've rarely seen good writing?
