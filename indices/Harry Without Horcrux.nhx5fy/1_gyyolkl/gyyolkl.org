Well there's linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero). I only read a few chapters and apparently it gets reallllly weird later on but I'll just leave the rec out there.

In linkffn(On the Way to Greatness), Harry loses the Horcrux earlier than he does in canon. I read it a long time ago and I don't remember if/how changed him.
