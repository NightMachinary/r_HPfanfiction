With Apparition, and maximum potential, the only advantage that portkeys have is that I wouldn't have to personally transport objects and people. Maximum Potential could mean that I'd be able to take an arbitrary amount of people and stuff with me, and based on descriptions of each I'd honestly prefer travel by Apparition than by Portkey.

They're mostly a wash really, Apparition would be faster, Portkeys might have more utility. Given that I'm already hypothetically carrying a bag of holding anyway, the only real advantage of portkeys would be being able to send people elsewhere on their own.

As for the Featherweight charm. I consider levitation an active spell effect. Whereas a Featherweight charm is something I could cast on an object and forget about it. It also has extra utility when you consider them both being 'Maximum Potential', and casting both spells on the same object.
