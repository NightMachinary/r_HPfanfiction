This really depends on what sort of purpose I will need those spells, but I'm going to assume that I will be using these spells in day to day life. Maximum potential, hovever, makes this much easier than normal.

Apparition: This is a no brainer, maximum potential apparition means that I can travel anywhere. No more waiting for a bus, no need for a car, no need to pay to fly anywhere.

Accio: I'll never have to lose my keys or anything else really. Useful if I want to be lazy. Also doubles as a potent combat spell, at maximum potential, I reckon it'd be easy to summon body parts.

Leviosa: Levitation is just useful in so many ways that it also seems a no brainer. Also has combat potential.

Reparo: Self evidently useful house hold charm.

Scouring Charm/Cleaning Spell, whichever is more generally effective: Again self evidently useful house hold charm. Creative use might also be an effective combat spell.

Protego, or any other better Shield charm: Obviously combat focused. Assuming the scenario involves me living in the magical world, it makes sense to have a shield charm of some kind. With maximum potential this could probably be modified to produce numerous effects and shield geometries.

A general purpose Transfiguration Spell: This might be stretching the rules a bit, but I honestly refuse to accept that there is a different transfiguration spell for every possible (or known) transfiguration. A general spell must therefore exist. This has obvious useful applications.

A general purpose Space Expansion Charm: At Maximum Potential a Space Expansion Charm could theoretically last forever and could theoretically contain nearly infinite space. At the very least being able to create my own bag of holding would be very useful. Not to mention increasing my living space.

Featherlight Charm: Obvious numerous useful applications.

Finite: Useful for cancelling the featherlight, maximum potential makes it useful as a defensive combat spell, at the least.

That's 10. If I'm not living in the magical world, then I'd probably replace the Protego with a Reducio, as making things small would probably be more useful, even with a bag of holding.
