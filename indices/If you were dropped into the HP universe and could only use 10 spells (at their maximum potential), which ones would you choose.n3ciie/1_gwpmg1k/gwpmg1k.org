Lots of HP spells which would be considered superpowers on their own, especially at maximum potential. So I use my first set for some superpowers.

- Apparition (teleport)

- Disillusionment Charm (invisibility)

- Legilimency (mind-reading)

- Locomotor Charm (telekinesis)

- Fire-Conjuring Spell (elemental)

Next I will sort out my basic self-defence and other general utility:

- Shield Charm (protect)

- Stunning Charm (attack)

- Vanishing Spell (dispel transfigurations)

- Finite Incantatem (dispel spells)

This leaves me with one spell with which to secure some economic advantage. I'm assuming that since this is us appearing within the HP universe, using magic to get rich in the Muggle world is out because the Ministry would probably lock me up. So I need some legal way to use magic to be well off in the wizarding world. Ideally something relatively safe.

I'm going to go with:

- Voldemort's silver-limb conjuring spell.

This seems like it would be a good skill to have among wizards. It's a rare ability, but unlike a lot of rare magic it is also very useful. There are plenty of wizards with lost limbs who might pay handsomely for a rare magical prosthetic. I reckon I could live fairly well off it - people would probably come from far and wide for me to heal them.
