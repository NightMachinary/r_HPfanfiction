Things that violate our understanding of physics seem like the priority. Like water conjuration, /Aguamenti/. Unless it turns out to just be condensing water from the air, or is just a temporary construct, or something like that. If it's actually creating matter /ex nihilo/, it could enable things we haven't even thought of.

Apparition has been mentioned, but I think I'd actually prefer the spell that Dumbledore uses to create a Portkey. More flexible when bringing passengers and cargo, for starters. Who knows what might be possible if you push its limits. Stargate, anyone?
