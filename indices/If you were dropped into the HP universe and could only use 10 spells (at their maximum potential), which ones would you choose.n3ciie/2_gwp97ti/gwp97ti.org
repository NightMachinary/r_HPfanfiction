We need more information? Am like I a muggle who can inexplicably use 10 spells and nothing else magical or more like a wizard cursed in weird way to only use 10 spells. If I'm stuck in the muggle world my spell choices differ dramatically from being in the wizarding world. Access to enchanted objects also changes things substantially. What about non-spell uses of magic like potions or some fanon depictions of runes and rituals?
