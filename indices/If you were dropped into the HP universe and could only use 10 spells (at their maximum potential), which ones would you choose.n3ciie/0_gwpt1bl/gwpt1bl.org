I read through the comments and was shocked at the lack of healing spells. I mean, Episkey can instantly heal a broken nose or other injuries. Brackium Emendo (when cast by someone more competent than Lockhart) can heal broken bones. Vulnera Sanentur can heal deep gashes. There are probably other healing spells we don't see since they weren't relevant to the plot. Rowling has said that there are magical solutions to all muggle diseases, so cancer, heart disease, stroke... I'd load up on all the healing spells I can.

Maybe I'd also have to have Obliviate so the muggles I heal don't get me in trouble with the Statute of Secrecy.
