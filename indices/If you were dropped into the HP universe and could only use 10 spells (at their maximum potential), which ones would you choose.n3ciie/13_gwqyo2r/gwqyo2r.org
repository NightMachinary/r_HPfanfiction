- Expecto Patronum (Communications, manipulating things at a distance, light source, ID verification, and keeping my soul. I like having a soul.)

- Portus (Portkey spell. Dropping someone in the middle of the South Atlantic is effective, and I can save a fortune on transportation.) Also I don't think Apparition is technically a spell; pretty sure it's a skill like occlumency.

- Protego Diabolica (Fiendfyre with target selection capabilities, and no threat to me.) During blood war II there seem to be too many points this would keep me alive. Less dangerous times I'd probably replace with /Gemino/, depending on how/if the degradation thing works.

Agreeing with [[/u/sineout]] interpretations for the next two.

- GP Transfiguration

- GP space expansion charm

- Finite Incantatem

- Protego (or some other shield spell)

- Vulnera Sanentur (heals most dangerous injuries, lesser ones can be handled normally)

- Petrificus Totalus (Harder to get rid of or dodge than stunner, but basically same effect.)

- flipendo/depulso (diff betweent the two is a little vague in canon, but it's a good combo with transfig and PT)
