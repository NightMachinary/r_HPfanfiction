That's actually a really interesting question.

1.  Obliviate, can be really useful in certain situations
2.  Stupefy
3.  Protego
4.  Accio
5.  Can I use unforgivables? Then I'd add imperio
6.  Wingardium Leviosa (because I'm really tiny)
7.  Repello muggletum
8.  Silencio (yes, I have siblings...)
9.  Reducio
10. Engorgio

With this list I could definitely make my life easier. There are some other really neat things, I'd like to cast but I don't think fiendfyre is that useful...
