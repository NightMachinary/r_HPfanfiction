Just got to the funeral, and it's struck me how damn close it was that that didn't actually happen. Could've been Katie, and/or Leeanne, or Rosmerta, could have been Harry, or Ron, or Slughorn, or all three - if they'd toasted and drunk simultaneously, no one would have lived.

Which leads me to the conclusion - the Gaunt ring was still cursed. It, or the Stone(which, like the Wand, likes to lead people to death), must have affected his judgment. There's no reason Dumbledore would continue wearing it after having already fallen prey to its temptations. Especially since he was so insistent that Voldemort not be tipped off about the Horcruxes. To continue to let Draco threaten the lives of students (he did escalate to trying an Unforgivable) was so illogical, that it's unbelievable.
