My most recent work, A Grim Odyssey, is about this. It's part three of a trilogy, but I've added a summary in case you want to jump right in :)

The story follows Harry as he wanders around Wizarding Britain, wanted by a hostile Minister for Magic, chased by the last fugitive Death Eater, carrying the cursed Elder Wand.
