There are several types of exile, from hanging around in muggle England through going elsewhere in the world to giving up magic completely. I've got some that fit each of these scenarios.

My favorite story in this genre is linkffn(To Become A Muggle by lifebitten), in which Harry decides to give up magic completely.

linkffn(Betrayed by katydidnt) has a Harry who's living as a muggle.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]], which a sequel to [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]], details the interactions Harry has with other characters during a self-imposed exile from Wizarding England. Perfect Situations sets up the exile. A site login is probably required for these stories.

linkffn(Escape by Singularoddities) has Harry leaving England with Hermione.

linkffn(From the Shadows by MK-ONE) has a betrayed Harry leave England. I thought it got a bit silly in the revenge portion of the story.

linkffn(A Place Where I Belong by Corwalch) is a Stargate SG-1 cross that has Harry leaving the dimension completely to get away.

linkffn(Mr Potter Goes to Smallville by JBean210) is a Smallville cross that has an exiled Harry showing up in Kansas.

linkffn(Extradition Escape by Tangerine-Alert) has Harry leaving when his name comes out of the Goblet.

linkffn(The British Reformation by kb0) has Harry leaving England after Sirius' death.

linkffn(Wizards Fall by Bobmin356) has a post-war Harry in the Bahamas, but the Wizarding World won't leave him alone.

linkffn(The Wizard Ashikabi by plums) is a Sekirei cross which has Harry in exile to prevent loss of his heritage.

linkffn(The Game is Afoot by perspicacity) has Harry leaving England to escape the goblins.

linkffn(A Bad Week at the Wizengamot by DisobedienceWriter) is a cracky story with Harry leaving England after his conviction for underage magic.

linkffn(Too Late to Apologize by JackPotr) has Harry leave the Wizarding World and join MI-5. I didn't particularly care for it.

linkffn(Missing: Presumed Missing? by Seel'vor) has Harry leaving after the Department of Mysteries fight when his friends turn on him.

linkffn(The Brave New World by bellerophon30) has Harry leave Hogwarts and head to Minnesota.
