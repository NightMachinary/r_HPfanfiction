Those look like sound recommendations! I will be sure to check them out.

Out of the Exiled (Forced or Self-Imposed) fics that I've read, the fics where Harry does that because of his 4th, 5th (After Dementor Attack, Post-DoM or after being told of the Prophecy) and Post-War are the best settings for these kind of fanfictions.

I do like it when Harry does end up meeting his friends and such afterwards and see their reaction to him being muggle / married / with kids and etc.

Also, so you happen to know Fanfics where Harry is forfeiting the Triwizard and thus lose his magic and goes to live as Muggle? (in sort of Self-Imposed Exile)
