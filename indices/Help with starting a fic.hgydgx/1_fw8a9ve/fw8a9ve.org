I think the biggest clich√© is to start your fic at the very beginning of the school year - maybe because all HP books start this way. In my opinion, it's better to start directly into action, when it's possible.

Also, HP fandom is huge, so why people should read your story? Why is it special or different? Your first chapter should answer to those questions.

A 300k fic is a lot! You can be proud!
