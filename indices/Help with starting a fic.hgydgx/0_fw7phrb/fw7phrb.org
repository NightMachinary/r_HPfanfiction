generally, a fiction should start with everyday life before the conflict happens. I hate fics where the first chapter is confusing or if it's directly in or after a conflict. eg, in time travel, it's good to show the character in their future before they go into the past, and not starting it with already being in the past, or just waking up. my opinion.

I know, it's fanfiction, we already know all the characters and the universe (unless it's AU), but I still enjoy beginnings that show everyday life of the characters.

confusing is my big peeve. a mystery unveiling in the first chapter so that reader doesn't know what is happening, yet it still captures them is very hard to pull. it exists, but most often the effect is meh and I'm not really interested in what is happening enough to read more.
