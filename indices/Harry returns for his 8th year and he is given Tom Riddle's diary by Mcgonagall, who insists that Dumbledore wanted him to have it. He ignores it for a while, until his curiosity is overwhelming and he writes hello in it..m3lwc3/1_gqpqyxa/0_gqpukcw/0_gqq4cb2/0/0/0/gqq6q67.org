That's so relatable, I have an exam after spring break lol

One of those WIPs is one I haven't posted yet. I did one of these prompt things to share it, I dunno if you saw it but it's where Percy is depressed and suicidal and attempts to kill himself when Oliver stops him and over the course of that year they become really good friends and Oliver helps him fix things with his family

The other one, the one that is available, is an AU take on Percy's betrayal and starts out in his POV and then goes to Harry's and will remain that way until we get back to Percy.
