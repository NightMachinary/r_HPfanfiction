If you like badass action and slow Harry/Hermione, I'd recommend one of my favorites: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

The first few years are slightly different although it's only hinted at (using Veritaserum instead of Polyjuice), but in the middle of second year Hermione gets framed for theft and can't prove her innicence without revealing that they drugged Draco, so she gets expelled and really wants revenge. She eventually gets it after years of training, the entire Voldemort war where she sees more action than most others without anyone knowing about it, and a slight detour of ruining Malfoy's associates first. Harry becomes an auror after the war to help clean up the Death Eaters and gets frustrated that the mysterious "Night Nargle" that's robbing the rich purebloods always escapes from him.
