It's the most controversial fic in history for a reason, some love it some hate it. It's got some interesting philosophy in it but if you fundamentally disagree with the author it's difficult to enjoy. It's well written in that there's a lot of effort and details in it, but if you don't like the style you'll probably not like it. Philosophical discussions on the author's forum has created some ideas on consciousness and AI that even Elon Musk talked about (Rocos Basilisk). It's everything but a typical HP fanfiction.
