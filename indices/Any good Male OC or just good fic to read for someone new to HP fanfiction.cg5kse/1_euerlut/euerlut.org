In my case my introduction to fanfiction was HPMoR (which is /technically/ male OC although it's a spoiler) but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone as it does some things really well (logic, creativity) and completely fails at other things (realistic characters) so it takes a specific taste in fanfiction to enjoy.
