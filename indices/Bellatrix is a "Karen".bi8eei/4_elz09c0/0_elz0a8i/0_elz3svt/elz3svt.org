She's in her late 40's, but remember that wizards and witches age slower. McGonagall is supposed to look like she's middle aged or a bit older (though the movies aged her so that she could be played by Maggie Smith). Bellatrix is even younger, by around 20 to 30 years I think, so she should look like she's in her mid to late 20's. She might look worn and ragged, kinda like a young meth user, but she wouldn't look like a Karen.
