I think people had more problems with the way she said it that the meaning.

Before the installation of plumbing, muggle did use pot chamber and things like that, before later dealing with it (sometimes by throwing it out of the street and you said), and Wizards probably used a similar method (but probably prefering to vanishing the poop rather than throwing it).

In her tweet (it was a tweet I think), Rowling didn't say Wizards were doing their business discretely into chamber pots. She said that a Wizard would shit the moment he needs to (like in the middle of a full corridor), and then Vanish the mess. Even with the magic that deal with everything, it makes them look like babies, or animals.
