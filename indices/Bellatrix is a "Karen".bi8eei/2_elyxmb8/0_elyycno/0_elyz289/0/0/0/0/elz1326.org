Not everyone goes to Pottermore, and a lot of people only learn about what she says after she tweeted (and often only because mainstream medias decide to talk about this).

For Gay Dumbledore, I admit I don't see the problem since it's already heavily implied in the book (even if some of her comments about how he and Grindelwald were very passionate may have been too much).\\
I also remember her organizing a fack Gay wedding between Dumbledore and Gandalf in front a anti gay marriage association some years ago that had me really annoyed (because, even if I think it was a useless moove that just gave the association more visibility, and I don't care about Dumbledore homosexuality, Gandalf is certainly not gay and as a lower divinity would never marry to anyone, at least in this realm.)
