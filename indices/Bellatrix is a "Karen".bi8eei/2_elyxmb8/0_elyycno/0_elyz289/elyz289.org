The Black Family tree includes several instances of people having or fathering kids at 13 and younger, as well as flatly contradicting what is said in the books. Even if you disregard the dates and just go with it stating relationships and birth order, it makes it decidedly difficult for Nymphadora to be the age she is if Bellatrix is older than Andromeda /and/ at school at the same time as Snape (although getting knocked up by her muggleborn boyfriend and leaving Hogwarts early to elope does actually make a good story).

I've long been of the view that it belongs in the same category as the poo-vanishing thing, frankly.
