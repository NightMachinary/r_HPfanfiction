I hated how sexualized she was in the films. It's one of the reasons I disliked them so much. She was not a "sexy minx" who really goes around, but a creepy stalker. She was very beautiful once, but Azkaban took that away - when we see her in the books she is gaunt, sickly-looking, with only a trace of her former beauty. She didn't wear sexy dresses with deep cleavage or corsets. And the only person she wanted in "that way" was Voldemort.
