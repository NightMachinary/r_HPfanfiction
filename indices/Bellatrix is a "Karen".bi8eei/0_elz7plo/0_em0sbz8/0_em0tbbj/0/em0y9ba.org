Delphini is actually the one piece of "canon" from that play I sort of like/accept.

Of course, in my head she was conceived as a sacrifice and/or potions ingredients.

Think about it, we already saw Voldemort use bone of the father, flesh of the servant and blood of the enemy. There's got to be some super-powerful potions or rituals out there that use parts of your firstborn, right? Especially since firstborns are already referred to in muggle fairy tales like Rumpelstiltskin and even in the bible. Signing away your firstborn is a joke phrase used when people sign something without looking at it or when people drive a hard bargain.

So Voldemort obviously doesn't need an heir, since he plans on living forever. But he needs to have his own kid to kill or chop parts off so he can get stronger or achieve something else he wants. Naturally, Bellatrix is going to volunteer- that may even be why she didn't have kids with her husband, so the baby with Voldemort could be a firstborn on both the mother's and father's sides.

Delphini is damn lucky they died when they did, just a few months after she was born. She wouldn't have lived to grow up, otherwise.
