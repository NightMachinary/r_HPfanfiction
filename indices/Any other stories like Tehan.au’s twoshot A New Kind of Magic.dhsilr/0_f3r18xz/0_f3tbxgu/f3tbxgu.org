Sure thing! The tropes are when an adequately educated person from the modern day gets sent somewhere (back in time, parallel dimension, parallel dimension back in time, etc) where his level of education would make him a genius or whatever and he ends up helping the little community that took him in prosper with modern knowledge like crop rotation, how to make steel, modern day economics. And he starts teaching the local kids (and some key adults) and eventually is a big time teacher all the royalty asks for.

As well as stories that dive deep into the knowledge of a trade. I love learning everything I can about smithing from people like Alec Steele, and I loved getting my degree in Horticulture, to seeing other trades be explored from a newbie is exhilarating for me.

I also love stories that play around with time travel more than adding a few extra hours into the day. I love Doctor Who so that sort of casual temporal mayhem is very amusing, particularly the older than dirt guy who played the Vandal Savage card and only looks to be in or around the prime of his life. This late 20-something guy gave Caligula his nickname when he was a kid, he pulled pranks on the emperor with the first fireworks, he was kicking around potbelly hill when the first group of people decided civilization might be a good idea, he met the people who would go on to inspire the stories of Thor and Heracles and Manannan MacLir and Cú Chulainn.

And after a big explosion at the Time McGuffin Storeroom you cut to just after when his friend or lover is lamenting the protagonist and then he steps out from behind a conspicuously placed tree (that he totally didn't plant decades ago for this exact purpose) dressed like a well traveled man and looking a bit older. Then we cut back to where he ended up after the accident and we have a nice narrator who has been established as him from the future talking about how he remembered all those “and then a mysterious stranger helped us and rode off into the sunset” or “(insert deity here) blessed up with a godly helper” stories told to him by a soon-to-be familiar family friend and decides to be the mysterious stranger. And then we get a “this is how it all happens” narrator without it being all “remember the good ol' days” or “this is how I met your mother.”

And extra points if, when told to act his age, the ancient young man turns himself into a skeleton or a pile of dust.
