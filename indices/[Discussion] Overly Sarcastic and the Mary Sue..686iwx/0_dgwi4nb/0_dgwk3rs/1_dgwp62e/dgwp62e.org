  I mean more that (ESP in the realm of fan fiction if you create an OC story running parallel to Canon OR Sandboxing in the world) how do you deal with having a strong protagonist playing within the rules set for the world and not have it labeled a Mary Sue.

To be honest, I don't think it's possible. The problem is the word "protagonist". We already have an idea of who the important characters are in the HP world so introducing an OC and making them important feels like an artificial invasion into the established order - like the video says, it appears that the world has been manipulated to reorient itself around this new OC.
