Agreed, though honestly I have come up largely short on what use he could put it too. Maybe passwords in an unknown language would be good security- except from Ron :P

On the flip side however I roll my eyes when Harry, usually in Slytherin, gets a snake familiar and then grandstands and says 'if any of you mess with me she will bite you and kill you!'. And all the people were cowed and wept bitterly at their ruin. When all I can think is a school teaching magic might offer those other students the means to say levitate it, burn, cut it, vanish it etc. I somehow doubt it requires the combined efforts of several trained wizards to put one down like a dragon.
