I think Dumbledore can understand parseltongue, probably through his research. Maybe just not speak it.

And Ron had been shown mimicking voices before he got into the CoS. Might've taken him awhile but with having heard it so recently he may have been able to guess it correctly.

Or maybe he insulted the stone snake's mother and it opened up. :p
