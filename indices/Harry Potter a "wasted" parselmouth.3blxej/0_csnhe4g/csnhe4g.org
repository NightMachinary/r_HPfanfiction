What do you envision him doing with this ability? I guess I can see him ordering snakes to spy on or bite people he doesn't like, but I don't know how effective that would be in practice. (He has no shortage of spying tools available to him, and wizards are more resilient than muggles, anyway.)

I guess he could have tried to command the basilisk, which would have been something.
