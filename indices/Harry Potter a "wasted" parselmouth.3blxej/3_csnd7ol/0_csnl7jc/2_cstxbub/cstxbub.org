It wasn't special in anyway. Until the dueling club incident, he had no idea that it wasn't just something that wizards could do. In the aftermath, when Ron is explaining things to him, he makes it pretty clear that he thought everybody could do it.

Also, in the grand scheme of things, its a pretty unimpressive power even if everybody else can do it. Harry was like 10-12 in the time before he knew about the stigma. In this time, he learns about the entire wizarding world. Basically, he had other stuff going on, and in all likelihood forgot he could do it (or at the very least didn't mention it because he thought everybody else could as well).
