Reboot by Kallanit has Harry, Hermione, and Snape go back in time. Snape goes back to the day he first met Petunia and Lily. Petunia does not end up with Vernon. And Snape does not join the deatheaters eg he's good. Now Hermione did put Draco down because her house was of the peerage and had been in Britainway before the Malfoys have left france.

However, I don't recall any lines like you referenced in your OP. The story is just shy of 290K words and I thought it was a decent read.
