I just have an aversion to badly written fanfic romance, so this is something I've spent some time looking for as well. Any sort of first year AU is probably good for you here. But this category fits a bunch of my top-10 fics.

The first couple books of linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) have no romance.

I'd recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) - the premise makes it hard to do romance here, considering the AU society and the protagonist's situation. Through the 4 current books there has not been foreground romance.

There's no romance in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) but there are sexually provocative scenes and a lot of violence. One of my favorite fics though.

IIRC linkffn(Forging the Sword) was abandoned before any romance subplot happens - one of the very best fics out there.

linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) is a first year story, so it's pretty aromantic as well.
