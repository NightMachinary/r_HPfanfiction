Basically everything that happened in the 6th book with Draco's assassination attempts. What if Harry decided to talk with Professor Slughorn the next day? What if Katie Bell wasn't wearing gloves (thus leading her to be fully cursed by the necklace)? What if Katie didn't argue with her friend (thus leading to the necklace being possibly delivered to Dumbledore)?
