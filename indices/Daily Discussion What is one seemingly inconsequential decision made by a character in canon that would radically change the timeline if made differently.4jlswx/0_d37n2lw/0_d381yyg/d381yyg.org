It would be interesting to have the triwizard proceed as it should have. Then it should happen again in Harry's seventh year, if they go by the every three years tournament schedule. It would be an interesting way for a fic to let Harry have enough time to train properly for Voldemort, but not reach into time travel. Voldemort could even try for the same resurrection plan, just delayed 3 years due to the lack of a ready servant.
