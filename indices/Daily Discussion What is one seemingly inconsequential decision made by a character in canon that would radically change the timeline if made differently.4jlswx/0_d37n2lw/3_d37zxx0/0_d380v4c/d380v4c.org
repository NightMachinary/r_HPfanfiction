I doubt you even read my post thoroughly:

- I said Moody would leave after his term was finished.

- Umbridge only showed up at Hogwarts because of the TWT disaster and subsequent disagreement over Voldemort's return. With that year ending peacefully, the Ministry had no reason and no authority to mess around with Dumbledore.

- I also said that Voldemort was stuck in Albania, why would there be a Ministry battle if he didn't even have a body?
