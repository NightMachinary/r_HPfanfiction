Dumbles not being his puppeteering self (and/or Dumbles being more interested in Harry's health while at the Dursleys) and not leaving him at the fucking Dursleys because he takes McGonagalls (in canon "inconsequential") warning more seriously...I mean that would change Harry's outlook on the world (him being raised differently and all - hell, he might grow some sense of self-worth (meaning that sacrificing himself for others might not be his first impulse all the damned time)) - everything would change from there on out IMHO!
