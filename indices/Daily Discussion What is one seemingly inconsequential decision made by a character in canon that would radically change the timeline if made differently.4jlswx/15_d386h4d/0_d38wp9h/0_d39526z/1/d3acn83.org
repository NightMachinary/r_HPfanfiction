The guy (who's an asshole, just as bad as Snape - but unlike Snape he's not honest enough to show it, he plays the benevolent grandfather while plotting and scheming behind the scenes!) doesn't deserve his name (and seriously: Voting someone down because his or her opinion doesn't match your own is quite infantile) not being ridiculed (I mean you can say "I'll pull a Dumbledore on this one" and people will most likely understand that you will not tell them jack shit about something after all)

IMHO the guy deserves scorn (!), it's him who put Harry with the Dursleys without checking up on him (out of sight, out of mind more or less -.-), he's also the one who lets bullying (by students, but also by teachers and I am not only talking about Harry either, I am talking about Luna and also Slytherin house as a whole (note: Yes, much of it is probably fanon, but even in canon you get the vibe that Slytherin isn't well liked and it's canon that the twins (from hell) love to prank Slytherins)) happen in his school, he hires crappy teachers (DADA!), he allows newspapers to slander Harry (he should have spoken up against that...he didn't, hell he distanced himself from Harry with a very stupid justification), he doesn't believe in giving Harry extra training (those "Tom-Lessons" were the dumbest thing ever...all of that crap could have been summed up in under half an hour - with the exception of Slughorn's memory maybe!)

Yeah, love potions, Harry being gay, Snape being his dad etc. that's fanon, but what I wrote above is fact!
