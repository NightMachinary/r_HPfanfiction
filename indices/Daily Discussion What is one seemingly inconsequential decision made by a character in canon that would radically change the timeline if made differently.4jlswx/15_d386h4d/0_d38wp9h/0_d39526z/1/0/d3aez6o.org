By your own admission, what you consider a "seemingly inconsequential decision" is to completely rewrite what you see as the canon Dumbledore figure. In other words, you've just proved my point about not addressing the OP's question.

I voted you down because not only did you ignore the OP question in order to soapbox, but also because you resorted to infantile name-calling instead of just making your point (which wasn't much of one in the context of the discussion). Were I to refer to you by the appellation 'Laxative,' would you not agree that it would add nothing to what I say and would serve only to bait hostile responses? Would it not make the tone less amiable and more confrontational?

Engage with ideas and I'll respond with same even if (especially if) I disagree. Resort to lazy name-calling (Dumbles, Dumblefuck, Dumbleass, Ginslut, Ginbitch, MoRon, The Ginger Retard, Umbitch, Longass, etc.) and I'll just downvote and move on.
