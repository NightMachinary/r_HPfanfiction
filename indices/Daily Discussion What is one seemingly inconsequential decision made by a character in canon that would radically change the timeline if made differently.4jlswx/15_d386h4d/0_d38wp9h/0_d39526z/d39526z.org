"Dumbles" followed by a rambling post baits readers into down votes. That the post doesn't attempt to answer the question ("one seemingly inconsequential decision"), but rather seems to push a fanon agenda, pretty much assures it.

If you're going to answer with this sort of nonsense, then go all the way:

"What if Harry were no longer a closeted homosexual and let Draco know his feelings for him from the start?"

"What if Ginny and Molly weren't dosing Harry with love potions?"

"What if Ron and Hermione weren't in the employ of 'Dumbfuckles' and ordered to befriend Harry?"

"What if Snape told Harry early on that he was his father?"

(And whatever other fanon nonsense you care to add.)
