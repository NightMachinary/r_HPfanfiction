I didn't upvote any of those you mention, but I do choose to downvote any instance of "Dumbles" (or other variants of bashing) that I come across. That's how I roll. I don't make a secret of this.

Anyone who doesn't respect canon enough to use the actual names of characters or accept that they are characters in a seven-novel series (and thus have to have some depth of character to be at all interesting) probably doesn't have a whole lot to offer the forum. And if they do, a few downvotes here and there probably won't make much difference to them in the long run.
