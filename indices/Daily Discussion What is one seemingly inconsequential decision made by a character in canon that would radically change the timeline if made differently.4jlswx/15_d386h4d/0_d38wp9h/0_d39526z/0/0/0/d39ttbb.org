Amazing. That we're here means we're fans of Harry Potter the book itself, with a couple of gripes here and there about certain characters. No one is everyone's favourite character. Everyone's got something to say.

But you, fanatical and judgmental, get to point at us and say "you guys don't have anything to offer us, not intelligent discussion really, because you don't like the character I like, and have reduced him to something I disagree with which means you're wrong -- and oh yeah by the way you're bashing because I said so -- so get out of here."

Gladly.
