The names we use set the tone for the discussion and some are just not conducive to a productive one. "Dumbles," "Dumbledork," "MoRon," "Ginslut," etc. almost never occur in a post that has much to offer the forum, rather like the clever folk peppering their posts with "Bernistas," "Screeching Harpy," or "Democrat Party" over in [[/r/politics]].

And in the end, a solitary downvote is about the mildest form of admonishment one could possibly receive. Talk about overreaction.
