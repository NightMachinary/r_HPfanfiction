I rather think that Lexian's reply to your previous comment answers this one and puts Pers in a more positive light there. He mistakes canon and fanon and doesn't truly seem to want to actually contribute to the discussion but instead to make others see that Dumbledore is all that he sees him as just because he sees him that way.

Is it possible that he is not actually doing that? Sure, it is. But so far the tone of the message (set by the words “Dumbles not being his puppeteering self”) and the intent (shown in his other message) seem to line up and the image they show is ... not positive and makes me think that Pers's decision to downvote is the right one in this case when the message itself is not actually on topic anyway.

So I very much don't think it a form of fanaticism. Could it be that he is jaded? Sure, it is a possibility. But not fanaticism.
