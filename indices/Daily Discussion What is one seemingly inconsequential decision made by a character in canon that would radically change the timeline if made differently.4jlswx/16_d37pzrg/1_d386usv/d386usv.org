You're getting downvotes because nothing of that is true.

First, it wasn't a murder, Harry's soul wasn't split. At worst it was self-defence, and at best an accident. Even if Harry's soul had been damaged, the blood ritual does not even come close to the horcrux ritual and would not have ever split. The reason he survived is that Harry was already a horcrux, seeing how he had a piece of Voldemort's soul in his scar. This was a huge point in the story, I don't really know how you're confusing it with something else. I don't recall it even being explicitly said that Harry's blood anchored his soul to Voldemort, though there were hints so I guess I can excuse it a little bit.

As for the story itself, say the teachers kill Quirrel without any losses, and therefore everything else is equal, Voldemort still uses Harry's blood in the ritual granting him protection even though he doesn't know he needs it, therefore Harry still survives the second AK and defeats Voldemort. But most importantly, lacking a confrontation with the Big Bad in the first book, no triumphs for the main character, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone loses out on almost all of the praise the real book got, is flopped by the publisher and the series never even gets off the ground, whereas most of the other suggestions in this thread result in a decent story regardless.
