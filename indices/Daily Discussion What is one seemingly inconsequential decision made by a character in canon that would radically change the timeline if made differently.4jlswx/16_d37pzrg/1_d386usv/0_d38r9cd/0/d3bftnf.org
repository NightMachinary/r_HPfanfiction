Nobody /in the book/ knows exactly why Harry survived, Dumbledore included. He is making guesses about love and blood and stuff, guesses that are not wholly inaccurate, but in the end he doesn't know either.

Might it be that? Sure, it might very well be. But it could also be the effect of the hallows united under one master, or it could be a combination of the two or even something else entirely. /We/ know which it is, he doesn't.

And Harry attempting to stop Quirrel from killing him is just that, an attempt to stop someone from harming him that had more of an effect because of a factor he did not know about. He did not actually desire for the man to die, let alone think about murdering him, so there is no way their meeting in the first book could result in Tom in any way being Harry's horcrux.
