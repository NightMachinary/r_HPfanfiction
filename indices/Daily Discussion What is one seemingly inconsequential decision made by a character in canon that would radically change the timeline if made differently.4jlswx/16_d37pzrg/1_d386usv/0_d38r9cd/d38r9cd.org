dumbledore told him that the blood and the protection are what are protecting him from dying, so he can go back. i'm pretty sure that is all that was said about him surviving. in the same way that he just 'had a bit of voldi power in his scar' for years, and it turns out to be a bit of soul. i just got downvoted because they like the opposite fannon ideas.

that aside, the general point was the only important one. if harry hadn't killed quirinus quirrell himself, what would happen.
