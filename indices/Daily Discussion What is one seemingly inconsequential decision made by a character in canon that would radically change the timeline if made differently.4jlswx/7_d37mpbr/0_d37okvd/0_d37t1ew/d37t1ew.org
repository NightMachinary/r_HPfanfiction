The Daily Prophet thing is probably my choice. Nothing else appears as inconsequential, nothing else has such lucky timing IMO. What if Fudge didn't bring the paper? What if he had the day before's paper? What if Sirius didn't ask for it? What if Sirius didn't like crosswords? What if Sirius only did the crossword and didn't care to read that tiny article on the Weasleys?

Moral of the story: always do the crossword.
