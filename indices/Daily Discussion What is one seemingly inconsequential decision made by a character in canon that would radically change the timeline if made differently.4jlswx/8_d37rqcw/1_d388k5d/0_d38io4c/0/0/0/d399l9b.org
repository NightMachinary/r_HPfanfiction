I disagree about that. I think just the act of ensuring that T.M. Riddle's diary went to Hogwarts, with Lucius knowing fully well that it would ensure a lot of harm and damage [though whether or not he was aware that Muggle-borns would be petrified due to it], was a "political gain" for Lucius.

I would argue that Lucius's prime target, despite what we are led to believe, was not actually Arthur Weasley. Malfoy disliked Arthur, yes, but there is someone much more politically influential whom he disliked far more: Albus Dumbledore. Compared to Arthur, Dumbledore posed much more of a "threat" to Lucius, and, in turn, the return of Lucius's master, Lord Voldemort.

Compared to Dumbledore as a target, Arthur would have been petty for Lucius Malfoy. Indeed, in /Chamber of Secrets/, Malfoy had near-total control over the Hogwarts board by threatening, blackmailing, or otherwise bribing the other board members. As seen in /Chamber of Secrets/, Lucius's main goal seemed to be getting rid of Dumbledore as Headmaster, something which would have happened anyways, regardless of which student had the Diary, as long as the Diary made it to Hogwarts.

For Lucius, I think he merely slipped the Diary into Ginny's cauldron during a moment of opportunity.

  What advantage is there to be gained in that area by killing Hermione?

As I posted in my other reply, Lucius was already irritated and upset that Hermione was besting his Pureblood son, Draco, in all academic fields. By getting rid of Hermione, it would not only rid the school of another Muggle-born, something which Lucius already likely planned to do with the planting of the Diary at Hogwarts, but also move his son closer to to the top of the class. It would also send a "message" to other Muggle-born students, to "put them in their proper place".
