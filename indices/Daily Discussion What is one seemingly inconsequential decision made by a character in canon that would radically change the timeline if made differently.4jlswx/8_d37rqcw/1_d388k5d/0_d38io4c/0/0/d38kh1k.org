It doesn't give him the political gain, like it would if Arthur got fired, so no.

Remember, this all started when Arthur wanted to pass a Muggle protection law. Lucius didn't want this, so he decided to try and discredit him.

Personally, I think targeting Hermione would be too petty for Lucius. The man is a rich, political figure. What advantage is there to be gained in that area by killing Hermione?

I just realized by the way: it's "killing two /birds/ with one stone" isn't it? Sorry for the poor English.
