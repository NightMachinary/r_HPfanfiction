Or, on the other hand, Lucius Malfoy slipping the Diary into Hermione's belongings, instead of Ginny's. On a re-read of the chapter in /Chamber of Secrets/, from Harry's perspective upon eavesdropping on the Malfoys in Borgin & Burke's, it seems like Lucius dislikes Hermione enough already for that to have been a possibility. What better way to eliminate "that pesky Mudblood" than to give her T.M. Riddle's Diary?
