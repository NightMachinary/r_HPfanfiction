I will say that I tried to read that one and eventually got tired of the characters just...not talking like actual humans. Like if a 15 yo kid has had zero therapy and lots of trauma, they aren't going to meet a stranger and suddenly spout out exactly why a certain behavior made them feel XYZ. Then the other characters very robotically answer, "Oh, I didn't know that. I will completely change all of my behavior! Thank you!"
