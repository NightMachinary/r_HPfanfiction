You should check out The Fall of The Phoenix by IfIOnlyWereAWeasley linkffn(11304085) It takes place at Hogwarts but with the next gen kids (not the ones from CC) and a bunch of OCs. It goes into some "Egyptian magic" and "creatures" and recently it's looking like it's going to go into some "Greek magic" as well.
