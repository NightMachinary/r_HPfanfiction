While they are not the main characters in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), they do have some nice appearances later in the story, when their true identities are revealed. The rest of the story is a great Harry/Ginny romance.

For someone who generally doesn't read romances, I enjoyed this fic tremendously.
