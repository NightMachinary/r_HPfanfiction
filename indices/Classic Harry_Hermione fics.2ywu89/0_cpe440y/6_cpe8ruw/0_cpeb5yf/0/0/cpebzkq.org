Oh, sorry about the misunderstanding then.

Actually, I put 'Romance fics' in the header as a catch all term. The only ones I would call straight up romances are Vox Corporis, Unlike a Sister, and Fulfilling Obligations. (And even then, Vox Corporis is generally regarded as the best romantic fanfic ever written, so you should give it a chance.)

The rest actually have a huge variety, ranging from a post-apocalyptic thriller (Resistance) to a surreal comedy (Champion's Champion).

And I definitely tried to stay away from nonsensical fluff. The romance is naturally integrated into most of the stories.
