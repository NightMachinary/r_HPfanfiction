I know they are not terribly popular or well thought of on [[/r/hpfanfiction]], but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][Robst]] writes almost exclusively H/Hr with some H/HR/LL thrown in for good measure.

The big criticism of Robst is that the stories tend to be very trope heavy as well as fairly formulaic and many of the older stories simply have not aged well. Other than that they are not terribly written (some of the older stories have some rough spots) and they are often at least complete.
