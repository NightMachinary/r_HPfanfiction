You should read ASOIAF again. Even when some people like Tywin turn around power (which I put here as Lucius)... that's not the deal with Brienne, Jaime or Arya.

It's hard to replicate the isolated refugee thing for Arya... But Draco seemed fitting for Jaime... who deals with honor and self-image.

Even in power there are many shades. Euron is not craving the same kind of political power Tywin has. Euron seeks a more otherworldly kind of power for himself, not some family name or institution. And he kind of control he wants to exert and fear he wants to provoke are more personal in nature. He could do wonders with Voldemort's skills and followers.

Ramsay likes a more physical sort of power. Not in paper but directly to feel a people's life and pleas on his fingers. He doesn't need the followers, but would love Umbridge's kind of localized power. And the blood quill.
