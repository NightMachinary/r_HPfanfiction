Would they keep their HP counterparts memories then? Otherwise I have no clue of how they would be able to catch up to fifth year level, let alone the adults with magically intensive jobs like Tonks, and on the subject, what about the magic they /do/ have originally from ASOIF? Like, Arya's face-stealing, or Jon's warging (or his and Dany's affinity to dragons? Would it even cross considering that the type of dragons are different between universes?)
