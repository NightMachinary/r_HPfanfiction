Linkffn(Wind-Shear) has Harry as an adult time traveller who goes back to the time of Bellatrix (and the Mauraders) and teaches at Hogwarts.

Its very good and definitely worth a read.

Edit - sorry I miss-read the request, he's not DADA professor while he is a student.

I'll leave it up just in case you or anyone else fancies reading it though.
