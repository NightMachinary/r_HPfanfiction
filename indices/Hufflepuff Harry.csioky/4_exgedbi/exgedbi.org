The secret of a Hufflepuff Harry is to make him interesting. BajaB did that by making Harry the hardest working Lazy kid in the world. I did it by putting a Sinanju trained Assassin Harry in with the 'Puffs.

I've been playing with one where Sprout grows all kinds of interesting plants in her greenhouses... Plants that come in handy at the legendary 'Puff parties, where it turns out the 'Puffs share EVERYTHING (and orgies ensue) though Harry tends to be dating a 'Puff and turns out to be the last one in the castle to find out about 'Puff parties and becomes The Man Who Was Molested.

Just make it different enough to attract attention.
