Oof, yeah those issues were all my bad. Basically, the drawing was more...ambient movements. Nothing specific, just him paying his respect. Lutain was with Skylar because where else would he go? Who would take care of him for now? Lutain has to make sure that Skylar fulfills his end anyways. Lutain being alone would be far too cruel in my eyes. Lutain isn't a Horcrux, he was hit by a killing curse in the final battle (by Voldemort)
