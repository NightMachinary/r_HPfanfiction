This answer changes depending on a few things- namely the genre, story, and length of the chapter itself.

For Antithesis, I spent on average 2-3 hours to write a solid 4K in a single sitting. For other stories where I'm aiming for 7K per chapter or more, it can range anywhere from 4 hours to 6 hours of work. Normally when chapters are of that length, I tend to split them up into multiple work periods, either divided throughout the day (interspersing writing with schoolwork and studying) or two consecutive days.

When writing angst, tragedy, or possibly sensitive topics, I tend to add on an additional...I'd say half hour per chapter of work. Either because I'm pausing to phrase things a particular way, or to consult my information document to make sure that my information is accurate.

When writing humour, or more of the 'slap happy' style stories, I tend to finish these in 3 hours maximum, however I /may/ touch back on them and elaborate. This generally is for oneshots, however if I'm working on a chapter story I'll spend around 4 hours per chapter just to assure that the balance is right.

Outside of writing the chapter, I spend probably...2 to 3 days ahead of time thinking about how I want the chapter to run. Similar to trying to recall the exact plot of a movie, I frequently flip or move scenes around mentally well before I sit down to write. Even if i'm not writing, thinking about the next chapter or even talking about it to a friend or an interested pet is a sure fire way to improve your writing speed and ability, since you know it inside and out already. If you have a timeline, it's super helpful to keep it open next to your story so you can write concurrently to reading what you already had planned. For Antithesis, my timeline was 22 pages.

For larger stories, I also compile an information document which I constantly refer throughout my entire writing process. This is where I keep information like...the proper spelling for spells, or the exact series of events in the canon books. I'll shove in information on seasonal weather temperature averages, the average amount of snow in Scotland per year, a map of London so I can accurately describe realistic walking times, or the proper treatment/first hand accounts of various mental disorders. I take this information gathering very seriously, and on average tend to gather two pages per chapter of relevant information.

I'm checking back in my document right now just to confirm, and my information document for Antithesis is just under 142 pages.
