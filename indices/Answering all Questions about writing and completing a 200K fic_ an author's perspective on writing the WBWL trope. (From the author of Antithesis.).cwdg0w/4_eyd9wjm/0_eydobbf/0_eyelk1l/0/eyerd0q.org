I do! Which is the main reason there are some horrible spelling and grammatical errors throughout.

I tried using beta readers, even managing to have around 7 of them at one time, but they all dropped off quickly or the quality of work was more praise and less criticism. I tend to bounce ideas off one person who is my “editor” in a teasing way, although she never hard edited any of my chapters since she was a reader. My works now tend to be a little bit more filtered and combed over for errors.
