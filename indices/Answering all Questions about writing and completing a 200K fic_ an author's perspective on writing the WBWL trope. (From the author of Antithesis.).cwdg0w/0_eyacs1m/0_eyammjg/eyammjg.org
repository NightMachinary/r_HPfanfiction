Oh this is a loaded question, I'll try my best!

I personally have learned the impact and sway that Fanfiction has on people worldwide. It is...impossible to describe. There is a heartbreaking level of pain and wonder and loss that so many nameless faceless people experience daily. I felt that...as an author, I had almost a moral obligation to myself and to others, that if I were to put a character through and sort of pain or suffering I then had to grip them tight and haul them right back out. When you read a story, you find pieces of yourself echoed in the characters. Things that are shared- the same favourite colour, the same name, the same birthday. When a character is written with trauma or abuse or mental illness, there are always going to be individuals that then read your work and assume the role of your characters. If you hurt your character, you will hurt someone. Authors of all sort have this magical truly amazing gift, because we have an /opportunity/, to say the things someone can't. To offer help or optimism or positivity in a form that someone can't reach. When you take a character and put them through hell, you have the /opportunity to drag someone else back out with you./

I don't know if I've ever touched someone's heart, or helped soothe their pain or grief or sorrows. I don't know, but I feel blessed and so grateful that this is one thing I can do. If I can make one person sleep easier with less chaos in their mind, then I feel that it is worth it.
