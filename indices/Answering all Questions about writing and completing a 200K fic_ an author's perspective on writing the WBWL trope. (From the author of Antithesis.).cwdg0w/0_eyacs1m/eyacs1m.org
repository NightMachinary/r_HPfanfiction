This post is thoughtful of you!

I haven't read your stories, but from what I've seen on this sub, the most frequent praise for Antithesis is for how it managed to draw out intense feelings from the readers. I'd like to hear whatever thoughts or advice you want to share on hitting emotional notes, and in general instilling the feelings you want the reader to feel.
