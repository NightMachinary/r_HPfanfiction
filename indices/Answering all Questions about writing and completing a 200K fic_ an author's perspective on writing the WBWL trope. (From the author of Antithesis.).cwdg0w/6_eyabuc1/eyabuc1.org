WBWL fics are bad because they're built around a fanon trope. We don't know much about Lily and James except they loved each other and they loved Harry unconditionally. We certainly don't know how it would have turned out if they survived and Harry and his "brother" lived to tell the tale, even more if one of them happened to be "the chosen one", which is retarded because in the end it was Lily the one who destroyed Voldemort, not a baby. You have to turn off your brain in order to enjoy WBWL stories because it's simply stupid to think such scenario would happen, but I don't think that's bad, it's popular and some people enjoy this niche, it's just simply impossible for me to enjoy and actually "believe" this can happen.

Now, about your story. I read it and I couldn't get past the part where Bella becomes Harry's mum. Why? Because I didn't feel I was reading about Harry's story anymore. He has another name, he didn't look like him, he didn't speak, act or behaved like him. If I were to open the story at some random chapter without reading the previous I wouldn't know Adrian was actually him, and that's a no-no for me. The only way I believe Harry would be part of Voldemort's group was if he was literally brainwashed and his memory were erased, simply as that. Your story is not badly written, not at all, but it certainly revolves around tropes, overuse of angst where there shouldn't be none, OOC character and lack of real focus beside making Harry angry and edgy for being ignored by his parents. I read HP fanfic to try to imagine what Harry would do during certain scenarios, not go over a complete rewrite where he's not himself in any way, shape or form.
