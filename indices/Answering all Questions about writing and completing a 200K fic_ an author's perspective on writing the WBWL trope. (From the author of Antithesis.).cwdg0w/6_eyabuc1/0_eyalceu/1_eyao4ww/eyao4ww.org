But it's true, though? OOC stories are badly written stories in my opinion. Harry can be shaped in many ways and it's totally okay as long as it makes sense, it's a gradual chance and it moves the plot forwards, instead of it happening because the plot demands it.

I don't really like canon, I feel like many characters were misused, others were not used enough and many were left open with tons of little things to add. I don't ask for a 1/1 copy of canon in fanfics, but I do like stories where there's a /believable/ plot and characterization where characters can truly develop and chance in different ways while still feeling like I'm reading a HP story. When I read this story, and many others WBWL stories, I can't get behind Lily and James neglecting Harry, James can definitely have the BWL is favourite, but I can't simply read a story where they suddenly fawn over all Harry's twin and make Harry live with the Dursleys(Jesus, how original) while they are the perfect exemplar family. Why not give him to another member in the Order? A friend of the Potters? Oh yes, because Harry needs to be absolutely miserable in order the become the ultimate victim. Same thing with Harry, by the time he went under all the ritual or whatever it was I don't remember by Bella, he simply was not Harry Potter anymore for me. It was like reading a OC character wearing Harry's skin(and not even that because I remember he looked different) and acting absolutely nothing like Harry.

This is my opinion, and I'm not trying to insult anyone, but I feel like saying this because I honestly don't think this fic is good.
