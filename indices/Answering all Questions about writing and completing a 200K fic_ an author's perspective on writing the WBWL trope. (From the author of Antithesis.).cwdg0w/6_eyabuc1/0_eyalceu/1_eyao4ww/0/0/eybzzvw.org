(Standard disclaimer: this is mostly my perspective and I want to stress the fact that I recognize and value your unique ideas and opinions. I'm not trying to change your mind, I only want to provide my own insights.)

I think, that the definition of OOC (Out of Character) is heavily reliant on the foundation of what that character is. For most fanfiction, when written in a severe AU such as modern AU, or Coffee Shop AU, the character is removed and placed in such a setting where the original personality is altered. This means, that in most forms of standardized AU, all characters are in some way, OOC. The difference is the author's ability to show clear concise reasoning as to how that character got there. How did these different variables lead to this? How has the shift from canon to something else changed the fundamentals of what you're writing?

With my story, I shifted the foundations to attempt to show a clear realistic interpretation of depression, mental illness, and other traumatic content. I recognize and I acknowledge that the Harry Potter in my story /is out of character./ I recognize that other characters, such as what we know about Lily and James, are also /out of character./ My intentions behind writing the story weren't to perfectly capture the canon personalities, but my goal was to write a realistic tragedy that individuals with trauma could relate to. Did I succeed? Maybe. Is the story still painful and awkward to read at the start due to the cringe? Oh completely. I only started to address the story seriously towards the later chapters once I realized how quickly it had gained attention. The story isn't fantastic, and I know if I put all my effort into it, it could be much better- but I am still proud of it regardless.

  I don't really like canon, I feel like many characters were misused, others were not used enough and many were left open with tons of little things to add. I don't ask for a 1/1 copy of canon in fanfics, but I do like stories where there's a /believable/ plot and characterization where characters can truly develop and chance in different ways while still feeling like I'm reading a HP story.

That's good! I'm sure that many people share the same thinking pattern. This sort of perspective and opinion is what leads and inspires so many people to write their own story, spinning their own plotline that becomes some of the greatest foundations for stories. If you don't see something, or have yet to find something you love wholeheartedly- then /make it./ If you want this, then someone else does as well.

  This is my opinion, and I'm not trying to insult anyone, but I feel like saying this because I honestly don't think this fic is good.
#+end_quote

I 100% respect that. I actually really enjoy talking to the people who don't like my story. They offer the best sort of critique and elaboration that then helps me find the proper channels to write something /better./ You helped me comprehend why you personally didn't like my story, which I am incredibly thankful for. I won't be rewriting Antithesis (god knows a rewrite of a rewrite would be /chaos/), but that doesn't mean that I won't be writing /more./ Having this help means that my future stories will be just a little bit better, and I will always improve the smallest bit more.

  In terms of the fic, I also was not a huge fan. I liked the premise a lot, but I agree with you there were a lot of holes. Especially after Harry got abducted from the orphanage.

I always joke and tease myself that my ideas and concepts are good, but the execution always falls short. A lot of gaps and problems that more attention, focus, patience, and a good editor (or someone to smack me with a newspaper for silly plot spirals) could have helped me wonders.

#+begin_quote
  I generally don't see a problem with an author starting the fic with a wildly OOC character, provided the story then unfolds naturally from there.
#+end_quote

I could entirely be wrong- but I think this is an individuals like or distaste for classical literature. Stories that start off following canon heavily and stay true to canon characters are a....traditional fanfiction (?) perspective, whereas stories which start with an OOC character or with OC's tend to favour or lean more towards traditional literature. It's the difference of starting a story and expecting it to stay true to Harry Potter, or starting a story with an open mind and anticipating an entirely new book that is /inspired/ by Harry Potter.

  I would hesitate to call these all bad fics, solely because they have characters that are very different from canon.

I like to say, especially new writers who are insecure or unsure of their beginning steps in writing, that you can look at any work of literature or writing and learn something from it. Even stories that are 'bad' or 'weak' can still be used as a tool. Generally, you find /something/ that inspires you; a single line that sticks in your head, or a plot twist you never anticipated. You can learn something from /anyone,/ even if you dislike their work. I never brush aside new inexperienced writers, because they have ideas and thoughts that deserve to be heard and can help my work even if it seems like otherwise. I can agree that some stories are of less quality compared to others, but I wouldn't call them bad. I'd prefer calling them /weak,/ because bad has such a connotation that devalues stories and authors and really hurts people if phrased poorly.
