It's alright! Honest! Everyone is completely justified for their own opinions and perspectives. I take no offence at all for why one person may dislike my story. That being said, I /did/ mention my note at the bottom of my post where I stated to be polite. Although I take no offence there may be others that do, and I never want any fighting because of something I've made. I want this post to be a nice welcoming place where anyone can ask any questions!
