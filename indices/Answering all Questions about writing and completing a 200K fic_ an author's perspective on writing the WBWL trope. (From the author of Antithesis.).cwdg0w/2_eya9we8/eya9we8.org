How do you deal with the issue of coming up with an original premise for a WBWL fic that's hundreds of thousands of words long? Especially with all negative connotation with WBWL and all the tropes.

Also, I read your story and while I did finish it and enjoyed objectively --- I felt a lot of it was overly angsty and it turned me off a bit as a reader. I came in reading it during the beginning thinking I'd be reading a dark dystopian fic where eventually Voldemort won and Harry would eventually come into his own as a sort of heartless general but it suddenly took a right turn towards the whole Barty Crouch Jr. scene where I, as previously stated, felt it became too angsty in a lot of parts.
