My original idea for writing is to investigate famous cliches and try to alter them in such a way, that they are somehow different. I've learned in recent months that this is a personal stylistic choice known as deconstructionism literature, but eh I hadn't known that at the time. There's a reason why WBWL stories are famous, and a reason why people don't like them. Just as a portion of the population will always enjoy the stories, guilty pleasure or not, people will always dislike them as well. To get past the negative connotations is to think about why you're writing. If the opinions of others or your readers alters your style or ideas to that degree, then your own plotting or brainstorming ability is constantly at jeopardy and is unstable to follow precisely. You can't ignore the cliches and tropes, but you can pick and choose the ones you want, and explore why you like them or why you don't.

All ideas for WBWL are inherently original simply because everyone writes differently. If you want to be original, find one thing or maybe two things that really stick out to you, and shift it ever so slightly. Give your character a nervous tic that comes into play later. Give your character an uncommon friend, subvert expectations by not writing relationships at all, or better yet come up with something new. Writers and authors are amazing people, but the moment they write to appease someone else and not for themselves, that's when stories become abandoned. Don't lose your spark- wrote the story that /you want to read/, and someone else will love it just as much.

Thank you so much for reading through my work! I always want to stress how proud I am of everyone that takes the effort and marches through those chapters. Readers that only make a handful of chapters are still so admirable and I wish more recognition was given for those who take on the challenge of such a large story. Antithesis has flaws, yet I am so so proud of it because I have learned /so much/ from writing it. Now I only want to help anyone else who needs it in any way I can!
