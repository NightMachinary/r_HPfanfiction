One of my fav things about your fic was the ending. Don't get me wrong, it was also terrible and tragic and left me an emotional wreck with so many Feels, but all of those things together is what really left a mark on me.

My question is, how much planning went into the ending? Like, sometimes I'll get a great idea for a fic (sometimes a wbwl trope) but I don't know how to develop the idea into a proper story with an ending, so I just end up writing a scene or two and leave it in the archives. Also, did you plan for your fic to be that long, or was it just something that happened as you plotted?
