This is a really good question!

When writing a very long story, regardless of how much time and effort you put into an outline or timeline, you will almost always deviate from it in some way or form. I know a few authors that stick nearly perfectly to their original plotline with only a few significant changes. Personally, I almost write canon-divergences of my timelines when drafting new chapters. It gets to specific points where I decide not to finish one way, or lose inspiration and try something else. I also impulsively add a lot of content before posting which tends to shift the outline. Some people then adjust their outline (the author of /Sum of Their Parts/ and I have discussed this in depth) so they have an accurate blueprint forward, whereas others tend to...improvise with a firm direction in mind.

A lot of times for longer stories, I personally have only a rough idea for how a story will end. This rough idea is still drafted enough that I can work with it, but not so concrete that it restricts my ending. Longer stories generally demand some form of conclusion or a concrete ending, so I plan from there. Concrete endings in Harry Potter almost /always/ involve confronting Voldemort, or finishing the war. I figure how I want that to go, which side, or if I'm too indecisive (which I was for Antithesis) I start writing and adjust as I go with the knowledge in mind.

When writing the story, I had a well structured document for deadlines- by a specific chapter I had to have finished a certain school year/book. Other times, I would write one or two sentences for what I wanted to accomplish in that chapter and then write until I had managed it. This was really important for me towards the end, for reasons I'll explain.

This is where the ridiculous exhaustion of Antithesis really kicks into gear.

Antithesis is 80 Chapters (81 counting the Epilogue). This number was chosen, for /no reason/ other than one day, when I was around Chapter 64 or so (in that range), a reader asked me when the story was going to end. I, like an absolute /fool,/ responded "why not on October 31st? That's symbolic!" The stupidity, is that this was in the summer months (I can't recall the exact date but I'll estimate around middle of June) so I had the sudden realization that I now had to write 16 Chapters in roughly 4 months. That doesn't seem too bad, except for I had /not planned for the story to finish in 16 chapters./

I generally write each chapter in a single sitting, split screen with my information document on one side and the story on the other. It takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to write a single chapter, however depending on how much research I need to do for sensitive subjects it can take much longer. Antithesis was...a wild ride.

[Spoilers]

This is even more amusing with context, because Chapter 64 is the part of Part 4 or the "Lone Wolf" arc. I also jumped around and determined that the final chapter titles should be labeled after the stages of grief. Chapters 76 - 80 are named Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance in that order. I wanted to be more symbolic (in hindsight I really screwed myself over), and have each of the final chapters actually focus on that specific stage of grief as well. This took away 5 chapters from my 16 chapters left, where I could unscramble the knot that is the plot line, and finish the story. From Chapter 64, I had 11 Chapters to finish and work out every loose end and plot event as well as finish the character arcs, and finish the story in 4 months. I believe that my chapter update speed towards the end was every 2 weeks, then in September and October I was updating a complete chapter every 5-7 days. Almost all of the ending was NOT originally what I had in mind, in fact the entire Great Hall Scene was entirely unscripted, and I figured out how to finally finish that plot arc roughly 2 days before I posted it. I was running and sprinting through chaos like the creators of South Park trying to churn out a new episode every week. The only scene I had vividly imagined and kept in the last arc, was Skylar and Adrian standing side by side in the last few chapters.

Ironically, I planned for Antithesis to be /longer./ It was the fact it gained so much popularity unexpectedly that drove me to finish the story and write better. That's why there is a /huge/ difference in quality of writing from the first half of the story compared to the second half. I tend to get inspiration while walking my dog, so I was taking two walks a day and the poor girl was exhausted every night. I carried sticky notes and scribbled anything that came to me- specific lines that sounded beautiful, a dynamic or phrase, and even dictated out loud while driving in to university to make sure I could look through all of my subconscious ideas later. The route from start to end for Antithesis was a poor Mapquest line frantically trying to find our way to the destination. We were in Rollercoaster Tycoon letting the computer finish our rollercoaster for us /while we were riding it./

If you have a specific scene in mind, a common technique I use is working backwards. Is the scene inside a forest? Perfect! That means, that just before it, your characters had to get /to/ the forest. That meant that they had to realize they wanted to /go/ to the forest. For that, you had to somehow bring up the conversation point prior to that to get the realization. This little backwards walking has already fleshed out how I structured chapters. I'd start it with something basic, casual events or actions, maybe a conversation which then triggers some good old internal monologue, then a nice pondering and the idea of the forest comes up. Throw in some doubt, then reaffirm that going to the forest would be good. Detail getting ready to go, how they would manage it without being caught. Describe sneaking out, describe finally getting there....and /now/ you write your original scene.

Please let me know if you're confused at all! I have my personal document that I used to write Antithesis, and simply for the safety of not spreading spoilers I'm not posting examples from it. If you're still curious or would like to know more, I'd happily talk one-on-one with you about the precise steps I took, especially since I still have all of the documents.
