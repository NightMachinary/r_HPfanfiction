I knew i'd get this question! You're going to love my answer, it's so silly. I came up with the idea for Shadowed Malice (the poorly written “prequel” to Antithesis) when I was 11, and unfortunately I learned that if I had been born a male, my parents would have assigned my name as Skylar. This, combined with the natural edgy-ness only a child can possess, was the reason I landed on such a horrible name. Also, 11 year old me had the creative naming skills on par with a codfish. Antithesis is my attempt to rewrite Shadowed Malice in a cohesive logical story, yet I kept the horrible name as both irony, and homage to one of the first fan fictions I ever wrote and what guided me down this path. It served as a constant reminder to myself over how far I had come, and also, simply put, it made me smile to have such an obvious reminder of how much I've grown. Thank you, bad baby names.
