Define Like. In terms of pairing, premise or execution. It has the best concept of time travel in my opinion in terms of the superimposition of identities and is pretty unique.

In terms of a badass Harry going back in time and becoming a DADA teacher there's a couple. Wind Shear by Chilord is probably the best of the bunch.

In terms of Harry time travelling and taking Teddy back with him, I havent seen many if those. JacobApples has a few other good fics as well so you should check them out.
