Its part of writing. I write novels in my free time and one of my greatest problem is that I struggle with character deaths. I don't want to kill characters I painstakingly "rose" from a name to this complex, intricate fictional person, even if it would make a great scene - or get the protagonist to really grow/change through the loss.

But on the other side, they are, technically, immortal. Miss 'em? Go back a few pages and there they are, forever "alive" in your text.

And you get the chance for another character to get attached to. A different story, a different set of people, a different adventure.
