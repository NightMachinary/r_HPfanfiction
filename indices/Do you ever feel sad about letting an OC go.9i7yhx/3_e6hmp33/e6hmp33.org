You start to truly love your OCs because they are your characters and you know everything about them. There is story lines to them that's not in the writing cause it would take too much time, but you know them. They become these babies to you, even the bad ones in a way. When I write I don't actively decide things it kind of plays out in my head like a movie, so when there is a death I can't just decide no I'm not letting them die. I literally can't write it another way if that's what happens. I've tried to kind of fight what's in my head on some things in my fic/the book I'm working on and it just keeps circling back. I think the worst part of an OC dying is writing it. You love that character, you made it and are proud of it, and now you're going to end it. You brought them into that world and they won't get that happy ending. I do like happy endings though and for the most part I like to believe a majority of my OCs get their happy endings.
