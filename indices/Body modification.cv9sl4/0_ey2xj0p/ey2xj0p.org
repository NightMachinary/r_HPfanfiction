'In the mind of a scientist' by ZenoNoKyuubi features a very much functionally insane Harry that's somewhat addicted to modifying his own body.

Inspired by Soul Eater's Dr. Franken Stein he is a vain, rude, obsessive and mentally unstable person craving for new and exciting ways to mock mother nature by doing things such as opening his own body to improve himself, create weird and unusual drugs, give Flamel, Dumbledore, the ministry and Voldemort the metaphorical middle finger and being intrigued to the point of obsession with Tonks' metamorposis abilities.

It's a funny story that made me laugh out loud several times and it has two sequels: 'Madness at the gates' and 'Madness effect' where he casually mocks all laws of nature in one way or another.

I highly recommend it.
