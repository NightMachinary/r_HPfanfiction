For me? No, not really. What I saw in Harry Potter was how backwards society was, and their "If it works, why change it?" attitude to everything.

Them being considered weak or backwards isn't that big of a stretch, really. In most other fictions with a magic system, people are always researching and trying to perfect their craft.
