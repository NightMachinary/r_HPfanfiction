It was not really weak. HP series is kids series so we saw lesser combat magic. I think wizards like Dumbledore can turn entire town in to dust within seconds. And you're right it was very versatile. You've dragons, werewolves, dementors and other dark creatures. In 6th book we learned that wizards created storms, uprooting trees and vanished bridges ...etc. They can raise dead like inferi. And most importantly mind magics in HP world are scary as fuck. We have imperius, confundus, compulsion, memory charms and muggle repelling charms. It's versatile and powerful.
