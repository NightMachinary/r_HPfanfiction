This ^{.} Completely agree, you've gotta balance things out. But with the proviso that if you are going to have HP Magic be overly strong or weak in comparison to your cross-over, do it for a damn good narrative/worldbuilding reason. Nerfing or upgrading the magic is a big decision and like most big decisions, it should at least mildly help you tell your story.
