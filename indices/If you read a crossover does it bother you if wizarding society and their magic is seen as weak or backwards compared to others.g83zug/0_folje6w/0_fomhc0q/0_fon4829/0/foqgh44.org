Fair, and character nerfs can have their place as well (eg. Faery Heroes has them less powerful after the time travel and needing to grow and re-tool up to reach their old powers again). But Rowling's Magic System is pretty OP sometimes, so a Nerf can provide some needed balance that lets the character grow in cunning or adaptability as they use strategy to fill the gap that the Nerf makes. Most of the big wizard-wizard battles in HP canon are virtually identical ("Latin yell!" - "Latin yell!") aside from location, so having to come up with creative solutions to conflict with a more powerful system can be interesting.

On the other hand, sometimes it's just a cheap way for the author to yell "Rowling is shit and here's why!" with a thin veil of narrative. It's not absolute one way or another for me, but to conclude before this becomes a massive page of rambling, in my opinion there is some interesting narrative merit to nerfing the system. :)
