Yes I read Crossovers because I LIKE both series, deeming one side of the Crossover as "Weak" then opens up the question, "If the Wizards and the Main Character sucks, why the fuck is This even a Crossover?" other than the author dancing on the grave of a series there is no real need to read it as the "Stronger" Heroes whether that's DC, Marvel, Buffy and the Scoobies, Camp Halfblood whoever solving all their original problems like in Canon and occasionally having curbstomp battles against Dark Wizards.

So you have no new conflicts of any note, a character and new set of characters who are a joke and a fanbase pissed off.

This goes either way, Harry shouldn't show up and make Thanos his bitch, nor should he kill Darkseid in 29 Seconds because the invasion spilled his beer.

Crossovers need to be balanced and thoughtful in how it's approached. Perhaps the crossed over character has their own private adventures or drag their new friends into a adventure they are more used to and comfortable with. Like in the MCU, Let's say Harry joins the Avengers. I doubt someone who's a hard core Avengers fan wants to read Tony Stark bumbling idiot and side kick to Sorcerer Supreme and Maester Wizzard Hadrian James Potter-Black-Gryffindor, as a Potter fan I do not want to read Harry Potter side kick. The Marvel Universe is enormous and wide, Giant Monsters, Werewolves, Vampires, Death Cults, Atlantis and Lemuria, Powerful dark magic users, Eldritch Horrors, Demon lords and plain old criminals ALL EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE! Harry doesn't have to back up Thor with the Dark Elves or Tony in taking down AIM, he can be off dealing with a new problem, one not seen in the movies. Same thing with DC, Percy Jackson has TONS of Monsters and Magic to deal with, even Harry Potter has the ENTIRE World full of Trolls and Giants and Magical Beast and Werewolves and Vampires and the like. The Teen Titans don't have to go to Hogwarts to protect Harry to come in Contact with these things, they already exist AWAY from Hogwarts
