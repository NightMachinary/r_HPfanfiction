On the strength of the magic, my feeling about it will rely on the intent of the author. Each fantasy World have different magic with different strenght and weaknesses, and are often hard to compare. To make an exemple with another universe that I love : take WoW, this World has far more different powers compared to Harry Potter, but there is no « Instakill » spell. You can however see warlocks summon demons, Paladins becoming immune to anything, necromancers bringing people back to unlife with new powers. So which one beats the other ? Well the one you want to, if any. There can be good excuses for such a take on those universes : if I were to pull a character from one world to put them in another, making this character magic weaker can help me create meaningfull struggles and avoid a full steamroll wish fullfilment fic. Some just want to be able to see a specific magic system dominate the other, it's a lot harder to make it interesting but can work.
