The actual dialogue is at the bottom, but it requires context. First: Harry is teaching River occlumency - she's basically an uncontrolled legilimens. Second: Simon is River's brother. Also, this is kind of long, but it has to be.

  Harry tried to think of an analogy that wouldn't be misconstrued. "Think of it as a dam," He began. "Your gift coupled with some of the Alliance's experimentation has you leaking. Now I'm going to eventually be teaching you how to plug the leak on your own, but if you'd like, I can sort of jam my own mental thumb and plug the leak with a little effort on my part. It weakens to the point of barely working if we're not in the same room."

  "A dam?" River asked.

  Harry nodded.

  "And that makes you the little dutch boy holding the flood back?"

  Harry chuckled. "I suppose you could say that."

  They all looked up as River came sprinting into the room shrieking in glee.

  "That was amazing!" River exclaimed in unbridled joy.

  "What's that?" Mal asked hoping for a change of conversation.

  River waved her arms up and down while she spun in circles. "Harry said I was some sort of dike, so I let him stick his thumb in me."

  Simon began cough uncontrollably.

  "It felt wonderful," River sang. "Him just filling me up and plugging my leak."

  "River!" Simon shouted aghast.

  "Okay," River smiled brightly and nodded. "I'm going to go have him stick it back in." She used one hand to clap a wave goodbye and spun right around to sprint back towards the bridge.
