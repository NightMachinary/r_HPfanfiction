  This was totally the best day of Harry's life. Might be the last, too, considering how bullshit the Holy Grail War was, but that did not even make it wobble in its position.

  There was no other day he'd see people trying to murder each other over who got to murder him while in the ruins of the place he'd lived for the worst days (and majority) of his life.

  If nothing else, Number 4 Privet Drive couldn't be burned down again. A building by that name could, but it wouldn't be the one he had hated so much.

  He could even enjoy the sight of Privet Drive burning to the bedrock - oh how sweet this was, if only he had a camera on hand like the Creeveys - without a single twinge of his conscience, because one or the other of the people who'd come after him had been nice enough to evacuate anyone that might get hurt first.
