Yeah, one would think it could be good, but so far everything I found was milder version of Haphne (Harry introduced to the high society by Susan). The only exception was linkao3(8495269), which is fem!Harry femslash with Susan, the beginning is not bad, but somewhere around October the author lost plot and tried to compensate with more and more weird subplots and finally gave up on it.

BTW, not in any relationship and not romance, but I love Susan in linkao3(2467277)! It is just great one-shot.
