EWE=Epilogue, What Epilogue? For those that like the end of the book but not the Epilogue and the pairings.

For the incest... I'm sorry to say that, but the only incest "acceptable" to me is the Lannister kind.

And for the odds of two stories with the same pairings... I can only say tough luck and try to skim through it to see what they did wrong.
