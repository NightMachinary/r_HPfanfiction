I've been working on a piece for a while and have yet to come across anything with similarities great enough to bother me. I dread it though.

I was ecstatic when I searched FFN for the pairing I was working on and found only a single one shot, which didn't actually pair them up. I've not seen a great many things which feature in my head Canon depicted and hope it stays that way until I can finish my story and get it out there!
