The biggest thing for me that you need to be aware of is what are people expected to know? One of the biggest issues with Fix-it fics which often have ocs is that the OC has solutions to problems that don't exist yet. The methods they use only make sense with hindsight meaning either your character is a divination prodigy or has knowledge they shouldn't have from an in universe sense. An example would be if an OC discovered in their first year that Scabbers was far older than most rats live to be and instantly worried that Scabbers was an animagus. There have been something like 12 registered that century, that as an option would be far, far behind, thinking the Weasleys look after him well or even that he might be a special type of rat.
