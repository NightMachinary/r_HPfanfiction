Give your character a canon name. No matter how well you write, many people will read "OC" in the summary and think "Mary Sue", dropping the fic before they start reading out of reflex while they'll eagerly click on "Daphne Greengrass, daughter of a dark wizard..." (Or Tracey Davis, Fae Dunbar, etc.) Fortunately, HP provides you with a lot of "characters" that are nothing but names (like Greengrass), so you can pretty much adapt any character to a canon name..
