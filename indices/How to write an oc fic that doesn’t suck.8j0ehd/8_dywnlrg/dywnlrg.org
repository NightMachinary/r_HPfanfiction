DON'T make your story canon except your OC is there. If the story is just the "Golden trio + 1" then there is very little point to reading it.

DON'T write your story just so you can pair your OC with a canon character. Pairings should be the product of a story, not the other way around. People can get away with this to a certain extent with non-OC protagonists, but very few people want to read a story which is solely about an OC romance.

DON'T make your OC good at everything. They should have strengths and weaknesses, and to a certain extent they should not outshine the strong characters of canon. An OC should never be stronger than Voldemort or Dumbledore, but it could certainly be plausible for an OC to eventually be better in the one thing they are best at, such as potions/enchantments/etc.

DO remember that other characters have their own motivations and ambitions. Things should be happening in the background in your story, and the world should not revolve around your OC. Your antagonists (and everyone else tbh) should be active rather than reactive.

DO make sure that your character has plausible motivations. An OC raised by purebloods is not going to instantly become best friends with Hermione on the train and give a long speech to Draco about why racism is stupid.

DO make sure that actions have consequences. Unless you are aiming for canon-compliance from a side point of view, then canon should be completely derailed early on in the plotline. There are very specific events that lead to Hermione and the troll/Harry in the forest/chamber of secrets/Voldemort's resurrection/etc and if you force these events to occur anyway then it looks bad.

DO explore the HP world with your OC! OCs give you a lot of freedom to write without being stuck into canon. Look into aspects of the wizarding world that we don't see in canon. We see very little of the average life of the daily wizarding family, as the Weasleys are not exactly typical. Considering how much fanfiction exists, unless you try something new and interesting you are not going to attract a lot of readers.
