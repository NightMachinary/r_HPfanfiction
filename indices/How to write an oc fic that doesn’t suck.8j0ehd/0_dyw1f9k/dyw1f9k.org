Do NOT give your OC "flaws" that are just cute. Also, no informed flaws. Is your OC hot tempered and does not think things through? Show me! Show me how this screws up her life ( even if just a little bit). Is she a shy wallflower? Show how this affedcts her life ( and not just by others being "mean to her") .

Have consequences happen. No matter what action, good or bad, your OC does not exist in a vacuum, what she does will have consequences.

Let her be wrong! Everybody nakes mistakes once in a while, your OC is allowed them, too. And people are allowed she is an ass for doing something they disasgree with without THEM ering an ass.

Give her a good supporting cast and realistic interactions with them. Again, your character does not exist in a vacuum.

If canon characters exist in your story try to present them fairly from as narrator's point, though it is fine if your OC does not like them. ( f.e., she can think McGonagall is prejudiced to her because of how strict she is, but YOU have to rermermber that this teacherr is the "strict but fair" type when wtiting their interactions. )

Make the story actually interesting.

Hold off the "political manipulations" or "romance" stuff till your characters are older.
