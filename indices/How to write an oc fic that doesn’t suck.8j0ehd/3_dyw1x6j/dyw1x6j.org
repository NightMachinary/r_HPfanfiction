Are you worried about your character or plot? OC fics usually get a bad rep because the character is a Mary Sue or the long lost sister/brother of the mc which is incredibly over used.

If your worried about the character you need to focus on making sure she is developed as much as possible. I like to start with one thing my character excels at. Then I list three things they are horrible at- not cutesy kind of things, ie being clutzy in an endearing way. It's so overused at this point. If they are clutzy, then maybe they get embarrassed and try to cover it up by saying they meant to do it, or maybe they have a disability that makes them less coordinated. This helps steer you away from the Mary Sue trap. This can also help in establishing their personality and shows they are not perfect.

From their I determine where they are at in life at the start of the story. Do they have a job? How old? Are they popular? What kind of lifestyle do they have? Who do they live with and where? Knowing this helps me come up with their history, because it forces me to think of how they got to this point and what made them the way they are.

Lastly, I would have at least a vague plan or idea of where you want the character to end up by the end of the story. If they grew, overcame an obstacle, viewpoint/values have changed, etc. This part can also help you in planning out your fic. Knowing where you want to end up I think is a great way to get the rest of the story planned, and make sure you don't go off in random directions and create plotholes.

Sometimes, I'll also write ficlettes or oneshots before getting to the main story. It gives me good practice for writing the character, and the stories don't have to be long.

NOW, if you're worried about writing a fic that is bad, you are not alone! I agonize over my stories and spend hours editing and rewriting before I post.

But a few pointers would be: make sure your grammar and spelling is double checked- this can be a huge turnoff for some readers. Don't be afraid of bad writing- the first draft is all about getting the story out. The polishing comes later when you edit. If you really want a second opinion on your writing, you can also get a beta. They will proofread for you, and some are willing to help you bounce ideas around if you get stuck. Lastly- have some kind of outline or plan. How detailed you want it is completely up to you, but I believe it is vital for longer fics.

If there's anything specific you want to know, I would recommend checking out [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] too! It is a great community of writers/readers, and a great place for advice on writing. Browse the topics, there are quite a few on OCs.

Write what you want to write- if your heart just isn't in it, it will show. For the record, I think it sounds like you have a really good premise!
