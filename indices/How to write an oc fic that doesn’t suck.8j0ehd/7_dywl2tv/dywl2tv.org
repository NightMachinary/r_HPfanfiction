Go all in or all out. If you want to get involved in the main story, do so, don't just have you character make friends with Harry Potter but then have everything play out exactly the same as in canon.

If you don't want to get as involved in the main plot of the series, stay away from it, don't try to recreate the same thing just with "the next Dark Lord", Voldemort is an antagonist unlikely to reappear for a while, yes while Grindelwald was around Voledmort was already amassing power, but it took him twenty years to actually do something. There aren't just a myriad of extraordinarily powerful dark wizards who plan to take over the world, waiting for their turn. Your character shouldn't be the centre of everyone's attention either.

As for the daughter of the dark wizard trope, try to relate it to something that exists in real life, the daughter of a criminal for example, try to base people's assumptions on that. Not everyone will care. Some muggleborns will have no idea as to the importance of this. Basically, Hogwarts is a big school, it would be unrealistic for her character to be rejected by absolutely everyone. Of course it's possible people will have inbuilt prejudices and will think badly of her if she does anything wrong, this can work for interesting drama, but basically, don't make that her sole defining trait nor the only thing people will judge her on. Is she well spoken and outgoing? People will likely associate her less to her father in that case, while they will react the opposite if she is a withdrawn slytherin who has difficulties forming meaningful relationships etc.
