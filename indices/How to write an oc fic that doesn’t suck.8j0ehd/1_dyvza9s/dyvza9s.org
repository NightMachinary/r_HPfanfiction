Fuck up the OC's life. For every good trait, give him a bad one, for everything good that happens in his life or with his goals, give him a kick in the balls later. How bad or how good these traits and events are of course depend on your story, and just how cruel you can be, maybe even killing him or her off in the end.

It sounds cruel, but it's for the best. It's too easy to make perfect but two dimensional OCs.
