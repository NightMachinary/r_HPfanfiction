Make sure that there's a plot happening that doesn't revolve entirely around her presence. Not even Harry did the /entire/ thing himself, and there was a sense that people were talking about things and thinking about things that weren't immediately relevant to him.

Give her strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate what they mean for her day to day life. She could be very smart, but if she works herself into a mess for tests and exams then her results may not show it...so what does that mean? If she sometimes speaks without thinking, what does this mean for how people view her?

Make it so that other people know or understand things she doesn't. Let her be wrong sometimes, let her misunderstand and make mistakes.

Give her interests. They don't have to be huge, just...little things that add colour. Something as simple as Dean's West Ham poster pinned up in the canon dormitory would do. Maybe she has a collection, or a favourite book, or some little thing.
