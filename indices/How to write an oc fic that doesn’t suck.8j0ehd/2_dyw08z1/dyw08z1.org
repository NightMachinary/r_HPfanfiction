1. Try to distance from OC. Is there, actually, more plot than just her life and contribution to canon events?

2. Make her believable. Not a plot device/author proxy, but a character that can act in her own and contrdict your wishes. Well, better do it with everybosdy, but main char in particular. Run through her past year after year. Any events that will give her non-standard reactions to smth? (You dont need to mention those events, of course)

3. Add /something/ new. A thing that will truly make it \not\ just another one. 3.5. and really, /really/ try to /do/ it. Not to turn into a grave in a cemetery of frozen fics. 3.75. list all details that bug you in canon(eg, time-turners) and cliche traits. do not allow them to be here, except intentionally and in a right way.
