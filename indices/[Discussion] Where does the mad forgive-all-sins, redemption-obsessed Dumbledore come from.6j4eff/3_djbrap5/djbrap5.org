There are many good points here but I think we've missed a big one so far. This trope started in the early days of fanfiction before book 7 came out. At that time, we didn't know that Snape was actually on the good side. This makes it look like Dumbledore trying to "redeem" Snape was the wrong decision and cost him his own life.
