Idiots who don't realize that Dumbledore knew Draco was a weeny, and not cut out for the Death Eater cause and decided to use his own death in an attempt to keep Draco from falling. Also idiots who didn't realize that all the times Dumbledore says he trusts Snape because Snape apologized or whatever happened only because he promised not to tell anyone the real reason Snape turned spy.
