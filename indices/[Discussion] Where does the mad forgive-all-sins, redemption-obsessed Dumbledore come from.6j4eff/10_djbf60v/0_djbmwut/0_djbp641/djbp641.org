  On the other hand, Draco might not have been capable of cold-blooded, AK-to-the-face murder, but he very nearly killed three people (arguably endangered a lot more as well) while trying to get Dumbledore.

That was him panicking and flailing without a plan. To be expected, and frankly quite lower near casualties than I would have expected.

  He also kept another person under the Imperius curse for months.
#+end_quote

True.

  And he attempted to curse another student with the Cruciatus.
#+end_quote

Also true.

Harry's got him beat.

Draco's still a weeny.
