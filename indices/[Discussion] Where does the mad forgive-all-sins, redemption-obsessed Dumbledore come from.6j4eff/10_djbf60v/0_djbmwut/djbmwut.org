On the other hand, Draco might not have been capable of cold-blooded, AK-to-the-face murder, but he very nearly killed three people (arguably endangered /a lot/ more as well) while trying to get Dumbledore.

He also kept another person under the Imperius curse for months.

And he attempted to curse another student with the Cruciatus.

So he seems pretty capable of... let's say one and a half of the three unforgivables.
