Harry killed his first sapient being at 11 by burning him to death. Then he killed the next one by stabbing him with a sword. By the time of the DH book, he had lost Sirius to Death Eaters, seen Cedric die - at the hands of a murderer Harry saved, to boot - and saw what carnage and cruelty the Death Eaters are causing, with other friends of his and family dying.

Any normal human being would kill at that point. The idea that humans shy away from killing is drivel; it's damn easy to kill when under the stress people are in similar situations.
