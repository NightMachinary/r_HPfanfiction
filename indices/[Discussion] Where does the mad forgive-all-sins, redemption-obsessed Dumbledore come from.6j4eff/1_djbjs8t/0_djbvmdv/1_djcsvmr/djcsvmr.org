  It is ironic, that in canon, it's Harry and Co. that hate killing. Fact is they're just kids in over their head, and they're trying to spare any shred of morality that they can.

Most armies spend years training adults (18+) to be able to kill someone. That a 17 years old would hesitate to kill someone he thinks is an innocent is not astonishing. The adults (who lived thourgh a war that took families and friends from them) would be a little more ruthless seems quite normal (even if their reaction to Harry not trying to kill Shunpike is probably a little too strong).
