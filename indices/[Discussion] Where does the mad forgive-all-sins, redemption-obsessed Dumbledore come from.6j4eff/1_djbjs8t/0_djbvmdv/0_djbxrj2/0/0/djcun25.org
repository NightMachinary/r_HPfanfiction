yeah but that was already clear from the beginning. she was always the one who had the least problems to deal with.

harry already came from a abusive family, had to defend his life multiple times and had to kill the first time as an eleven year old. He also has strong anger issues and was willing to torture opponents on at least 3 occasion and succeeded once.

Ron had to feel inferior to so many people during his entire adolescence and by associating with harry had to face many things no child should be confronted with, And even though he is a competent wizard himself he doesn't really get any recognition for the times he had to risk his life. Honestly I would expect him to need lots of therapy just for the confrontation with acromantulas alone.
