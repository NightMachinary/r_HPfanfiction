Ron and Harry dont hate killing, they hated unnecessary killing and killing of civillians. Harry didnt even care about the other death eaters he shot of their brooms or the one who was hit by pieces of the sidecar harry blew up. And Harry's only concern about the death eaters in the cafe was that if they killed them, the others knew where they have been.

Ron on the other hand felt uneasy about killing but also shot death eaters of their brooms and during the battle of Hogwarts he deliberately wanted to kill death eaters as revenge for Fred(and harry s thoughts strongly imply he succeeded)

Hermione was the only one of the trio who seemed to be really disturbed by the idea of killing and wasn't seen doing so
