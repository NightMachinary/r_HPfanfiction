It is ironic, that in canon, it's Harry and Co. that hate killing. Fact is they're just kids in over their head, and they're trying to spare any shred of morality that they can.

Examples, harry didnt kill stan shunpike, they didnt kill the two death eaters in the cafe after they stunned them, etc.
