I never understood why the order of phoenix is so often potrayed as a group of pacifist, who hate anyone using lethal force. The order in canon even calls harry out for not killing a civilian under the imperius curse in order to keep his cover (and that was even after harry killed a couple death eaters). clearly they dont have a problem with killing death eaters and are even okay with causing civilian casualties if necessary.
