I think it stemmed from the fact that with a few exceptions, we don't see many Death Eaters getting killed in three books. Not in the Battle of the Ministry at the end of book 5, not in the battle in Hogwarts in book 6, and even the battle of Hogwarts at the end of book 7 didn't seem to show many dead enemies. Add to that that Malfoy and co. managed to get off in 1981, that the kids not even managed to kill defeated Death Eaters who they knew were murdering muggleborns, and the idea that Dumbledore doesn't want to kill others is not that hard to support.
