You've a decent perspective, particularly regarding Sirius and the other major Death Eaters. I admit that /Wind Shear/ is actually a really well-written and enjoyable story, I think the fact that Dumbledore is still quite pacifist that set off my little rant, even though the story itself isn't anywhere near a bad enough offender to deserve my ire.

You're right, though, in /WS/ he's well-constructed, and his arguments are reasonable enough, which is already more than can be said for (in my experience) most similar versions of Dumbledore.
