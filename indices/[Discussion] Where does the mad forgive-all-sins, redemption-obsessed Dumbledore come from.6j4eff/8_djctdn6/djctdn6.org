Regarding /Wind Shear/, it is probably one of the most believable non-violent Dumbledore : he is ninety years old, still sees most people as his pupils, barely more than children, and certainly is affected (and has been for a long time) by some form of PTSD (he still don't know whether he was the one to kill his little sister, that we know from canon, and is not a fighter, but a teacher who found himself with the responsibility to end a war through fighting against a man he once loved). This Dumbledore is already an old man who don't want to fight (and never had), who dread the idea that another war is coming, whose role (passion) as an educator is to teach and correct.\\
That's the stuff you make the most hardened pacifists with. The kind that just want to drive children to become adults, and will, under pressure (i.e. when the threat level against their pupils become too big), either shatter or lose it.\\
Canon Dumbledore seems to follow this model: he nearly lost it, but still (again?) restrained himself. The worst offenders (the Lestranges, or in his mind Sirius) he let rot in hell; others, those he can still think as children who misbehaved, he let go free with a tap on the hand.
