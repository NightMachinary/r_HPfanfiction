Indeed. It's hard to interprete the shitty plot of book 6 in a way that doesn't paint Snape as incompetent or evil for not telling Dumbledore about Draco's orders, or Dumbledore as deliberately choosing to save Draco, at the cost of risking innocents - he would let Katie Bell get cursed (she'd take months to recover, probably having to repeat the school year, if she didn't take permanent damage) and Ron get poisoned. In my opinion, it's just shitty plot railroading with no care for characterisation - like most of Book 6 - but those who try to make sense of that mess often end up with a Dumbledore who puts saving one sinner above saving a dozen innocents.
