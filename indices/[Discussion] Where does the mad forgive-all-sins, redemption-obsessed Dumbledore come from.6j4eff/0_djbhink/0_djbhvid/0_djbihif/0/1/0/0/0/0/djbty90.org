To swing to the other side of the argument however, Dumbledore was in a very awkward position. Snape was already suspect, and Bella and Narcissa knew perfectly well that Snape was one of the few who knew about Draco's mission. Dumbledore needed to keep Snape from being discovered, and if he uncovered Malfoy, Voldemort would investigate every single one of his Death Eaters first, looking for a traitor, before even thinking to consider that Dumbeldore found out on his own.
