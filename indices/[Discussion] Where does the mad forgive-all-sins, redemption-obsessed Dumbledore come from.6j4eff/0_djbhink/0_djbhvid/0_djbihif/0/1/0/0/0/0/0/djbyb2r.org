draco wasn't subtle about being a death eater. He told the other slytherins where everyone could overhear it. his behavior also changed a lot and it doesn't take a genius(which Dumbledore is) to investigate the failed assassinations. It would be easy to paint draco being uncovered as his own fault rather than a traitor.
