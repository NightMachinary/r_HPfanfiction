I agree about the vanishing cabinet. The Pucey (or Montegue?) episode in /OotP/ took place after he'd fled Hogwarts and was resolved before he returned. He probably didn't look into it in the aftermath of the Ministry.

That's if he even knew that there was a vanishing cabinet--let alone where its mate was.
