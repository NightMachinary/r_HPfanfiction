Dumbledore doesn't know how - he's genuinely surprised when Draco does the Vanishing Cabinet reveal, and doesn't notice that Rosmerta is under the Imperius Curse when he and Harry head down to Hogsmeade to Disapparate in the book.

Otherwise, I don't think Snape knew the details either - he figured out that the necklace and the mead were Malfoy, and I think he has words with him at some point but Malfoy brushes him off (I'm not sure on any of this though, so if someone wants to look it up and confirm they can), but I'm quite sure that Snape's not clued in on the Vanishing Cabinet plan.
