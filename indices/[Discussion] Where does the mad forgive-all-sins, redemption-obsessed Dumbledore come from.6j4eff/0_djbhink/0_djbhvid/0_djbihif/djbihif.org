Just saying, in the book Dumbledore is aware of Draco's plot though, it's revealed in Snape's memories in /Deathly Hallows/.

But I think you've hit the nail on the head - in trying to make sense of Rowling's plot decisions, whatever they might be - authors construct these versions of these characters to try and fit what /isn't/ a perfect plot, and then transplant these already flawed characterisations into their own work.
