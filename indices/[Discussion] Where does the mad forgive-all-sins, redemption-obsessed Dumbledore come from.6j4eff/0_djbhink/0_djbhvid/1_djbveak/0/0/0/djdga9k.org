That's stupid. If he wants Draco to fail, then he can simply make him fail right away (arrest him, kill him, force him to make a deal - whatever), stopping his attempts in their tracks - and then can have Snape kill him at his pleasure when needed. And probably seal the Elder Wand in some rock and drop it in the Ocean.

There is really no excuse for the stupid Draco plot in HBP.
