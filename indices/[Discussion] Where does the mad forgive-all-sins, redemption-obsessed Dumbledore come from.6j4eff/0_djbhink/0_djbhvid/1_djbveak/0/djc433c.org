So... Katie Bell almost dying to a dark curse is not serious enough? Ron almost dying to poison is not serious enough either?

Dumbledore could have easily arranged an accident for Draco. Or tipp off Scrimgeour that Draco was acting suspiciously - Harry already suspected Draco as well. Aurors would have taken care of Draco, without implicating or threatening Snape. If Snape had to find out what Draco was tasked with, then they could have done so too. Even if he could withstand Veritaserum and Legilimency on Dubmledore's level, he would have broken down and taken a deal to save himself and his family, if the alternative was to die and have his family die for his failure. Or he could be killed easily, and see the Malfoys die at the hands of the Dark Lord.

Dumbledore was certainly not doing what he could to protect the school.
