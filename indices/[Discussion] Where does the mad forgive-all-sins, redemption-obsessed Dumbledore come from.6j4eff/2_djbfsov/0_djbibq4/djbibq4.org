Let's not forget the whole Mad-Eye giving Dumbles what-for when the old man is lamenting the violence of war. I mean, really? This guy who /ended/ the wizard world war in the 40s being all melodramatic and wondering why everyone can't just get along? There's fuck-all consistency with characterisations of Dumbledore and it really gets on my tits.

To me, Dumbledore always seemed receptive to humanity's faults and cruelties, and sought to inspire the best in them, rather than blindly pretend that violence can never be the answer, etc, and it's depressing to see an otherwise good story with strong characterisations settle for a second-rate Dumbledore.
