I'm 100% with you. This version of Dumbledore usually ends up extending to the Order with Mad-Eye being the war-hardened veteran who disagrees. I distinctly remember in DH where Remus tells Harry that if he can't bring himself to kill, at least stun (when he threw an Expelliarmus at Stan Shunpike). The Order isn't pulling their punches. I think this comes from authors wanting Harry to be the only badass in their story and not have to share that title with someone like Dumbledore, who Rowling created as a certified badass.
