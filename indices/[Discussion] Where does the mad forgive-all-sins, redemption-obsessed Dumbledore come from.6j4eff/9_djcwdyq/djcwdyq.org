If you want over-the-top characterisations of Dumbledore in general (not just OTT forgiving Dumbledores) then linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?) has the single most amusing version of Dumbledore I've ever come across. Dumbledore is basically fully aware of how much the Wizarding World worships him, and he's also turned into one of those completely uncaring, filterless old men who's trying to see how far he can go before someone calls him on it. So far, he's extremely disappointed in the Wizarding World.

"And to conclude the End-Of-Term Feast, we have one final announcement. The Hogwarts Express left five minutes ago, and as of now, you are all trespassing. Well? Get off my property!"
