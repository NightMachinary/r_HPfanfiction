There is a tag on [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Pureblood%20Culture/works][AO3]]. I have an interest in how authors build their magical culture, I think it is an area that JKR really could have done more on. Magical's should not just act like muggles with magic, they have had isolated social development for hundreds of years. Some of these I've picked up from older thread but haven't actually read yet, so I have no idea how /good/ they actually are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10071063/1/The-Assassin-Wore-White][The Assassin Wore White]], definitely worth while and relatively well written.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster][Spellcaster]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9652275/1/][Bonfires at Midnight]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oath Breaker]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1844462/1/The-Twenty][The Twenty]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697521/1/][The Brave New World]]
- Harry/Draco: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1652549][There's a Pure-Blood Custom For That]], actually, a lot of fics by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Lomonaaeren/][Lomonaaeren]]
- Harry/Draco and MPREG: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2449031][Appallingly Wrong and Irreparably Broken]], good, if you can get past the 1st POV
- Modern USA: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] and [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10869775/1][The Margaree Motel]]
- French and Bulgarian cultures, some stuff on Jamaica: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]]
- Grindelwald-era Central Europe: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Für Das Größere Wohl]]
