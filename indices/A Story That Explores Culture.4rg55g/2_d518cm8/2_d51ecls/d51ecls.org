Bonfires at Midnight is clearly the best on that list, because I wrote it. Honestly, I forgot all about that story until I saw this post. Wizarding culture has always been a thing I've loved reading about (as evidenced by me recommending the same two stories in every thread like this that pops up). Though, I can't say my efforts at capturing my thoughts on the subject has gone all that well, but it's not for lack of trying.
