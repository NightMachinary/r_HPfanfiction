The Sacrifices arc is hella long & I've re-started it several times but have never made it all the way through, but it's extremely well-written and definitely explores pureblood culture, linkffn(Saving Connor)

linkffn(Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina) is one of my all-time favorite fics. It does have Dumbledore/Weasley bashing (which I personally don't mind, but I know some people hate it) but it's not super over-the-top about it.
