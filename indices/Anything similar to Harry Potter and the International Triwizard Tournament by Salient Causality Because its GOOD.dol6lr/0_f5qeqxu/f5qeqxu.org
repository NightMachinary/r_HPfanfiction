Thanks for the kind words and I'm glad you like my fic. I update as quickly as I can but life happens, probably another update this weekend, but we'll see. Here's four fics, three of them complete and all of them longer, that you may enjoy, if you haven't already discovered them.

Cadmean Victory is a completed fic that many have enjoyed, 4th year and with a Chamber of Secrets/Salazar Slytherin aspect. linkffn(11446957)

I'm Still Here is another one I quite enjoy, it's not complete as of yet. linkffn(9704180)

Honour Thy Blood, the romance aspect is a rather minor subplot but an enjoyable fic nonetheless linkffn(12155794)

Stepping Back is the same author as Honour Thy Blood and a Harry back in the same time as when his parents were at Hogwarts. Has a greater romance aspect than the other. linkffn(12317784)
