I think there should be a definite difference drawn between the movies and the books as well. Sure artistically it could be similar, but until a movie is made it's just a concept, an idea to be filled in by the reader. We're a more appropriate explanation given in canon to explain the castle, maybe it would confirm/deny architecture. We shall never know.
