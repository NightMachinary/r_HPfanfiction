Mine are all "I've got this idea, and I can't competently write it myself but I'd like it to /be/ written. Maybe if I share it, someone else will pick it up or it'll inspire them in some way." Some are also "I want this story to exist, and would love to read it, but it doesn't exist and I can't write it." Most of what I've actually written came from "It doesn't look like anybody else is going to write this, so I might as well give it a try" coupled with my muse spitting out plot elements or scene fragments.
