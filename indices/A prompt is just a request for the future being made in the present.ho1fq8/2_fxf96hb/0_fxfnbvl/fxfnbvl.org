Some prompts I've seen are the "same old, same old" you see on FFn. The ones that do stand out, however, are the 'unique' ones, like the aforementioned "Teachers Shipping" prompt.

Not to toot my own horn, but when I post a prompt, I try to think of unusual, out-of-the-box ideas that I hope will entertain people.
