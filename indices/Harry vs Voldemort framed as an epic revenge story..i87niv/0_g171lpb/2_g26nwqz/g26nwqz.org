Yeah. There's just something about it. Voldemort with all of his power and resources and ruthlessness is focused on his grand ambitions and his great enemy Albus Dumbledore, not really realizing or appreciating that, by operating the way he does, he has his whole life been been planting the seeds of his own defeat. Eventually one took hold, and while he's busy focusing on his his lofty goals, a nobody rises up to defeat him. You reap what you sow.

Though I do also enjoy the whole prophesied chosen one idea.
