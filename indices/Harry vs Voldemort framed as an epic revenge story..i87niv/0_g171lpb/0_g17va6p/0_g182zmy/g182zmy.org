A self-fulfilling prophecy is still a prophecy. Harry is spared because of Lily's sacrifice, which only occurred because of the prophecy. He's still the chosen one.

Dumbledore's point is that /after/ that happened, the prophecy was just spelling out what any idiot could have predicted and what Harry would have chosen for himself if there had been no prophecy.
