I'd be very interested in an AU where Voldemort actually DID die that night, but Sirius still doesn't escape from Azkaban until year 3. Maybe since Dumbledore knows Voldemort is gone, he's able to place Harry somewhere he's actually wanted, so when Sirius breaks out it's not as important that Sirius take him into his home and instead Sirius focuses on using the Black fortune and name to destroy the lives of the people who destroyed his.
