I can perfectly imagine Bella giving her own twisted version of the “black mamba” monologue to a alcoholic washed up Lucius who is a bouncer at a knockturn Alley strip club.

Peter Pettigrew is a stay at home dad with a healer wife. His daughter sees him get a reducto to the face.

Greyback calls his pack the crazy 88 and owns a cool nightclub in Romania

The Bride is played by Sirius Black, try to get his godson back from the revived lord Voldemort, who is actually a possessed Regulus Black to provide emotional impact.

I've never written a fan fic before but I'm tempted to write this as a one shot crack piece.
