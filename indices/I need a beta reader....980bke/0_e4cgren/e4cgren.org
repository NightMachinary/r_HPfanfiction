So i'm going to give you my thoughts while reading:

‘It was cruel of Harry', Dumbledore would say. Harry couldn't care less. Finally, it came; the day he left the Dursley's.

/Harry imagines dubmle dumbledore would call it cruel but he didnt care. (this sentence should be part of the alinea above it as it connects with that not with this alinea)/

Levitating his trunk wandlessly downstairs, he saw that Dudley was struggling with Aunt Petunia over food. It was quite funny to Harry.

/He is carrying his truck no magic for 14 yr olds not in school/

“Leaving. I'll see you next summer.” replied Harry coolly, before opening the front door and stepping outside.

/You speak of a Harry of dumbledore like intelligence. When someone is that intelligent why do you have him rely on fear in his relationship with the durseleys? (installing fear with magic is illegal in canon btw) But its also not an intelligent way to solve the problem. It's the way a lot of independent harry writers have badass harry solve his problem after years of abuse./

/As i understand it your Harry always was intelligent so please have him respond to others in an intelligent fashion./

Arriving at the Leaky Cauldron on Charing Cross road in western London, Harry paid his fare and got off the Knight bus. His trunk was already on the curb. He looked back, the bus had left.

/There is a lot of tell not much show.. Try to take the reader along with harry instead of telling us what harry is doing. Tell us what harry sees feels etcetera instead of from an outside perspective./

‘Dumbledore has someone watching me this summer' intuitively thought Harry. He'd had to be careful about not getting caught by the spy doing something wrong and would have to lose him before entering Knockturn alley.

/Harry isnt thinking that intuitively he simply knows it because Tom basically tells him. Which would be incredibly stupid of dumbledore to do unless he wanted Harry to know? (there is no upside in letting Tom know harry is coming....)/

“Of course, my boy. Your old room is available; and perhaps a bit of breakfast?” asked Tom politely with a smile, that was missing a few teeth. Scary!

/He is 14 he has an old room. He should have seen the teeth before so no reason to think scary. Stay consistent in your universe./

Harry took the key Tom gave him and took the stairs upstairs, his trunk levitating behind him.

/Again no levitation/

He took a survey of the room and slid his trunk under the bed after casting a few alarm and security spells on it. There were some questionable items in his trunk so precautions were a necessity with a spy on his tale.

/Is he serious about Dumbles spyin on him? Because if Dumbles is those spells will have zero effect dumbles just goes in does whatever the fuck he wants and gets out. No 14 yr old would know. Be consisent in universe evena smart/intelligent 14 yr old doesnt stand a chance against Dumbles. Or is dumbles an idiot in the story (Dumbles did basically tell harry he was spying after all)?/

He hadn't eaten anything since dinner last night in a hurry to get away from the Dursley's.

/What hurry? He explicitly waited an extra week while not being totally neccasery?/

He sat ahead and acted calm. After half an hour, the Hampstead station came, but Harry sat still.

/Acted calm? For all we know he is calm? You didnt show any nervs?/

Harry got out of the tube station and discreetly summoned the Knight bus again. Entering the Leaky Cauldron again, he saw that Tom was missing. ‘Probably had gone to help that woman back to Diagon alley', he intuitively reasoned.

/So he ditched the spy for no reason? He goes back to the place he was before so the spy now is back. There is no logic to this action./

/Why would Tom help her back? She can just apparte out of sight? There is no reason for tom to do anything..../

Harry decided to visit Knockturn alley first after a visit to his vault, then do his school shopping later.

/Harry is now again tailed by a spy because there is no reason at all for there not being a spy. (or is Dumbles indeed an idiot)/

He had also asked the goblins, to transfer the Basilisk skin to the French branch of Gringotts in Paris today.

/The second year one? You will have to give some context of how this got out of the school?/

He'd thought of selling it, but then decided against it. It was a trophy. “Trophies aren't sold”, Dumbledore had said.

/And finding it on another persons property doesnt make you the owner. So there is no selling./

Harvesting the thousand foot long Basilisk had taken nearly six months, and also provided Harry with a massive increase to his vault and with a good amount of Basilisk skin. Dumbledore, Snape and Sprout had called experts they knew who could get the job done. Many Magizoologists, Potioneers had come. A thousand year old Basilisk was nearly a miracle and many wanted to see it.

/Cool there is the explanition I was waiting for. Of course the basilisk is property of the school so harry wouldnt get the money...../

Hayato Kang who Harry automatically decided to call Sensei when he first met him in January, c.1993 was a tall man, he was lean but not thin.

/You can't use a Katana is remotely the same way as a western Sword. So or the Japanese Sword master wearing a katana is acutally also an expert on western weapons? Or Harry is not going to learn how to use a western sword? (your choice)/

‘How did Dumbledore put up blood wards on Number 4, Privet Drive if they have been outlawed for over 300 years?' wondered Harry.

/If harry already knew they were outlawed why is he wondering this now? Not when he found out?/

In Hogwarts Harry had claimed a large classroom on the seventh floor and locked it with a password and additional wards.

/This is quite the time jump you make here? Maybe add something about the journey or what he did for the rest of the vacation?/

The cupboard had to be fixed. He'd called Dobby and asked him to fix the cupboard for him. Dobby had gone and gotten 2 more elves.

/If dumbledore isn't supposed to know things like this? He certainly knows now his elves did it./

Tom was annoyed with him. He ordered a roasted lamb with gravy, along with an ice cream sundae for dese

/So he isnt at hogwarts? Now i'm confused./
