The trace is on Harry as a person. Not on his wand.

All magic used near a minor is traced. Not only the magic performed with a minors wand.

In book 2 the levitation spell Dobby uses is traced by the ministery because it was used in Harries presence.

In magical households the minitery does not send letters with warnings because they assume the parents not the childeren are using magic when the trace goes of in a magical location.
