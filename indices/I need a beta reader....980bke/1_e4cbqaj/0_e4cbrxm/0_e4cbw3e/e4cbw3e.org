What wandless magic do we see Dumbledore do in the books? (in the movies we see the man changing some banners but that could be the house elves just as well) And even if he is able to do it in his old age we 14 is still rather young.

But i will explain to you why it makes stories dull. It for some reason is always untracable and not tracked by the ministery (altough the Trace is not on the wand) so the whole magic system from canon goes out of the door and Harry can do whatever he likes. It is boring
