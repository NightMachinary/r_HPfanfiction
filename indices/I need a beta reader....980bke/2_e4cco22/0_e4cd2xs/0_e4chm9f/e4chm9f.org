I can't help you. From what I've seen of your fic I would want to change everything, plot, characters and all, at that point you're not writing your own story.I dislike your MC, I dislike the tone, I dislike the wandless bullshit, I dislike the way you're presenting Dumbledore, and I can't help but feel I've read a 5th year version of this a dozen times. This isn't a story I could help with.
