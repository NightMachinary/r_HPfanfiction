After living with the Dursley[']s (you don't want the apostrophe. At the Dursley's would since you're talking about the home they possess but the Dursleys are people, multiple people and therefore plural.) for 2 weeks, Harry had felt the blood wards, built by Dumbledore 13 years ago fully recovered. (Whole sentence is clunky, that whole sentence needs to be re-written.) Though just [for]->(to) be[ing]->(cut) on the safe side he['d->had](You shrink speech to match what would be really said, you don't do it for your writing.) decided to spend a week more there. Enduring the Dursley's for three weeks had gotten a whole lot easier, when he had used a [wandless](oh dear.) stinging spell on Dudley in full view of both Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia his first day on Privet Drive.

So your first line has a mistake. The rest of the paragraph doesn't get better and you've already introduced wandless magic which is making me nope out of there. Wands are important in HP magic. An OP indy Harry will probably get more attention on FFnet than here. Have you considered looking for a beta on their forums?
