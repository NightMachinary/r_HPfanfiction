linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by slythernim)

Harry died in 1981 and was therefore not a part of the class of '98.

Hermione almost died attacked by the troll and was forced to drop out and leave behind magic by her parents, leaving her to take extreme measures to study magic -- including Dark magic.

A very guilty Ron and his fellow Gryffindors ended up wishing to celebrate her legacy by being ... studious.
