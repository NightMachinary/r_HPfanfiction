I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), did a good job in treating the Harry/Ginny relationship. There was no CoS event here, and Ginny wasn't nearly that devoted to Harry. They got together for a year or two, but after Voldemort returned and Harry began neglecting her in favor of training, their relationship fell apart.
