In whatever order I feel like:

linkffn(The Changling; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): Ginny sorted into Slytherin (also spoiler, she gave the diary to Ron)

linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song): Ron petrified by the Basilisk (among other differences), James still lives but left Harry with the Dursleys

linkffn(Blindness): Hermione injured by troll and leaves school (also killing curse leaves Harry blind)

linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): Dumbledore separated Harry after Sirius died and trained him up in private

linkffn(The Darkness Within): Pettigrew decided to capture Harry instead of killing the Potters, then brought him to Voldemort

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus): Harry turned into a cat at age 5 to escape, then raised by the Grangers with Hermione

linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): Luna's father dies due to his time in Azkaban, it definitely affects her

linkffn(Percy takes the wheel): Arthur and Molly die, Percy has to assume the role of running the family (ditto for the rest of them)

linkffn(Backwards with Purpose I: Always and Always): most of the Weasleys, but Percy in particular is rather loyal because of Harry taking a curse for him and the concerted effort to treat him better.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind): Sirius decides not to go after Pettigrew and instead hash out a better plan.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Death's Ultimatum; Unintended Consequences; Betrayal by butalearner): Ron and Hermione left during the Horcrux hunt

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology): Hermione was sorted into Slytherin House

linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary): Luna got the Diary instead
