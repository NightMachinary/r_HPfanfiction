I'm not an expert writer, so I don't know how to give good constructive criticism. As a reader, I found your first chapter bewildering - the sentences are long, the paragraphs are immense, and there's just too much action going on and too much extra-canonical information assumed from the get-go.

I did like your use of unusual vocabulary.
