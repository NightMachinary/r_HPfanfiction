I actually like your writing style for the most part. There are a few instances of clauses /too/ disparate being stuck together, like at the beginning when Harry casts that Lumos, but otherwise it's well done. It almost reminds me of the late great Terry Pratchett.

One negative from me: Ron. I hate Ron bashing and I like stories that treat him well, but he's /too/ different. He's not just smart - which I was looking forward to - he's overly pretentious in his speech, like a well-read gentlemen of another century writing a letter. He's 13, and even if he's smarter than Hermione and it's being exaggerated for comedic effect, it's still too much for a preteen/teenager.
