The classic of the trope is linkffn(Australia by MsBinns). It is a slow burn Romione (sometimes NSFW) very well written, sometimes it seems to me that main heroes are slightly too thick and the story is too drawn out (but of course the point is to keep R&H together long enough to resolve out their issues). For example they couldn't find them with a bit obvious but adorable solution of linkao3(The Wheel Is Come Full Circle by White_Squirrel). There is a long Australia-looking-for-Grangers chapter in linkffn(12713008), but well, I am not super keen on that.
