So glad to see this posted because I'd love these kind of recs too. The only one I can think of that comes close is linkffn(Haggis from Algernon by Rude Gus)

It's been a while, but the characters (Marauders + Lily) felt like teenagers when I read it. They do some goofy stuff and are generally bad at communication.
