The only one I know about which strictly satisfies your criteria is linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss by Ecmm), but I was not super excited by it.

Not exactly, what you ask for is however linkffn(Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89) and that is certainly great story, in my opinion one of the best outside of Hinny or Hermione main pairings. It has also lovely prequel.
