Both fics are redemptive. Leather pants might make an appearance, but it is not the usual "Draco is hot, they should shag" fic.

Canon-compliance:

Tissue of Silver was written before OOTP came out, which is why Narcissa's maiden name is different (not Black) and why Snape is a rich pure-blood. Draco turned spy under Snape's guidance in 5th or 6th year, which is why so many people want to kill him. Despite these deviations Tissue of Silver has really stood the test of time, it is one of the big H/D classics and definitely worth reading.

Reparations and Foundations was written post-DH, so it is canon-compliant except for the epilogue and Cursed Child.
