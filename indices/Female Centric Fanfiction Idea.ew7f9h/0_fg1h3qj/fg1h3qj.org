Lavender Brown. She's an awkward girl who substitutes gossip for social skills, and throughout her time at Hogwarts basically only manages to make two friends -- Parvati and Seamus (who everyone seems to forget was friends with Lavender). She spends the beginning of book five super conflicted, because Seamus pressures her to disbelieve Harry, but she's still one of the first to show up and one of the most eager to join the DA. She's also mentioned in the same breath as Ginny and Luna and Neville in book seven, being one of the most important members of the reconstituted DA. Then Greyback kills her more or less off-screen, and random people on the internet write several millions of pages of fanfiction where she is portrayed either as stupid and ditzy or as a minor antagonist, because what people remember her for is a disastrous relationship where she acts highly insecure as she realizes that her boyfriend is in love with another woman, told primarily through the lens of her romantic rival and her romantic rival's best friend.
