Id love to read a Ginny-centric story. Loved Annerb's The Changeling and its sequels. Go for it, and if you need any help, check out the Harryand Ginny discord page. A lot of greatg writers hang out there, including Annerb and FloreatCastellum and the DistantDusk and they are all great to ask advice from.
