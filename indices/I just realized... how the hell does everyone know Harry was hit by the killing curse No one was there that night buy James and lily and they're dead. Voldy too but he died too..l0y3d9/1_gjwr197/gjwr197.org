Everybody knows because Hagrid has a big mouth and hangs out in pubs all the time. (Remember, when he first took Harry to Diagon Alley, the first thing Tom the bartender asked was if Hagrid wanted his usual.)

I've read at least one story where Dumbledore had been planning to pretend Harry didn't survive, only to find out that while he was dropping Harry off on the porch, Hagrid was telling the story to a pub full of people and thus it was front page news.
