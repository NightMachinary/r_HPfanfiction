I think a fair bit of the story came from conspiracy and a convenient story. Plus, Harry surviving the killing curse is both an exciting/dark story with a beautiful simplicity. (No esoteric theory needed.)

It's widely believed Harry stopped Voldemort, whereas Harry was more collateral damage.

In this case:

1. Two adults die fitting the profile of the killing curse (the absence of cause of death indications). Both adults had personally challenged Voldemort.

   1. The baby survives, but has a mark on his forehead. Why would Voldemort leave a baby alive? Harry has a scar but not other traces of spell - thus it appears to be a killing curse that left a mark instead of causing death.
   2. Potentially witnesses to a flash of green light to the nursery? For unknown reasons, the Fidelius charm falls without Pettigrew dying - maybe he just releases it?
   3. The dark mark fades and Death Eaters fall into disarray. People imperius'd by Voldemort come to, those who want to fake imperious come forward.
   4. Hagrid blabs to everyone that Harry has been put into hiding - implying he needs to be protected from angry mobs despite the war ending.
   5. Sirius Black is convicted for murdering Safe Keeper Peter Pettigrew, reinforcing the idea that the Potters were specifically targeted.

2. Dumbledore doesn't challenge rumours as he wants to keep the prophecy a secret.

   1. The ministry launch on the story because it provides a tidy solution to their issues. The ministry definitely want to limit rumours that a new, traceless (bar scar) spell is potentially circulating.
   2. Nobody for Voldemort is found, implying some sort of backfire. The ministry propagate rumours that he died to reduce hysteria.
