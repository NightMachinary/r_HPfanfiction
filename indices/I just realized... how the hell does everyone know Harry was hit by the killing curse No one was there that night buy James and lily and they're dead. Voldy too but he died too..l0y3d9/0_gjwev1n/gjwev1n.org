1. Magic leaves traces.
2. Studying the wands and the most recent cast spells.
3. And finally, while it is never actually stated outright in the books... Harry's situation is not unique, just incredibly rare. Dumbledore and Voldemort both identified what happened after the fact. Voldemort may not have foreseen it due to not understanding love, but he was familiar enough with the concept that after his resurrection he stated what happened, verbatim. Dumbledore was familiar enough with everything to not only identify what went down, but to improve upon Lily's protection, ensuring it lasted at least until Harry was an adult.
