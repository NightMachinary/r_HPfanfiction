Dumbledore/Snape used leglimency on the child.

Or Perhaps they found Voldemort's body killed by a killing curse. It would be trivial to find that Voldemort died after Lily did. No one else could have been in the house due to the Fidelius. Harry had a "power he knows not" which informed Dumbledore that the child was responsible for Voldemort's demise. Combine these facts and the conclusion can be reached.
