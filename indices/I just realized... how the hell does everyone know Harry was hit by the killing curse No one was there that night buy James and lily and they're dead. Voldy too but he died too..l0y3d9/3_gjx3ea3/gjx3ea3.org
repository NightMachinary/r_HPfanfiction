Think about it. Voldemort was terrorizing the wizarding population. Suddenly he disappears one night. Soon people start speculating what happened, conspiracy theories start coming out.

The order is compartmentalized, but a few members in the order know that Voldemort attacked the potters, this information spreads, soon it's the most popular theory.

Information about Harry (a 1 year old baby surviving voldemort's curse) also circulates. It's so bizarre to think about, that it spreads like wildfire.

Wizards want to verify if the story they heard is true, they visit the Potters house, the proof is there, standing in front of them. The house in ruins, roof blown away.

Dumbledore hates all the conspiracy theories, and the attention Harry will be receiving. He silently moves Harry out of the wizarding world, not just to give Harry blood protection, but to also keep him away from all the attention till he is older.
