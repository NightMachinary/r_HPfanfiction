1. It left a mark on Harry because that's where he was tainted by Voldemort's soul

2. He almost certainly received word from the ministry or one of his spies that there was a massive explosion or burst of magic at Godric's Hollow, and given the only people of note that we know live at Godric's hollow are the potters and bathilda bagshot it's pretty easy to deduce what happened. I don't understand what you're asking here. Voldemort tried to kill an infant, his body and cloak were on the ground, dead, infant lives with a scar in the shape of the wand movement of the killing curse. It's pretty simple to deduce what happened
