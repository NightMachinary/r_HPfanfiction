Yes, I thought about it after writing it. Dumbledore has to know what Lily did before deciding to give Harry to the Dursleys. We also don't see him doing anything to the house before leaving, unless he returned after McGonnagal departed.

It would be very well within character for him to use legimency on Harry to figure out exactly what happened, but he would have to had suspected before hand.
