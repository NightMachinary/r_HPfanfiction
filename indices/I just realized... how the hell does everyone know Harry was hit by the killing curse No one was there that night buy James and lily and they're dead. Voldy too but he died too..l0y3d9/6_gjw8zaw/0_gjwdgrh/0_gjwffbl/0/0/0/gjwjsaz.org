Admittedly I did not consider that lol, but given the timeline presented in the books the first time that Dumbledore sees Harry after the attack is when Hagrid drops Harry off at Little Whinging,

Which is a full 24 hours after the attack and everyone is already celebrating the triumph of the Boy Who Lived

So unless I'm mistaken that theory doesn't pan out?
