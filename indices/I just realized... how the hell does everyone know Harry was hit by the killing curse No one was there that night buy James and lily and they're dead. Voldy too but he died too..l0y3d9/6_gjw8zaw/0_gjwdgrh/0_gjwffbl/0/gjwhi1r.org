You contradicted yourself, if the mark was left by Voldemort's Soul tainting him then it could not have been made by the Killing Curse as the Soul Shard could only exist after Voldemort was destroyed by the spell itself

Canon wise there was no body left behind either, just a destroyed house and a crying child as Pettigrew took the Wand and ran

Meaning the person who could guarantee Voldemort was in fact destroyed by his own Killing Curse was Harry, so once again how did Dumbledore know?

Snape arrived mere minutes after Voldemort was destroyed only to be interrupted by Sirius and flee, only for Sirius to not even make it to the door before Hagrid arrived and demanded he give Harry over to him as Dumbledore had ordered Harry be collected

This took place within the span of a few minutes at least after Voldemort being destroyed, given there was no sign of any Ministry Officials or Aurors it can not have been more then 20 minutes in total give or take

So once again, how did Dumbledore know to order Hagrid to collect Harry within literal minutes of the attack ending if he was not already aware of what occurred?

It was a complete set up
