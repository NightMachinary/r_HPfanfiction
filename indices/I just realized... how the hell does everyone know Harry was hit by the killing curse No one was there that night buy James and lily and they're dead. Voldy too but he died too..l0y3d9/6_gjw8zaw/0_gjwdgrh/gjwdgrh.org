But it its stated outright in Canon that the curse leaves no marks on any of it's victims, so why is there one on Harry?

Furthermore how did Dumbledore know, given he never went to the Cottage but instead sent Hagrid?

The only way for Dumbledore to truly know is for him to have placed some form of monitoring spell within the house itself or even one on Harry

which begs the question if he knew Voldemort was there and what spells he was using at that moment why did he not gather reinforcements to try and save the Potter's, instead he waits until after Voldemort is seemingly defeated before telling Hagrid to go get Harry, meaning he knows James & Lily are dead and that Harry somehow survived despite never going to the cottage itself

The whole thing screams of a set up, especially for Hagrid taking Harry from Sirius & flying from Godrics Hollow to Little Whinging but the entire wizarding populace have already spent the past 24 hours in a constant stream of parties celebrating Voldemorts miraculous defeat and praising Baby Harry

So where the hell did the Boy-Who-Lived story come from? Cant have been Hagrid as he was flying the motorcycle carrying Harry, cant have been Sirius as he was chasing after Pettigrew, doubtful its Snape given he was mourning Lily and it sure as hell wasn't Voldemort, which just leaves Albus as the only one who could have told people and yet he is the only one who Canonically never went to the Cottage in Godrics Hollow before, during or after the Attack

Entire thing reeks of a set up from start to finish
