This gets me too... Aside from the assumption that it was probably the killing curse and apperently it's the wand movement, you know, fine. Maybe it feels like a cursed scar? I dunno.

How did Dumbledore even know the house had been attacked?? And why did he send HAGRID?? Why didn't he go himself? Why was Hagrid there so quickly? Hagrid arrived just as the muggles were showing up meaning he has to had been there within minutes. As far as I know, Hagrid can't apperate.

I'm assuming the Potters had warning or something directly to Dumbledore if there wards were breached? Meaning Dumbledore had to send a message to Hagrid who had to portkey to the Potters? Since he has to borrow Sirius's motorbike to get back.

Why didn't Dumbledore go himself? And how did he get the message to Hagrid so fast?

Unless Dumbledore already knew Voldemort was going to kill them...
