The Potters weren't the only wizards living in Godric's Hollow. Bathilda Bagshot, a mentor to Dumbledore and friend to Lily, lived just down the street. Dumbledore has a phoenix and the ability to send a quick message via patronus. So Hagrid could have gone by floo, Fawkes, or a portkey delivered by Fawkes.

Hagrid is resistant to most spells and given that he knew they prophecy and Voldemort better than Voldemort knew himself (knew he'd kill Lily, Harry would survive, and that he'd come alone) I can see why he sent Hagrid and stayed at the school or headed to the Ministry.
