It's a plot hole.

But if you think about it an entire day passes from the night of Halloween to when Albus, Minerva and Hagrid drop Harry at Privet Drive, during this 24hr period Harry's location is unknown just as Dumbledore and Hagrid's is. It is unrealistic to assume that Hagrid when flying on the motorbike would take twenty four hours to cross the country, and by the time he hands Harry to Albus on Privet Drive Albus knows of the scar, suggesting that he has already seen Harry since that night.

Going from this it can be assumed that Hagrid returned to either an Order Safe House or Hogwarts before coming to Privet Drive and that during this time Dumbledore and possibly the Ministry investigated the cottage. We know that neither James or Lily used their wands against Voldemort and so Priori Incantatem would not yield information on what had occured. We also know that the Ministry can detect when someone's death is due to the killing curse, therefore it stands to reason that they can tell when it has been cast on someone, this in turn would lead to Albus discovering that Harry was hit with the curse and then he somehow discovered the Blood Protection and so should have been able to figure out what happened.

The fact that the Ministry can detect when the killing curse has been used on someone is obvious from the fact that they knew (rightly so according to Harry's memory) that Lily was killed with that curse and yet they could not have gotten the information from Voldemort's wand as Pettigrew had it.

If you think about it, it's entirely possible Voldemort was accompanied to the cottage by Pettigrew, I say this because we know that Voldemort's body was destroyed and that Peter had managed to get hold of Voldemort's wand.

If the Ministry had the wand then they would have destroyed it, it was the wand of the most feared Dark Lord in history and we all know how superstitious they are about wands and the wand picking the wizard, therefore it can be inferred that they would not want the wand to exist and risk corrupting another, even though this isn't what happened in the first place.

Once Albus realised that Harry had been hit with the curse and that Voldemort was destroyed he would have had to inform the Ministry THINK ABOUT IT a war was going on and he was a major figurehead. From there he most likely visited Harry and Hagrid while news that the Potter's were attacked and Harry survived began to circulate and so everyone figured it out because the Ministry was corrupt and could not keep the details Albus provided on the attack secret; remember at this point Death Eaters were positioned throughout Ministry departments.
