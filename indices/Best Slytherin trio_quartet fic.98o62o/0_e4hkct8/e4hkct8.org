I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12596856/1/The-Other-Side-of-the-War][this]] fanfiction about Draco, Nott, Blaise, and Pansy, and it's not a Draco/Pansy. It's about them dealing with adjusting to life after the war, but it is also very dark and has themes of abuse and such. It also has a young Scorpius.
