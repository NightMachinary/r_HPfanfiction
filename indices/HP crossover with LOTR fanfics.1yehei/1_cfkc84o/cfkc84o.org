[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6335808/1/The_Wizard_in_the_Shadows][The Wizard in the Shadows]] I have read this a long while ago, so I don't remember much. Harry is sent on a "vacation" ,turns up in Middle-Earth, turns slightly mad and fights orcs. Man, I think I'll reread that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2899679/1/To_Face_the_Wolf][To Face the Wolf]] This is a crossover not with LotR, but with the Silmarillion, but it's too good not to recommend here. A werewolf appears in Hogwarts, all are puzzled, Lupin is sympathetic, Snape doesn't trust the whole situation, and Hermione has to figure it out.

Edit: Just wanted to add that I found both of those fics via [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotter][TVTropes]]. I quite like the big list of recs.
