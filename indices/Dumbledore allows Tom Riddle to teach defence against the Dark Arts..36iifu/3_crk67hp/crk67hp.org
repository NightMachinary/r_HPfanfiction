Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure by Zalgo Jenkins is the only one I've found that is readable so far. Unfortunately it seems to be abandoned at only 17k. And Dumbledore didn't give riddle the job, Dippet did, but I assumed you were looking for the end result of riddle being a professor, not the way he got the job.

  More than two decades ago, Headmaster Dippet made the fateful decision to hire Tom Riddle as an associate Hogwarts professor. And now, at last, Riddle's double life as Lord Voldemort is threatening to bring the Wizarding World to its knees...if only he can convince his students to leave him alone.

Edit: I just read __Pers' recommendation and it was great so I second giving Reclamation by Sam Storeyteller a try.
