Try linkffn(The Refiner's Fire by Abraxan)

and it's sequel linkffn(The Time of Destiny by Abraxan)

These two books are over one million words of length in total, features a powerful Harry that is in the level of raw magic as Dumbledore but would still get his ass kicked, has no major cliches like manipulative dumbledore, bashing, “slytherin -gryffindor-Le Fay” cliches. It's also Hinny pairing and is very well written. Probably one of the best fics ive ever read
