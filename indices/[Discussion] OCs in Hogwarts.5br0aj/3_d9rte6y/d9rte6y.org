Ok, the basics.

Use a 'blank slate' character if at all possible. Hannah Abbott, Theo Nott and even Dean Thomas have very little said about them in canon. It shouldn't be hard to find a character that suits your needs. Failing that, find a Morag MacDougal or Oliver Rivers off Pottermore. Just none of this Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way bullshit.

Make the reader care about them / hate them. Easier said than done of course. Ideally, give them tangible goals that are inextricably linked/opposed to the protagonist's. Maybe give them a PoV scene. Give them flaws. Have them act out, show real emotion.

The three unforgivable OCs

- The Mary Sue dominates every scene. Like a black hole, they distort the fabric of plot and character around them.

- The Walking Infodump. Reading paragraphs of author headcanon is painful enough. It's even worse when it's coming from an author mouth piece with no relevance to the rest of the story.

- The Mysterious Old Man. Nothing more irritating than that smug idiot heckling the protagonist from the sidelines, with no characterisation, contributing nothing to the plot. Just don't do it.
