OCs have a strange roll in HP fanfiction. Within the Harry Potter world we have so many potential blank slate characters. Someone like Daphne Greengrass or Susan Bones are for all intents an purposes OCs that have cannon endorsement and some background. True OCs are therefore prone to stick out if they are inserted into the same age bracket as Harry and co. You can get away with it for other years as so few people are given explicit names.

What makes a good OC? Well in my opinion purpose. What purpose, well as a character they should have goals, something that they build to as a person not simply to solve plot holes you've found in cannon. They should also have purpose for the writer. A poor OC is one who is either Mary Sue and or an irrelevant character named after a friend because they wanted to feel involved. Never write in a character without being able to justify it. Why do they need to be there, what do they add? Re-read the Santi's Harry Potter and the boy who lived. The majority of people in that story are OCs or at least blank slates and its considered by many, myself included one of the best.

Interactions with the real characters, well that depends. What purpose do they have? Are you adding a mentor, a friend, a rival or what? Whatever it is the interaction should be fitting, or at least fitting for where they stand when they are introduced. People tend not to become instant friends if they have existing friends. Harry, Ron and Hermione are their own cliche, tight enough its probably intimidating, nobody should be able to simply waltz up and join. Friendships that appear overnight would feel false.
