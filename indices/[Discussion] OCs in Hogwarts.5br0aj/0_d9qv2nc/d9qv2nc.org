First off I think its important to note that an OC in this context does not equal a character made from scratch, which means that not all character development guidelines apply. An OC is supposed to fit into an already finished universe.

  What makes a good OC?

Basically what makes a good character. Agenda, Passions, Values, Quirks, Dreams. If most of these are relateable and interesting, people are going to enjoy the character. It sounds simple, but it is a lot of work to make a character that isn't an archetype, but who feels human to a degree.

  What are some common failings that most OC writers suffer?
#+end_quote

First and foremost, of course, the Mary Sue. But to that later. I think what most writers fail to do when they create a character is to make logical connections - cause and effect reasons - for the behavior of the character. Probably the best example here: Harry's childhood was loveless to a degree where people, rightfully, call emotional abuse and neglect. He has not known kindness from 1 year old onward until Hogwarts, yet he is kind and compassionate, even if he is a bit awkward about it sometimes. He needs to be in order to be the hero, but in light of his background it makes not much sense. If that is good or bad is an argument for another time, but in general a character should have a coherent development ending in his present personality.

The much more scarring failings I often encounter is the RPG character. I feel like a lot of writers in fanfiction write characters as if they're creating a new character for a D&D campaign, with stats and modifiers and the like. The result is a character with close to no personality, just like a fresh D&D character that hasn't been roleplayed yet.

Then at last you have the caricatures. Characters that are so emphasized on one trait that they are more the avatar of that trait than an actual character. Voldemort is such a caricature to some degree. He is an avatar of evil, literally incapable of love and he surrounds himself with more caricatures, such as Bellatrix who may be described as a representation of insanity. Bash-characters also fall under this category. A bashed Ron is stripped of any trait that isn't enforcing the notion that he is worthy of being ridiculed, humiliated and hated in general.

  How can one avoid the dreaded Mary Sue?
#+end_quote

Ever heard of "Kill your darlings"? Many Mary Sues are born because authors do either of two things. 1 - They self-insert (which is an absolute no-go. If you catch yourself self-inserting stop, erase and redo.) 2 - They love their character too much. Writers tend to make connections with their characters. Most of the time they'll like the protagonist and his sidekicks, hence they can't bring themselves to write any misfortune they succumb to, or bad they have inherently in themselves - they Mary Sue. There isn't really a method to prevent this. My tip to that is only: Give them a trait, or several at best, that harbor the potential for people to truly hate them for it. Give them weaknesses that may truly cripple them in some situations - that will take all of their willpower to overcome. Of course, standard "Keep your cool" applies, so no white hair and black eyes, no superfancy tattoos, no outfits straight from Hot Topic,... you know the drill. As long as it isn't plot relevant, don't make it an eyecatcher.

  How do you handle an OC's interactions with the cast?
#+end_quote

Logically. I really don't know what else to tell you. If I make a pure-blooded character who has grown up reading and hearing about Harry, some awe-isnpired reaction will follow. If I make a character who is polite and values politeness, he may get in trouble with Ron. If I write a character that is bubbly and "hands-on", that personality will probably clash with Hermione's views on books, studies and learning.

If that sometimes is too abstract to figure out, a good method is to imagine both characters as friends of yours and then try and imagine what they would talk about (or if they would talk at all).
