True. I probably lost the focus on fanfiction there for a moment. Self-Inserts in general are bad character development, and the more detached you are from the world and culture you're writing yourself into, the more jarring this will be.

But in fanfiction there is of course the case that people have daydreamed about being part of a world after reading the original material. Self-insert fics are offering this.

The point stands, however, that self-inserts have a tendency to be Mary Sues, as the author (and therefore the character) have an outside, omnipotent and all-knowing perspective on the story.
