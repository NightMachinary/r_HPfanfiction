Are you talking about OCs in Hogwarts or in HP fanfiction generally? I like OCs (I write them, so obviously I do), I think it's a step towards originality and I detest making canon characters OoC. But equally, I am not a fan of shoehorning an OC into canon events -- I don't think it's necessary. There are plenty of spaces and missing moments in canon where OCs can fit in seamlessly.

Mary-Sues? Well, there are so many definitions and interpretations of what really consititutes a Mary-Sue that I'm inclined to believe that they exist purely in the mind of the reader and that's out of your control. All you can do in your writing is persuade the reader to like your character -- and you won't always succeed anyway. Write the character who's living in your head and don't worry about anybody else.
