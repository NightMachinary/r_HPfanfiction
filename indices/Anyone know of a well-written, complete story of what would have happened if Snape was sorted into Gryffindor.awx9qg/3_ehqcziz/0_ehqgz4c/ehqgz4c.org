His relationship with James and Sirius (and maybe Remus & Pettigrew by association) probably wouldn't have been improved any. Instead of being a Slytherin, Snape would be a Gryffindor who was already on record (on the train ride) as stating that he preferred Slytherin and that Gryffindors are "brawny rather than brainy," i.e., stupid.

Maybe he and Peter would have been good friends and they could go off and be murderers together.
