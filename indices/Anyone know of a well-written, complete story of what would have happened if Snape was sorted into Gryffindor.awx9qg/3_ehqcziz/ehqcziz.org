Snape would almost certainly be a completely different person.\\
A halfblood Gryffindor is unlikely to end up friends with death eaters (well people who will grow up to become them and very much held their views), the fact is the future death eaters likely wouldn't have really spoken to him if he wasn't a slytherin, and with the house rivalry they'd likely have been somewhat hostile to him.

This means he never calls Lily a mudblood, never joins the death eaters, never spies on the prophecy putting Lily in danger and consequently never becomes a spy.\\
Those events are what really shaped him, they gave him his personality and motives.

Now some things might be the same, there's a chance he would still have been somewhat antagonistic with James (because both would still want Lily), though it may well not be to the same extent (his death eater leanings, future death eater friends and even being a slytherin clearly made him seem an acceptable target to the marauders, and perhaps more importantly, only James would really have an issue with him, Sirius wouldn't have reason to hate him enough to send him into the clutches of a werewolf etc.

As for changes to others, there's every chance that either: the prophecy is never partially overheard, and if as some suspect it's self fullfilling it may well never come true and Voldemort may win, alternatively someone else overhears, but they wouldn't run to Dumbledore when they found out the target, nor would they ask Voldemort to spare Lily. This means that there would be no fidelious and betrayal (so if Peter is still a spy he wouldn't be exposed), and depending on how important Voldemort asking Lily to step aside and her chance of survival was, she might not save Harry with her sacrifice, and again Voldemort wins.\\
Of course Voldemort might not win, it might be that he still fails when he attacks Harry, in which case You'd have a story where Harry actually has his godfather and parent's friends in his life. I think it unlikely Peter would try anything, he's clearly the type to join the winning side if given the opportunity, so he'd probably just do his best to hide the fact he was a spy.
