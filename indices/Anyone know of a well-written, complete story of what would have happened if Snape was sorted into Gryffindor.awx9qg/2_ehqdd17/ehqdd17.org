The only thing close I have is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/]])

let's go though the checklist;

- well written? that's subjective but I enjoyed it
- complete? yes
- Snape in Gryffindor? yes
- Snape turned into a different person? yes
- completely avoids talking about the other things because snape is a time traveler and has been told by the Grim Reaper that halloween 1981 must go the same way? yes
