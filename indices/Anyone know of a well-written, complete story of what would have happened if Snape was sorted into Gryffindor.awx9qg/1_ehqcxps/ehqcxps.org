Firstly, sorting hat never made mistake. With the given data it can read from a mind of a eleven year old, it did fairly well.

The problem is people often mistake "courageous" with "good". What Peter lacked wasn't courage, but loyalty and moralfiber. Peter Pettigrew had enough courage to do what was needed to facilitate Voldemort's return... I mean, it's not like chopping your own right hand for a dark ritual is an easy task.

And second, Snape /could/ have been sorted in Gryffindor. It's not like he had zero courage. But more than courage, he had ambition and he was inordinately attracted to dark arts. That's why he was sorted into Slytherin. But yeah the possibility of him getting sorted into Gryffindor exists.

His relationship with Lily would have been same. Mind you, Lily and Snape were close friends even when he is Slytherin, until he joined Voldemort.

But then again, Lily would have known about his vindictive nature lot sooner, so their relationship would have gone sour even earlier. It all depends on particular events.

But one thing is for sure. He wouldn't have gotten place in death eaters. Even if he joined, he wouldn't have gotten into their inner circle with ease like he did in canon.
