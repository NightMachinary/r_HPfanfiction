I'm not sure if his falling out with Lily would have happened at all.

Snape wouldn't be living in a house full of people who will judge him for every interaction with her. There wouldn't be peer pressure to call her a mudblood. He would be a /lot/ less likely to fall in with the Death Eater crowd. The marauders wouldn't necessarily like him, but they wouldn't be able to hold being a Slytherin against him, so that escalation of viciousness would be severely reduced. I kind of doubt that McGonagall or Gryffindor house in general would let the marauders have nearly as much slack if they really targeted a fellow gryffindor, nor would Snape have as much room to respond in kind.
