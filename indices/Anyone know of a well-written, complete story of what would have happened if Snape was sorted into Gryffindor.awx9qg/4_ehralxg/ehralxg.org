  We know that the sorting hat occasionally makes mistakes.

Do we? Who are you thinking of?

IMHO the Hat making a mistake is only a trope in fanon and not present in canon. I'm not against the idea of a sorting mistake as a plotline but in fanfiction it's only ever used in the most assinine of ways, like "Hermione should've been in Ravenclaw" or "Neville should have been in Hufflepuff", completely missing the point of their characterisation.
