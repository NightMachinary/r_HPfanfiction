[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]] has a very different Year 1.

Harry and Lockhart solved most problems on their own in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]].

Harry was raised by Sirius in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]] and never went to Hogwarts. He hires Ginny to accompany him on some adventures after the war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]] is Muggle AU and a nice Harry/Ginny romance. Dumbledore and Voldemort don't exist here.

Finally, James and Lily get to raise Harry themselves in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]. Dumbledore lives until 2015 in this fic, but he's completely overwhelmed by the turn of events and hopelessly outmatched by his adversaries. He can't even control rogue elements within his Order. He and Harry never met.
