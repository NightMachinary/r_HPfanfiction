I'll stand behind a second rec for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11104321][The Magic Words]].

I recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655][Hogwarts Battle School]] as well. It doesn't exactly leap straight to a relationship, but that's because it's busy being awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10914042][Sympathetic Properties]] is in an interesting position. It has many risk factors for the standard manipulative Dumbledore storyline, but it keeps on being good anyway. The Granger family dynamic is a treat; be on the lookout for that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542][Patron]] is more than a little AU. It puts some distance between the cultures of Muggle Britain and the Wizarding world. Variations on the fourth-year tournament events.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718][The Hogwarts Strike Team]]. You might have been thinking this list wouldn't feature any time travel. Premise: Voldemort left a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch][dead man's switch]], time travel became necessary.

These are all relatively near the top of my alerts list, so they'll update before too long.

I know what you said about complete, but you might not have read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]. Or you might not think it has much H/Hr.
