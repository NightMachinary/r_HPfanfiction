[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548714/1/Screams-Part-One][The Screams Series]] is technically unfinished as the most recent update is in progress. I hope cloneserpents chooses to finish it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap][Harry Potter And the Quantum Leap]] by seel'vor doesn't age all that well, but it's well worth a look if you like the H/Hr pairing.

I'd also humbly submit my own work in progress: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11104321/1/The-Magic-Words][The Magic Words]]. Shameless self-promotion FTW!

You mentioned that you had read most everything on ff.net so I was wondering if you'd also checked out [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=toplist][portkey]]. It has several excellent fics that I hope you enjoy reading.
