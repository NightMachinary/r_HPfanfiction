I think he would. Tom had already committed multiple murders at that point AND would have just killed Ginny Weasley. I don't think he'd tell anyone (except maybe Snape) or involve the Ministry. Ginny's death would be blamed on the basilisk.

Honestly, though I feel like Tom would have gotten away after draining Ginny and the two Riddles would be fighting each other.
