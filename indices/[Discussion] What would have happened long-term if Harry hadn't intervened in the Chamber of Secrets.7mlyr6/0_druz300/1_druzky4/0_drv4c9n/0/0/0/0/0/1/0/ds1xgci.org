Would that work, though? Technically, if Diarymort made Horcruxes, they'd be Horcruxes for /himself/, though --- tethering /him/ to the world if the physical diary came to be destroyed --- they wouldn't technically be Horcruxes for Originalmort. ...Does Diarymort himself still act as an anchor even if he's no longer in the Diary? Something to ponder.
