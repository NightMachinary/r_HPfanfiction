All we know for sure is this:

#+begin_quote
  *Interviewer:* In 'Chamber of Secrets', what would have happened if Ginny had died and Tom Riddle had escaped the diary?

  *Rowling:* I can't answer that fully until all seven books are finished, but it would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably.
#+end_quote

From this we can infer that Diarymort /would/ have joined forces with the present-day Voldemort rather than fought him, because having the distraction of another him trying to kill him would /not/ have "strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably".
