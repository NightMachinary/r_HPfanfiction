I hadn't considered new Riddle as a point of view character because of my own biases; that could be an equally intriguing perspective on the Harry Potter universe. Especially if, as you suggest, he's more diplomatic the second time around.

In addition to Fudge and Dumbledore not being antagonists yet, Fudge likes problems that go away quietly and Dumbledore would offer that.
