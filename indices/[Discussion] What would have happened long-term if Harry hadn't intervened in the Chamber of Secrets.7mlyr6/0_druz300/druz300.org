1) I think that the Diary is using Ginny to return the horcrux to a body. Once it's complete, the horcrux is in the new body and the diary is no longer a horcrux, so no replication ad infinitum.

2) If Dumbledore captures him and not the ministry, he'd put the pieces together about horcruxes (I think the diary was his first clue in canon) and destroy Young Riddle, knowing he's not actually a person. If it's the ministry, Fudge still trusts Dumbledore atm and would take his advice as long as it got rid of the problem quietly.

3) (If Dumbledore hasn't killed him) Young Riddle would be disappointed by Old Riddle's failures and would see him as an obstacle to his own goals. At this point however, he's too weak to take him on, so he'd either hide or try to finagle his way into the good books of the good guys and fight Riddle. Old Riddle would seek to kill Young Riddle as soon as he discovered his existence. It would be his priority even over killing HP. Alternatively, Young Riddle might shift his goals on world domination to more 'diplomatic' means, having witnessed that magical might does not guarantee success.

Number 3 would be an interesting story. 17 y.o. Riddle navigating the world and deciding at which point to diverge from Old Riddle's path and by how much, what to do about HP, Dumbledore, horcruxes, etc. I personally find that idea more interesting than the one you proposed, but only because I prefer fics set during the book years.
