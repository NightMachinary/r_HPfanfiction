Mizuni-sama's "Prince of the Dark Kingdom" has a great take on how Diary-Riddle would act after being brought back into corporeal form. It's a 7 "book" series that is very heavily AU, where Voldemort won the first war and rules Wizarding Britain in a greatly expanded magical world. While it's one of my favourite fics, it's unfortunately unfinished at 1253k words.
