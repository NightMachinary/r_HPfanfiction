it was one of theories about his survival, yeah. as stated by Distaly, it was mentioned by snape in hbp and in the writing about draco on pottermore

  Like every other child of Harry Potter's age, Draco heard stories of the Boy Who Lived through his youth. Many different theories had been in circulation for years as to how Harry survived what should have been a lethal attack, and *one of the most persistent was that Harry himself was a great Dark wizard.* The fact that he had been removed from the wizarding community seemed (to wishful thinkers) to support this view, and Draco's father, wily Lucius Malfoy, was one of those who subscribed most eagerly to the theory. It was comforting to think that he, Lucius, might be in for a second chance of world domination, should this Potter boy prove to be another, and greater, pure-blood champion.
