  I think you're confusing 'many' with a couple of loud rumours.
#+end_quote

This is true. While the rumors were persistent, there is no evidence that they were by any means the majority. It was most likely limited to paranoid people or Knockturn Alley types. The thing is, Slytherin is not lacking in either kind of people, and if everyone at Hogwarts has /heard/ these rumors, even if they dismissed them, it's likely that the more impulsive of them would condemn Harry immediately based on his Sorting. Ron certainly comes to mind. Another question is whether it was common knowledge that Dumbledore had been in charge of Harry's placement. People ignorant of Dumbledore's influence in Harry's life might easily have assumed that Harry was taken in by dark wizards.

  You and so many Slytherin Harry authors are forgetting he's eleven.
#+end_quote

While I agree that almost all Slytherin Harry authors conveniently ignore Harry's mental maturity at 11, I don't think I am doing that at all. My post is about other people's assumptions about Harry, not how Harry himself would act as a Slytherin. I'm pretty convinced that Harry would have no clue what he was getting into and would simply react naively. It's made pretty clear that Harry had never had any friends before meeting Ron, and it's heavily implied that 11-year-old Harry is deeply impressionable. He consistently accepts whatever the first person who tells him about a topic says, and then sticks to his guns after that. I think he was pretty lucky that Dumbledore sent Hagrid to go fetch him, as this basically guaranteed that Harry would be on Dumbledore's side. I have little patience for fics that give Harry his own lofty independent ambitions before puberty. And he certainly wouldn't have the social skills to navigate Slytherin House without making several powerful enemies.

  Dumbledore would almost certainly looked into the Dursley's more had Harry been sorted into Slytherin.
#+end_quote

I agree with this. It never makes any sense when it turns out in fanfiction that Dumbledore never cared about Harry's treatment or had some stake in having him be mistreated.

  The fact that Malfoy Sr ditched the diary shows he doesn't anticipate the Dark Lord returning to claim it,

I think it shows the opposite, actually, but that's rather off-topic. I linked to an essay explaining why in my response to Distaly above.
