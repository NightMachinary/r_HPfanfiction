I thought that essay was almost completely wrong. On the rumours front I would suggest the opposite kind of people would be the rumour spreading lot. Throughout his time at Hogwarts Harry had the most image trouble with Hufflepuffs. Slytherin disliked him and knocturn alley types almost certainly would know what dark was and should be better in formed. In the forth book it's dotty Doris or whatever who spreads the nasty rumours about Frank the gardener. It's idle people with too much time.
