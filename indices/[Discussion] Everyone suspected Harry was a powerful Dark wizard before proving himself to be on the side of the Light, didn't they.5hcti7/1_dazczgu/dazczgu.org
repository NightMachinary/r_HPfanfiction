I think you're confusing 'many' with a couple of loud rumours. There is no evidence that anyone took them seriously. Harry Potter is the person to ever survive the killing curse. The first, something must be strange about him but nobody knows how a child at one could do it. Any sensible person would tell you that it was a fluke or something done by his parents. Only the nutters and conspiracy theorists would call him a dark wizard. When he re-enters the wizarding world at eleven he's a small, quiet mystery trying his best to fit it. Being sorted into Slytherin would have had people ask more questions about his upbringing than him being evil. You'll get rumours sure but nobody who matters would care about him, he's eleven. If however you found that he was forced to become cunning and distance due to his upbringing then people would try and guide his future. Nobody knows where he has been. Dumbledore hid him away, stories have been written about his adventures but at no point would they care about what he has to say. Hogwarts is its own little fiefdom with Dumbledore in charge, nobody can touch Harry there and its unlikely he wouldn't be sent back to the Dursleys at the end of summer.

Draco and Harry don't like each other. That much happened before the sorting. It is unlikely that after what happened on the train Draco would take that lying down, they would be bitter and likely it would be like the Harry/Seamus drama in fifth year where they dislike each other but mostly ignore each other. You and so many Slytherin Harry authors are forgetting he's eleven. People might seek to guide his growth, to groom him but it is unlikely that he himself has any real ambitions set in stone at eleven. Draco might wield his father's projected power to make Harry's life harder and it would be strange for Mr Malfoy to try and reverse this open antagonism, if anything he would likely try and isolate Harry even more.

Dumbledore would almost certainly looked into the Dursley's more had Harry been sorted into Slytherin. Dumbledore wants Harry loved and cared for, he would want to know why Harry was sorted there and I doubt he would be happy to learn that Harry lived in a cupboard. You'll likely find that if anything Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing even more to guide him away from people like Draco. An ambitious cunning Harry who Dumbledore personally guides would be far more interesting than some poor attempt at child grooming by Malfoy Sr, anyone could tell Harry that the Malfoys would hate him and he being a Slytherin would be more cautious. Remember that when Harry returned only Dumbledore and a few others knew Voldemort would return. The fact that Malfoy Sr ditched the diary shows he doesn't anticipate the Dark Lord returning to claim it, why plan around controlling Harry Potter when he is nothing but a novelty. 'Pure blood' society is a fanon thing and I doubt Harry Potter age eleven is very interesting outside of being the boy-who-lived.
