You're right that's the implied reason, but if it were the only reason, why would Dobby have been so concerned about Harry specifically, unless he had overheard the "plot" to make terrible things happen at Hogwarts? I think Lucius had been playing with the idea of handing the Diary off to Harry since sometime during first year, once it was clear that Harry was not valuable as a potential ally. There's also the fact that Lucius was getting impatient with Borgin, saying he had important business elsewhere, yet, we see him again not long after just hanging around at the bookstore, seemingly waiting around for the Weasleys and Harry. It is possible that selling the Diary off to Borgin was a last-ditch effort that failed, and then it was back to Plan B--offloading it onto Harry. It just happened to be that he got in a fistfight with Arthur, and he changed his mind at the last second.
