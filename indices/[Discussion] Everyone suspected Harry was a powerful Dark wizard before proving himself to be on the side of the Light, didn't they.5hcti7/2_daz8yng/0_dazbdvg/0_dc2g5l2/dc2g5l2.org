Didn't Lucius only need to get rid of the Diary because of some new Ministry law about dark magic items? I think that was the given reason for why he tried to offload it at Borgin and Burkes, where no one would have written in it and it probably wouldn't have been used as a weapon that year, which he was only unable to do because Borgin knew Tom Riddle was Voldemort.
