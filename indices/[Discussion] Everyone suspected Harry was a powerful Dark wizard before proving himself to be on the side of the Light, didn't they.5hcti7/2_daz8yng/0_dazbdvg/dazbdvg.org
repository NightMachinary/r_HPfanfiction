Thanks for the lengthy response! I disagree that that quote by Snape (”I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack.”) is unreliable, because he is referring to stories and rumors, not his own opinions. This is enough to explain the antagonism towards Harry in CoS, and it's a simpler explanation as well.

The fact that rumors were circulating around Harry at that time also explains why Lucius waited until his second year to plant the Diary, as explained in [[https://hpcompanion.com/essays/csessay/][this essay.]]

As for Light/Dark, yeah, I agree it's mostly fanon, though there are a few references to it in the books, just not as this big Star-Wars-esque conflict. TBH, I was just using it as a shorthand.

I put "pureblood society" in scare quotes because it is fanon for the most part. There are canon things such as the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but those things are never fleshed-out. It only makes sense that Harry would become more familiar with these things if he were in Slytherin, even if he ends up rejecting them.
