I have just read PS again a few weeks ago and I dont remember either of the things you just pointed out. You say it was idespread that people tought him to be "dark" but there is no canon evidence for that. On the top of my had I only remember Snape saying it to Bellatrix in HBP and he would have said anything to discredit Harry in that situation.

You say even Dumbledore had his doubts until Harry showed he was "light-oriented" (btw the whole dark-light already is pretty much completly created by fans) but as far as I remember he always was behind Harry, always. The stuff with the parselmouth is easily explained, a bunch of childrean in school have just 'lost' a few class members and suddenly this famous dude is revealed to have an ability that only the evil have, therefore he must be evil. That this logic is flawed doesnt really matter when you are 12.

How would Dumbledore have reacted? Propably the same, the Malfoys? Propably the same consindering Harry had already made Draco an enemy before the sorting. I even doubt Snape would be very conflicted in the end, his hate for James is pretty much limitedless.

And last, what is this Pureblood society you are speaking of? I mean if something like this is included by the author (which happens often in Slytherin!Harry fics) it has only two consequenzes:

1. All ELEVEN year old childrean are expected to be political masterminds and only act in favor of there family. Does anyone really belive thats how politics word?
2. Harry becomes really important for the politics despite being evelen and therefore having the voice of an little girl. Seriously no one would take his words for anything other than amuse.

There are of course still fics like what you search (although I cant recommend one), they just have the problems of being far from canon and being bad.
