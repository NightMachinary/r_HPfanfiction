I would think the Malfoys would wait patiently, maybe even attempt to have another child (daughter) so they can marry into the Potter-line.

Snape would be just as nasty to Harry, as most people who see themselves when they look at someone, see someone they hate. And a closed off boy that is really good at every wand-related subject (if you go by most fanfictions that put him in Slytherin) would definitely remind Snape of himself at that young of an age.

I would like to challenge the theory of Dumbledore attempting to convert Harry. I actually think that it would be the opposite. Dumbledore was always a realistic person with a touch of optimism, it's highly likely that he expected Harry to get into Slytherin, due to sending him to the Dursley's. Maybe, that was what he wanted, a Harry that thirsted for the magical world, wanted to learn every subject with a wand that he could. Harry getting into Slytherin would give Dumbledore hope, and maybe even the will to train him.

The others in Slytherin house would constantly bully him, and he would regularly be challenged to duels simply for impeding on the Slytherin 'honour'. Harry naturally not having the forces of the Weasleys behind him, would just leave it be and not rise to the bait, we can assume he had to deal with people like that in school.

I have no idea about the ministry, since the ministry itself was generally incompetent in canon, and I cannot gauge any character from there other than Tonks.
