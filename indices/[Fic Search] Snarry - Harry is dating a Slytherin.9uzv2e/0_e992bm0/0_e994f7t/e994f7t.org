Yes but I seem to remember that the students like Harry, Ron, Draco and Hermione are at Hogwarts because they skipped a year because of the war. It was Blaise to start thinking Harry and Draco are dating, I seem to remember that Hermione ask Draco if Harry is any good in the sack :) at the end Snape answer this question.
