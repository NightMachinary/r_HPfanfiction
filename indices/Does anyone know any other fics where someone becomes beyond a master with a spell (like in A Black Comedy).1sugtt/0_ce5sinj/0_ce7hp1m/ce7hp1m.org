Thanks, sounds good. No wonder I haven't heard of it, I typically stick to Harry/OC/Other series/show/movie character centric fics, but I'll be sure to give it a shot.

Thanks. As for super fic, I'd say black comedy is sort of, , but the backstory is pretty much the same as the cannon series.

To be fair, even cannon Harry after the final battle might be considered super Harry, as with the you know what from his scar gone, many fics theorize that he would be more powerful as it is somewhat likely it screws up his abilities possibly even siphoning some of his magic. Sound logic I'd say, though we don't get any proof in cannon as the final battle wasn't about spellpower but about wand loyalty.
