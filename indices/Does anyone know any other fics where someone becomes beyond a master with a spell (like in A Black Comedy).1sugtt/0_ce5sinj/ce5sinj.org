In this story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8776626/1/Patronus-Totalus]]

It's Hermione who goes beyond mastering the patronus charm, effectively becoming a patronus herself. (The story is complete.)

Seems to fit what you're looking for, but it's not a super!fic like I believe a Black Comedie is, if I'm not mistaken.
