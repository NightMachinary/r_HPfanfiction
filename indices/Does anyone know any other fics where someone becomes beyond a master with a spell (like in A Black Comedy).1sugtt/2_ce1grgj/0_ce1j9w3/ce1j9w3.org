  I would be interested to see more people writing new magic systems that have "realistic" and balanced things to bring to the HP 'verse, especially if Harry doesn't instantly master them for no goddamn reason. Instead of inventing new spells, it would be nice to see more authors coming up with something that isn't simply Runes/Gift of a questionable god/Wandless magic/Animagus nonsense/Bloodline of a generic magical creature.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] brings an extended system of magic to Harry Potter and explains within the context of that system much of the difference between ordinary wizards and the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore. Also, Harry's becoming Dumbledore's apprentice and learning this magical system makes him the target of a secret society who seeks to protect such magic. This leads to his life being screwed over pretty badly.

Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels also vastly extend the Harry Potter magical system with other parallel systems of magic. While Harry is over-the-top (his defeat of Voldemort is an afterthought compared with the more serious threats), there are plenty of others far more buff than he.

You might be able to appreciate another of nonjon's stories, the novella [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]], where another magical system is developed alongside the canon HP one.

  As a final thought, if you like the invisible hands thing, it might just be a straight ripoff of "Elfen Lied". I was never able to slog through the first five chapters or so of A Black Comedy, so I'm not aware of this exact ability. In any case, that anime is okay and the manga is quite good, if you happen to be looking for more invisible hands action (though that certainly wasn't exactly what you said you were looking for in your post).

Actually, it was homage to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Octopus][Doc Ock]] from Spiderman. (nonjon is not much of an anime/manga fan.)
