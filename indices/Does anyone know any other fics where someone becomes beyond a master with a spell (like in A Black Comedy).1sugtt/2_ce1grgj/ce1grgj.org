That seems like a very generic SuperHarry sort of thing and not that hard to find. Excuses vary, but the basics remain the same. You might be able to do a search for "master" or "super!Harry" and find tons on FFN.

Unless you mean non-spell magical abilities in general? Because Harry just being awesome at magic for no reason resulting in non-canon effects is really common, mostly some set of spells he's "mastered" and can now +use+ abuse the effects of to wandlessly spank a useless Dumbledore in a cringe-inducing "climactic" scene.

I would be interested to see more people writing /new/ magic systems that have "realistic" and balanced things to bring to the HP 'verse, /especially/ if Harry doesn't instantly master them for no goddamn reason. Instead of inventing new spells, it would be nice to see more authors coming up with something that isn't simply Runes/Gift of a questionable god/Wandless magic/Animagus nonsense/Bloodline of a generic magical creature.

The few times I've seen the rare truly original and well thought-out idea, its almost always worked quite well. Tellingly, in those stories Harry usually /doesn't/ master those new magics. Sometimes, and in some of the BEST fics, the new magical ideas are used simply to /totally/ screw him over, which really seems more true to canon themes.

Speaking of, JKR wrote almost nothing about magic itself, so that seems like a really wide open area to explore without just saying over and over again how awesome Harry is now that he has "mastered" a charm that is usually taught to 14-year-olds in school over perhaps a week's study time, or how he can now somehow shoot lasers from his arse without even trying for no clearly explained reason.

But people look for different things in fics, and that sort of power fantasy just isn't my thing. Obviously.

As a final thought, if you like the invisible hands thing, it might just be a straight ripoff of [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied]["Elfen Lied"]]. I was never able to slog through the first five chapters or so of /A Black Comedy/, so I'm not aware of this exact ability. In any case, that anime is okay and the manga is quite good, if you happen to be looking for more invisible hands action (though that certainly wasn't exactly what you said you were looking for in your post).
