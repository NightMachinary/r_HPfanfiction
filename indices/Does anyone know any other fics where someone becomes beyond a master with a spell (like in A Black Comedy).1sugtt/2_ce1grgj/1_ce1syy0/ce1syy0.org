Well, thanks for the recommendation of manga.

As for the powers being too powerful, I'd of course prefer balance unlike in the Black Comedy (While it was stated that people got mastery of spells on occasion like Harry, Harry was the sole modern person with an ability of that level. It wasn't really all powerful, it had limits of distance, and the invisible hands didn't save him from the veil of death despite his best efforts. In essence, all it did for the most part was allow him to use rubble and such to block curses, and allow him easy victory in very close combat which isn't the norm for wizards duels; since typically they're far longer ranged than he'd be able to use the hands offensively)

I wouldn't mind seeing Voldie having an mastery as well as Harry, such as being able to rip out the souls/magic of people and ingest their magic adding it to their own for instance (Which happens in the Bearers of the Light duology ) (And while it isn't said in the duology, I'm theorizing it's his vast experience, knowledge and such with the Avada Kedavra spell allowed him to do so), I'm all for a semi-fair fight.
