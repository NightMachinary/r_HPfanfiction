  Harry is lost back in time with four people he felt he really should remember...with no memory and only seven books to find out the truth of his life, before it's too late to save his new family. A reading the book series with no actual book usage, for a copy that does contain parts of the book easier to follow along, shoot me your email address and I'll send it along.
