Ah are you the author? It's amazing! I just finished it and I really loved it. I love your Ron especially, despite Hermione saying he had an emotional range of a teaspoon, Ron was really the most social of the 3 in the books. He managed to befriend both Harry and Hermione who were anti-social oddballs lol. I can see him as a mind healer because he has a way of drawing people out of their shells. Really great fic! I loved every minute
