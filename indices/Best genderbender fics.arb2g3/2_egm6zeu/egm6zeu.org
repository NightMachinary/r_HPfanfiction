Linkffn(Gryffindor's Girl) is one of the best fem!Harry fanfictions I know of, if not /the/ best. I've ranted about its greatness multiple times on here, but not a whole lot of people seem to pay attention to said rants. Which is a shame, really.

Linkffn(11654455; 5883303) are the best fem!Harry one-shots imo. Not a Girl also had me pretty much crying by the end of it, which is something pretty unheard of for me when it comes to fanfiction.

Also, linkffn(12902633) is the best male!Ginny fanfic I've seen (and the only one where only Ginny is genderbended). It's also a one-shot.
