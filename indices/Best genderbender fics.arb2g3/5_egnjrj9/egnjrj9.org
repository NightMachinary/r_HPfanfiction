How has no one mentioned the best two yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The-Pureblood-Pretense]] - This one is fairly AU in general, but the writing is top notch. Basically the premise is Riddle never became voldemort, and instead went the politics route, and succeeded heavily. Muggleborns and Halfbloods aren't allowed at Hogwarts and need to go elsewhere, such as America which is much more liberal. Since there was no war, Fem!Harry's parents are both alive, and Sirius never went to prison, so he got married and had a son. However Harry really wants to attend Hogwarts and Sirius son really wants to attend the American school, so they swap places despite that being super illegal. Sounds kind of weird but it's super interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]] - This fic is difficult to describe, and a bit polarizing as it is very surreal at times. But if you like the author's writing style it is great. Basically in this fic Death (the actual being, so not a MoD fic) is reborn as a Fem!Harry, and is thus incredibly powerful. However she doesn't remember being death previously and doesn't really know how to use said power effectively, and also doesn't really understand most normal humans, and as such there is still a lot of character based conflict as she can't just use her OPness to solve all her problems. In the fic she lives the life of being the girl who lived and is just constantly frustrated with all the bullshit that makes her have to deal with, which is very entertaining.

There's also a a Fem!Harry Naruto crossover that I like a lot. It's pretty early on thus far, as the author is rewriting a fic they started several years ago, but they are apparently much further along in the rewrite than what they have posted thus far, so it should at least get steady chapters for a while. I liked the original fic too, but this one is definitely better written as the author has improved over the years.
