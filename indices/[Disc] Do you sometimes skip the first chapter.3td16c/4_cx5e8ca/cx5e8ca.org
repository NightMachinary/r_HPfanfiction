After thinking about it for a bit, here's my conclusion.

Though Rowling didn't make a completely airtight narrative throughout her books, she did describe her characters well enough that on point x on the canon timeline, we, as readers, have a decent idea of how the characters in the story can turn out based on their previous actions and such. However, many slightly AU writers forget this and think that they can arbitrarily change everything past said point x w/o considering what has happened beforehand. I feel like that's why complete reboots/changes to base canon are easier to read since much of the story is showing what sort of wizarding world Harry will discover this time and allows OOC to be slightly more acceptable.
