This is a really cool thing to know about writing, thanks. I have never attempted writing fanfiction but I'm thinking about it and you hit the nail on the head on articulating what it is I find really annoying in most fanfics I eject out of - "And Harry felt a tug and went whirling around dimensions for two paragraphs and we spent four more learning the favorite colors and biographies of the bronze Ravenclaw trio".
