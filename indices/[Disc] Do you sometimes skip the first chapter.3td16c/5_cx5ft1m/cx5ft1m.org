As a reader? No. As a writer? Yes.

Example: Imagine I start writing a time travel fic. My goal is to focus on the interaction of Harry and other Hogwarts students.

In this scenario I could either write a chapter about how his live is in the future, the resulting twist that sends him back in time, him being confused about the change, him starting to make changes and then finally arriving in Hogwarts.

Or, since none of these things are so unpredictable that a reader wouldn't be able to fill in the gaps, I could simply start with “And here I was, dangling my far too short legs from the chair, waiting to be sorted in to a house for the second time. Time travel sucks, especially in situations where all you do is wait for information that you technically already know.“

Tada, 2-3 introduction chapters compressed into two sentences! If there's something I find worth mentioning I can always push Harry into a similar situation and make him remember things.

As an author 'skipping chapters' is not only allowed, in many cases it's necessary.

But as a reader? No. I'll assume that the author has a reason for his first chapter, that he'll drop hints of what is yet to come. If the first chapter then only is canon rehashing, I'll know the rest will be similar, in which case I don't skip a chapter, but the whole fic.
