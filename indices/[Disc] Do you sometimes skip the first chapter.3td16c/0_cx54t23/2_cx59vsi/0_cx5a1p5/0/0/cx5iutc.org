I feel like the Dresden Files series is this way. I decided to start the series because of a "buy two, get one free" sale the bookstore was having. Later I was so glad it happened this way because I wouldn't have continued past the first book or two if I hadn't already owned the third. Luckily I loved the third and now it's one of my favorite series.
