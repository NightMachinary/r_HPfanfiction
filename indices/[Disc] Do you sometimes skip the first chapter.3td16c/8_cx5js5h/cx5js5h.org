I skip the first chapter many times, especially if it's time travel or AU setup. Oftentimes because these kind of fics have a very corny or cheesy lines filling up the first few chapters. like:

"War was won but everyone is dead...blah blah.....Phoneix....blah blah.......second chance."

It feels like an awkward narration that we sometimes see in movies. I just hope that author has a good premise and the quality of fic improves over time. If something in later chapters causes any confusion, I quickly skim over the first chapter.
