There are times when I skip way, way more chapters.

Its rarely the first one. I respect that the author wants to set the scene, even if its at first just a slight divergence from the original plot.

But what I definitely skip are "Harry goes shopping", "Harry does workout" or other Grind-LevelUp-Chapters with the protagonist just doing some montage-style makeover. Extra points if he gets tattoos and starts smoking.
