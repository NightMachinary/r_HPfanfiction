  She meets a pack of Australian muggles at a pub in Barcelona; they tell her that they're staying in a youth hostel with bunk beds and communal bathrooms and rat traps in the hallways---and she sneers in response, half-cocked and semi-automatic, but then a bottle of Absinthe is produced from an Army-issue canvas knapsack and she's being handed a fire-filled glass and told to â€˜say hi to the green fairy' and the lights spin and the room tilts and she smokes her first cigarette and kisses her first stranger and smears her pearl-pink lipstick on a cocktail napkin to wipe the sweat off her face and she hears herself laugh and laugh and laugh and there's music pulsing in bass-heavy shockwaves up the notches of her spine and there's salt on the insides of her thighs and the hollows of her hips and she isn't Pansy Parkinson anymore, no, she isn't a girl who hides or runs or escapes, no, she's someone else she's someone new she's someone who's breathing and fighting and alive---

  Because there's a word for what she's doing.
