She's prominent in both these:

The Auction is written by someone who had written 2 other fics that are (the right thing to do, all the wrong things) Draco/Hermione post-war and the Auction is that relationship in an AU where Voldemort won. Does this make sense? I've read the auction it's great and has one chapter left to be updated, it's updated consistently. I assume Pansy is also prominent in The Right Thing To Do and All The Wrong Things but I haven't read them.

Breath Mints/ Battle Scars had bern highly rec to me but I haven't read it yet it's Draco/Hermione year 8 when they all return to complete school but I have heard she's prominent there and has her own romantic storyline as well.
