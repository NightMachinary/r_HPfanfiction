[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/][Harry Potter Becomes a Communist]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/][Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles]] are neat satires.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/][In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life]] is a fun oneshot: Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.
