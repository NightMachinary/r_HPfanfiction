Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/674180/Sarah1281][Sarah1281's]] works. Specifically 'when in doubt obliviate' and 'oh god not again'

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/943028/BajaB][BajaB's]] Harry in Hufflepuff and various one shots such as day of spoons are also good fun.

Switch is a good story, but I forget what site its on. The twin confundus the Sorting Hat, and everyone gets shuffled around. Harry and Draco are friends in Hufflepuff. Greg and Vince find a new tiny blond leader in Hannah Abbott when they all end up in Gryffindor and bond over chicken... that kind of thing.
