I saw this a while ago... It might work as a funny one-shot, but anything beyond that...

I hate to go all SJW on people, but /come on!/ You basically have two men decide that a certain woman's "love" (in scare-quotes, because the more accurate word is NSFW) belongs to them, so they will, without her knowledge or permission, use deception and violence hurt anyone who presumes to ask her out on a date, serving to isolate that woman until she goes with one of them?
