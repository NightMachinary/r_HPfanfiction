This has been reported for Rule 8 but I am ignoring it.

Things that break Rule 8: directly linking to a fic with sexual/suggestive content involving minors or posting a text post or comment that depicts said content involving minors.

Things that do not break Rule 8: OP's review where they discuss the weirdness of the sexually suggestive themes of the fic and where OP specifically states they are not linking the fic because it breaks Rule 8.
