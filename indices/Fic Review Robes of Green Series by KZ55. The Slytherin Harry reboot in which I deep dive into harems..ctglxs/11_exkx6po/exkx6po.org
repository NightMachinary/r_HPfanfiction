Props to you for writing a well-thought out review for what sounds like an above average harem (which isn't saying much). To be honest, it feels like your effort is wasted on a fic like this.

Harem is automatically trash. Doesn't mean I won't read them, but they will never not be trash no matter what reasons the author comes up with to justify them.
