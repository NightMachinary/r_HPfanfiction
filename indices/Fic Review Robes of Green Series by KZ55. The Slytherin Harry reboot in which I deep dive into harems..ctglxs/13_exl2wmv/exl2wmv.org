I've always looked at this series and thought about reading it, but then I look at its review count and just know it's not good. I mean you have to work pretty hard to write hundreds of thousands of words, update regularly, to get hardly any reviews in the HP fandom. Even if the writing is bad, you get plenty of reviews on multi-chapter stories. This did not. 30+ chapters and less than 100 reviews on ffnet for the first story, and the rest of the sequels are the same. Something has to be seriously wrong with a fic to get ignored like that.
