Thank you very much, I appreciate that. I've been taking a lot of requests lately, and mostly choose the stories I review based on what is recommended, but I might also give reviews of fics which would be my personal picks.

I don't deliberately review stories I find distasteful - I try to go into every new story without any preconceived notions about it, and just write on what I've concluded on my own. I guess my last few reviews have been largely critical, but there's definitely a lot out there which I enjoy thoroughly.
