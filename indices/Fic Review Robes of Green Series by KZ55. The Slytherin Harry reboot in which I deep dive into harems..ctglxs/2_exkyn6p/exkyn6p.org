I really appreciated this long form review. I had zero interest in the fic before your review and less interest after, if that is possible. I would love to read more of your reviews and in depth thoughts on fics like this. (I think a few that you actually enjoyed more would be fun too.) It's great to see something you'd find in a book review journal about fic. Fandom needs more scholarly and semi-scholarly work so well done.
