Appreciate the review. Ive seen this fic pop up on searches from time to time but I've been hesitant to read it as it didn't seem that promising. Now I know I can just skip it.

Based on your review it seems like the author tries to break away from the standard harem smutfest but falls short of hitting a more mature "realistic" approach.
