So I read through this fic as quickly as I could and I have almost convinced myself that the author is fully aware of how he is portraying Harry. Just the conversation/argument with Krum alone shows that. But I kind of think the author is doing this on purpose and will pull the rug out from under the "nice guy" thing eventually.
