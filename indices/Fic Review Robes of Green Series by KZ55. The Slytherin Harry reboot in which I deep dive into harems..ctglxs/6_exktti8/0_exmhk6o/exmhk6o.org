I mean, I genuinely hope you're right? But the narrative doesn't pull the rug out from under Harry, at least up until the end of Triwizard King, and the follow up quote from the author seems to be backing Harry pretty solidly.

But hey, if you read on and the rug thing happens, that's excellent. I would be genuinely happy to be wrong about this.
