I'm not really trying to draw a logical connection between these two things in terms of what a Slytherin would be. It's more in terms of what a "good person" would be, since the author wants to emphasise that they wanted to write a good-guy Slytherin Harry rather than an OP edgy Harry, and I feel like that's somewhat incompatible with someone whose interests lie in the Unforgivables.
