Ah, I stumbled upon this gem months ago while searching for new Harmony stories. The weird dynamics between Harry and Pansy, which begin to show from the very opening scene IIRC, and the horrible first-person writing made sure I didn't make it past the first chapter. And now he's rewriting the whole bloody thing? It's like man, just move on, learn from your mistakes and write something better.

I wish more people took the time to write analysis like these, they're always an interesting read, like you're opening a window for us to peek inside the mind of an author without having to suffer through their messes.
