Most canon plot points have been resolved. There really isn't much left to be said. Fic could be complete within 2 or 3 chapters. Why Harry wouldn't check up on his younger self is a mystery. For more Little!Harry fluff: linkao3(The secret language of plants). For a realistic abused child recovery fic: linkffn(Always in Your Shadow:Calista Snape Volume I).
