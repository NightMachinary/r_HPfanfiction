Dialogue.

Or, if it suits the writing style, clever mental dialogue.

No, really. Interesting characters are the driver of a story. It's not so much /what/ they do, but /how/ they do it.

Alternatively: subvert the trope. Have someone try to sell Harry the magical mansion trunk or omniscient pet snake, but have him turn it down because he doesn't need those things.
