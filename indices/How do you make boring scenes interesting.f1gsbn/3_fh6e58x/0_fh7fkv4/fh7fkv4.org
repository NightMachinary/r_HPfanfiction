Heh. Hadn't thought about subversions of that stuff. Now I want to see a fic where Harry goes through all the purchasing, then gets home and goes through all of his purchases only to find they're all ridiculous novelty/tourist crap that's ridiculously impractical or overpriced. The Magical Mansion keeps turning into a Starbucks and the Omniscient Pet Snake is only omniscient regarding the position of every mouse in the world.

I do like your point regarding how a character does a thing being the driver, though. So, you'd more often rely on character reaction, building, and interpretation to augment events than adding new events in (eg. Rowling's shopping trips involving Harry meeting the villain, hearing about some drama, finding a bit more out about the world he lives in, etc) to build up the multi-purpose-ness of a scene?
