  So, you'd more often rely on character reaction, building, and interpretation to augment events than adding new events

I don't really see it as an either-or situation. If there aren't any events that add to the story, there isn't really a point in writing that trip, yanno? An event should happen, but what makes the story interesting is how the character reacts to said event.

If nothing happens in the shopping trip, exposition will do the trick, and you'll get to the meat of the story faster.
