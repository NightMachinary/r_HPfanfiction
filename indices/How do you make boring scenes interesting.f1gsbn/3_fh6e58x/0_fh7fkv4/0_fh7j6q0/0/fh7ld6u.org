Fair point, but not quite what I meant. I was trying to ask if you'd favour one or the other to make a scene interesting. Shopping + Character Building or Shopping + Plot Building. Not that you'd always go for one or another, just which one you might favour most often. Would you be more likely to have Harry quip and comment on things as he shops, or more likely to have him see your antagonist trade a MacGuffin that'd be used in his later plots? That kind of thing.
