How cracky do you want to go?

Rorschach made a fic where Harry and Sirius literally had a box they threw things that they found in. So if anyone asked where they got something, they point at the box.

It was a box for ALL of the Chekov's Guns. A Chekov's Box if you will. Sorry Shrodinger.

  "I don't know," Harry

  shrugged. "Just toss it all in a box or something so we can pull

  random things out without people asking where we got them."
