Well, there's a few ways to do so. You hit one way of doing it - by working in plot relevant information, like canon does. However, in that case you do have to ask yourself - what's the benefit of including it /there/ instead of somewhere else that you'd find less boring?

For instance, take the shopping trip. In canon, I would say its primary purpose is to introduce the magical world in all its fantastical glory to Harry - with the secondary benefit of adding in the introduction of Malfoy, Harry's wealth, and so on. But what I always come out of that first Diagon Alley trip is the sense of wonder and possibility and /strangeness/ of the magical world - and yet how close it is to our own.

Now, in fanfiction, what's the point of a shopping trip? Well, it's certainly not to be boring - but it can be made into a boring scene depending on how it's presented, of course. It's a difficult situation, because people have very differing reactions on it. Personally, I find that it's a great way to inject worldbuilding elements, just like canon does - you just want to keep it moving along nicely. Don't use it as a checklist for Harry getting the power up he needs - use it as a way to build up the world, show Harry wandering around some cool new magical shops, possibilities with magic, etc. It's also an excellent way, IMO, to introduce a twist in what he's interested in - show him wandering into an enchanter's store, looking through all the cool items, and becoming fascinated with the idea of becoming an enchanter. That could work for potions, runes, enchanting, etc - and be a way to have him focus on those more than he did in canon in a fairly organic way.

*However*, if it's a scene you find boring - don't include it. Find another way to make it clear - and I wouldn't even use a line like what you put there. Instead, I'd just do a throwaway paragraph that indicates that he went to Diagon Alley, went shopping, and what he bought that'd be /important/ to your story.
