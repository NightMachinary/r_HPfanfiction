I always find myself really enjoying reading your comments, Taure. Even if I disagree, your thoughts on things are always somehow quite interesting to read.

On this one however, I very much agree. To continue my example, Rowling literally has a shopping scene every year and manages to make it really interesting to read each time. Harry always meets the bad-guys for that year in Diagon Alley too, interestingly enough. Quirrel in first year, Malfoy and Lockhart in second, Hearing about Sirius and meeting Fudge in the third (Dementors, listening to Snappy, and the Buckbeak debacle), no Diagon trips in fourth or fifth, and Draco in the sixth. I hadn't noticed that until now. But yes, her scenes are highly multi-purpose in a way most fanfic isn't. Good points!
