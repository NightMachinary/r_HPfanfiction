I take the opposite approach. If you're writing a scene and it's boring, then you should keep adding stuff to it until it's interesting.

One big difference between fanfic and JKR's originals is that JKR always has her scenes serve multiple purposes - character, plot, worldbuilding, humour, etc. In contrast, most fanfic scenes focus on doing a single thing.

That is where the problem of boring scenes comes from - because sometimes, the plot requires something to happen but it's a bit boring to write about. Nonetheless the writer feels stuck because the scene is necessary - without it, the plot won't work.

The solution isn't to ditch the scene. The solution is to add more to make the scene more dynamic.
