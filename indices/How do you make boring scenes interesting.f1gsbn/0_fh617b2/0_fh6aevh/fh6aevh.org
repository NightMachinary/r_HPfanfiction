This. Make boring scenes interesting by getting rid of them!

If a scene doesn't either advance the plot or character development, think realllly hard about whether it should be there or not. Maybe it has good world-building, or you like it for another reason, like being good fluff. But if it serves no purpose, why have it at all?
