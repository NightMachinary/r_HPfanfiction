Instead of writing boring (but necessary, because plot continuity) scenes, I just allude to them. I don't hand-wave it away, mind you, but add items, or dialogue, or narration to imply that the event happened.

To use your shopping example, I'd write a scene that moves the plot along or resolves a situation. Let's say, that Ron missed a class and needs to borrow Harry's notes. I'd add an item to that scene in order to imply that the shopping trip happened, perhaps a shopping list. In order to make the scene work, I need to have a reason for the shopping list to be with the notes. This is a good opportunity for me to introduce, or exhibit, a character trait that could be important later in the story; for example, Harry being disorganized.

"Harry, can I borrow your Divination notes?" Ron asked.

"Yeah, sure." Harry handed them over. They were ripped in places and mottled with mysterious stains. Doodles and scribbles interspersed the writing. One page was titled 'Emeric the Evil,' and in the margins of another was written, 'Shopping: Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick.'

"Thanks."
