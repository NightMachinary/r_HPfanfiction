You can use it introduce people who will later be relevant or objects that will come up later (ie Chekhov's gun). And you can use it to showcase characterisation and development. And you can combine all of these. So, for example, you have Harry go into a shop because he's attracted by the colourful marketing on the outside (tells us about his character), whilst browsing he meets the owners daughter and badly flirts with her (tells us about his character and sets up a future love interest), then whilst browsing he can causally notice something really cool but which he doesn't need (shows him developing a little maturity by not impulse buying) which you can then bring up in a future chapter, perhaps have him dig it out the wreckage of the shop and use it on death eaters during a raid?

Don't feel like you need to showcase every minute of something mundane however, ideally every scene should have a couple of reasons to be there (like the above example). So you have that shop scene, then another scene where he...runs into a friend in the quidditch shop and has a catch up with them. In that he can mention that he's already got his books and isn't looking forward to the apothecary.

Cut scene, he's back home and desperate to shower and get the stink of the apothecary off him.
