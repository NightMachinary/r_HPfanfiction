Thats brilliant! It makes the story better and you never suspect a thing!

To give an example of really badly forgetting about what a character did: It was one of those powerful/indy shitty Harrys. He had contacted Skeeter in year 2 or smth and struck up some sort of deal with her (dunno how, maybe threats or smth). Then in the wand ceremony in 4rth year they each forgot that they met the other. It was as if they had met for the first time (and they weren't faking it either). I was expecting some sort of follow up from second year, but nope. That really annoyed me. I think they also did the exact same thing with gillyweed. Harry had learned about gillyweed earlier in the fic and then relearned about it in 4rth. That also really irked me.
