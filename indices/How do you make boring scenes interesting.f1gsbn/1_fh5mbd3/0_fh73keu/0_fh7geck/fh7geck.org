I've done this once with a Life is Strange fic. In my first chapter, I had my protagonist pick up a girl at a party and arrange to meet her outside, though the protagonist got distracted foiling an attempted kidnapping of a fellow student, but I forgot that initial girl existed until about four chapters later and I just decided that she was the kidnapper's second (and successful) attempted victim.

I'd quite like to see a fic like that pull that sort of switch off. Have Harry buy a bunch of shit, then store it in his comically-oversized trunk-house and forget about it (like he forgot the mirror-package) and only remember later on. GM's first rule: If you fuck up, either admit to it ASAP, or just make it part of the story. :D
