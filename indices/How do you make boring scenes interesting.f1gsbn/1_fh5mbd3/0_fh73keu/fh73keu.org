  You can use it introduce people who will later be relevant or objects that will come up later (ie Chekhov's gun).

Contrasting this is what many tropy writers do, introduce a lot of people and objects that sound like they will be relevant later but never are.

It's so annoying to me, especially when the writers start forgetting they introduced something/someone and re-introduce once again. At that point I tend to drop the fic completely because the lack of logic and consistency is starting to hurt me.
