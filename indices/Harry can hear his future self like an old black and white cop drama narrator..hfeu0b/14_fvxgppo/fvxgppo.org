Fun one-shot perhaps, but an extended story based on such a premise would be untenable in the long-term.

Perhaps you'd get a lot of attention for the first few chapters because of the novelty, but I doubt it'd really continue over a full 7 years worth of story, unless there were many other changes to create a truly enticing plot. Of course, then the premise of a narrator would detract from it.

I suggest writing a one-shot covering some important moments over the conflict.
