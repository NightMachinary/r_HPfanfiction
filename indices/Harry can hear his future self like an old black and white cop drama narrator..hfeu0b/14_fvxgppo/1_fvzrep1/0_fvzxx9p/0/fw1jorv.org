Oh, that was fun. Thank you for that link. :)

And I definitely wouldn't say to force a long story - pacing is something that switches me off a lot of stories - but something like that would definitely make it more of a possibility, IMO.

Though I admit, seeing stuff like the Stanley Parable and the InXile Bard's Tale game is definitely biasing me here. I love both those games, and the protagonist-narrator relationship is done so well in both. Also saw it work quite well in a Mass Effect fanfic called The Lives and Deaths of Commander Shepard where replaying the game essentially added the personality of the last Commander Shepard character into the new one. Bit long in places - even if I think a longer story might work, length has to have a limit - but the overall plot worked.

But hey, the proof is in the pudding, as I imagine not many people say anymore. If someone writes it, they'll prove one of us right. Each to their own, otherwise. :)
