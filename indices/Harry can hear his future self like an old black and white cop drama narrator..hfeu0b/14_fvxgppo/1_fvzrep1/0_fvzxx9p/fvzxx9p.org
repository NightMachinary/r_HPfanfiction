I hold to my thoughts, however. Again, it'd be a fun concept but wouldn't really work for a long story. It could work if it was similar to the "Horcrux helps Harry" stories, but then the premise would shift from being a narrator to an actual participant. Besides, why force a lengthy story when it'd be more funny as a one-shot?
