Just make the narrator more involved in the story. End of year one, or two, maybe, Harry gets back to Privet Drive, the narrator narrates away about how annoying the Dursleys are, and Harry twitches. The day goes by, with little hints about what Harry's feeling, and then he goes back to his room, sits down, and looks up and says "You know I can hear you, right?"

Like the Stanley Parable, or the InXile Bard's Tale game. Make it a partnership protagonist thing between the present Harry and the narrator Harry.
