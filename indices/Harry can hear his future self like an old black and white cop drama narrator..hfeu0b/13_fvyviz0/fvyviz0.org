Reminds me of that Tumblr post that said a movie starring a little girl with an internal monologue voiced by Samuel L Jackson would be incredible. I LOVE the idea of the cliche grizzled old bastard of a post-war Harry Potter monologueing the cliche nice sweethearted little boy Harry Potter that wears everyone down into liking him because he's so nice and kind and genuine about everything all the time. :D
