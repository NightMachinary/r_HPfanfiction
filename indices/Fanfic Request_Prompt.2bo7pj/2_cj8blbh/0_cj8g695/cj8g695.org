They didn't play a part in the series because they didn't care about what was happening to Harry. Now they would have a reason to care. The effect would be small, but a smart fanfic writer would be able to think of ways to make them more important.

Small examples: Dursleys coming to watch the Third Task. The champion's family was invited, after all. The Dursleys being witnesses for Harry at his trial in the fifth book. Just in general them being more supportive of Harry after Cedric and Sirius die, leading to potentially fewer of the emotional issues that characterized the fifth book.

It seems like a very small change, but it can be used in interesting ways. Besides, what I wanted was mostly the family drama, not to change the HP world drastically.
