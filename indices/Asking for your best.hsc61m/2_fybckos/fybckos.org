*That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
Harry touched something in the DoM he wasn't supposed to and finds himself on top of a certain school. He notices a little girl there with him. Yoink. Spoilers: That girl is that universe's analogue of him.

Harry is the MoD, forced to take up the Peverell Lordship, has a vault filled with money, and the Goblins /want/ to help him. But does he use this? Hell no, he's anti-social, and the Goblins grin all the time which frankly scares him.

Ivy (Fem!Harry) is an experience of itself. She's like Fred&George, the Marauders, Hagrid, Charlie, Bill, and Hufflepuff rendered down into one person. And dosed with cocaine. She turns Hogwarts on its head. And may or may not have a Hufflepuff Army.
