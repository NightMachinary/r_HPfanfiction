Had to recheck the subreddit name as this immediately reminded me of the tv show 'I wanna marry Harry' where they got a regular British ginger construction worker with no money to pretend to be prince harry and 20 American girls who had been recruited to this reality show who were hook line sinker all over themselves for him. Great trashy binge watch.
