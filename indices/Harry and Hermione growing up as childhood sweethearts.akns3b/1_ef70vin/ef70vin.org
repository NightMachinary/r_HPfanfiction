Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence]]) isn't complete, and like elvish welfare it hasn't gotten past the close friendship they have, but what's there is sweet.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween]]) is written by a very divisive writer (Robst). Has Lily Potter meeting Emma Granger as the reason Lily lives through halloween 1981.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them]]) has time traveling Hermione arrange things so this is the case.

Hermione meets Harry on the day of his birth in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/]]) due to Snape's time travel, might not count though due to the fact they get their memories of the previous timeline back once they turn 11.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]) has Harry and Hermione meet in mundane primary school, but there's a caveat: I haven't read far enough into the sequels to know if they get together. I think the currently updating sequel is year 4.
