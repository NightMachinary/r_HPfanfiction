It is one of the all time greats but what I loved most was that it doesn't go down the route of Daphne making Harry more Slytherin because Slytherins are better than stupid Gryffindors etc. etc.

Instead, for perhaps the first time ever, Daphne comes to appreciate how much better being a Gryffindor is and becomes a better person for it. She becomes more open, direct and friendly. It is a fantastic reversal of the standard tropes.
