I doubt I would be able to write Harry/Luna well because that pairing has never resonated with me. Luna is brilliant but her personality is so unique and different from Harry's I personally can't see them being together romantically.

Harry/Tonks would be interesting though...I can see a reality where they would be a couple. They have a lot of things in common, similar humor and Harry could do with someone who could help lighten him up a bit.
