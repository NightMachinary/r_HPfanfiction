I agree that It could be the greatest story for a guy who like that kind of plotline but I guess that's not for me.

I have read out Dorothea Greengrass, GreyAssassin and BookNerd1947's Community Page completely and i have to say that i liked most of them and read those stories out in one read. Quite Enjoyed them to say the least.

Cause I believe that not knowing how they are going to play it out is the best way to build up a story.

Dude, Harry Potter and the Betrothal Contract was innovative in its own way by having a different approach to defeating Voldemort and held me quite on the edge for more.

I wont spoil it but thats my #1 for HP/DG pairing. I'll link it down. Give it a try and as you said, To each his own.
