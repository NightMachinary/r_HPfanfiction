You know, the framing of this story bugs me so much.

It just sucks away all narrative tension when it reveals--in the context of a school presentation, no less--that they've already defeated Voldemort

I just don't like that in the first 500 words we already know how things will end.

I guess the tension comes from how the romance develops, but I don't find this particular ship so captivating that I'd want to read a story on the strength of its sails alone.

So this has my personal bias creeping in, but I've never gotten very far into this one.
