There are multiple things I would tweak/change now that it is finished but that is not one of them. It was a purposeful setting of expectations at the beginning of my story.

I wanted anyone hoping for action scenes and exciting battles to know that this probably wouldn't be the story for them. I wanted people to know from the off the scene when Voldemort was defeated was 'boring'...the presentation was the best way I could think of to do that.

The only thing I would tell you is it isn't all about the relationship. A lot of the story focuses on what they come up with to defeat Voldy.
