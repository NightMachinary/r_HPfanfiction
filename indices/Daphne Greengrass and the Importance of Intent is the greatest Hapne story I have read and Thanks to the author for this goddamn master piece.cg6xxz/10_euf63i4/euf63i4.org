Same.

For some retarded reason I could never get past the first chapter, I really didn't like it. But once I got in there, I couldn't stop reading. Very well written, good character interaction, slow romance with a believable flow of events and a nice touch for side characters. Probably the best newish Harry/Daphne story, and certainly one of the best including the oldest one.

I'm looking forward to his side story's update too.
