Linkffn(9818387). The amplitude, frequency and resistance of the soulbond. It's not a typical soulbond fic, H/G, but one of my favorite dumbledores. One of my complaints about fic dumbledores is that they're often very serious, and there's not enough of the 'alas! Earwax!' part.

This Dumbledore is about 92% 'alas! Earwax".
