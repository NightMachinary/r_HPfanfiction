A lot of 'verses have more powerful magic, but I think HP's selling point lies in its versatility and abstractness. What other magic system has a spell that can so completely hide a secret that, when properly cast, you can't even comprehend the fact that a secret is hidden? Instant teleportation? Tenfold dimensional expansion with a few words?

A lot of 'verses are more powerful in scale, but properly cast (and properly /extrapolated/, damn Rowling's reticence about worldbuilding to hell) HP magic can be both extremely versatile and extremely subtle.
