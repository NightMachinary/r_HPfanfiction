I would say it another way : HP magic is the kind of magic that support a society, or more precisely most magic was discovered/created with the sustainment of a society in mind.\\
Rand Al Thor has the capacity to litterally destroy existence. Vin can see what her opponent will do in the immediate future and has the capacity to process it; and the Lord ruler and Sazed moved a whole planet. Gandalf goes against and survives a thousand years old demon. The wizard and witches of the Discworld consider breaking into hell a normal day-to-day occurence.\\
Every single one of these magic would just destroy Dumbledore or Voldemort. But none shows the capacity to support a society.
