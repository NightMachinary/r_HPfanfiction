Superman is specifically weak to magic. Deadpool? Sure, he'd survive it (Thanos' curse and all).

But more than that, neither of them (or any comic book superhero I can think of, expect maybe Professor X?) would ever get hit by one. Because they're too damn fast.

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Powerful, versatile magic isn't much of a help when you're so slow and so weak that your opponent can beat you to a bloody pulp before you can shoot off a spell.
