Dune?

It's been ages since I've read Herbert's series, but from what I remember the Bene-Gesserit could probably give most Occlumens and Legilimens a run for their money. The Harkonens are far more cunning than >90% of the Slytherins in HP and make for some memorable villains. Paul Atreides also lives for an outrageously long time without the use of horcruxes, so there's that. Sorry if I've misspelled any Dune-isms.
