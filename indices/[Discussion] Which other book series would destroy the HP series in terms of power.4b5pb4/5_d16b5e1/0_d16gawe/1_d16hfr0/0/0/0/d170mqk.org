EDIT: Spoiler alert ish.

I'm not sure bringing a god into the fight is...fair?...acceptable?...I don't know what I want to use here.

Madoka turns the Magical Girl setting into a terrifying concept with the end result being a goddess.

The implications of the HPverse versus other established verses is what Taure had pointed out.

We've yet to see wizards and witches become exhausted (in regards to their powers in HP because that isn't (so far) how their world is built. Other established works have set limits on these types of things (excluding god hood)

Since JKR hasn't built her world to include gods (again so far) we can't compare a universe where gods walk the verse to one where it doesn't.

Well. I mean, we can but gods always win in those match ups.
