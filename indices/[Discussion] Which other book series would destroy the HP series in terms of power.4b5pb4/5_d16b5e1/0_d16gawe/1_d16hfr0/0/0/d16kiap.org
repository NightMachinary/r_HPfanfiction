Now the Wormverse, on the other hand, that has potential. One of the protagonists is Eidolon, a dude who regularly goes fist-to-fist with entities called "Endbringers" that pretty much just rock up and murder cities for reasons.

And then you have Taylor Hebert, AKA Skitter, a girl that turns bug control into a pants-shittingly effective power against, well, everything.

ED: And the Madoka'verse, where the magical girls be crazy y'all. Homura Akemi could probably depopulate the magical world by herself if she was so inclined because time powers are bullshit that way.
