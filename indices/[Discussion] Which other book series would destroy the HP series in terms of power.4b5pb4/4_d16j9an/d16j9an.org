A while back there was a thread about a guy wondering if there was interest in a Belgariad/HP crossover. Frankly, sorcerors from the world of Belgariad would royally screw over the people of HP. And that's not counting Polgara, Belgarath or Garion (with or without the Orb of Aldur. With would basically make it similar to a Godzilla verse Butterfly fight).
