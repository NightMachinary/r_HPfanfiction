Because this is something all wizards can do /s Never mind that explosive decompression would fuck the wizard's shit up anyway if they're on the same ship, and wizards have a space-time limit on their teleportation.

And ah yes, the fabled speed of thought, so overpowered against people that can literally move and react faster than eyesight. Poor wizard's head is going to be on the floor before he can think his pseudo-Latin.

Not to mention that magic and magic-like abilities are not exclusive to the HP world. In the EU Darth Vader has choked people to death from across the vast reaches of space.
