You think a society that writes with quills will know what a nuclear device or a fission reactor is? They barely understand electricity as it is. HP magic is powerful, but it's wielded by some of the most myopic, close-minded dunderheads I've ever seen in published fiction. No contest - Star Wars shows up, gets dismissed as uppity muggles by the idiots in charge, and blows up the wizards. Even your best case scenario cripples ONE world when the SW verse numbers in the thousands.
