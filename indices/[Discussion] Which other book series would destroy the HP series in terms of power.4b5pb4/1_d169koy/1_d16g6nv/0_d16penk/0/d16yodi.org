  You think a society that writes with quills will know what a nuclear device or a fission reactor is? They barely understand electricity as it is.

If HP Wizards think they're superior to muggles, that's because they are. As we see from the first chapter of HBP, the wizard government has the ability to control the muggle one freely and completely. They rearrange the British PM's schedule on a whim! But more importantly, Kingsley (future minister, btw) was stationed there by the ministry and had already become the PM's right hand man. He was so good at understanding muggles that even the Dursleys felt comfortable with him. Obliviators have been doing a perfect job of keeping the muggle world secret for years, and you can't do that without understanding technology. Dumbledore reads Muggle Newspapers regularly and had connected Frank Bryce's death with all that had been happening with Lord Voldemort.

TL;DR The average wizard may not know much about muggles, but there are plenty of people high up that do. I'm sure any threat posed by uppity muggles will be dealt with appropriately.
