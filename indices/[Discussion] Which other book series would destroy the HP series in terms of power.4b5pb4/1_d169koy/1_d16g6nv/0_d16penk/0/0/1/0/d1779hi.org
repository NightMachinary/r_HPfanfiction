How about we start from the part where they struggle with /driving cars/

Or the part where they have no idea what the incoming innocuous little ball of death is capable of or that it's even incoming because they have approximately 0 tech

Or the part where their compressed unreal spaces exist in the physical space-time of Earth

Or the part where even current, non sci-fi ballistic missiles move at 5000 motherfucking m/s but can apparently be targeted by spellwork so slow that teenagers can dodge it

And has potential AOEs so vast that it literally does not care about your country hopping (which, mind you, Wizards can't do without aids such as Portkeys)

Or most importantly, the part where the characters on the HP side are honestly amongst the biggest set of dunderheads to ever grace fiction

This "war" is over before it even starts because their opponents literally don't care about a tiny blue planet orbiting a mediocre star, I mean they have a fucking word for [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mundicide][wiping planets off the star maps]]

Like I know this is an HP fan sub but damn the cognitive dissonance is unreal.
