But the power balance is so unreal that it would only take one muggle born with a basic education to take down a death star, and really entire galaxies. The argument isn't at all about how stupid most wizards are, since it would literally take only one.

If you are interested in rationality, check out hpmor, written by one of the head advocates of Bayesian logic and more intelligent AI development. In it, he briefly touches on how a modern mind could really wreck shit in our world, which almost mirrors star wars but with the most powerful magicians lifting a plane, computerized systems that can't aim, and more natural resources than normal (enough metal to build a moon? Not efficient at all...)

All it would take is sending a timed dark matter bomb of arbitrary mass into the core of a ship.
