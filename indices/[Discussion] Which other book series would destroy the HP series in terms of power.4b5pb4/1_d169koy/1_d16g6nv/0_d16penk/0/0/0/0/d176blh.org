And what ins do wizards have with the Star Wars governments? Or the thousands of independents with the power to nuke Earth from orbit?

Not to mention that it's a two-way relationship. The Muggle governments and militaries know as well, and unlike the Ministry of Magic are actually fairly competent and plan things ahead of time. Or do you think no militaries in the HP verse have anti-magical considerations?
