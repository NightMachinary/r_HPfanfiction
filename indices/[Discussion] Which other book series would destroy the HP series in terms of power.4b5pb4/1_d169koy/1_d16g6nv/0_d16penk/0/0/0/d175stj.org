  I mean I'd like just one instance of these "plenty of people high up" being able to operate a laptop to talk of grasping what critical mass or radioactive yield is

You don't need to know anything about critical mass or all that stuff. You need to know politics. The scientists are controlled by the Government, and the wizards control the Government. They possess tools that will always ensure that they remain in control. Hell, they can directly control the scientists if needed. No war between wizards and non-wizards will ever reach the state of direct war, because wizards would have won the war well before it begun.
