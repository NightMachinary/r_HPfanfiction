It's more a fantasy than sci-fi, but the /Inkworld/ trilogy by German author Cornelia Funke would also destroy HP, character power-wise. Why? Its main character, Meggie Folchart, and her father, Mortimer ("Mo"), have the ability to make any part, of /any/ book or written content, come into their reality by reading the words aloud. Despite being Muggles otherwise (though some in the Inkworld call Meggie a "witch"), their kind is called "Silvertongues", and they basically have the power of gods to make whatever's written exist. Had Meggie and her father existed in the HP world, they'd probably have to go into hiding like the Potters, as Voldemort (like the villain of /Inkheart/, Capricorn) would seek them out to force them into his servitude.
