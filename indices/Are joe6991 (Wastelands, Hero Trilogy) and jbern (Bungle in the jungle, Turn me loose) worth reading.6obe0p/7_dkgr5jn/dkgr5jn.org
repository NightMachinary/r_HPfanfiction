I'm going to play devil's advocate with everyone else and say no. Joe is good at writing 'original' fiction and that shows in his HP stories to the point where it feels so far off from where it started that you don't know how it got there anymore. Magic isn't Magical is just about the only thing you need to know about his fics.

Jbern is the opposite side of the spectrum. He seems to always try to do something different but falls into the sanctions of canon every single time to the point where if you've read one, you've basically read them all.
