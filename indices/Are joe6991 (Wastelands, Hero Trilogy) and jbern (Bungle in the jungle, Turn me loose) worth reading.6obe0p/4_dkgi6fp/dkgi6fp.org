I like what Bungle and Turn Me Loose attempted to accomplish, and they're well worth reading for the attempt. They definitely do not feature "wimpy shy" Harry (almost the exact opposite actually). The problem with both of them is that at the end of both of them you're left with a...'so that happened' feeling.

The magic is fun, there's some awesome sequences, but like most jbern stories he spends too much time priming for sequels that never actually materialize. Sure, a lot of pennies drop all over the place but the resolution isn't the greatest. If you know what you're getting into with a jbern story they're definitely a fun ride. They just leave you with the feeling that the roller coaster stopped too soon.
