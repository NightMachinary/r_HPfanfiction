  In the last 3 months I've read a little over 8 million words, which is about the same as reading the Philosopher's stone 103 times.

I'm pretty bad at contextualizing large numbers, so I didn't know how much 8 million words was. I fully expected you to say that's about ten Philosopher's Stones. I burst out laughing when you said 103.

Keep doing you, I think that's awesome.
