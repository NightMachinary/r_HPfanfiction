I started tracking my reading a few months ago in a spreadsheet (mostly because of feeling guilty that my Goodreads challenge wasn't as complete as I wanted it to be). In the last 3 months I've read a little over 8 million words, which is about the same as reading the Philosopher's stone 103 times.

I've been reading Fanfiction for maybe 12 years? I haven't read at the same rate for that whole time, but assuming I had, it'd be upwards of 300 million words.
