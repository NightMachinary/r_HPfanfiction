What are you usually interested in. A godly Harry, a weak Harry, an average Harry, a Harry with a pet virus, a Harry who's not Harry, a crossover Harry, a muggle Harry, a Harry story with Harry as a side character, a Harry story where he isn't even in it, a Harry story that has no characters from Harry apart from a one scene wizard, what tickles your fancy.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
