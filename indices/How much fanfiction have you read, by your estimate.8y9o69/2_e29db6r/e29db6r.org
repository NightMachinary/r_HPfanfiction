Too much. Way too much. I usually get through about 150k a day, and i've been reading for 7+ years. Let's be conservative, and say I spent only 4 years reading HP fannfiction(even though it's my main fanfic source). 150k times 1,461(leap year)= 219,150,000 words, and that's my average. Not including the times when I really get into a story, and forget sleep. I've been able to go through a 300k word story before sleep.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
