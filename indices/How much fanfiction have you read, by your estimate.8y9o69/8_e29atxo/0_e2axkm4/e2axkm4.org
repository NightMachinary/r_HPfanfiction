I feel most voracious readers are much higher than the avg, i read 1k wpm at roughly 80% comprehension, 350 is the low end.

I read at work etc and ill regularly knock over 2-3 200k plus stories - already done one 180k this morning onto a 400k which ill finish before bed tonight incl a trip to the airport and hours of gaming.. i cant stop reading, its an addiction.
