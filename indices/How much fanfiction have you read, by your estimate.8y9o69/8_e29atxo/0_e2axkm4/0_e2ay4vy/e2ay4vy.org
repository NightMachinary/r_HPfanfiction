I went with conservative estimates because reading speed fluctuates. I probably did read at 1k wpm at some point, but now I take things slower which averages out.

360wpm means you can read one 210k story in a 10 hour day (if you don't take breaks), which is about one Goblet of Fire a day (give or take a few thousand words).
