It makes it super easy to find fics I've read.\\
In particular, I read WIP fics to the current end and then drop, not follow them. I note down the next chapter on the sheet so I can go back to it later.

Besides completeness, I also (sporadically) tag fics with tropes, so it's easy to find, for example, time travel fics in case I need to rec them or if it's the only thing I remember about a fic I want to re-read. I always tag the pairing, so if I'm in a shipping mood I can find exactly what I want. I also have a category for "reference" which I use to indicate something the fic explored really well. Of course, I also use favorite and quality columns to tell if a fic is worth re-reading.
