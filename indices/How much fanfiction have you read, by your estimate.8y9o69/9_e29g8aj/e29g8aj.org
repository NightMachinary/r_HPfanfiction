112,744,005 words across all fandoms.

47,584,085 words of HP.

Minus a couple million for fics I've dropped but have full wordcounts for.

Probably plus 30~40 million for re-reads and fics I don't have a wordcount for.

My spreadsheet was created three years ago and I was /maybe/ reading fanfiction a year before that, but I still have most of that period in the spreadsheet.

400~500 wpm. Averages around four hours of fanfiction a day, which sounds about right.
