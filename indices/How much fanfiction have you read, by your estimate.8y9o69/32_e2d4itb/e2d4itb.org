I started reading HP fanfiction during the summer of 2003 when Order of the Phoenix came out. I lived in a small town that didn't have any places to buy books so I downloaded what I thought was a legit copy. It was not.

For most of the 15 years I read, conservatively, 5-6 hours everyday. At an average reading speed of 600 wpm I'd say I've read right around a billion words of HP fanfiction. Over the last year or so that rate has really dropped as I just can't get into a lot of the newer stories. I find myself reading my favorites multiple times but even that has lost it's appeal.

I've gotten back into reading other fiction and it's been fun because my mom loves to read as well so we will start the same series of books and the text each other randomly about it.
