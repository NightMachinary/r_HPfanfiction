Couple months ago I had ~48 million words in my favourites. I think it's safe to double that number considering all the stuff I've read that either got booted from there or never ended up there. That in 7 years of active fanfic reading. Would have been more but 2017 was mostly spent writing an app to help finding fanfiction to read and that's taken most of the time I'd have actually spent reading. Can't say it was a bad trade :)

And yeah, I don't realy regret anything. The creativity of some people really deserves an applause. Taking source material to new heights and/or places clearly not intended by the author and making it work fabulously is great. And even horribad WTF fics have value as they make you laugh and sometimes think of something you wouldn't have had otherwise
