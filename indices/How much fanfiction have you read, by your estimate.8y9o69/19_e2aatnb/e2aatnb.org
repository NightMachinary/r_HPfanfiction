I have a spreadsheet I've maintained since I started reading fanfiction as an adult (before this, I had only frequented an old Pokemon fanfiction site in the early 2000s).

In this time, I've read over 100 million words of fanfiction at a rate of about 35 million words per year.

(This includes a number of Pokemon, Worm, Naruto, and Star Wars fanfics as well).
