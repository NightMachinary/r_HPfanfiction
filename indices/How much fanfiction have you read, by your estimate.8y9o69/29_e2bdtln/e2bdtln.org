The thing for me is, I very rarely read fanfiction word-for-word. There's just too much of it and not enough time. (I don't know where some people find time to read 9-figure word counts.) After I read enough versions of the same story and characters over and over again, I found I could get a pretty good understanding of a story just by skimming (500-1000 WPM). Even on my favorites list, I've only skimmed most of them. A story has to be truly extraordinary to get me to read it word-for-word.

I probably read a few dozen stories word-for-word when I was starting out, about 5 years ago. I'm guessing that was in the range of 5-10 million words. Since then, I never really kept track, but based on my reading habits, I'd estimate I've skimmed about 50 million words, give or take 50%.
