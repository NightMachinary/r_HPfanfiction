According to the FFN app, I have 1049 fics in my history with 998 downloaded.

Of course a lot of them (I'd say around a third maybe?) is dropped.

I have the ffn app on my phone since Feb 2017 and I've been reading fics since ~Spring 2014.

Other than these numbers that doesn't really say anything (epic length fics and drabbles put at the same level) I can't really tell you anything, sorry.
