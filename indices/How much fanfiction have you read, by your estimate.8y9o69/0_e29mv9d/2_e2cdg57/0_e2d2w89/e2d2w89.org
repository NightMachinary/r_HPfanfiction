My absolute favourite fan fic is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/]['Perfect Slytherins']] by Jeconais.

Harry Potter raised by the Adams family and....not quite normal anymore.

Brilliant.

There are hundreds of great fan fics out there though, depending on what you like. linkffn(9860311) A long Journey Home is one of my favourites.

Sunrise and Sunset over Britain are both really long stories written by Bobmin, will take you a while to read as they're basically novel length.

If you're looking for something a bit different linkffn(2889350) Bungle in the Jungle is pretty good. People either love or hate this, but I enjoyed it.

BTW - if any of those links don't work, just google the titles with 'harry potter fan fiction' at the end, and you'll find them. I'm rubbish at using the bot correctly.
