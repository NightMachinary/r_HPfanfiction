Hundreds millions words worth of fanfiction seems plausible. I wouldn't be too surprised if I even hit the billion mark counting all fandoms. I read an awful lot and I read awfully quick (pretty much the only reason I passed college, kek).

EDIT: actually a very tentative calculation puts me at 70mln words/year. Now I just have to remember how long I've been reading fanfiction for?
