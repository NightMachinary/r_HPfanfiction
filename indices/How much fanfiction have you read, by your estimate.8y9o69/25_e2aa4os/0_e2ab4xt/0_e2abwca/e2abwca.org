You don't want to, either. Aside from the fact that you run out of material super quick (especially once you leave Harry Potter, which is an extreme outlier quantity-wise), it basically mean you're dedicating most of your reading time to fanfiction. Between the background reading required or suggested for my courses (which I really need to read since I barely ever go to class) and fanfiction, I haven't read a proper novel in months.
