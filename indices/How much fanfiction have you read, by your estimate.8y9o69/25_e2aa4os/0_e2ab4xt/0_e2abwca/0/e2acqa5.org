Mhm, I've already read most of the good stories out there. I've pretty much read read everything interesting in the first 300+ pages on ffn sorted by follows.\\
I tried going to other fandoms and branching out to crossovers, and there are definitely a few fandoms where I've read /every/ story on ffn.

You know, I just remembered something. When I first started reading fanfiction, and I saw the ammount of works in HP category, I told my friend that there would be a day where I'd've read over half the stories in that category :D How naive I was.... I envy new (HP) fanfiction readers. They don't know that for every gem, there's a few hundred bad ones in there.
