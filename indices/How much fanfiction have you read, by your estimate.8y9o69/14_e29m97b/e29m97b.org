I have been tracking my reading since November, roughly, and that accounts for at least 13 million words. Assuming that the reading speed MoonReader reports is an average over time I should have read ~23 million words on my phone only over the last one-two years.

Adding together everything I read on my laptop, what I used to read on my Kindle and Kobo, and taking in account the last ~seven years it's probably more than two hundred millions^{*}. I don't know, though, how many of them are from unique works - I often end up re-reading them from scratch on a new chapter release if it has been a while from my last read-through.

^{* A rough estimate: I was reading some four hours a day back in 2011, at around 550 wpm. Assuming that I kept this up for the last seven years, that's 7 years * 360 days * 4 hours * 60 minutes * 550 wpm = 333M.}
