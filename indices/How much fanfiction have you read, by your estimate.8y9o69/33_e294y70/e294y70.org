surprised you've read so much fan fiction without getting tired of how amateurish most of it is. not knocking fan fiction writers, it's just boring how tropey it can get.\\
i went on a fan fiction bender for a couple of months when i realized novel length or even multi-sequel fan fiction novels existed. i think i've read everything that has been rated above a 4.7 and has more than 150k words on the established fan fiction websites
