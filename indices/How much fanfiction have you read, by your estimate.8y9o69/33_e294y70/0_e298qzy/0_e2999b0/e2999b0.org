  If I limited myself to entertainment that's completely new, I would barely consume any media.

...are you serious? there is quite literally an endless font of good stuff as long as you're willing to accept different kinds of media. anime-ONA-western cartoons/manga-webtoons-comics/free games made by amateur devs on itch.io/movies from other countries with subtitles/youtube stuff\\
i had a couple of years where i wouldn't consume any form of media unless it was original and not derivative or a sequel(perceivable to me ofc, tvtropes killed all my ideas of anything being original)
