Probably about a 100 million words? 100million/(8*365) thats like 34k words per day and I generally kill a 250k word fic in 3 days so perhaps a bit of an underestimate?

UPDATE: I saw the math calculation by [[/u/ltouroumov]] and am going to have to revise my calculation since my reading habits are more on par with what he is saying but at double the speed; that would conservatively bring me to 40 million words per year but if we account for a year worth of vacation something around 250 million words?
