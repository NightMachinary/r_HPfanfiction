I've been reading fanfiction since I discovered the internet. Back with dial-up modems. Probably about 25 years now. Which is crazy.

I only just started paying attention to word counts because my younger co-workers. We openly discuss fanfiction now, it's not a such a secret stigma anymore. Hooray for solidarity! My favorite fics are all sweepingly long epics. If I see that a fic has 30+ chapters or over 200k words I get excited like a kid on Christmas. On average I burn through at LEAST 1-2 a week. It has slightly spoiled me with actual books. I have a hard time getting through the exposition and character development in a lot of books. If they don't hook me by the 3rd chapter or so, I'll choose to just read a new fic instead.

At this point I've probably spent years of my life reading fanfiction, perhaps as much as I have spent sleeping, and I regret nothing!!

PS: REVIEW kids it's the best way to keep your ships sailing and your favorite writers happy and continuing writing. A little love goes a long way. They write 10k+ words for you, you can drop them at least 10 now and then. :)
