If you mainly need someone to give it a once-over, and give you feedback, I'm happy to. My only thing is that I won't touch fics that aren't complete. Need tweaking? Sure. Need beta-ing? Cool. Incomplete? Hard HARD pass. If this is genuinely complete, and you're just looking for a second pair of eyeballs to look things over, I'm your guy.

That said, if this is something that's heavy duty dystopian, or otherwise really dark, I'm really not your guy. The world is fucked enough without having to see that mess in fics as well.
