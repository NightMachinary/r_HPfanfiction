It's half done, so maybe I'll get back to you in a couple of weeks when I'm nearer the end? Thank you!

Dark/dystopian isn't my thing at all dude. This is a pretty light going work - bad things happen, because some bad things have to happen for the story conflict, but they aren't graphically described, there's no sexual violence or torture, it's gen all the way (other than a couple of F bombs dropped by Sirius Black!) I think the worst thing that happens to one of my characters is being briefly kidnapped and having to live in a cell for three days with only cold soup to eat before being rescued! I can't write dark stuff, I'm with you on this - the world is on fire, why would I set my imaginary world on fire too!? The few instances of A Bad Thing are canon-typical bad things, if that makes sense.
