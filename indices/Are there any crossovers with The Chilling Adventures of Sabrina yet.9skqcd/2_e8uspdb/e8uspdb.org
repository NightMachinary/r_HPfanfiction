I'm writing a xover at the moment, I need to flesh a lot of ideas yet but the basic plotline is Zelda visiting the old country to check on a coven near Godric's Hollow. After visiting a friend over there she feels an explosion of magical energy, that being, of course, Voldemort trying to kill Harry.

Zelda ends up adopting Harry as she can sense how much potential he has, thinking Satan would be pleased with a child like that signing the book of the beast. Which he does by the age of 14. I was thinking on using the good ol' "summoning Harry" to the Triwizard Tournament trope. That's the basic idea, I don't know if I will change more stuff but yeah.

P.S. Nice to see you are still alive Fresh owo
