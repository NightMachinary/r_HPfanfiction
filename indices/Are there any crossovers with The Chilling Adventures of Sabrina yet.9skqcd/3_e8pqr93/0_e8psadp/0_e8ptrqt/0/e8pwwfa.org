Well there will of course be an awkward beginning, especially when Harry realizes she is basically a devil worshiper. I'm assuming Harry had some sort of religious knowledge, not necessarily any religious belief mind you, and that would mesh not well with Sabrina's way of life.

Once that got figured out, I'm sure friendship and perhaps romance could develop. There would always be bumps in the road though.
