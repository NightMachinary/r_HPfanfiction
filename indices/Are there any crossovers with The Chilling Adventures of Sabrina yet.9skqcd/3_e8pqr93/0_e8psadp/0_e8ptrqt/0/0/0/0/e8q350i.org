I imagine Sabrina tearing into Tom with the full force of a train, just for (in her point of view) having the nerve to pretend that he's a Dark Lord. while she doesn't like Satan, she still grew up with him as a God for her. so she'd still believe that he's the true Dark Lord while she'd consider Voldemort as nothing more than a mere imposter.
