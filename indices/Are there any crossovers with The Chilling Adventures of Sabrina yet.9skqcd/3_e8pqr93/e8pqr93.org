Let's wait, it would probably take a while before writers on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]] begin writing fanfics for CAOS by itself. not to mention crossover fics, unless you do want to take the initiative yourself.

Also, regarding pairings. what do you mean? are you talking like Harry x Sabrina? I feel it'd be a bit complex, though you can have the Aunts and Ambrose initially disapprove of the fact Harry and Sabrina are dating due to Harry's being an adult who is 38 dating a 16 year-old teenager. unless either Harry is de-aged or Sabrina's aged up.
