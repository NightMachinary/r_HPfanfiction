I think it comes down to two things.\\
1. Community: Forums or other more centralized locations where a lot of people know each other pretty well. When someone posts a challenge, it's probably other people from the same internet community responding. Reddit doesn't seem to have the same sense of community. I think it's the population being so much bigger, while also lacking easily identifiable physical characteristics like avatars. Also sigs. On a forum, you can put a link to your challenge into your sig, and 4 months later, it's still there waiting for another author to pick it up. Here... a prompt comes and goes, usually within the day it's buried. Sure you have a few people pop back in when their reminder pings them a week or two later, but when they see nobody has posted a link to a story, they leave and never return. And you simply can't (or shouldn't) write more then a one shot with only a week of planning time.

1. For Authors BY Authors. Most challenges I have seen seem to be posted by people who have a fic or two under their belt already. As such, they tend to be at least a little developed already, with some actual meat to give other authors something to work with for a longer story. In comparison, most prompts seem to be made by people who have never written anything, and had a random idea that they spew out as 1 to 2 sentences. And most of the time there simply isn't enough meat to the prompt to actually fill a longer story. And some don't have even that.
