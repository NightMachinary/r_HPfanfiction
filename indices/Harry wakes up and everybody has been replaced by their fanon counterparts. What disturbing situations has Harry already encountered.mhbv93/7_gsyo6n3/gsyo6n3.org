He is alarmed when he investigates some odd noises coming from a broom cupboard and finds his godfather groping Remus Lupin in an excessively pornographic and physiologically impossible manner.

For no apparent reason other than that the author thinks she's cool, Nymphadora Tonks is hanging around the castle. She greets Harry with a cheery “Wotcher, Harry” despite this phrase having fallen well out of use in the extremely localised areas of the UK in which it was ever employed in about 1983. Her hair changes colour 5 times a sentence and wow she is so cool.

“Morning Harry” says Neville in the amiable, pleasant way that amiable pleasant characters have when they're being included because they're in the books dammit, and it's not essential that they're dialogue is delivered by one of the golden trio. “Have you seen the blonde?”

“Huh?” Harry frowns obliviously over his mother's green eyes and, y'know, the scar.

“The blonde” Neville repeats, gesturing at Draco Malfoy who can't be called Draco too many times in a paragraph.

Draco sneers at Harry in a besotted sort of way and grinds out the word “Potter” in a hateful, adoring, venomous, besotted tone of voice, before telling his father about this, doing something pureblood-y and hatefully kissing Harry full on the lips.

Harry takes his seat, dizzily, his scar burning, to find Ron has, indeed eaten all the sausages.
