Draco, Daphne, Ginny, Hermione, and half of the entire Hogwarts population are suddenly vying for Harry's affections

McGonagall is even more unavailable than she was previously, which isn't saying much but is still noticeable

Pomfrey has suddenly assigned Harry a bed and is constantly threatening to give him more potions

Ron has suddenly become your textbook Ron from a bash fic: moody, stupid, selfish, and obsessed with Hermione like a creepy stalker

Dumbledore is dosing everyone with potions via lemon drops

Snape spends 50% of his time shouting at Harry for absolutely no reason, even when he's not in class, and the other 50% treating Harry like he's broken glass
