Harry suddenly finds himself trying to avoid Daphne Greengrass's pining of him. Hermione and Ginny are also in love with him. But Ginny constantly tries and fails to give Harry Love Potions, Ron ends up giving Hermione Love Potions, because the Weasley's (except for Fred, George and Arthur) are using Harry.

Dumbledore constantly asks those around him if they want a Lemon Drop, which is driving Harry mad.

Voldemort becomes even more like a Saturday Morning Cartoon Villain. Which leaves Harry confused.

Draco constantly brings up "Wait until my father hears of this, Potter!" At the littlest of things.

Turns out, that Lily and James Potter are alive and were hiding with Harry's twin brother who everyone believes is the Boy Who Lived.
