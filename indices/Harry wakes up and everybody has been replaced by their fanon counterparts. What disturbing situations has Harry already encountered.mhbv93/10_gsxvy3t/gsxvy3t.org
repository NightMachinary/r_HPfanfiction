"Harry, my boy, do you want a lemon drop?"

"Err no sir, thanks."

"Ok, pity. Well, the reason you are here is because I, for the greater good, find myself in the shameful need to ask you to go live with your aunt and uncle."

"But... I already live there..."

"It is regretful, sure, that's why I asked you to take a lemon drop. To ease things. My boy," he said... His eyes twinkling wisely.

" Er, no, thank you. I am not sure I am following you."

"Oh, Harry, I know It's complicated. What I am asking of you is to live with your aunt and uncle."

"Okay..."

"The Dursleys."

"Got you"

"Would you mind a lemon drop. In your way to the Dursleys."

"Not really."

"Such a shame. More so now that I have to ask you to live with your aunt and uncle."

"Are you... Serious?"

Snape sneers greasily.

"Why is Snape even here?"

"Dunderhead!"

"Lemon drop? Any of you?"
