“I'd like to visit my vault, please.”

Wide-eyed and astounded, the goblins gathered round.

“He said... please?” A goblin muttered.

“The p-word!” Another said, clearly astounded.

An elderly looking goblin, shorter than the others but with Dumbledorian hair began to speak, “We must name him as a Friend of the Goblin Nation. Show him our secrets, give him discounts, and a free checkup at our mediwizard that happens to be ready to extract horcruxes.”

“No, no.” Another disagreed. “Let us name this human who we don't know, don't trust, and doesn't know our customs as our KING! After all, no one has ever spoken politely to any goblin in a thousand years, not even muggleborns who don't know wizarding prejudices.”

“We should also give him access to the Potter-Black-Peverall-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Gaunt-Emrys-Le Fay Seat that grants him control of the Wizengamot, Hogwarts, and ICW. Ya know, because the wizards gave us, the people that constantly go to war with them, the ability to decide who controls their human government at any time. It makes perfect sense!”

The goblins bowed to their new leader, befuddled as he was.

“Uh- I-“

Before he could finish, the goblins carried him away to rule over them and the Wizarding World.

And that, children, is why you should never be polite to a goblin.
