/The morning after the "Great Hall Sleepover" in PoA:/

Poppy Pomfrey: "I've identified 12 students with sleep apnea, 47 with deviated septums, 6 teeth-grinders, and 3 sleepwalkers---do you KNOW how many staircases we have? It's amazing any of them, or their roommates, get a restful night's sleep! I also noted 22 cases of potential restless leg syndrome and/or leg cramps, and we had several bed-wetters. I can't even judge how many insomniacs we might truly have, because this was an extremeally abnormal situation. I will be assigning appointments, and you Heads of House will need to make it clear that they are not optional."

Dumbledore: "Now Poppy, take a lemon drop and calm down."

Poppy: "Don't 'now Poppy' me! For Merlin's sake, Albus, this is why I've been requesting mandatory start of year physicals since I arrived! Apparently I just need to call for an annual school-wide pajama party. My next target is going to be their sugar and caffeine intake levels."
