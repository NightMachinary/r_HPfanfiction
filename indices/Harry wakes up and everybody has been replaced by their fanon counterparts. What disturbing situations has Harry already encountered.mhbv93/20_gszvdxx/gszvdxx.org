There's an extra bed in the dormitory occupied by a boy who looks identical to Harry but he has a slightly different shaped scar and hazel eyes. No one finds it unusual that he is there, though James Jr. himself wonders why Harry is at Hogwarts and not Durmstrang. He appears to be an arse though, so Harry is relieved when his new twin brother leaves with Neville, who also has a scar on his forehead and looks gloomier than ever.

Harry heads down to the Great Hall for breakfast but is waylaid by his parents, who are inexplicably alive but even more dismissive of him than the Dursleys. Close behind them is Sirius, who seems to have forgotten Harry's name in favor of calling him “pup”, and Remus, who is casting longing glances at Sirius.
