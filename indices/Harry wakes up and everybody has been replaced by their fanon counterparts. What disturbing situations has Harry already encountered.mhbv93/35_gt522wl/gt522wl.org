Harry can't figure out why Ginny is touching him, flirting with him, and trying to dupe him with love potions.

Ron has become an incredibly stupid and yet incredibly manipulative death eater overnight, who has been trying to murder him since morning.

Hermione is flying above him with a scepter, the perfect image of a goddess. Oh, and she also wants to get into his pants.

And then he makes the mistake of looking into a mirror.

His ebony black, shiny and messy, yet handsome looking hair falls over his eyes like a thin curtain. His cheekbones are high and aristocratic, his skin is the perfect shade. HE has a weird tattoo on his neck. It was only then that he notices his hands, which are weighed down with a bunch of rings.

And his eyes! Oh, his eyes! His blazing Avada Kedavra green eyes, like pools of emerald fire pierced into him from the mirror, looking right into his soul. They were the most beautiful things he'd ever seen - he himself was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

Anyone would've fallen for that face in a heartbeat.

As expected, Harry screamed.

Oh, and Voldemort's suddenly sane, looks like Tom Riddle, and wants to shag him.
