You know, I read a HP SI fanfic where they decided to befriend an emotionless Daphne. They incude everything we know about Daphne: That is is to say, nothing.

Daphne is literally emotionless and pretty much has nothing to say. She also like turtles.

I really appreciated that poke at fanon, even though I love Daphne in fanfiction.
