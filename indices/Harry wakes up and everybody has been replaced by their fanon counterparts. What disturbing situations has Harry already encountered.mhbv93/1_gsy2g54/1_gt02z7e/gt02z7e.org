Draco is 50% sadder, is a spirit/elf/veela, speaks only French, is bizarrely hypercompetent, and is currently pregnant with Harry's child. He's driven into an absolutely towering fury when he realizes that normal Harry doesn't have a matching soulmate mark. On the plus side, he resolves the series' plot by ruthlessly using his spirit/veela/elf magic to murder Voldemort for also trying to get into Harry's pants.
