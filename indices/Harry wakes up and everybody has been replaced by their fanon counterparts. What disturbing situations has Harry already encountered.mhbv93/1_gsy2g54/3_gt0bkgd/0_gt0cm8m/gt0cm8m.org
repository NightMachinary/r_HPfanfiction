Not accepting a male Veela as your mate and letting him die, despite you not being attracted or wanting it in the first place, is basically murder and earns you several lifetimes in Azkaban!

After all, enforced 'romantic' relationships and essentially slavery is such a romantic topic! Surely these two were meant to be together!
