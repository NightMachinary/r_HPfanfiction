sidenote, reminds me of a funny bit in a fanfic that pokes fun of other fanfics.

#+begin_quote
  Harry quickly scribbled on a bit of spare parchment:

  /Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter agree to share a period of eating known as breakfast. Breakfast Succession: After this contracted meal has been ingested, responsibility will fall to Hermione Granger to clean up after them for perpetuity, lest her magic wither and fall barren./

  Ron read the parchment and grinned. "I've always wanted a house elf!"

  Hermione actually looked panicked, which made Harry inwardly amused. Honestly. If they lived in a universe where contracts could suck the magic out of people that didn't even sign them... how on earth would Voldemort even be a threat? Give Harry five minutes with a quill, and the rest of the story would feature an antagonist named 'Voldesquib'.
