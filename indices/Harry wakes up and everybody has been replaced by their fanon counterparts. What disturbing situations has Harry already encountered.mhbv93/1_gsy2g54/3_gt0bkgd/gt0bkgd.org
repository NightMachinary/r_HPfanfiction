Remember, that as a male Veela who has chosen his mate, Draco will die if the relationship is not promptly consummated. All Harry has to do is make himself scarce for a day or two (Chamber of Secrets is dirty, smelly, but quite secure - and elves should have no problem getting him a blanket and a picnic basket). By the time he's done hiding, well, he might just appear in time to attend the funeral.
