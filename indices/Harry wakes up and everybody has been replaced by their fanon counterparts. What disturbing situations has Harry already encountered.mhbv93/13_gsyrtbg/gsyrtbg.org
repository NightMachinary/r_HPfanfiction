Ron eats out of a pig trough for breakfast and for some reason randomly reveals that he's been spying on Harry and wants his money, even though canon Ron gets uncomfortable when Harry even buys him a present or something.

Hermione starts gushing over Harry and saying how handsome he is, then switches to worshipping all authority figures and saying she's also spying on Harry for Dumbledore so she can get his money. She and Ron have a loud conversation about this just around the corner from Harry.

Draco and Snape START acting NICE. Snape starts acting like he's Harry's dad or something, and Harry is creeped out.

The goblins come and tell Harry he's the heir of 1000 houses and has 10000000000000000000 dollars.

Dumbledore overuses "For The Greater Good," and "It's a slight misunderstanding." for every awkward situation.

Edit: And Ginny is a stalker in revealing clothing, and for some reason Voldemort either wants to adopt Harry or is in love with him. If the latter, Harry would probably be in the corner rocking.
