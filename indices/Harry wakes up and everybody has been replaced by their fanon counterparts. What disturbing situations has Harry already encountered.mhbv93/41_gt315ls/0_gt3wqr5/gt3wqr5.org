Maybe once Harry writes a three page apology letter sealed with the Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Azkaban-Peverell-Emrys-Gaunt-Grindelwald-Pevensie-Thranduilion-Targaryen-Stark crest stamped in wax and delivers it to Draco in person while addressing him as 'Heir Malfoy' and speaking in an elaborate and stilted manner, Draco will deign to forgive Harry for refusing to shake his hand in a shockingly uncivilized display of blood feud inducing rudeness after Draco had merely insulted his new friend and made fun of said friend for being poor.

Then Harry can move into the Slytherin dorms so he can properly immerse himself in his lessons on how to pureblood.
