Harry was scared.

Before him was not Dumbledore. No, it could not be. Clearly, this was an Impostor, like Moody was.

Right now, the Impostor was monologuing, and Harry was quietly searching for an escape route so that he could find actual Dumbledore.

"-yes, yes, my boy, you will go rot... em... live at the Dursleys, my boy. For the Greater Good, yes, my boy, so that I can sacrifice you like a pig I do not care for, of course. ...My boy. You must remain weak and helpless for that to happen, naturally-"

It was not just what the Impostor was saying, no. It was everything else as well.

His usually merely twinkling eyes were now radiating light at full blast, like two miniature suns, blinding Harry and his usually calm state appeared to have been substituted with a deranged one.

"-obviously, also you must not know about your humongous, pulsing magical core that I restricted by sacrificing sixty nine phoenixes, all Fawkes's brothers, as well as blood of fourty nine innocent virgins. After all, it was for the Greater Good, of course-"

Finally, Harry could listen no longer and he bolted from his chair towards the door.

Upon reaching it, he opened it as he always had, running full-tilt down the moving staircase.

The last thing he heard was the end of Dumbledore's ramblings, before they were cut off as he turned the corner.

"-he found out he is the heir to Hogwarts, I need to obliviate him. MY BOY, WAIT, FOR THE GREATER-"

Clearly, something was not right here. He would investigate further.
