linkffn(Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987)

By chapter 9 I published a comment: Best Dumbledore representation while dealing with a manipulative!Harry SO FAR. Highly recommend it. The beginning may be a little confusing or so I felt it, english is not my main language so may be easier for you. No romance as far as I remember, tooootally worth it.

Edit: sorry I misread it, is not a do-over but I still recommend it to you.
