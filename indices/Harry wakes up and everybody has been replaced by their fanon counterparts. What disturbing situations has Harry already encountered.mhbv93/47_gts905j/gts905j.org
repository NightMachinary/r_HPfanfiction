All of them are different fannon versions. You have a brain dead Ron who does nothing but eat constantly and messily which worries canon Harry greatly because Ron doesn't act like that. indy!hary manipulative Dumbledore who thinks he has these big complicated plans that were grown over the course of decades but don't exist in this world. Seer Luna who knows everything and is extremely cryptic. Wbwl gloryhog Neville who thinks his parents died and Harry is a normal kid and everyone is confused because he keeps saying he is the bwl and throws tantrums bc nobody is basking in his glory. Mentor father figure Snape who is all of a sudden really nice to Harry which obviously freaks him out. Drarry Draco who thinks they are married and in love when they definitely aren't. All three black sisters who are in love with Harry and also think they are married. Cat person Hermione. Super friendly dog-like Basilisk who likes hanging out with Harry. Etc I'm running out of cliches here but you get the point, a bunch of different cringy cliche fannon characters all interacting at the same time with Cannon Harry.
