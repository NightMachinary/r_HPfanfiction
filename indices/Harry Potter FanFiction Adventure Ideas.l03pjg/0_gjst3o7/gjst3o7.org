For a student - muggle born named Beatrice 'bea' collins ( not related to any main or side character). She gets in to Hufflepuff because she has a big family and grew up learning that family helps others. She would be very surprised to get the letter because the only accident magic is small and easy to explain. I think her overall goal would to try and see if magic from muggles books would work in reality. She would always be ready to help her friends ( and if Teddy lupin is in the story she has a small crush). She and her friends would start a club for research and crafting.
