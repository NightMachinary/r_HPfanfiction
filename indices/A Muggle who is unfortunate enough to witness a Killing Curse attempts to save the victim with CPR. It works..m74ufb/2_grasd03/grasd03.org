/Last week's events of a witch victim of the Killing Curse being revived by a muggle continues to raise uproar in Britain's magical community. As the Wizengamot continues to deliberate about the legal status and rights of the newly dubbed previously-deceased, an inquiry to the Department of Mysteries regarding the muggles' unhallowed powers reveals new information. CPR, now identified by the Department of Mysteries officials to mean "Cosmic Projection & Reanimation," was until recently a top-secret research subject pursued only by the most arcane minds of the prominent department. Now, officials admit to growing talk within the highest levels of the department to declassify and disseminate all research into CPR, in the interest of allowing independent researchers to help push the field forward and catch up to the muggles. Concerns are being aired by a small, stiff-necked, unpatriotic group, stating the reaserch matter to be "profane," and, "An immediate risk to the security of our plane of existence from ruinous, unfathomable existences." To that, this reporter has to say: That the muggles can do it while the wizarding community can't is already more risk than any right mind should willingly bear. More inside:/
