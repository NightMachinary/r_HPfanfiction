Forgot where I read this...But in one fanfic the KC works by acting as if you got hit by a lighting bolt direclty. IT Kinda disrupts all electricity from moving in a human body IE:the nerves/brain. So anything that prevents electricity from moving through it would protect you from the KC. That why most armour does not protect you. Metal, dragon scale, Basilisk scale. they all conduct electricity. Thats why You can block the KC with random objects providing you are not touching them. But anyways. A muggle healed people via Defibrillators. And thus magicals created a spell that acted like one. Apparently magic and electricity have a Acid/Base relationship therefor no one ever thought to use electricity to jump start a human body.
