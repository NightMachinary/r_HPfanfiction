I like this idea! iirc you can experience medical death (aka breathing and heart stop) and come back from it so it's certainly possible that the killing curse causes that and magic folk simply don't have the technology/knowhow to help with that.

Obviously there would still be the complications that a heart attack or similar causes, but well, you're not dead anymore!
