That happens to the caster, it breaks the soul of the caster, ad with a ritual that is unknown in canon, u can rip ur soul from ur body and create a horcrux. As for what exactly happens to the recieving person, in canon that is unknown, but in the movies it doesnt show the soul escaping the body like with dementors, nor is there a mention of this in the books. Theres many theories but i think it just shots down every function of the body with actually damaging them.
