I've wondered this ever since I got certified in CPR. If Avada Kedavra stops the heart and not the brain, could you apply standard treatment for cardiac arrest/heart attacks and have a chance at saving the victim? Could they be saved more than once? If we go by the heart attack model-AK then probably, my grandma survived three.

I have a hard time believing that wizards have no knowledge of CPR, though. Muggleborns would have brought it in to magical society.
