I'm really sorry, there's no way I'll remember it! Maybe someone else has read it though? Spoilers include:

Harry bought his own house with the goblins helping him trick his bank account.

During the summer holidays, idk what year, he decided that for some reason, he can't go to Hogwarts. So he runs away to live in said house and works in a nearby village in a restaurant for some old people. He gives himself a fake name and lives with Dobby, I believe.

Harry's friends sneak out during the Hogsmead weekend and take the Knightbus to visit him. Lucius Malfoy follows them

Harry had been teaching himself everything during all this and, believe it or not, he learns so much more than he ever did at Hogwarts! He's been somehow contacting his teachers whenever he had questions.

Hermione's parents, Nevilles gran, Professor McGonagall and the other guardians of Harry's friends are super unimpressed by how few courses Hogwarts offers, how hard they all suck and how stupid Dumbles is, so they decide to found their own school.

I'll add everything else I remember!
