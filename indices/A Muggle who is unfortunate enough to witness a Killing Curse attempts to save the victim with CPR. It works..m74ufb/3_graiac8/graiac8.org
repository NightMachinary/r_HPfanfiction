Hold on, I think I read a fic once where Harry is hit by Malfoy Senior's killing curse and Hermione's parents perform CPR on him? He comes back obv but for Horcrux related reasons. It was one of those "Hogwarts sucks, we'll just open our own school!" fics with loads of Dumbledore bashing so can't recommend though
