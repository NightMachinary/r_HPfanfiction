So the wizards come to one of two conclusions:

Option 1: The wizards realize Muggles know some magicless techniques that they don't, and science has a perfectly logical explanation

Option 2: The wizards conclude that Muggles have secret unfathomable powers they know not, and can defy death itself.

Guess which one is more likely?
