linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories) is the best story with this premise I know, but he doesn't "go underground", and for a good reason --- he gets Voldemort's memories but they're a broken haze, and he can only remember things one at a time, so he doesn't instantly get clear knowledge of everything.

linkffn(Seventh Hocrux) is of course a classic.

And, well, there's another one, but it's sort of a spoiler that it involves the idea at all, sooo...
