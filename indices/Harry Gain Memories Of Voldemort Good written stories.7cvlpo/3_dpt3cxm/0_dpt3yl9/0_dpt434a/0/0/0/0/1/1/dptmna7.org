There's a fic from a decade ago that's kind of hokey by today's standards (might have actually pioneered the shopping trip and badass trunk cliches), where Harry captures Death Eaters and imprisons them in his trunk. Even without That Fucking Trunk, dosing them with Draught of Living Death and dumping them under a Fidelius somewhere would be way more secure than Azkaban.

That's 99% as good as killing from a, "will they cause problems later?" perspective, plus you can interrogate them under Veritaserum and (at some risk), release them under the Imperius curse to cause havoc for their former allies.
