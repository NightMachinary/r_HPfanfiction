Not necessarily a cold-blooded murderer. There's a clear difference between assassinating someone in cold blood and killing in battle while the other guy is throwing dark curses at you. And it's not necessarily about killing either - readers want to see Harry taking the fight against his enemies seriously, using spells that require more than an 'ennervate' to undo.

That, I think, is what people are frustrated with. Also known as the fighting Death Eaters with stunners syndrome. With good reason - Death Eaters were captured and returned again to murder and torture more innocents.
