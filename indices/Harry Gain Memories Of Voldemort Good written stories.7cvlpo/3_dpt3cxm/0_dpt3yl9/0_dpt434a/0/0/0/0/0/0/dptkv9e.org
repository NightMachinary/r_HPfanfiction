It's an old argument. To be clear, I'm mostly arguing against what AutumnSoul /is/, in fact, asking for, which is methodical assassination of all Death Eaters at every opportunity, not just use of lethal force in battle.

That being said, some have made solid arguments that Stunners in battle aren't such a ridiculous concept, though they might not be /best/; these arguments point out that successfully casting a spell like Ennervate isn't just pointing and saying the word --- you have to do the right wand motion and focus on it, which is taking valuable time and attention from you even though wizarding battles are first and foremost won through speed.
