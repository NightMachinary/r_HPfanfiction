It's an ethical dilemma to be sure, but not one I feel is so clear-cut (that'd be why it's called a /dilemma/, see). Rather a lot of people believe there is something inherently /wrong/ about murder, no matter the circumstances. Killing great numbers for the Great Good was, in fact, /Grindelwald/'s plan, and I find few people arguing he was right.
