They stun and capture these Death Eaters all the time, only to have them escape and go on to murder and torture god knows how many people. In their attempt to keep their souls pure, their hands clean of blood, or whatever, they're pretty much dumping barrels worth of innocent blood over the top of their heads. It's selfish, really.

Teddy is an orphan. He might have not been had the trio just killed Dolohov and the other dude. Hell, Tonks could have been alive too. For all we know, Remus not being killed leads to him helping Tonks out with Bellatrix.
