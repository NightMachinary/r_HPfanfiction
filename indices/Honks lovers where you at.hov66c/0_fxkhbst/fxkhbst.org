Wish there was a completed, >50k word-length Honks fic that does not feature Dumbles bashing, manipulative!Dumbles, Indy!Harry wank, Lords and Ladies, time travel, Gringotts wank, or Light-side bashing in general.

Like, just a normal-timeline Harry (even if in another house) not hating Dumbles and friends, and getting with Tonks will do.
