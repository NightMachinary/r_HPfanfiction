Linkffn(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor) Though I feel the fic is more gen than romance. It focuses on the plot and the pairing is not the main focus (or the side focus really). That being said, nuanced plot. Amazing OCs. Definitely worth a read.

Other one shots by the author have the pairing as well. Tonks is written pretty well in the other one shots.
