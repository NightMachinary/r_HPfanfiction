This whole argument's really simple.

Is it an adult with a minor? If yes, then its wrong.

Is it two adults who happen to be of different ages (ie an adult Harry and Tonks)? Then its fine.

Its not the number of years that matters, its whether both parties are old enough to consent, and whether there is a power disparity. So can we please stop conflating the two? A twenty five year old and a thirty three year old have an eight year age gap, but no one in their right mind would treat that the same as a 24 year old and a sixteen year old, or a sixteen year old and an eight year old.
