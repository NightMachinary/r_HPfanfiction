I like the pairing, but I tend to prefer fics set in the books timeline, and there really isn't all that much of a window for this to happen in that timeline, without time travel or deaging or something.

My favorite remains Grains of Sand, with follow ups by some of those "Teddy goes back in time and gets his 'parents' together".

I do think the whole "Tonks goes undercover to protect Harry in school" and gets stuck there for 3+ years in a younger body could be a very good story, I've seen a few attempts, but nothing made to my 'this is a good fic' list
