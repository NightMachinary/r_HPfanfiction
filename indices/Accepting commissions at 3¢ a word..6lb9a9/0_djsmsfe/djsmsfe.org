$3 for 100 words? Dude, I know how much time writing takes but we are talking about fanfic here. If you don't enjoy it then just stop rather than making silly passes at a community that doesn't have a market for you.

If you are good at writing erotic literature then I hear self publishing through e-tailers can make a decent amount.
