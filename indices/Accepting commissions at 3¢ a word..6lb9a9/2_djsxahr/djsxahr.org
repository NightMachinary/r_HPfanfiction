Hey, I really recommend looking up copywriting sites as a way of earning some extra cash as it's unlikely you'll have much success this route and could even stumble into legal trouble. I used a site called copify and though I believe it's UK specific I'm sure there's an US equivalent. I made about Â£100 extra a month just doing it in my spare time.
