Who would want to hire you to write his story? FANfiction are made by fans who enjoy writting storys about their favorites universe. I do it because I want to do it on my free time. If you enjoy writting and want to win money doing it then write a book and sell it on Amazon. But don't degrade an entire community by involving money in it.
