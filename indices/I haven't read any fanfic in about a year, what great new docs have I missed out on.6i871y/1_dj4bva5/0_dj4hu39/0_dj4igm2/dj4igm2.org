It's fairly decent, but it's also finished, which is major points for it. Personally, I would have wished that Harry munchkined a bit when he figured out that he went back in time - i.e. killed himself to reset and try again, or at least figure out the rules of his time travel a bit better. It just kind of goes "Oh? I know how to defeat Voldemort now? Let me off him as fast as humanly possible rather than exploit this ability to defy time for a bit first." The ending feels like the author just kind of wanted it done and simply checked off all the last items on his list as fast as possible.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't read it, I'm just saying that it ends a little weakly.
