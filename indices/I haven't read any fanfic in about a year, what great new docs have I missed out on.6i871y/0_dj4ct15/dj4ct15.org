[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is a brilliant and hilarious implementation of the 'read the Books' trope by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/][White Squirrel]]. Its sequel, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12473842/1/][A Sensational Story]], linkffn(12473842), is written by a different author, but still very good.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425), originated from an idea on this very sub: what would happen if Harry had red hairs.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), is a new Harry to the 70s time travel. Unlike in "Delenda Est", this Harry began kicking asses immediately. Writing is really really good.

I concur that "Divided and Entwined" is an excellent story, especially in politics and battle scenes.
