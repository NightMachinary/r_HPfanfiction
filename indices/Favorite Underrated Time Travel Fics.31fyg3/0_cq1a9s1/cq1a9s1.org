Ooooh, I /love/ time-travel fics. I have a few recs of my own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/1/Destiny-Redefined][Destiny Redefined]] : /Voldemort was dead, all was well, but the real enemy had yet to reveal himself. Time-Travel Story./\\
Takes place one year after the epilogue. Rather unique time-travel mechanics with Harry going back in time using a potion for only a few hours, causing changes, and then having to live in a new AU world based on the changes he made in the past. Harry fucks up monumentally the first time, and now he has to fix it by further trips to the past. Lots of plot twists and major character deaths. Harry/Ginny. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] : /Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours./\\
Fast paced, frantic action with a highly driven and ruthless protagonist. Harry/Ginny. Highly recommended as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] : /In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)/\\
This one is set in the ancient times. The arc with Merlin and Jasmine (as Morgana) is simply amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7644616/1/Hallowed-Time-Twists][Hallowed Time Twists]] : /Mixing the Potter kids with the Master of Death, not-so-secret horcruxes, haywire magic, and the dawning Second War could only end in catastrophe. All was well? Harry Potter really shouldn't have tempted fate like that. For the Potters are now stuck in a year where Voldemort is far more than a half-forgotten nightmare. --- Canon compliant, Next Generation Time Travel./\\
Rather slow paced, but has some really good ideas. The Potter family arrives in Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts. Harry/Ginny as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2894304/1/Young-Again-The-Rewrite][Young again : The Rewrite]] : PostHBP. /When all hope seems lost and everybody is dead, Harry transports his soul into the body of his one year old self. This time, he's going to try and set things right./\\
Harry and McGonagall travel back to the time of the first war. Its slightly dated, but it has a few very good scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6083930/1/A_Clock_on_the_Face_of_Hell][A Clock on the Face of Hell]] : /Fate was sealed that night. I was to live and fight, to breathe and conquer. The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend./\\
Harry and Flitwick travel in time to the time of the Grindelwald war. This one is really good, with a great mentor!Flitwick. Highly recommended.
