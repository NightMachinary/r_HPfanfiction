linkffn(The Merging) ploughs head on into just about every cliché you can imagine but comes out of it pretty well. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite a fun read.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is one of the best Fem!Harry and Slytherin!Harry fics IMO as these are often genres that fall into the same traps across many fics.

linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) has a go at the idea that a basilisk can just be dismissed out of hand although it does fall into the Super!Bones cliché fairly hard.

And of course linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is good with tropes too.
