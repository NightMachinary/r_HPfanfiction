Oh wow! That is a /huge/ complement, thank you so much!

I personally hate the idea of bashing, to me it feels...wrong? It feels inherently flawed for writing- readers should determine who they like/dislike based on the actions or mindset of that character, not on how they were written. I felt like it would be wrong to write anyone in a purposeful negative way without justifying their perspective or actions, hence why so many readers were split on who they loved and who they hated.

I felt like it would be a huge error on my part to write Voldemort as someone cocky or someone loving, and in return I felt like it would be a crime to the character itself. I wrote Voldemort in the most logical realistic way I could see him being, and I wrote other characters similarly. That's why there was no sudden twist of love towards the end, or why Voldemort completely ignored Adrian in every sense since his use had finished.

Now for my next story I'm going to try and twist that- I like taking famous or common tropes/cliches and twisting them into something new. I'm going to take various things that are incredibly opposing or unrealistic of various characters in canon, and try to write it and twist their perspective/mindset so it /isn't/ out of character. Basically, maintaining the canon personality while having a character do something incredibly /out of character,/ while not /actually/ being out of character.

I figure it'll be a really interesting challenge and a wonderful experience for me to try before tackling an original publication.
