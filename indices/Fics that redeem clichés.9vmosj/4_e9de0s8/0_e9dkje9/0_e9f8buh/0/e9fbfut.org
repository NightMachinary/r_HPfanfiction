I currently have chapters 1-23 mapped out in plot, as well as a 30 page information document I've been using for jotting down plans for political structure and theory. I've been busy reading up on philosophy too for various interaction points and to incorporate it into the story. I have classes and exams that are going quite poorly so I've been working on that instead of writing! The story should be finished pretty quickly once I get started on it, although the themes and content will be much darker than Antithesis if I play my cards correctly! (I'm aiming for the first chapter to be somewhere in December or really late November!)
