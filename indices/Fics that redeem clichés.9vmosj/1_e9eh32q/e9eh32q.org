[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]]

A first person POV fic about a self-insert (more of an OC though) that gets transported to Hogwarts as an 11 year old. Yes, I know. It is the most cliche, horrible premise imaginable, but for some reason I absolutely love this fic. This is despite me usually hating main character OCs and first person POV in fanfiction.

The main character has a running commentary on everything that is both entertaining and hilarious. She really has a great character voice and is a very likable. Things constantly don't go the way she thinks they will and there is never point where she feels super powerful or good at everything.

It's a Gen fic with no romance that focuses on friendship and adventure with lots of humour. She befriends Susan Bones, Hannah along with Hermione and Neville after she (to her displeasure and surprise) gets sorted into Hufflepuff. She does influence canon events, but often not in ways that she expects or realizes. While it follows canon (kind of), its from the perspective of an outsider and the scenes and descriptions are completely original.

It's really nice to read something and not know what happens next because the author doesn't feel the need to rehash canon plot points even if they make no sense.

The descriptions of magic and Hogwards are just wonderful. They really expand the Harry Potter world and are full of small details that are not in the books but feel canon. Anyways, great fic that I recommend.

(It's a regularly updating WIP at the moment so still ongoing and fairly new. )
