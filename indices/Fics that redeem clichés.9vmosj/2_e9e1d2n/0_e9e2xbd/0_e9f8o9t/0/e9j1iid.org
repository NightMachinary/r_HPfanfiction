There's stuff in that fic that's excellent, like the really in-depth examination of magic and spellcasting and there's stuff that's terrible, like the "Heir" business and the "Light/Dark/Grey" stuff.

If you can accept that Harry's family, which is supposed to be the epitome of "Light" families, would abandon him willingly to the Dursleys because he's a squib, then this fic might be your cup of tea
