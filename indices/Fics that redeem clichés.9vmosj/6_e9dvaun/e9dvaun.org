I've heard a lot of good things about antithesis and want to give it a shot because I like a lot of the themes it deals with, but I hate reading about child abuse, especially from family. Could I read it where I skip chapters (if I remember right, it was several of the beginning chapters) and assume that it happened and was awful? I'm fine with reading about the aftereffects, but I really don't want to read about it while it's happening. I don't mind having to pick up on a couple things here or there that I missed out on.

I guess it's a question of how integral is Harry's worse than canon child abuse to the story? Is it just his motivation for revenge and cause of psychological issues or is the abuse actively ongoing throughout the story?

If skipping some is feasible, what chapter should I start on and are there any I should skip later on?
