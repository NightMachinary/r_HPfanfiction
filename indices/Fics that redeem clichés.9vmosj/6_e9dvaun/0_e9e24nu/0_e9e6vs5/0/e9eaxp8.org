Alright yes! I can explain this easy peasy.

Chapters 1-4 set up the story, and although there is child abuse it's more neglect or disregard for Harry. In these chapters it basically sets up the dynamic between the conflict, and Harry and his twin.

(here on I'll mark it as spoilers.)

Chapter 5- abuse, feel free to avoid.

Chapter 6 this is where a snake named Lutain is acquired, Lutain is pretty much Harry's familiar throughout the entire story. Considering how long the story is, it's important but there are scenes of abuse with the Dursleys here

Chapter 7-8 orphanage which is iffy in how abuse is portrayed. Mostly bullying, but plot for two characters: David and Suzie, as well as the fact that David dies as Lutain (the snake) kills him on Harry's accidental/misunderstood order. Rabastan and Rodolphus is there, so Bellatrix Lestrange acquires Harry.

Chapter 9 first view of Voldemort, but basically is just setting up Harry's role in the story and all the conflict of the two sides. There's no Dursleys past this point.

Chapter 10 the story "starts" in regards to the first year of Hogwarts and supplies. Minor mentions for how Bellatrix's household is in general pretty dysfunctional and unhealthy.

Chapters 12-16 is all of *Year 1.*

Chapters 17 - 23 is all of *Year 2*

Chapters 24 - 32 is all of *Year 3*

Chapters 33 - 39 is the summer between Year 3 and 4 There are some things that can be considered abuse, although most of it is psychological parts and not outright scenes of abuse. It's...Voldemort being Voldemort. Nothing to do with Potters or Dursleys.

Chapter 40 - 47 is all of *Year 4*, and /End of Part 1/

Chapters 48-50 is the summer between Year 4 and 5

Chapters 51 - 54 is *Year 5* and /End of Part 2/

Keep in mind, there /is no Year 6./ (you'll see why if you read the story.)

Chapter 63 is the /End of Part 3/

+Chapter 72 is named 'Abuse' and+>! the chapter is dedicated to explaining unhealthy households and abusive living situations. There's no actual abuse in the chapter; it was intended to be the closure and catharsis that people needed.!<

Chapter 80 is the /End of Part 4, and the End of the story./

Chapter 81 is the Epilogue.

If you want to jump in randomly, I think that chapter 9 or 10 would work fine for doing so. I want to throw a disclaimer out there that the first third of the story is agonizingly slow at times- I'm aware of it too don't worry! The real mental health issues and psychological factors start to come in around chapter 33, so if you ever want a summary of the early bit of the story because it's dull to read, don't worry at all and I'll do my best!

(Sorry if any of my chapter numbers are off, they're a bit out of sync in my document I use for writing but I did try to make sure things were accurate.)
