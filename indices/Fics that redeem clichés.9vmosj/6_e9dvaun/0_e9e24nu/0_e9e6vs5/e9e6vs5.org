Hi! Thank you for responding! I really appreciate it. I'm not super sensitive to abuse, I just dislike reading it, so if you accidentally send me towards some it won't ruin my day.

It's more that I want to read about Harry going dark, magical realism, the influence of the horcrux, his relationship with Voldemort, his mental health problems, and all those other ao3 tags you have, and I don't want to read about Harry's parents/the Dursley's being awful, or even just neglectful and preferential to Skylar as it happens. So it'd be really great if I could skip past that.

If there are several chapters in a row later on where harry spends a summer at the Dursley's or something like that, I'd prefer to skip that too. But I'm fine doing a little skimming when it come up for a couple pages here and there.

Is it feasible to read your story like this? I really want to give it a better try because everything else about it sounds so interesting and I've heard lots of people raving about it, but I just couldn't get through the child abuse happening in the first couple chapters.
