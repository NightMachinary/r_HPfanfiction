Yeah I agree. Petunia was a bitter woman but Hitler was much worse. Being forced to take your nephew in or face being killed is not a pleasnt thought.

It's like being the black sheep of your family, going no contact and starting a new life, then having to raise your nephew because your sister got killed and being forced to everybody you know and love will die.

Petunia was a bitter bitch but even when she tried to distance herself she couldn't win.
