Urgh, Sacrifices Arc.

It's a chore to read. An almost physical struggle. An uphill climb. A repetitive plot which doesn't advance in 3 million words. The issues that are being struggled with in year 1 are the same issues being struggled with in year 7. There is no character progression. At all. There are multiple character "breakthroughs" after which you think "finally, enough with that shit already". But then the author goes straight back to the previous plot point.

The author is a one-trick pony, and that trick is extreme angst.

The writing is literally dripping with overly emotional melodrama. The characters are all ridiculously one-dimensional and many of them are caricatures who behave in very unlikely ways.

The magic is crap and full of gimmicks. Further, it's contradictory. By virtue of birth Harry apparently should be able to wtfpwn most wizards via overwhelming them with his power. And yet we often see him in conflict with non-Lord-level wizards.

The magical creature plot is the same boring Harry "friend to all creatures" Potter. Newsflash: I don't care about goblins or centaurs or house elves.

Every story drags on far too long with so much filler it's unbelievable. The climaxes are always protracted - sometimes lasting the same length as a short novel - and so lack any sense of urgency, except the urgency the reader feels just to get to the end of this crap already.
