[[http://dragongirl16.livejournal.com/95485.html][Faith]] by dragongirl16 /(Harry gets transferred to Slytherin during the course of the story.)/

*Summary:* What if the wizarding world turned it's back on Harry? Who will stay true? Who can he turn to? What will he do?

*Warning:* It has a lot of graphic violence. Possibly also rape, or implied rape. It's been a while since I've read it.

*Pairings:* Harry/Draco. Neville/Blaise.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3535620/1/][Insane Asylum Escapees]] by RuneWitchSakura /(Incomplete)/

*Summary:* This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry.
