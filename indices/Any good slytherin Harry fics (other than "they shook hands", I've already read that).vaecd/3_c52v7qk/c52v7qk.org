[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What_Would_Slytherin_Harry_Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]] Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but it's an enjoyable fic that has Slytherin!Harry. Series of one-shots detailing, well, exactly what the title says.

Also going to second [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On_the_Way_to_Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], which is easily the best serious Slytherin fic I've read.
