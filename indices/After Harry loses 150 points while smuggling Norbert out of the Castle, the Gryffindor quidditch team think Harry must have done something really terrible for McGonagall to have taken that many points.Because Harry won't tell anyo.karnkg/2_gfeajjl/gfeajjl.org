Harry stiffened as a shadow fell over him. It was Dumbledore, had to be. He'd...had he told them about the dragon? Was Hagrid in trouble? ‘Mr. Potter,' Dumbledore said, and it sounded as if he was pronouncing his doom; he'd be expelled, along with Hermione, and if he got on the train without being horrifically murdered by either Hermione or most of Gryffindor for the points that would surely be deducted - because of course a dragon was worse then the original event -, he'd have to live with the Dursley's. They would lock him into his cupboard for god knows how long for daring to come back early and getting himself expelled. And what would become of his friends? He hadn't told them about how Ron would've joined in had he not been bitten, had he? He winced. He probably had. ‘- come with me, Mr. Potter. Minerva?'

‘I'll be right behind you,' he heard McGonagall say. He felt rather numb all of a sudden, as he followed Dumbledore. So this was it, then. He was well and truly done for. ‘Do you remember what happened, Harry?'

Dumbledore asked casually, as they made their way upstairs. Harry shook his head. Whether Dumbledore saw it or not, he continued, detailing how his team had gotten ‘rather curious' about the loss of points. How they didn't teach truth serums here for a /reason/. How one of them had gotten a dodgy recipe, and how they had brewed it in secret. ‘In spite of their natural talents with Potions, something went wrong. This amnesia is one side effect,' Dumbledore explained. The other factor was that they were not precise enough in their questions. Harry's heart sank.

‘And rather unfortunately they had decided to conduct this... interrogation, in the Gryffindor Tower,' McGonagall told him, rather briskly and helping him keep up - he wasn't being particularly slow, just reluctant and unable to keep up with the adults' larger strides -. ‘So everyone heard of your... unfortunate home life.'
