I actually think a bit of a modification on this prompt could make it into a very funny story, maybe suited to an older Harry but it could work with a devious! Or- whatever other trait you want to throw an exclamation mark after-Harry.

Harry sat there in the Gryffindor locker rooms feeling a mixture of complete betrayal and terror. These people were supposed to be his /teammates/ what sort of team used a sticking charm to glue their seekers butt to a locker room bench before forcefully drugging them with truth potion?

“Clearly a team out their bloody minds” Harry hissed under his breath as the gathered group stepped back, obviously worried that the boy who lived had other tricks to make the process obsolete-such as hurling the entirety of his stomach contents up.

Alas it was not the case, Harry was feeling no worse off after having his mouth forcefully gripped open and 3 drops of what apparently was an extremely potent truth drug dribbled down his throat, assisted by a spell to ensure it went down the right way. That said, Harry wasn't exactly feeling the urge to spill the reason Gryffindor was down 150 points either...

“Harry.” Oliver Wood, looking much more intimidating and shadowed under the light of a single lumos, spoke up.

“Are you going to answer truthfully?” The Scot asked, voice a harsh whisper that the younger had never heard him use. It was unnerving but Harry's terror and the possibility of being drugged had now been replaced by fury at the attempt as for whatever reason, it had not worked. For a moment Harry thought about spitting in his face and calling him every swear under the sun, regardless if he stayed on the team or not. However that hidden Slytherin side the sorting hat had talked about made a sudden emergence and instead of anger, Harry attempted to make his voice sound forced but clear.

“Yes”

The team looked between themselves, clearly nervous now that they had the boy in their hands. Oliver gulped and licked his lips before inhaling deeply and plowing into the million dollar question.

“What did you do that caused Gryffindor to lose 150 points in a single night?” He asked. The first time this question had been asked it had been in suppressed rage, Oliver had been shaking as he stared down at Harry sitting in the common room, the flame of the fire reflecting off furious eyes. Now it was nervous as the clear length they had had to go to seemed to have made the captain nervous about the true answer. But he wanted an answer.

So an answer he would get.

Shifting his face into what was hopefully a sincere look of resignation Harry took a deep breath before giving his explanation.

“Sex. I got caught having Sex.”

A heavy silence fell over the room as the team looked at each in utter disbelief. Oliver just stared at him for a few seconds, mouth moving but no sound emerging, finally he shakily stepped forward before getting down on his knees a gripping the bench either side of Harry with a whit knuckled grip.

“Y-you're having-you're /eleven Harry/ ” he almost wheezed as if physically hurt.

Similar looks of disappointment and pity were being aimed at him from the rest of the barely lit crowd but Harry ignored them in favour os staring straight at his captain.

“I know but I'm good at it, my cousin Dudley says I've got an arse built to fuck.” He said without any difference in tone.

3 things happened.

Oliver lost his grip on the bench and fell on his arse, eyes wide and mouth agape, Katie Bell fainted, no one physically aware enough to grab her and Fred Weasley slammed into the nearest cubicle to throw up loudly.

Oliver, looking like he might cry just shook his head.

“Harry, oh Merlin Harry no-”

“So i thought, I can use this, and i did...” Harry continued softly, before leaning forward as much as he could to get into Oliver's face.

“Oliver-I've been shagging the Slytherin Quidditch team. I've had all of them inside me Oliver: Higgins, Pucey, Warrington, /Malfoy/ ” he listed almost airily before letting his eyes widen, trying to stare impossibly deeper into Olivers now wet eyes.

“And Flint Ollie, I've had him inside me-I've seen the way you look at him on the pitch, how does it feel knowing that his dicks been inside an eleven year old boy-”

Harry didn't get a chance to continue as Oliver turned and vomited on the tiles at the same moment George Weasley lost his own lunch, Angela started crying and Alicia just covered her mouth with her hands, horror etched all over her face.

“They agreed to let us win Ollie, I just had to give them my arse, isn't that what you wanted Ollie? To win?” Harry continued As Oliver began to sob into the floor on shaking hands, a cruel smile made it's way to raven haired boy's face despite how his nose was badly protesting the smell of vomit.

It was at that moment that Harry discovered the sticking charm had worn off and he shakily got up, the thrill of revenge running through him. But he did have a sense of justice and decided this had gone on long enough.

“Well that was fun!” He laughed lapping his hands together loudly, drawing the attention of whoever wasn't mentally broken to him.

“So how did I do? Did you believe me?” He smiled brightly.

The wailing and sobbing began to die down into distraught confusion. Harry just looked over his team as innocently as possible.

“What? I thought we were playing pretend?-the fake truth potion enhances it doesn't it? Like um-method acting!”

Utter silence penetrated the room until finally, Oliver, with a red, tear streaked face spoke in a shaky voice.

“What's my name Harry?”

Harry just smiled down at him.

“Massive twat.”
