I'm not by means attempting to tell you how to behave online, but if you set a prompt, without specifying that you want to remain within canon boundaries (which irl would have had a horrific impact on a child's mental health) and call the first response you get cringey and over the top there won't be many redditors looking to respond going forward which is a shame and presumably not the outcome you wanted.

Being more specific the next time you post and providing constructive criticism (if you feel the need to criticise going forward) is a much better look.
