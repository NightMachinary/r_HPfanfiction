Don't have the mental energy to lie. I am sure you are much more comfortable with lying, but I would rather give a honest opinion.(One of the biggest lies society tells children is to be honest, when society really wants everyone to lie). Still at least when I genuinely like something the person will know, instead of having to wonder if I am just lying again because that is what society says you are supposed to do.

I feel more bad about the fanon part of my original comment then part were I said I found it bit cingey because I was being quiet literal, when Katie said the line about attorney and charges I literal cringed.
