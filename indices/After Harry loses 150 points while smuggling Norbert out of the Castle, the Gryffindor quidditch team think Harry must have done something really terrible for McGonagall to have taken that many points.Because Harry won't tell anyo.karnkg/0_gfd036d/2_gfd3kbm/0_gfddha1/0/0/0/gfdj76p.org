You're being downvoted because describing a response someone made for your prompt as cringey and over the top comes across as rude and ungrateful for the time and effort the person has put in.

If it wasn't to your taste that's fair enough - but if you specifically wanted strictly Canon that's something to add to your prompt.

For example, if you'd posted along the lines of "I didn't personally like the way you took this as I prefer canon boundaries on the Dursley's behaviour, but I appreciate you taking the time to respond to the prompt." that's a hugely different ball game to "it's cringey and overdone"
