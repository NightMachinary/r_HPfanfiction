okay let me rephrase for you: even if it wasn't your cup of tea SOMEONE RESPONDED TO YOUR PROMPT and wrote something as a direct response to your request for FREE. it's pretty entitled of you to respond negatively. You could've said something like â€˜this isn't what I first imagined when I wrote the prompt but I like the direction you took it in and it's really well written!' or something.
