Call0013 is right. What the Dursleys did was morally reprehensible but not illegal. They fed him (just not the good food), they gave him a place to sleep (yeah, I know its a cupboard, but it was technically save and warm) and let him go to school. For the laws of the 80ies this would have been enough. And OP had written about first year. The frying pan incident didn't happen at this point. Also didn't they outright starve him or tried to hinder his education. What they did was awful, but obeying the law sadly isn't the same as doing the right thing and they didn't cross that line until CoS. Also, they only cross the line one time later when Vernon tried to choke Harry in Book 5. Everything else is, as sad as it is, not illegal.
