Ah, okay good. I wasn't sure if I maybe made mistakes in my writing so that it sounds like I would defend the Dursleys. I don't, what they did was awful and shouldn't be allowed. It's just fact that child protection laws were pretty much shit until recently (10-20 years). English isn't my mother tongue so I wasn't sure.
