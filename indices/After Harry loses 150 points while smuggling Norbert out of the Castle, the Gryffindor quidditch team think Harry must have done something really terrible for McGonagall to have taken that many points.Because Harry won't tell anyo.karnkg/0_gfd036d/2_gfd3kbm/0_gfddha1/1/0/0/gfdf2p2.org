Man, kids get fucked up when you hit them, never believe them or like... you know... let them sleep in a cupboard or how about Harry Hunting. If you don't see that as abuse...

Harry had no friends, no adult looking out for him. What is cringy (but overall better for the story ) is that Harry has no depression in the books. Normal people go to therapy after his childhood.
