I found it a bit cringey and over the top to be honest.

Unless that is what they were going for, with the Kids not understanding that what the Dursleys did was not actually illegal.It was the 80s after all.(That or they have gone complete Fanon over the top with the Dursleys abuse, after all apart from mabye the cupboard under the stair which they had stopped doing before Harry first year.)
