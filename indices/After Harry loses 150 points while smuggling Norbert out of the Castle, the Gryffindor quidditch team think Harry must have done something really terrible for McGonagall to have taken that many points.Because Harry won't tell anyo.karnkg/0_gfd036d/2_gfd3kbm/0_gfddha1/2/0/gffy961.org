As someone born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s, the "realistic" take would probably be Hermione reacting much the same way, but most of the other kids consoling Harry without actually really doing anything. Like, "that's tough, mate. Anything I can help with? Maybe my mum or dad could do something--"

Harry: "No, no. Please. It's fine. I'll manage. Plenty of kids have it worse..."

But yeah, great scene. Keep writing :)
