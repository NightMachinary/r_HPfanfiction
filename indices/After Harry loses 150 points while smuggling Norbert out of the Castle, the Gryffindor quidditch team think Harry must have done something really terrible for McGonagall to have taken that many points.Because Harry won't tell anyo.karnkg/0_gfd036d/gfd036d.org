"You should talk to her," Hermione spoke softly to his right. He caught her sneak more pieces of cut pineapple onto his plate. He didn't protest it, he had just accepted that it was something his friend did.

"No." He shook his head, fist gripping his fork, "no, She'll just brush it off or get mad or something else. I don't know. Nothing ever goes as planned."

He was actively avoiding looking to his left. He could feel the states from his teammates. Their whispers always seemed so deafening lately, probably because he knew what they were about. They had started to treat him differently too. It's as if overnight he had turned to glass. It made his jaw clench.

"I'm sure Professor Mcgonagall will help you. She's a teacher! She has to believe you!" His friend squeaked out. He frowned thinking about the times he did tell a teacher. The pitying looks that turned to disgust after speaking with Vernon would forever be seated into his mind.

Ron chose that moment to loudly slam his bag down on the table across from them. He looked tired and fed up. Randomly grabbing spoonfuls of food, Ron harshly whispered across the food. "George and Fred are going to be sending a letter to Mom after classes. They are going to risk getting in trouble." He leaned back and stuffed a spoon in his mouth only to spit the food back onto his plate. He looked down with a scrunched face to see he accidentally served himself mushrooms. Spitting his tongue out, he grabbed some bacon slices.

Across the table, Harry's breath picked up. Instantly the room became unbearably loud and a ringing had started to fill his head. His chest tighten and his vision became warped and blurry. By the time he stood up to leave, tears were starting to drip onto his collar. The first steps caused him to stumble, his legs felt numb.amd his body felt to far away to properly control. At some point Hermione attached herself to his side and led him out the hallway. He didn't realize he was no longer in the Great Hall until he felt two heavy hands push against his shoulders.

Katie was pushing him against the wall and downwards into a sitting position. She didn't say anything just pushed his head down to his knees while drawing light swirls on his back. He wasn't sure how long he was stayed in that position. When the ringing faded and he was able to pull his head up, he noticed there were more people are him. McGonagall and Pomphrey were talking to Katie. He couldn't focus on the words, they didn't process in his mind.

Hermione was crouched next to him tapping light rythms on the back of his hand. She wasn't talking to him or anyone else. Neither was Rin who was standing behind her glaring at his brothers. Those two were taking turns explaining something to McGonagall. When Harry thought back he would realize that they were describing the truth potion event.

"It'll be okay," Katie softly told him. "I've been talking with my Dad. He works as an Attorney and charges have been brought against them. It'll be okay, just give it time."
