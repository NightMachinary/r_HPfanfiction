"Dumbledore's actions" are what ensured Harry is alive and relatively well. Yes, sadly at the cost of being mistreated. Which I am sure is a whole lot better than what Bellatrix Lastrange and her cohorts would have done to ANYONE who housed Harry and they could have gotten their hands on. Dumbledore didn't leave Harry there because he wanted him mistreated - it was literally the only place safe for him where he could have something even approaching a normal life.
