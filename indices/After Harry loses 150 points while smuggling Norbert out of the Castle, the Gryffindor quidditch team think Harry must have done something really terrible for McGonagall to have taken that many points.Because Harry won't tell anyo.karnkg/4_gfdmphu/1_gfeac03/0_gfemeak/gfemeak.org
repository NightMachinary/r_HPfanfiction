if Dumbledore really wanted too he could have made sure Harry was treated right by the Dursleys he just chose not to, he abandoned Harry on a doorstep with a letter and then didn't bother with him for 10 years, it would have served him right if Harry hated Muggles and went down the same path Tom Riddle did.

A normal life for Harry would be growing up with magic not Muggles, i disagree with the fact that Harry needed to be at the Durleys to remain safe. I still don't know a valid reason why was he made to go back to the Dursleys every year. Every year he was allowed to spend summers at the Weasley house where the Dursley house protections didn't exist, he even went before sixth year when Voldemort was back and in the open.
