The blood protection excuse for Harry having to go back doesn't make sense it only ever worked at the Dursleys so every time Harry was at the Weasley house , Diagon alley, Hogsmeade, or even at the world cup he was vulnerable to Death eaters or anyone else who wanted to attack him. Like I said there isn't a valid reason to send him back there every year when he is allowed to other places where he can be attacked at any time.

Lily protection and the Dursley house protection are two different things, Lily's protected him from only Voldemort and the Dursley house protected him only protected when he was inside the house. He was even attacked by Dementors close to the house.

The Durlseys are scared that wizards were watching them and gave harry his own bedroom after the letter came , Harry didn't need to be abandoned by the entire wizarding world Hagrid, Mcgonagall, Dumbledore even Diggle the wizard who Harry met at a shop could have all visited if they really wanted to but they abandoned him for ten years
