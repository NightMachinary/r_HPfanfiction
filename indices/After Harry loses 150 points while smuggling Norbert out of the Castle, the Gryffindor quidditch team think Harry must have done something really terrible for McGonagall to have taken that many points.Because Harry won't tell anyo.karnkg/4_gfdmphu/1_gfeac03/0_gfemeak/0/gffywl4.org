It could be fanon but didn't Harry have to spend a certain amount of time living with his blood relatives for the protections to remain? He couldn't just live with Andromeda or the Weasleys full-time or else the protections / wards / whatever Dumbledore did would fade away and both Harry and whoever he was living with would be vulnerable.
