People finding out about Harry's home life is god thing in the long run for Harry. People can finally see what Dumbledore actions did to Harry all those years and Harry can live somewhere else. If Harry is safe enough to go to the Weasleys for weeks in the summer after second and third year and be around Diagon alley before third year then the blood protection at the Dusleys doesn't really matter that much.
