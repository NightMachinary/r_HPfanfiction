James's wand /was/ used for fighting. He was also clearly killed first, protecting his wife and child.

On the other hand, they would have to know that, with Lily and James both dead, there would be nothing that would have stopped him from killing Harry. Connecting the dots - two people effortlessly killed, one baby left alive with the scar from a murder spell on his head, presumably plenty of witnesses to Voldemort storming the house, minor Death Eaters trying to come clean offering information about where Voldemort said he was going, etc.
