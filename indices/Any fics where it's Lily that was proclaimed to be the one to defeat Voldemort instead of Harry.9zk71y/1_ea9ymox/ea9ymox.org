I've never seen it though this does present an excellent divergence. Harry's part in Voldemort's downfall comes out immediately. If this never happens and the official report is that James and Lily Potter defeated him but died in the attempt Harry would have a very different life. Even with Harry still being the Boy-Who-Lived but no one knowing that but Dumbledore Harry and Voldemort.

Most people wouldn't be aware of Harry's existence. His lack of fame means lack of isolation through childhood. Though he's still likely to live with his Aunt he'll probably have visits from Uncle Albie. We'd end up with a different sort of Harry. It's easy to prevent Voldemort's early resurrection if Harry has his usual luck but lacks the aversion to authority. We could get a realistic protagonist that could triumph by means other than goodness and righteousness.
