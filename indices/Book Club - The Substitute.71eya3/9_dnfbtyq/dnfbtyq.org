Although I enjoyed this fic when I first read it, upon a reread, some things annoy me more. Foremost, it's almost Weasley bashing, but doesn't even give them enough attention for that. I would have liked to have seen Ghary at least spend some time feeling the rejection, since he viewed them as family. Instead, they were brushed aside.
