I might be in the minority but if it had been slightly longer I would have stopped reading. Some of the chapters to me dragged on. I wasn't even sad at the ending as I didn't feel attached the characters in the story. Overall I enjoyed this fic and really respect the originality of the story. It ended at just the right time.
