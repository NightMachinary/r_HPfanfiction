Wow I feel like I'm the opposite.

Really really disliked the concept but the ending was really nice. I guess for me, there wasn't much you could go for with the idea, so giving it some sense of closure was good.

Im also a stickler for poetic endings though (in all kinds of media, not just literature) so it could be that too.
