Well the premise is certainly original.

I'm not wild about the OC siblings - they're basically cardboard cutouts with "The nice one" and "The dark one" written on signs and hung around their necks. The constant use of prefixes for the two Harrys got on my nerves too.

I don't find the story as depressing as others seem to. For a start, his closest friends stay true, and he picks up a couple of others. It's also pretty clear by the end that his nightmare scenario of being experimented upon isn't going to happen. Yeah it's a crappy thing to happen to someone but I think he'd get over it given time.

Of the two endings, I prefer the original. It did what it needed to do, and got it done quickly. The alternate ending had some really awful dialogue from the Marauders and managed to drag on while also skipping much detail.
