The warnings had me really prepared for a depressing story and though it was, it wasn't as much as I was expecting. Overall the mood seemed to be one of melancholy and elevated from just being depressing by the fact that Garry had a group that stuck by him from the beginning. I was really happy for that and that the ginger twins also came around. I did enjoy the story and was pleased at the little differences here and there from the canon triwizard results. It kept thing fresh and it was interesting to see other ways Harry could have gone about succeeding.

The ending broke my heart but it seemed inevitable. A particularly poignant scene to me was once he entered the maze and turned around to see Ginny holding the clothes she had fetched for him. I could picture the scene so vividly and it was so sad I paused before continuing. I haven't yet read the alternate ending and I will soon. I just wanted to stew on the original ending for a bit.
