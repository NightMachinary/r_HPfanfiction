I read a story once where the Cloak was actually just as insidious as the Wand and the Stone. Basically, it /seemed/ to help owners survive but when looked at over generations, all the Potters who used the Cloak died way sooner than they should have, and almost never of natural causes. The Cloak was always there for its owner, except when they needed it most (James Potter not having the Cloak when Voldemort came to Godric's Hollow anyone?).
