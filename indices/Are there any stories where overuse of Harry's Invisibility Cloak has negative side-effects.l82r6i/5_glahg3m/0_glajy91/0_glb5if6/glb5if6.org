Actually, the Fallout series (video games) do that. In the series, there's a species called the Supermutants, who originally were humans who were mutated. They are bigger and stronger than regular humans, but generally complete idiots, very aggressive and very intent to either mutate other humans into fellow Supermutants (Supermutants are sterile) or eat them. Anyway, amongst them is a special type called the Nightkin. In this universe, there's an object called a Stealthboy that allows its wearer to be invisible. Nightkin use them constantly and it affected both their biology by turning their green skin grey (and thicker skin and other stuff). But more importantly, it made them developed mental instability such as schizophrenia, delusions, split personalities. The more they use it, the worse it gets.

A constant use of the Invisibility Cloak could do something like that. For exemple, Harry could begin developing an aversion to be seen and other mental disorders related to that. In a particular cruel type of negative side-effects, when the user wears it constantly, it could eventually alter how other people perceive them. As in, eventually, in the worst case, other people wouldn't be able to see the wearer at all, even with the cloak off (as if there was a field over the wearer that would stop people to be able to pay attention to/see them).
