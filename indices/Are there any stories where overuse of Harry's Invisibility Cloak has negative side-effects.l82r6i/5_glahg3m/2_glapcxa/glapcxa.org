Well we only see the invisibility used as a spying/sneaking tool but invisibility in real world conversation is typically associated with people who lack confidence so much that nobody even pays attention to them. So maybe the more you stay invisible, the more addicted you become to going about unnoticed to the point that if you wear it too much you become so isolated that you don't feel like ever taking it off.
