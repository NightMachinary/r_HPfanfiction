Based on this Dumbledore quote;

‘Strange how short-sighted being invisible can make you.'

And further based on older discussions, I am of the opinion that the Hallows don't have negative consequences to the owners health directly, but rather try to entice the owner into the grasp of Death. The wand was requested by a Antioch Peverell, a ‘combative' man, therefore it will make the bearer more likely to put themselves in those situations directly, a violent death. Cadmus, ‘an arrogant man' requested the stone which if the bearer is arrogant enough to fully understand what they are doing by using it; They will feel a continuous ‘Call of the Void' until they act on it. Ignotus, ‘The youngest and the wisest of the three' requested the cloak and gave it to his son on his death bed. The cloak is the most unassuming but also the most insidious of the Hallows. It will lead it's bearer into increasingly reckless situations and influence the Bearer to make more rash decisions, like a devil on the shoulder.

This is how I interpret the line ‘Use it well' You have to be on your guard most with the cloak. I also think that being of Peverell blood might influence something in some way. Not in a Superpower way but a curse, though some may call it a blessing, something that makes the cloak keen to return to Ignotus' line hence it's semi-mysterious return on a few occasions. Realistically, it was Dumbledore, but the Wizarding World literally has Physical entities of the literal concepts of Time and Love, why not stretch it further? This I think works really well with both interpretations of the Tale. If Ignotus created it then something linking it to his line might make sense. If they are actually from some deific personification of Death, then it has taken some interest here.

I find the Deathly Hallows to be a really interesting part of the story. What does it mean to be ‘Hallowed by Death?' Death being the central figure of a wizarding pseudo-religion is really intriguing to me.
