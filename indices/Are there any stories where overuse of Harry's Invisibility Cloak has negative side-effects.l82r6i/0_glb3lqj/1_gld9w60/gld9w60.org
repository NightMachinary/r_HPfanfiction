And I'd play them straight instead.

Wand would indeed make the user invincible in a duel, even against the Death itself - but do nothing to prevent it being taken, or the wearer dying to a danger they'd not forseen. There would be no curse, save the illusion of invincibility borne of experience, a continous string of victories preventing the wirlder of the Deathstick from ever learning humility.

Stone would indeed call back the dead - but not restore their bodies, long decayed, not destroy the sense of belonging to the Other Side. There too, a curse was absent. But as the Second asked for ability to deny the laws of death, so he got that. And while there was no divine retribution coming, no part of his wish requested protection for those he'd call up - and so there was none. They would always long for the Afterworld.

The cloak was perhaps the most insidious - it provided genuine protection from Death for its wielder. Where Ignotus went, Death could not follow... Here too, there was no curse. But while it is easy to fear the Reaper when it stands above you in all its glory and holds your life in its hands. It is harder to take them seriously when they stumble around like a man devoid of sight - swaying around and walking into walls and crawling right past their target without noticing them... There is no magic here, no compulsion... Just Death's willingness to drop to her knees and be humiliated. Endure every indignity and insult. So pathetic. So powerless. And in doing so erode the last vestiges of self-preservation and justified fear in the bearer of Cloak.

And so, the one best protected against Death's gaze is not protected from their own. Devoid of fear, they walk to their doom with a smile.
