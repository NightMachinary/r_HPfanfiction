Lockhart is better than Umbridge for the simple fact that he initiated the Dueling Club where Snape taught the kids Experilimous - he was a terrible fraud but he was a terrible fraud who wasn't specifically opposed to practical lessons/experiences the way Umbridge was.

Hell, his first class (Pixies) was going to be a “practical” one but he didn't have the experience to back it up (an especially generous soul could suggest he hosted the dueling club to allow the students practical experience with a /competent/ teacher, but that may be going a bit too far)
