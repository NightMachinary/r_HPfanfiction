Sensory deprivation by itself sounds a lot more pleasant to me than just being in the vicinity of a Dementor. Ugh, just thinking about makes me want to gather all the Dementors into some deserted area and nuke them. Or learn how to cast that super Patronus that HJPEV uses.

In fact, I'm thankful that they're fictional.
