Depends on how far you are willing to take the myths about centaurs at face value, they are sometimes shown as being mass rapists who will pound mercilessly anything resembling a female to death. Saw this depiction of them sometimes, while it's hard to feel any pity for the many fanon Umbridges I genuinely think that this was actually worse than cannon Umbridge deserved (locking her in Azkaban for some decades would have been better) though considering her ideology that was more karmically accurate. The story takes on a much darker turn if Harry and Hermione had thought the centaurs would do it and deliberately led her to their territory.
