Basically, Draco goes back to just before his first year, he and Harry become friendly with each other when they meet in Madam Malkin's and the Hogwarts Express. While Ron's there in the compartment, there's not *too* much hostility between them. Harry and Draco get sorted into Gryffindor and become best friends after that. Ron and Hermione are friendly with the two of them, or at least friendly rivals. It becomes a Golden Quartet as opposed to canon's Golden Trio. Also so far, the story is implying Drarry, but since they're kids (Draco regains a bunch of childish qualities, don't feed him sugar,) it's not gone anywhere yet.

As to the quality, well, I think it's really good. Draco's relatively limited knowledge of canon allows for some interesting moments of tension and avoids being a Mary-Sue fix-it fic. There's no weird tropes or unnecessary bashing.
