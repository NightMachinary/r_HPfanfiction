My headcanon on the matter is that there's a way (akin to Pensieve magic) to extract someone's knowledge of a language. It can then be drunk as part of a potion to transfer the knowledge to you.

Anyway, there's definitely /something/ in canon, though it may or may not resemble my above ravings. Barty Crouch Sr. couldn't possibly have learned 200 languages the Muggle way, for one thing. And Parselmouths are evidence enough that magically-transmitted knowledge of a language you never learned is definitely within the realm of possibility.
