In Harry's year, except for Apparition, there are at most twenty students per class. If the entire wizarding community from North America attends Ilvermorny, at a population about 8x that of UK, you would get 160 students per class. Not a stadium but a big lecture hall definitely. Or maybe they are separated into cohorts.
