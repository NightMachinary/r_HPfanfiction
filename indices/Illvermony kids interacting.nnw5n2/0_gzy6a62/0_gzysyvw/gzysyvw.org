The entire of the canon magical US is a mess of fanservice. The current US demographics are as a result of genocides of the native population, mass emigration from Europe and human trafficking from Africa and then a population boom due to the introduction of modern medicine.

Given JKR I am pretty sure explicitly states that magicals don't suffer from the same diseases as muggles, the magical Native Americans would have proportionally done a lot better than their muggle counterparts, even before using magic to protect/hide themselves from settlers.

While I am not an expert, it was a perfect storm of wars, persecutions, famines and other economic hardship which drove European emigrants to the US. While it is not impossible that magical Europe has similar pressures, given that it seems to be a post-scarcity society which barely populates the land it already inhabits, why would malcontents cross half way around the world when they could achieve the same results by picking a random field and putting up muggle-repelling charms.

While magical slave trade is not explicitly stated not to have existed, the magical world just doesn't seem to have the scale of economy to justify it, especially given how difficult it must be to keep magical slaves while also giving them enough access to magic to be useful labour. Also given the wizarding world is meant to be 'old-fashioned' and they are very good at ignoring things that they don't like, I am pretty sure if slavery was a thing in the recent past, it would still be going on and even oblivious Harry should have noticed something.

This combines to mean that IMO, magical America consist of disproportionately large (at least compared to our demographics) Native groups and then large numbers of muggleborn and 'new' families drawn from the US's muggle demographic over the last couple of centuries.
