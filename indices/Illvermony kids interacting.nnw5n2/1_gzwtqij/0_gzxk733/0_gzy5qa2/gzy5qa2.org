Except Bulgarians apparently attend Durmstrang, so it would seem that at least in Beauxbattons they would be mostly restricted (hopefully) just to Romance languages (and Greek?), and French (or Latin? that would be interesting) could be the official language. However, Durmstrang would be a complete nightmare. Which is a complete fault of JKR, who combined heritages of her ancestors and with the French arrogance and British ignorance created something so unbelievable as the school located somewhere in the Northern Scandinavia with Russo-German name and students all the way from Bulgaria, Germany, Norway, and (I guess) Benelux? Notice, there is no German school, which is as believable as the pigs flying. All those Germans, Dutch and Scandinavians learning Russian? Or all those Russians and other Slavs learning German? And why there are Russians there at all, when they have their own Koldovstoretz (or rather correctly Koldovstvoretz)?
