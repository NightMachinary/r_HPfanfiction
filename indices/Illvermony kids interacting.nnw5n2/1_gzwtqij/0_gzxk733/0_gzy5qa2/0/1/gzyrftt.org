I am not sure about that. With the proportion 5,000 Muggles per a wizard/witch, it makes some magical nations awfully tiny. My own nation, Czechs, makes 2,000 wizards/witches. That's rather small village. Yes, you can make a village school out of it, but I would prefer if more nations pooled their resources and have something of their own. And of course, patriot I am, I believe that the gord [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeƒç]]), which disappeared IRL after 936 was actually magically hidden and the school is there till now (and of course, wizards and witches from there established later many other schools around Europe, including the one in the Northern Scotland).
