With Durmstrang and Beauxbatons being the 2 only Magical School of mainland Europe (at least according to Rowling), I really hope for the students that there is some Magical way to quickly learn a new language (though it seems to not be the case in Canon).

If we assume that Beauxbatons take the students from Southern Europe, when we have French, Spanish, Portugese, Italian, German (from Switzerland), plus all the Slavics language depending of how far East the school go (Slovene, Serbe, Croate . . .).

Durmstrang must also be a nightmare between the Germans, Scandinaves, Poles . . .
