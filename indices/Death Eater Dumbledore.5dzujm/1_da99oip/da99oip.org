There is a crackfic - or part of a collection - where Dumbledore picks a Dark Lord candidate each generation so he can fight them and be a hero. Once they are defeated for good, they can retirem to some Island, or with another identity. Harry is picked as the next candidate, and Voldemort fills him, explaining that no, thtey really do not have any chance, Dumbledore is just that powerful. As far as I recall, it's not for some comlicated plan or goal either, Dumbledore simply likes to play hero.
