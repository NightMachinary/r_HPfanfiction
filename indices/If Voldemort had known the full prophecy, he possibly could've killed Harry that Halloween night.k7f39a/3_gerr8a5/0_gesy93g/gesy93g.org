Could just be Dumbledore leading Harry on, and goading the child to find his own impetus rather than trusting in prophecy and becoming complacent. A little of 'Column A and column B' situation, really, especially coming from Dumbledore. It's a prophecy, and while it doesn't have to be fulfilled, it definitely indicates powerful magic at work, magic that has a sort of mind of its own and determines fates. It also distracts Harry from all the things Dumbledore has done to influence and redirect Harry's life, as if this is really Harry's decision to face Voldemort. It was never Harry's decision, that was thrust upon him like so many other things, whether he wanted it or not.
