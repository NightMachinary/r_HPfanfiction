Reminder that prophecies in HP are not binding at all; the reason it was fulfilled is because Harry could never live in world with Voldemort around. If Voldemort had just ignored the prophecy, it would have gone unfulfilled. Prophecies are basically fancy predictions. It's why most of them are unfulfilled in the DoM.

  “No, it doesn't!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, *“You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”* “But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means ---” “*If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”\*

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! *Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”* Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. *“I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.*”
