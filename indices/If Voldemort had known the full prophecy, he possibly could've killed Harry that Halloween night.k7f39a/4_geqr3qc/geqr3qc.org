Ignoring should be the only solution. Prophecy tells him, he'd mark one of them as an equal. He could, of course, view that as a symbolic mark. Either way I think he avoids Harry/Neville like he did Dumbledore or sends a proxy. I can see him saying "if he's not marked as an equal, he can die by any hand."
