This is the only mention of Daphne Greengrass in Canon. It doesn't give us reader anything outside of her name (and gender I guess). With time, things like Rowling Interviews and Pottermore (what I would call the extended Canon) gave us a bit more informations about her: She was a Slytherin, Pureblood, part of Pansy's gang, she had a little sister would would eventually marry Draco before dying young . . .\\
But the point remain that, outside of having a cool name, Daphne is popular because she is a blank slate.

People on this sub love to debate about the natures of the Canon character., you just have to look about some of the old "discussion" to notice this. Just try to say that Ron was an useless idiot that did not deserve Harry and you will see a bunch of guy jumping in to defend his character (me included to be honest). And the same thing would happen anytime someone talk about the talent of Hermione, Dumbledore's treatment of Harry, or the 2 cans of worms that are Snape and Draco (petty asshole and little nazi, or unsung hero and poor kid?).

By her nature, Daphne Greengrass is totally free of all these discussions. The "Ice Queen" persona may be predominant when reading about Daphne Greengrass, but unlike other, there are no "correct" (or rather "canon") way to write her. She can be attractive or plain, talented or stupid, blood purist or not, the choice is yours. And this liberty made it popular with author.

Another reason for Daphne popularity is that she fills a previously empty niche: the "Slytherin Love Interest". Before her, Fanfictions didn't really have any "neutral" character in Slytherin to pair with Harry. Pansy Parkinson was too close to Draco, Milicent Bulstrode too ugly (I honestly can't think of any other reason to not have her become a love interest, since she is very similar to Daphne outside of that), and Fem! Blaise kinda died when HBP confirmed him as a boy. As mentioned by MidgardWyrm, having the Love Interest in Slytherin opens a lot of new doors when it comes to plot (from Harry's corruption to the Dark Side, to some Cursed Lover and with the usual Political/ Lords fics), and Daphne is the perfect character to introduce Harry to these aspects that are unexplored in Canon.

​

In the end, Daphne is popular because she manages to both be a blank slate and fill an empty niche. Personally, I am a bit disappointed that with all the story about her, most of them always show the same "Ice Queen" (that I'm not a fan of), and I do wish that more stories paired Harry with other Slytherins that could also make some pretty interesting story (give me more Tracey Davies damnit, the Half Blood girl surrounded by blood purist).
