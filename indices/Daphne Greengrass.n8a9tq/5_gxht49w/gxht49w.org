There are only a few known facts for Daphne:

1. She's a Slytherin
2. She's in the main characters' year
3. Her sister, two years younger and also a Slytherin, went on to marry Malfoy, have a kid, and then die from a blood curse
4. Astoria is said to have held her family's bigoted views until the War changed her -- it was a point of contention between her and her in-laws
5. This implies that Daphne and her family, by the time of her being at Hogwarts, were also bigoted
6. She hung around with Pansy
7. She's a pureblood
8. When the series was being developed, she was originally known as "Queenie"
9. ...And that's all, IIRC.

Some say that Chloe Rich played her as a background character, but she could have played any of the other "unknown", older Slytherins that don't have a set appearance to them (e.g. Pansy, Millicent) as we know their actresses, such as Tracey Davis.

For various reasons, people latched onto her because she's a blank slate they can use for various stories (like a "good Slytherin, non-slash romance for Harry), though a few details later contradicted the fanon portrayal of her when CC came out (from knowing stuff about Astoria).

The blonde hair, blue eyes thing? Probably lifted directly from Chloe Ric herself, even though her general appearance could be different from fic-to-fic.

Daphne was named after a Greek mythological nymph character that was persuaded by Apollo (read: He wanted to own and rape her), so that probably factored into a characterization of the usual contention with Malfoy thing (who wants to own her as a girlfriend or wife, in a lot of stories).

Anyway, whatever plans JKR had for Daphne/"Queenie", none came to fruition.
