These are ranked in order of my favorites:

Harry black series (google harry black book 1, 2, 3, 4) book 4 is currantly a WIP (really good, prob my favorite, too much to describe here, just read them)

The legacy prevention act (really, really good marriage contract)

Second chances series' (second chances, congregation of the asp, horcrux three) (instead of big bad harry, you have mildly talented harry who depends on daphne's family to bring down voldemort as a family)

Angry harry and the seven (another marriage contract. James signed a marriage contract with daphne's dad when they were drunk because sirius suggested it)

Living dangerously series (living dangerously, living in secret, still waiting on the final story to come out) (this one has daphne being forced by her father to join the death eaters even though she loves harry, she betrays the death eaters eventually to join the order but it takes a while)

There's more I'm just not remembering off the top of my head

My own fic is still very early. It will be a long fic spanning years 4,5,6 and about a year or so of open warfare between voldemort and Europe. No horcruxes, no prophesies. James and lilly were death eaters who turned on voldemort and bound a big portion of his power through blood magic when malfoy convinced voldemort that they were turning on him. It killed his parents and left him as an orphan. He is unpopular because of all this on both sides of the political isle instead of being the popular chosen one. Will be slow burn harry daphne. It's also Slytherin harry with mentor snape)
