Daphne greengrass is a popular pairing for a lot of reasons

She is a blank slate, so there really is no wrong way to write her. She's a Slytherin girl, which opens up a LOT of different story types (harry falls for a death eater, daphne gets used to get to harry by death eaters, harry can get seduced to the death eaters, she can be a good girl in a bad house, she can bring in politics that other girls wouldn't bring in simply because slytherin house is almost always more political, she lends herself very well to 'gray' harry fics, she allows for tropes outside of what your standard Gryffindor girl pairing will give you etc.

A lot of stories have her as an ice queen because honestly, those stories can be really fun to read and she fills that role well as canon and fanon didn't really have a dedicated ice queen type girl.

Personally, daphne is my favorite pairing, and she is the girl that is being paired with harry in the fanfic that I am writing
