I kinda envision Nurmengard as a huge overkill, similar to Tai Lung's prison in Kung Fu Panda.

1000 guards

Every ward known to Wizardkind /and/ the Goblin Nation

Magical-suppression bracelets

Horrific death traps

A trench filled with the Draught of Living Death

A single way in or out

And only one prisoner.
