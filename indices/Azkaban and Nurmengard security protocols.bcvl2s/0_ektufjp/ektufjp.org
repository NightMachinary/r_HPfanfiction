That short story told through letters between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, whose name I forget (/38 Owls/? I could be wrong on the number) has an interesting take on what Nurmengard looks like and how it works.

But, generally... security protocols? What security protocols? It's magic. Nurmengard is, I think, commonly understood to be just under some extremely powerful, Hogwarts-grade protective enchantments. From the way Voldemort was able to kill Grindelwald without anyone interfering, one gets the feeling that there was never anyone else inside the prison than Grindelwald once he was imprisoned there; there didn't need to be; no earthly thing could have broken him out. (Not even Voldemort; it is my belief that if he had tried to drag Grindelwald out rather than kill him, the enchantments still would have prevented it.)

As for Azkaban, it's guarded by Dementors. That's it. It doesn't need any more security than that (indeed, we see that it doesn't in how easily the Death Eaters barge out once the Dementors are persuaded to join Voldemort's side in the War). The prisoners are kept in a mental state where the thought of escape is literally impossible, so they don't try. And if they somehow do try the Dementors are allowed to Kiss them, so they're /highly motivated/ to seek out said escapees.
