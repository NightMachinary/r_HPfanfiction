There are some great canon compliant Ginny fics:

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is a wonderful year 6 story from Ginny's POV.

Fellow redditor [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] wrote *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408), the best year 7 Hogwarts story imho.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is an excellent fic about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2010.
