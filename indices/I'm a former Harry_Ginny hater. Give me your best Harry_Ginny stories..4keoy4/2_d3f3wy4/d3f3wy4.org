  So hit me with your best Harry/Ginny. No stories with Ginny as a Harry fangirl are allowed.

My own best? Probably linkffn(4889913), followed by linkffn(5116751) (one-shot), linkffn(4905771) (one-sided HP/GW), and linkffn(4543379) (hate-triangle thing with Harry, Ginny, and Daphne).

The community's best with the pairing? Arguably, linkffn(4101650). Perhaps the best Ginny-centric character piece is linkffn(6919395); it's not HP/GW (yet), but you won't see the character in the same way. Definitely worth the read.
