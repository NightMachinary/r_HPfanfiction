[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breakers: The Maya By Jonathan Avery]] Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter.
