I'd say these are probably my favourite of the long ones (in no particular order though). For such a great pairing, there really aren't that many - and even fewer that're good. It's weird, but probably a mark at how good the pairing is that even a crap story can get us shipping it. Definitely my favourite pairing as well, with Harry-Luna as a close second. :)
