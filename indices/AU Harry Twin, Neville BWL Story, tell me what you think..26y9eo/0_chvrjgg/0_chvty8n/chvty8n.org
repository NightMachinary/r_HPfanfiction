Good point about Harry being mature, it does seem a bit over the top, i will try and tone it down a bit. Neville and Alan aren't Harry's enemies(No prizes for guessing who will be his enemy). I can't reveal anything without spoilers about them, or about the point of Alan and Stephanie, but i do have a plan for them. Harry and Alan don't really hate each other. They're just very different people and spent their childhood doing different things. Thanks for the comment, you gave me a lot to think about
