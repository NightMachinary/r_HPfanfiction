Its a decent start. However there are major plot holes in your story. Why is Harry that mature? Kids dont grow up that fast. Whats the point of bashing Nevil or Alan? If you are trying to make Harry look good than make his enemies strong so its even better when he overcomes them. What made Harry and Alan hate each other? Brothers are brothers, they fight some times but they will cover each other and wish the best for each other. Whats the point of introducing OC like Alan and Stephanie?
