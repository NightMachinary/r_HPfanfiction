- Your paragraphs are way too large. Three/four sentences per para for exposition, one/two for dialogue. Otherwise the eyes get tired. Line space between dialogue lines for the same reason.

- Think a bit about sentence structure too. You have long sentences filled with commas and clauses, which get a bit tiring to read. Try removing clauses that are useless, or could be revealed later. Dashes help break up the monotony.

- Daphne Greengrass is all but an OC. The reader has no reason to care about her, so it's tedious when Eyan constantly worries about her. You also didn't make us care much about Eyan either -- we should be sharing in his frustrations, fears and anger, and elective choices don't really do that for us.

- Snakes don't have dens.
