linkao3(17777138) is Hermione/Dean, and although it is WIP it develops kind of nicely. Pure fluff, not much drama or adventure.

Also, there is one when Dean stops Hermione's ranting about liberating slaves with some rather chosen words persuading her she knows what she talks about. Then they move S.P.E.W. from followers of William Wilberforce to be more like RSPCA and just prevent harm to home-elves. Couldn't find it now. I am not sure, whether eventually Hermione/Dean romance ensues.
