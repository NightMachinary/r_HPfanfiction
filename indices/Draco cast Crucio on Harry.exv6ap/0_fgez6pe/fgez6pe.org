Dumbledore would cover that up faster than you can say "Guilty!"

Dumbledore:

- already sent Harry to the Dursleys for over ten years.
- already let Draco slide by almost killing three or four people while plotting to kill him.
- Allowed Marietta Edgecombe to be memory charmed in front of him to cover stuff up.
- Shelved all of Snape's past transgressions (doesn't matter if they were all shown or not), because he became his semi-once in a while-maybe-spy.

He would totally cover it up. He's too hardheaded and set in his ways to let his plan change once he set his mind to it.
