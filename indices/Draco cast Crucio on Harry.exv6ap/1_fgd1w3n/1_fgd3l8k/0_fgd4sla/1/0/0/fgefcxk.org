I don't disagree that Snape kept students in Hogwarts safer, but students /were/ getting tortured and Neville got beat the shit out of. Neville himself tells us Michael Corner got tortured and mentions unnamed others. They had a 1st year chained up.

  How's Harry going to find out the info he needs? Get the sword?

By Dumbledore telling him and giving him the sword as he's very much alive for most of HBP because only plot kept him from doing so. There's also the fact that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only remember about basilisk fangs at the end of DH and not the end of HBP. Harry also manages to disregard speaking to Slughorn about Horcruxes in general.
