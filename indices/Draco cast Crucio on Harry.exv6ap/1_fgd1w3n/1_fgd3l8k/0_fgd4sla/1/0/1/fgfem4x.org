No. Harry does not have to die to defeat Voldemort. You can destroy his body, no matter the Horcruxes and then go searching for them. If anything, that would make the search easier. Even assuming that Harry is indeed a Horcrux (which makes no sense given the protection he has), you can reduce Voldemort to a wraith and remove his entire powerbase, effectively preventing his return until Harry dies aged 130 or something like that.
