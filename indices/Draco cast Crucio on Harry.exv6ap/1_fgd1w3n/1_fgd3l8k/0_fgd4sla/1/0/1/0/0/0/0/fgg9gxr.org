  THE "ALL WAS WELL" LINE WAS 17 YEARS LATER. You're ignoring 17 years of possible struggle!

So you would say that all was well in, for example, Poland in 1964? That the 1/5 death toll amongst the population has been completely equalised? That there was no resentment, no trauma, no families torn apart?

Or, a more recent example, do you think that in Syria, 19 years down the road all will be well? That the economy will make a full recovery and a status quo ante bellum can be restored in that time?

Or how about a longer perspective? The US is still divided amongst its civil war battle lines. Or would you really say that all is well there now, nevermind in 1884?

  I love how you went from "Harry doesn't need to kill himself" to "Harry should blow himself up!"

At which point do I talk about suicide bombing? You plant invisible explosives, the big fault of disillusioned objects (visible while moving) is irrelevant if things just lie there, you get the hell away and watch the fireworks from a safe distance. And you can certainly plant enough explosives on the perimeter of the camp to completely blow it up.
