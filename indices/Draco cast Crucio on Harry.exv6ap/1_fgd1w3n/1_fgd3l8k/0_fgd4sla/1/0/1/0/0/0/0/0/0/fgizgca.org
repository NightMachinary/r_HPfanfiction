First of all, the epilogue is 19 years later. If you want to troll, at least check your facts.

  How the fuck do you think it's logical to summarize 17 years with three words?

"But we prevailed", "Justice was served" or maybe "The wounds healed". You could do a lot better without the three word limit, but here you go.

As for the examples I've given, if you really are too blind to see the parallels between what happened in Poland until 45 and the fact that the Ministry was deporting people of a certain birth under laws which look like a bad copy of the NÃ¼rnberg laws, well, I'd recommend picking up a history book.

Syria and the US were just further examples of countries torn apart by civil war. And given that you can see the divide one-and-a-half centuries later, someone claiming all was well, even in a metaphorical way, would have been utterly wrong.
