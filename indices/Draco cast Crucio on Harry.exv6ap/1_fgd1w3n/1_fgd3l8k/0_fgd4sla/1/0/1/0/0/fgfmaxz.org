By whom? Voldemort threw away his entire forces in that stupid frontal assault on Hogwarts. By the time he was finished, Bellatrix had been the last one standing before she was killed. Umbridge also apparently was dealt with easily as "all was well" in the epilogue, implying that there was no bloody struggle for control over the ministry.

Execute all surviving Death Eaters or have them kissed by dementors and Voldemort has no powerbase left. Hell, Harry could have planted a few tons of disillusioned explosives (transfiguration, your friend and helper) from under his cloak and ended the conflict during the hour Voldemort gave him to surrender himself. Mechanical detonators and chemical reactions are not impeded by magic after all.
