The point is that it's much easier for everything to go horribly with Snape dead. He played a crucial part in DH. If Neville and Ginny aren't killed, they're sure as shit tortured without Snape there to reign in the death eaters.

Without Snape, some other actual death eater becomes headmaster of hogwarts. And then who's Dumbledore going to talk to? What's stopping them from just torching Dumbledore's portrait? How's Harry going to find out the info he needs? Get the sword? There are ways these things can happen anyway, but it's made even more difficult.

Losing Snape would be a heavy blow against the good side.
