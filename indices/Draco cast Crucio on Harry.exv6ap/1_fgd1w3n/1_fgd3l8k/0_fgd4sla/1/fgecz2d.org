Neville in DH:

  "Doesn't matter. They don't want to spill too much pure blood, so they'll torture us a bit if we're mouthy but they won't actually kill us.‚Äù

And just like Harry doesn't have to be the one to kill Voldemort, Neville doesn't have to be the one to kill the snake. Oliver Wood is right there speaking with Neville and both Ron and Hermione are still around. Hell, Harry was just about to move.
