  And why the flying fuck would Snape ever make an Unbreakable Vow to protect Malfoy?

It's hinted at that he's Lucius friend and he genuinely seems to like and approve of Draco (which shows just how much of a hypocrite he is). It's why Narcissa felt comfortable coming to him. In the 1st potions class, Harry says something like "Snape walked around insulting everyone's work, but Draco's" Every Gryffindor, but every student but Draco.
