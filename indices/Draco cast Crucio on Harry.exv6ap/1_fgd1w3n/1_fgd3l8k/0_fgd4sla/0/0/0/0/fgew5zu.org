Honestly, the plot is a joke and characters seem to be holding the idiot ball for no reason except that.

Harry wasn't told how to destroy horcruxes at all by Dumbledore. He could've handed the sword over to Harry any time during the year. He could've told him about basilisk venom and made provisions to have the fangs accessible to the Order and the trio.

But, /nooo/. Snape needs to be relevant somehow so he passes on a sword. Ron needs another moment to shine so he can suddenly imitate parseltongue well enough to fool a magical entranceway.

And why the flying fuck would Snape ever make an Unbreakable Vow to protect Malfoy? His position and reputation with Voldemort is secure. The Malfoys' power is on the wane and they're rather irrelevant at that point. Sure, he could've agreed to help without risking his life.
