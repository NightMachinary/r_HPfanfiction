And all of that can be blamed on Dumbledore for not giving the trio the necessary tools before he died.

Also, a Basilisk tooth would have done the trick, and Harry can easily get into the chamber. And since Goblins don't count as humans, you can simply use the Imperius on them, just like Harry does at Gringotts anyway. It's not even morally questionable since keeping the Horcrux under their protection is siding with Voldemort, which makes them enemy combatants. And who says that the passage into the ROR wouldn't appear if they need it. Not to mention that with Snape dead, the Order would not have lost their best fighter in that stupid extraction plan.
