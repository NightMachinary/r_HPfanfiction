  to what extend does Snape need to protect him.
#+end_quote

To the best of his ability. Narcissa makes him swear to protect Draco to the "best of his ability."

I don't see any way out of this. If Snape finds out Dumbledore is planning on turning Draco in, he has to act or die. The best of his ability would be to either convince Dumbledore not to do it or kill Dumbledore.

And if Snape doesn't find out, then he finds out when Draco is in Azkaban. And /then/ Snape has to get him out. Or die.

Kind of a clever idea from Rowling. Gives a good excuse for Draco sticking around despite Dumbledore knowing what he's doing. It just makes Snape look stupid for accepting the unbreakable vow.
