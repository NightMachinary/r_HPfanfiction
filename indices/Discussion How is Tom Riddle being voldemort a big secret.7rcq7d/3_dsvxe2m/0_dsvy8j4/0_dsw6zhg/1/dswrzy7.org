The caveats in PoS are (1) the wizard must be "exceptionally skilled" at runes (i.e. on par with Dumbledore) if they want to conceal intangible secrets and even then the more compex the info is the harder it is and (2) you have to entrust your secret into another person and they can't be bound at all.
