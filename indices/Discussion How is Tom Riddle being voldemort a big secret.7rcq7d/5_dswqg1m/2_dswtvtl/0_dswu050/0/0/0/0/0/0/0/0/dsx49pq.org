You were looking for an explanation to the apparent dissonace between the stated pureblood tenets and their application and I gave an example of how purebloods reconcile their ideology with that dissonance--the same way Nazis did. Or the same way any ideology does, really. Twisting the language to appear as if it supprts what you say.

And I don't know why you backpedalled with "plz no offense". It's pretty obvious that purebloods are wizard Nazis and I don't think anyone would be offended by this comparison.
