The point is that they're not letting a Muggleborn into the club if said Muggleborn pretends not to be a Muggleborn and the pure-bloods also pretend that they-re not Muggleborn.

That is, what determines whether the Muggleborn is a Muggleborn or a Half-blood is not their actual biology/parentage but rather their willingness to sign-up to the pure-blood cause.
