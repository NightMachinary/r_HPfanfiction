  You were looking for an explanation to the apparent dissonace between the stated pureblood tenets and their application

What? I wasn't, though. The Pottermore wiki, apparently, states that being a pure-blood more has to do with political leanings than biology.

While there can absolutely be that dissonance that allows them to make excuses for certain individuals where it improves their position, the only point I'm trying to make is that they're /absolutely racist/ and it's not /simply/ a political movement.

/That's/ why I said your post supports my own position. I wasn't twisting your language at all - you were just saying something that coincides with my point.

I suppose you could say that no one would be offended, and maybe that's the case, but I wasn't /backpedalling/. I didn't change my opinion or position or anything like that, I was just making it clear that I understand and acknowledge there's a difference in regards to the scope of damage between the Nazi and Pureblood movements. Like I said at the end, their ideology, however, is nearly exactly the same.

I realize, now, you may have been talking about the purebloods own dissonance instead of my response to you. In that case it doesn't particularly change the rest of my post, but I apologize for thinking you were saying I was manipulating your words.
