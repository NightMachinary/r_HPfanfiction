I think the miscommunication between us is that you consider that "Muggleborn" means something independent of the political pure-blood movement. But my position is that "Muggleborn", "half-blood", and "pure-blood" are invented social categories, not natural kinds. Characters like Dumbledore don't just oppose pure-blood supremacy, they reject the whole classification system as false.

So it's not that someone /really/ is a Muggleborn but the pure-bloods pretend that they are a half-blood. It's that what a person /really/ is, in terms of blood-status, is determined by those people for whom blood status matters, the people who maintain the classification system, i.e. those who subscribe to the political movement. There is no "truth" to blood status, other than what social category your peers place you in.
