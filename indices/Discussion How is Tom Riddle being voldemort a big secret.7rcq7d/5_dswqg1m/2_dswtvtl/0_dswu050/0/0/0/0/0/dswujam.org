So they could rationalize that the muggleborn is a half-blood, sure. I get that. I'm not arguing that. But that's just a convenient excuse to further their movement. Their beliefs haven't changed any.

Maybe I'm not explaining myself clearly. That pottermore quote says something to the effect of “being a pureblood is more accurately defined by political intentions than biological fact”.

But this is obviously not the case. While excuses could be made for worthwhile deviations, they're still very much focused on your blood status. The fact that we would agree that they'd /entirely change your classification to make you a more acceptable addition to their political party/ is kind of a confirmation of that fact, not an argument.
