I think it depends on how successful said Muggleborn was at passing themselves off as pure-blood. If the Muggleborn in question "discovered" (i.e. invented) some family connection to a known wizarding family, and were useful to the cause, I think they would be acceptable, yes.

Indeed, one suspects the pure-bloods would prefer it that way - consider how Slughorn assumes Hermione is related to the Dagworth-Granger family when he sees that she is talented - there is an assumption that people who are good at magic must be pure-blood, and so for such a person to "discover" that they are not really a Muggleborn but a half-blood would probably be greeted with satiwsfaction among pure-blood advocates.

Of course they'd probably continue to gossip about you and look down on you, but it would be enough for appearance's sake.
