That it doesn't make sense is the point. No one calls Voldemort out on being a hypocrite because they're /all/ hypocrites. Make the right noises and you're one of them regardless of your actual history (see Umbridge professing to be a pure-blood Selwyn in DH). Make the wrong noises and you're not one of them, even if you have a long line of wizarding ancestors (see Weasleys).

It's not about blood, it's about political allegiance. (But you still have to pretend that it's about blood if you want to be part of the club).
