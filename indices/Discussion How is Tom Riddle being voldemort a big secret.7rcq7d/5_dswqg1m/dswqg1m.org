Who says it's a secret? Seems to me that it's a piece of information that a fair few people know (Lucius Malfoy, Barty Crouch Jr, Ollivander, Voldemort's school "friends"), it just isn't thrown around all the time.

In anticipation of the inevitable follow-up, here is the Pottermore section on "pure-blood":

#+begin_quote
  As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent (â€˜I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.
