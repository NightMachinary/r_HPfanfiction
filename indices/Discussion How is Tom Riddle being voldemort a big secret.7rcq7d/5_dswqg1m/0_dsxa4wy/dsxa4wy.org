  As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent (â€˜I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.
