If everyone is equal magically what is the fun in watching thr tournament?

Much if Jk's tournament was fun imo because you got to see different champions play to their strengths because of the power differences, as well as finding the "best" wozard. A lot of fanfics (like "the lie i lived") also do something similar (like including dueling). I agree with another commenter that if u add this you should explain more how magic works in your universe and what the draw of the Triwizard Tournament is then.
