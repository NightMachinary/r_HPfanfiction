I could see it increasing just the base amount of magic everyone has. So if Harry sucks at transfiguration, he becomes better at it, but is still porportionally inferior to say Cedric, who would have more skill and practice. Sort of forcing the champions to fight smart, and not coast on their innate traits, which would in turn better represent the schools and their education, which would be the deciding factor in a lot of cases.
