I think that that was the opposite idea of what the goblet is meant for. It's supposed to only pick those that are Magically 'worthy' (Aka: Those it deems the ablest to compete in the tasks and come out the victor). The point of equalizing the champions is, in fact, pointless after that point, nor do I think an object should be capable of permanently increasing/decreasing a wizard's power for equalization's sake.

  how could a quarter-veela sing a dragon to sleep when it normally takes half-a-dozen wizards to stun them normally?

That makes absolutely no sense, it's a veela's special ability, they have their own magic just like house-elves and goblins have their own magic. So technically, that Veela part of her allows her to access a wider variety of spells in the fact that she can use Veela-only spells, whereas most wizards are either not capable of accessing such powers or the Veela keep it a 'family secret' and don't allow wizards to learn it.
