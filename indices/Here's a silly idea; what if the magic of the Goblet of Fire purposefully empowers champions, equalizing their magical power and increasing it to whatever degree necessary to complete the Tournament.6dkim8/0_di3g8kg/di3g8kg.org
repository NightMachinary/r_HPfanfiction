THe problem I always see with stuff like this is the overrepresantation of the goblet. For me the goblet of fire had one and only one function, choose the champion. Periode. It dosen't magical bind anything (atleast not the goblet itself does rather your act of throwing you name in does if you really need the magical binding) and it dosen't hamper with anything else.

But of course anyone can see it diffrent in their fanfic but an additonal problem I see with your idea is the premise of 'magical power'. If you say it empowers the champion you would need to explain the way your magic works thorughtout to make it beliveable. If you can do that, your idea could be worth to explore (maybe except the Dumbledore did it part, that sound mostly lame).
