I second this story. Great, long read. Fair amount of action.

Also, seriously? That's your complaint about the story? Perhaps years ago it was more common to take the SAT there at the high school.

Everyone I've ever talked to about SAT and ACT took them at a local high school. So I think it's a perfectly acceptable assumption.
