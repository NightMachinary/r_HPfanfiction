Well, first fic I can think off that has Harry transferring doesn't have that scene you want, but I don't give a shit. I've got a real soft spot for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697521/1/The-Brave-New-World][The Brave New World by bellerophon30]] because the school (Great Lakes) is in the UP and most likely an incredibly damn short drive from my hometown. And Chapter 6 has my favorite chapter title of all time: Bladvak, It Means Pickaxe.

However, I do have one complaint about it. Chapter 11 claims that a character took the SAT at the Marquette high school. This is false. The ACT (which is the more common of the two standardized college admission exams taken in the UP) and the SAT are taken at Marquette's college, Northern Michigan University.
