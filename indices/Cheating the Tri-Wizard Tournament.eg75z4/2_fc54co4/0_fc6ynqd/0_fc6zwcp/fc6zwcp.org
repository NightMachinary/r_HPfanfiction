I've seen a couple where either Harry tries this and doesn't get away with it, or the adults want him to but Harry is â€˜so independent and takes orders from no one' and as is common in those types of stories OPs his way past all the obstacles. (Probably leaves Ron to drown too because Weasley bashing :/ )
