It's gotta be slytherin or dark AU Harry! Bitter/Smart/Dark Magic Harry is my favorite, but really only if he's not paired with Voldemort. It makes me sad, lol. So hard to find a good fic. Whenever I look at dark Harry fics they immediately have Voldemort and Harry run into each others arms like “don't worry... I understand you 🥺🥺🥺” and like completely overlook the fact that Voldemort ruined his whole life
