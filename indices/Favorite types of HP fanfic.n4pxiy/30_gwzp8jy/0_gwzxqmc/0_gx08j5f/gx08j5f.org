No I haven't! Thanks for the recommendation! üëç I'm following one called Cassiopeia at the moment, its on-going and recently alternate dimension but I'm really enjoying it and written very well. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17573267/chapters/41417477][Cassiopeia]]

Another one I enjoyed was The Black Resurgence - unfortunately abandoned... though it looks like it's been picked up by someone else since I last checked in on it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7736764/chapters/31577736][The Black Resurgence]]
