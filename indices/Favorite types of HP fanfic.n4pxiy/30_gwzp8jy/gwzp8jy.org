Always searching for completed stories fleshing out the black family... Ideally centred arouns Sirius's life time, always interested in a story realistically fleshing out pure-blood culture.

There are plenty of other stories I'll read, any thing reasonably well written, and long (50,000+).

And I love coming across a well written rare ship I haven't seen before. Usually makes me hunt for more and be severely disappointed for a few days afterwards! ðŸ˜‚
