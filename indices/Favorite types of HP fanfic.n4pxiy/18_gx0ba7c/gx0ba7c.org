Don't really have a set one as a favourite, changes a bit, but I do know what I don't like.

Snarry. No.

Drarry? Would have to be a really good hook.

Marauders fics? I should try them out but thus far, all fall flat.

Sirius/Hermione? Oh god, why does this exist?

Willing to hear any good recommendations though for any of them?
