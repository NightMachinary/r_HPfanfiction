I don't hate it like on principle but I don't really like Tom x Harry Tom x Hermione Tom x OC or Tom x Bellatrix

Which is what I usually come across and I don't usually come across depictions of Tom in a romance where it feels like him. Like ive seen alot where he seems in character and then the romance starts and he doesn't really act the same.

So i end up liking the friendship based ones with him more ðŸ˜….
