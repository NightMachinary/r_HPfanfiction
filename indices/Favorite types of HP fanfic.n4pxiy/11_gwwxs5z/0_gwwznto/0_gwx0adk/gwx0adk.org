Oh! I can totally empathize with that. I started out reading and writing Tom/Hermione, but I was really picky with stories I would read, and writing it was so /difficult/... and it took me months to realize I had such difficulty with it because I don't see them as generally compatible! I still like my Tom/Hermione work, but it took a /lot/ of finessing to pair them in a way that satisfied me. I've moved on to more niche Tom pairings since.
