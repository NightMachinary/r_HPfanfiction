On one hand, Tom is often portrayed as someone who sees all love as a weakness and is obviously evil, with the implication that if he could feel love then he would be more. "normal". That goes into a lot of negative ace and aro stereotypes, a megalomaniac is not the representation we want or need. Also, aro people feel love just not...romantically? You can love your friends and family just as strong.

​

HOWEVER-

(I know in cursed child he had a kid with Bella but let's ignore that)

​

I cannot see him as anything but aro-ace. His being in a relationship just feels weird, but I have nothing against people who are into stories like that.
