I always thought they meant feel 'love' in a more general way. as in love for humanity. like I thought the implication was that he was a psychopath and nothing about asexuality. So I think he's really a sexual person but he doesn't value anyone. Plus the story puts no focus on Tom Ridds sex life. It's like Dumbledore.
