If you like Riddle-centric fics that humanize him, I'm writing a Harry and Tom fic (no romance) where they have a brotherly/student-and-teacher relationship.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13784563/1/The-Grand-Tour-of-Messrs-Potter-and-Riddle]]). It's also under the same name on ao3 - see if you like it!
