Mod!Harry, Time Travel, OP!Harry

Anything written by Lomonaaeren is A+.

I read tons of Tomarry & Snarry stuff.

Still, there are a couple of excellent fics that I would have never read without people recommending them to me. I typically despise Female!Harry but some of my favorite fics ever have a female Harry. Some are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] and all its associated sequels

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]] even though it isn't finished.

I occasionally read some Mentor!Snape stuff as well.
