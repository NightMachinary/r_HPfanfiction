This the one. I have literally entered fandoms of source material I know nothing about based on the summary of time travel fic that looks like it would be bomb.com. If it looks like it'll be heart-wrenching, I am here for it. It's how I got into so many fandoms. To be completely honest for the past couple of years (really the last decade) I don't watch things without checking what the fanfic count looks like. I still read books for the sheer joy of it but I only watch shows/movies that have fanfic. And there better be some time travel fix it.
