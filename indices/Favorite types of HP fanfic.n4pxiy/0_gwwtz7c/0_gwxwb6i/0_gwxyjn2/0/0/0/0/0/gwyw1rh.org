If I may suggest The Archeologist? Technically it's dimensional travel, but there's only a couple significant changes between universes (and really only significant in how directly they affect Harry [well, both Harry's]) and it takes a full established adult Harry back to 1992. So in effect it's a time travel fic with added flavor.

 

And I guarantee this Harry doesn't follow the normal "PeggySue!Harry" checklist. (Yes technically there are crossovers listed but you don't need to know anything about Bloodborne or Sword Art Online)
