Would you like to link some of what you consider the best of these?

I thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905/chapters/45993925][Messing With Time]] was enjoyable. The author is competent, the prose workable, but I wouldn't consider it a gem of a fic. More like a ... very smooth rock.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25236877][Three Hallows, a Rat, and Redemption]] is good. Interesting premise, that Peter is reincarnated as Harry. Sort of. I recommend it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13978644][Resurrect The Living]] is another that's fun, but not exactly a literary masterpiece.
