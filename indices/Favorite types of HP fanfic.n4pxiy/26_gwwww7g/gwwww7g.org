I wrote [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/magicians-realism.html][a blogpost]] about it. The Magicians' realism, e.g., stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/][Northumbrian]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]], [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]], or [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Forrest_of_Holly]]: [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][plot]] and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/overall-post-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][characters]] are a way more important than magic and other toys.
