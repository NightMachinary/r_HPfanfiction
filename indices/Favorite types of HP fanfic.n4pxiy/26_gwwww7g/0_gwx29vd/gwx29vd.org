So I started reading through your blog post (and the posts linked from that, creating an ever-growing spiral of tabs to distract me from work today, thanks for that!), and I really must say, as much as I do enjoy the style of realism you're describing: why not engage with characters like Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore in realistic stories grounded in normal human experiences?

I'm hugely biased by these two being among my favorite characters. I write for one, and I will eventually write for the other. Throw Gellert Grindelwald in there, because why not and he's definitely of the same character archetype, and you've got a trio of my faves including one of my favorite ships in the game (Grindeldore).

Humanizing the ultra-powerful people that drive much of the core HP series plot is wonderful fun. And we know so much about them that would make them perfect fodder for this sort of realism! Tom Riddle worked as a shop clerk for around a decade! Albus Dumbledore was just a schoolteacher for multiple decades! Even during the heights of their power, they must have daily routines, they must have space for compelling character growth---and that's to say nothing of adding in canon divergence that opens up opportunities for even more realism.

With Tom, I've always felt that writing him in really mundane situations focusing on character growth is exciting because his character has so much room to grow. Dumbledore, though not starting from the same place, has much of his own baggage to work out. If anything, I want more realistic stories about the unremarkable parts of their lives.
