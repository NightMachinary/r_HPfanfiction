  why not engage with characters like Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore in realistic stories grounded in normal human experiences?

You mean the non-magic AU? That's a fair question, I suppose, but I have to add completely against any theory, that the magic is fun. Also, the magical community has additional advantages: very small universe, which is easier to grasp (and describe) than the endless complexities of Muggle universe, and it feels more gemütlich (cosy? G. K. Chesterton claimed there is no good translation into English). I am also thinking about the simplicity and directness of the Western cowboy stories --- probably not because everybody is as heavily armed as anybody else, but mostly because for small and more simple universe. Dreaming about the simple life.

There is probably even some relationship to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Herriot][James Herriot]] and “It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet” and sequels. That kind of feeling.

That humanization element is for example the reason why I liked “Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray” linkffn(714431) before it turned into the ultra-sugary romance, which I didn't like that much.
