Well, it is teenage/young-adults adventure story, so you need some adversary, and it is quite often a bildungsroman so The Hero's Journey with The Great Teacher is quite appropriate as well. But if you ask, why we don't have more realistic descriptions of both non-crazy Voldemort, and failing but more or less honest Dumbledore, it is just because it is very hard to write it, and most fanfiction authors are not very good, being amateurs.
