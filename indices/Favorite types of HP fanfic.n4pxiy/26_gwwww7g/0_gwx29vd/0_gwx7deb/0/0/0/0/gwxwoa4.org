I haven't done anything like that. I don't know many about Tom/Dumbledore's normal life stories, true (there are some small exceptions), but I like for example a sad alone misunderstood Dumbledore in “Honour Thy Blood” linkffn(12155794), because he seems to be a way more realistic than super!Dumbledore and especially than bashed!Dumbledore.
