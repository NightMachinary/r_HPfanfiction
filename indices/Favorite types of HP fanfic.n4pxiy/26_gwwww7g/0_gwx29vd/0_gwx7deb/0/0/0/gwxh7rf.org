I'm not really asking why it doesn't exist, more so lamenting that it doesn't and commenting on your choice to exclude those two particular characters from the stable of available people to write these sorts of low-stakes, human stories about.

Much of my reading energy goes toward hunting these fics down, and all of my writing energy is poured into it, and I do find myself quite fulfilled. Just, like any fan of niche content, I wish it were more prevalent so I would have more to enjoy and more people with whom I could talk about it.
