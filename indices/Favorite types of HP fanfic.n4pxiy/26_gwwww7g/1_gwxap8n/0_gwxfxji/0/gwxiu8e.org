Its funny cuz Harmony is what turned me bitter in the first place lol

I liked the idea of power fantasies when I first started reading hp fics and i liked fixit stories and Slytherin or Dark Harry just because it was new to me at the time. And alot of them were Harmony and had all the problems I was talking about.

Plus they kinda took away alot of the unique interesting things about Hermione's characterization to make her a powerfantasy. Though tbh they arent the only ship that does that to Hermione.

They did similar things with Harry but Hermione was more of a fav to me than Harry so that bothered me more.
