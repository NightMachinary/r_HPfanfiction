  I don't care about characterization or character growth because the character doesn't need to grow and who they are doesn't matter how strong or smart they are is what does.

That's IMHO the fatal flaw of almost all Harmony stories. Purely on abstract theoretical level I can accept that Harmony is perhaps possible, or (given [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][how poorly Ginny is written in the books]]) or even more probable, but the execution almost universally sucks.
