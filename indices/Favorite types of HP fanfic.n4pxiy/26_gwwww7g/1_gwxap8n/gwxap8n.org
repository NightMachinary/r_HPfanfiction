/" What I mean, is that the magic there seemed to me like something external bolted on the top of the story, not inherent to the universe heroes of the story lived in."/

I mean you are absolutely right I think this is another reason i dislike the super genius MC becomes brilliant op or hyper intelligent witch/wizard stories where they logic out magic/make it scientific or hack wizard politics as preteens type stories

There are many issues I have with the hp series but what did and still does resonate with me boils down to two factors.

The awe and wonder of experiencing a magical fantasy world thats a bit absurd

and seeing these characters grow and struggle and overcome challenges unique to who they are so seeing them succeed and be happy resonates.

The super logical scientific interpretation of the magical world takes away alot of that awe wonder and absurdity imo.

And the hyper competent and powerful mc doesn't feel very compelling. Im watching to see how he/she solves the next obstacle. I don't care about characterization or character growth because the character doesn't need to grow and who they are doesn't matter how strong or smart they are is what does.

I don't care as much about side chatacters or relationships because the story is focused on the cool ways the mc ( or sometimes main ship) can come out seeming cool strong and smart. No matter who the supporting cast is they aren't going to be more competent or powerful. So in a story like this they dont really matter outside of maybe some fun dialogue.

To me personally I get bored pretty quick.

Which is honestly a shame because I do like smart characters and I have seen stories where smart characters who have to fight using their intelligence but the set up still makes them struggle the supporting characters have important contributions and character growth is still very important. And even fanfics like that but its not really common and now i side eye powerful or competent mcs in hp fics.
