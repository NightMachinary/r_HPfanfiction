No! More along the lines meta fics, and "what-if's". Fics that look at a character's motivations and personhood and dissects it.

While they /can/ fall into authors' rants, it's more of a kind rant. a happy one. it's your friends excitedly telling you about their favorite hobby, where you can see their entire face light up.

My favorite examples are....a lot. But my tops picks are things like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473][The Dogfather]] which is not /too/ meta at first, but by the time you get to the last installment in the series obviously almost an essay about fandom, canon, and how we interact with it. And it's beautiful.

/"In the best of all possible worlds, there would never be a need for Harry to walk into the Forbidden Forest with a Snitch clutched in his hand and dread coiled around his heart."/

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24174838/chapters/58222408][A question of ethics]] is also great, it can act as a study between the relationship between Tom Riddle and Dumbledoor. But it also asks questions that the audience would ask, and explores those concepts. While the original soft magic system in the books was certainly whimsical there plenty of holes or throwaway lines that have disturbing implications that the audience is left to fill in the gaps for.

​

/“Would you say a Transfigured animal is alive, sir?”/

/Dumbledore showed no outward sign of discomfort when he replied, “It depends on how you define life, Mister Riddle, though the short answer is No. Adalbert Waffling wrote a rather seminal paper on just the subject, if you are so interested--”/

/“So a Transfigured animal cannot die?” interrupted Tom./

/“It can be reverted to its original form,” said Dumbledore. “You shall learn Untransfiguration in your second year--”/

/“But surely a Master of Transfiguration such as yourself can create an animal so life-like that it may as well be the real thing,” insisted Tom. “To the degree that if one should cut it, it would bleed--”/

/“An unusually cruel notion,” murmured Dumbledore./

​

And of course [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5147618][Eleven Up]] is a prime example of this!

/In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997./

I could rave on for it for days, but it's a great analysis on the effects of trauma in youth, what it means to be normal, what it means to be /not normal,/ and highlights some characters that did not get much forefront in the books or by most of the fandom.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1855237][Methods of Humanity]] was originally written as a character study on Tom Riddle/Voldemort/You-know who/Thomas Gaunt. While the plot expanded as the series progressed, its roots in what monster-hood is, how mortality helps us, and choosing your own identity carry throughout the entirety of it.

My favorite quotes form are probably;

/"Tom Riddle was never taught to live -- he had to learn from scratch."/

/"At some point, Tom Riddle forgot how to be a human. Learning again is difficult, but Lord Voldemort can do anything he puts his mind to."/

It's not everyone's cup of tea and I would not recommend it to everyone unlike the other three, but its in-depth exploration of Voldemort's image of himself is incredible.

​

Every single installment in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Boy with a scar]] is great by every standard, but my favorite parts are where the author directly speaks to /us/ the audience like this is more of a conversation rather than a written work. It dares to ask "What if? which is the question that probably inspires half of all fanfics, but the way dirgewithoutmusic explores the concepts is lovely.

"/you know what would have been great? if ron got sorted into slytherin./

/imagine-- we have this kid on the train, the first friend harry meets, with his corned beef sandwiches and smudged nose. ron is eleven years old and he wants gryffindor, because he's a weasley and that's what always happens. but it doesn't happen./

/what a way to redeem slytherin house-- or, god, at least complicate it. because ron is petty. he is mean and sharp and ambitious and jealous-- and he is loyal to the ends of the earth. he is all those things, and he is and always has been good."/

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17574581][Doubt tho the stars are fire]] is great as well, or at least if enjoy Sirius. It's an exploration of his relationship with his family, and a critique on the definition of Slytherin.

/"(In another life, perhaps he was more like Andromeda. Perhaps he rebelled, lived his life bright and loud and brave and Gryffindor. But in this life, Sirius Black decided that surviving was more important to him than living , and he adjusted his actions accordingly.)"/

​

Anyways! I could go on for hundreds of fics that make the english-major in me squeal in delight, but I have only been typing for a few minutes and this comment already seems absurdly long. I just really like fanfiction.
