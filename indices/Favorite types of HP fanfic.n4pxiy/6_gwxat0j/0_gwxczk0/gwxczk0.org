Ok tbh I am way more forgiving of this for stories in Harrys gen than Marauders . And its entirely because of what I read for both those types of stories.

Because I read alot of stories in Harry's gen where its very necessary to flesh out a supporting set of characters that had no personalities in canon. Like in Slytherin Harry AUs you would need alot of support character Slytherins to be friends or just give a better idea of what the house is like. Since Slytherin Harry is a popular au they keep being built on fleshed out and some eventually reach a level of consistency on what they are like. They end up feeling more like existing support characters than ocs. And so it just feels right when people start shipping them.

But for Marauders centric stories ( the ones i like anyway) alot of these focus very much on just the relations between Marauders and Lilly. There maybe some other characters like Snape and his friends as antagonists but that basically it. So when a super minor character or a character only name dropped once gets shipped with say Sirius it just feels like they exist just to give Sirius a girlfriend and I don't care.

Because unlike say in Slytherin Harry where I was interested to see Harry be in Slytherin and see his relationship with other Slytherins and how he functions in the house, I just wanted to see the Marauders relationships to each other while they undergo challenges. So I don't care about the ocs or any relationship with a marauder and a oc or basically oc then ðŸ˜…
