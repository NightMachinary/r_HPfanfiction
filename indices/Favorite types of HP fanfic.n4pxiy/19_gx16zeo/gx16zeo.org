Harry-centric canon divergence, where he grows up differently or has a different introduction to the wizarding world that changes his character, actions, and friends. Preferably Sirius raises and/or rescues Harry, but I'm not picky on who raises him as long as it's not Snape.

Harry-centric time travel or alternate dimension travel where he changes the timeline or uses his knowledge to help the new dimension rather than trying to preserve the timeline or sit back and let things happen.
