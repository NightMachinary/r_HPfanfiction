Ones which are pretty canon, like to the point where it could have been written in the book Harry isn't a powerful lord, headmaster of hogwarts etc handsome and unaware Harry is fun at times Characters reading the books is also fun sometimes Harry Potter what ifs, e.g sorted/ resorted in slytherin, died at the end etc No unnecessary relationships I don't like post war fics only Harry in hogwarts times and some Marauders Harry struggles with something e.g death of cedric, sirius, mental health but not Severitus or in a romantacising way. So I guess, angst? No adult or creature with underage characters , very creepy how popular this is I only like Canon pairings but like before I don't really want unnecessary relationships. maybe some harry/luna, maybe fremione, neville/luna, even wolfstar but very rarely

I'm picky tbh
