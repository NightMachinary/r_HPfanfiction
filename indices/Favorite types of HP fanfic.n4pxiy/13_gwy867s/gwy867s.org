Really different stuff than from canon generally. Generally dark; Voldie won, resistance dead/imprisoned, Wiz War went nuclear,Harry either a distant martyr or right at Voldy's roundtable,Captive Hermione crap, tent fics (at their worst when Ron has left)

I don't like bashing, but i like H/Hr so that ends up being inevitable.\\
On this oneself esteem test i was given, I wrote that my greatest strength is adaptiveness; cause I can roll with the punches, watching the Weasleys get bashed in one fic and praised in the other.
