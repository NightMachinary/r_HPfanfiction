Sorry I'm late but To Fight The Coming Darkness is a pretty great action-centric dark-fic. It starts with a simultaneous attack on Harry and all his friends while they're home for the summer, and spins out into covering the war from many angles. The Author is a lorehound, which is sometimes tiring and comes off as yet another fic author trying to flex how much smarter they are than Rowling. But, this is also a great thing,since the author comes up with loads of great ideas for wards and battle scenes. The constant introduction of new concepts and fleshing out minor characters also does well in making it feel like the war is heating up and has a lot of people's lives at stake.He takes the characters in weird directions (Neville's arc is unbelievable),but I found it weirdly engaging as well, since it was unpredictable has the very rare-pairing of Harry and Susan Bones Linkffn(To Fight The Coming Darkness)

Two Steps From Hell by ssserpensssotia is a Tom/Hermione fic. I clicked on it out of morbid curiosity, thinking it would suck, but it surprised me all through.Voldy finds out about the Horcruxes after Hermione is accidentally made one.He has to now keep her alive and gradually they fall for each other.It showed an almost appealing vision of the Death Eaters winning.Not doom and gloom and creepy manors,but parties, drugs and apartments in Venice,which seemed in line with how death eaters would act after winning, and really reminds me of the movie Cruel Intentions. It shows Hermione starting to struggle with her morality after spending too much time with Tom, his Inner Circle, and a now jaded, drug-addicted Harry.I loved how even though they were attracted to each other,(especially after Voldy gives Death back the hallows and gets back his good looks),there was still the tension of them being mortally opposed, as well as the fact that Hermione was, at the end of the day, his prisoner. Her friendship with Harry is as heartfelt as in canon, albeit in a dark, twisted way. It ends in a mind-blowing way. Linkffn(Two Steps From Hell)

Recnac Transfaerso by Celebony. It's premise is that Harry is back at Privet Drive, and for once a Muggle family moves in that treats him well. He grows close to them, and soon finds out that the father has been diagnosed with late-stage cancer. In his typical self-sacrificing way, Harry manages a spell to transfer the cancer to himself. The story then focuses on Harry going back to Hogwarts running on borrowed time, the character's reactions as everybody gradually finds out, and Harry's relationship to them all. It's a really old fic, and has this air of freeness, like its not weighed down by fanon tropes or even by complete canon Linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso)
