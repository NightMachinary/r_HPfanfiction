My favorite kinda fics are the crossovers where there's just enough foreign elements to mix things up but not flip the Wizarding World on its head.

linkffn(Something Wicked This Way Comes) is the prime example of this. Harry-is-raised-by-other-cool-characters is also great.

Otherwise strong leanings toward femslash.
