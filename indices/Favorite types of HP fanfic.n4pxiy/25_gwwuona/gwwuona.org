Angsty whumpy stories. Generally about society and problems in it. Something with witty, sarcastic writing and a just a dark sense of humour.

Usually these tend to be stories following Remus or Sirius after the war. Sirius dealing with Azkaban, Remus dealing with being a werewolf in an intolerant society.

I don't like romance or fluff or anything remotely piney or sappy. However, sadly most stories insist on having some romantic pairing in them. If it's done well and compliments a more plot/adventure focussed story then yeah sure but, I have no patience watching people be happy.

I think that's why I don't mind Wolfstar? Because generally, the two lads are so sad and tortured and depressed that there's rarely any romance and in their partnership? It's more desperation which is sad and interesting to read. For me anyway ðŸ˜Š.
