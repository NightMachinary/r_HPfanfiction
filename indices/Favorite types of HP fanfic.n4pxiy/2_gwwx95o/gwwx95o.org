I go through phases... Time travel with anyone Hermione, Harry, Sirius... it's an absolute shame that there are so few Ron time travel fics. Any an all Ron centric fics Maurders are also a favourite of mine. Also when I first got into fanfic about a decade ago more or less I was very into Hermione/Snape. If it is well written and complete I read it although I'm not a huge fan of slash and I don't like the pairing of anyone with Draco ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
