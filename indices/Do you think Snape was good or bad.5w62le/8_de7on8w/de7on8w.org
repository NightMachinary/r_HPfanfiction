I don't think Snape was /good/ or /bad/. For me, he sits firmly in the middle - he's a bad man, for sure, filled with petty hatred and a powerful obsession with Lily Potter, but at the same time ends up doing the "right" thing at the end (helping to defeat Voldemort).

The thing that sets Snape apart from the rest of the Order or the rest of the Death Eaters is that everything he did, he did so /on his own terms/. If anything, Snape is on his own side, and his only objective - in my mind - is seeking some kind of retribution for Lily's death, or even more so, /absolution/ for his role in destroying her life. Even when he's looking after Harry, it's only because he reminds him of Lily, and that he feels some kind of obligation to her memory - or Dumbledore exploits it, same thing really.

He's a hollow shell of a man to me, someone who's stripped away their humanity in pursuit of a single goal, some far-away aim that he's obsessed with reaching.

I think that if he could get his absolution without siding with Dumbledore or helping to defeat Voldemort, he would have done so. He often appears dissatisfied with the state of affairs (his rant at Dumbledore in HBP about not wanting to do it anymore), and that suggests to me that he'd be willing to leave it behind if it were in his interests.
