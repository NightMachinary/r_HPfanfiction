I agree that financially, he might be able to just walk away, but to me he's more concerned with the absolution of his sins - I should have phrased the original comment a little better, sorry.

The way he reacts when Harry calls him a coward at the end of HBP suggests that he wouldn't be able to just up and leave, even if he had the means. To me, the reason that he stays isn't because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the only way he can see that /might/ give him absolution.
