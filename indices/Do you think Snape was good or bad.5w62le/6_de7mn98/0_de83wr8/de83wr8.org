That second paragraph explains why I hate Snape, as every time we see Him giving info it's "Nothing yet" or "The Dark Lord's biding his time" yet seemingly Voldemort ended up with the entire Order Play Book, Names, Faces fuck the noseless wonder probably go a Autographed poster of the entire Order Roster and a Beer cozy!

I swear Snape paid simple Lip service to Dumbledore, the entire Climax of OotP depends on the Idea that the Order couldn't beat The Ministry 6 to the Ministry, yet we learn one book later that the Order has Nigh instantaneous communication with their Patroni and we know they all have Instantaneous Travel in the Form of Appartion, so if it took the agreed 3 hours for the Thestrals to reach London, How did it take that long for everyone to get there, unless Snape sat on the info for a long while, what part of Instantaneous did I miss that requires 3 hours?
