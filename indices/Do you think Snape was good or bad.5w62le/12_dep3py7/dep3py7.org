Snape was a bad person who did both bad and good things. As Dumbledore put it, he risks his life every day to protect Harry, and ended up being invaluable to the war and the downfall of Voldemort. He did this because he knew that Dumbledore was right - the best way to honour Lily and, perhaps Snape's own way of apologizing for not protecting her (?), was to ensure that her Voldemort would never be able to kill her son, the Voldemort's original goal.

But there is a problem with all of this. Snape was an asshole to tons of students for no good reason. He mentally tormented Neville for 6-7 years. He was wholly unprofessional by showing mass preference to his own house, and was willing to verbally insult children if it meant covering for his own house. When Harry saw Snape's memories during the Occlumency lessons, Snape stops giving lessons even though learning Occlumency is vital to Harry surviving Voldemort. He was a pureblood supremacist, at least before he met Lily, and was probably one /after/ he met her, too; he did join the Death Eaters, after all.

Ultimately, I think Snape and Snape's actions are far to complex to be able to keep it as black and white as "good or bad." While I don't think he was a good guy, he wasn't completely evil either.
