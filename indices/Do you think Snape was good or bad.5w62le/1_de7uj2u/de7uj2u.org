Umbridge levels of awful. For the most part when I judge Snape I ignore his war stuff, why? Because he wasn't doing it to be good, he was lashing out at Voldemort he wanted to take another man's wife for his own then, when he realised he set the most dangerous man on earth after her he realised he couldn't clear up his own mess so went to Dumbledore for help. It was purely selfish.

The time I believe to be the most important times to judge Snape are pre-Voldemort and in between the wars. These are the times he is who he chooses to be not who he needs to be to survive and as Dumbledore says it is our choices that define us. Lets take a moment to look at how he treats Neville. The poor boy is so terrified and bullied that Snaps is his Bogart. There is no excuse for being that cruel and petty. Now personally I think his behaviour towards Harry is disgraceful but some apologists will say that its okay because Harry's dad was a prick before James grew up. I think that's a dumb argument but ignoring that look at his reputation, he is a pathetic bulky who abuses his position to make others suffer. Unlike Umbridge who at least can pretend she's doing it for the Ministry and the good of the nation Snape is evil and cruel because he can be. Nobody MADE him become a Death Eater, he wanted the power, heck he only tries to do something about it when Lily was in danger.

In my opinion, and this might well be wrong but a lot of people ignore how much of a bully Snape is and look to blame James Potter. Being bullied at school was apparently an excuse to become a Death Eater, who knows what he did as a Death Eater. James Potter was a prat who grew up, who loved his wife and child enough that he was willing to try and fight Voldemort without a wand to buy them time to escape. Snape is easily one of the most interesting but cruel people in the series. Voldemort is the bogeyman, he is evil because he is, he's insane. Snape is real evil, the sort that actually exists in everyday life like Umbridge we all know a moody gut who feels the world owes them and lashes out. The sort of person who abuses whatever power they have simply because they can.
