I mean I always think that people forget that Snape needed to sell himself as a deatheater even in Hogwarts. If he wasn't seen to be biased against non Slytherin and have it out for the two chosen ones the deatheater's children would tell there parents and his loyalty would soon be questioned. That being said perhaps he did take it too far and saw Harry as a way to get back at James.
