It depends on how you look at it, he was true to the Order of the Phoenix but only really because he had a seriously weird obsession with Lily. I mean its not like he even liked Harry he just saw Lily's eyes and that is the only reason he did what he did - plus he IS the reason that they died if you remember it was Snape who told Voldemort about the prophecy to being with, even if he didn't know it at the time.

And as amazing as the revelation scene at the end was, he still treated Harry and many other students including Neville like crap for years and years, I mean Neville's biggest fear in the world was Snape in PoA. I don't think that just because he was a double agent for the "good guys" excludes all that, and it still boggles my mind that Harry named a son after him (even if it wasn't a first name) I mean yes by all means honor what he did, but to name your son after a man who literally hated you for 6 years and went out of his way to bully you just because he was a double agent and had a weird obsession with your mum. Bit stupid to me, which is why hes Albus Fredrick Potter in my head.

I mean seriously you are going to name your son after Snape after the death of Fred and Remus!

Having said that I love Snape as a character he is complex and interesting but I don't think there is much of an argument to calling him "good" after everything he did before the big revelation in DH.
