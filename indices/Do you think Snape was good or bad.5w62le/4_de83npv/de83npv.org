The dude couldn't get over an obsessive crush for almost 2 decades. He was a monstrous teacher and had no business being around children much less teaching them. He instantly hated the child of his crush because he looked like her husband. He probably knew that Sirius wasn't the secret keeper before the shrieking shack episode but still didn't do anything to help get an innocent man out of jail all while he, as a death eater went free. He was horribly abusive to children for no reason besides the fact that he was a petty douche.

At one point he actively supported the blood supremacy of the Pure Bloods, which is why he went to their side to begin with despite being a half blood. It wasn't until the woman he listed after was threatened due to his own actions that he switched sides. And even then he never said his beliefs had changed. He just didn't want her, and only her, not her child or husband, spared. When Voldemort killed her Snape l turned against him. He turned traitor out of spite and lived a miserable life as a result.

He was a horrible piece of shit who spent 6 years helping to create a child who would willingly commit suicide to kill Riddle. Snape despises me as a person. Almost as much as Dumbledore does.
