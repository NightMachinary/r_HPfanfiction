He is somewhere in the middle, but leaning more towards the good side.

I think he has strong principals and knows what's right and wrong. He never felt like he truly belonged anywhere; he joined the Death Eaters to belong somewhere. He switched mostly because of Lily, but I believe that deep down he had some reservations about Death Eaters soon after joining them, and Lily's life being endangered gave him a very strong reason to help fight against Voldemort.

On the other hand he was bullying younger students and held a childhood grudge. He was extremely bitter his entire adult life, and probably had mental problems. He is far from a guy who had a rough exterior with a golden heart.

Tl;dr He is a bitter prick with a good side.
