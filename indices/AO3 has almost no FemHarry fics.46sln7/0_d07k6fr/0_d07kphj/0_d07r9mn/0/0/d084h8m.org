Well, Deity Harry does not show up as a recognized tag, and super!Harry has only been used 8 times, so you can probably leave those out. Honestly, I'd probably just sort the Female Harry results by kudos or something and then go by summaries - powerful Harry is not something that would necessarily get tagged, it's just a given for a lot of people. I only got 21 results when I made that part of the search.
