A beta reader shouldn't be expected to read 'a very rough, unedited first draft'. Frankly, no one should. Finish the story - or at least the chapter. Edit it. Polish it to the best of your ability. when it's as good as you can make it yourself it's time to get another pair of eyes on it.

Beta-ing is sometimes tedious work, so it's a good idea to offer a reciprocal arrangement.
