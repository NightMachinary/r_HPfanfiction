Thanks for the info. I've never had anyone read my work so not sure how this normally works.

Maybe VERY rough was a bit overkill. I've polished the first half, which I suppose would constitute as a chapter. I didn't really set “chapters” per se, but a good stopping point.

Really I am looking for, does it flow well? Does it make sense? Am I missing some detail that would clarify something? And grammar, I'm quite terrible at punctuation. Commas all over the place...lol.
