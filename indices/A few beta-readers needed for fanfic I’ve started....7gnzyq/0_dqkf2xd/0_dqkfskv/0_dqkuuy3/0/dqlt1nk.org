Again, this is all new to me so thank you for the information. I am certainly not looking for someone to pat me on the back and inflate my ego. I genuinely want honest feedback. That is the only way we improve isn't it?

As far as the chapters go, well again I've never done this. While I have breaks in the story where I intend to transition into a new “chapter”, I am looking for feedback on whether those breaks are conclusive and make sense. They make sense to me but I am only one person.

And yes, it would probably be wise for me to brush up on my grammar. It isn't fair to have someone else do all the work for me.

Again, thanks.
