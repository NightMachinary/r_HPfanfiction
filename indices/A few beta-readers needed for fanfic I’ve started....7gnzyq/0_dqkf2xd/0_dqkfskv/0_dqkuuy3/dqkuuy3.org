You're going to have a very difficult time writing a story if you don't have it planned out enough to be able to differentiate between chapters.

Also twenty pages, assuming word processing with standard formatting, is around 10,000 words. The first Harry Potter book is 75,000 words. Do you think what you have is equal to fifteen percent of a book? But, as a whole, word count is typically more efficient of a judge of length than page count. Especially because some people seem to insist on typing in size twenty green font, double spaced, and in Arial.

Also, it's impossible to actually 'beta' something in any meaningful way without knowing the plot and intention of the author. Without knowing what's supposed to be there, they can't tell you if it's there or not. For example, I think Severus Snape is a terrible human being. So if I'm reading it with no thought of what you want to do, I'm going to ask you questions like, "How do you justify the fact that he's intentionally failing a student by maliciously vanishing his classwork repeatedly and expect me to sympathize for him?"

Also if you say 'does it flow well?' and then admit to knowing there's comma issues, well, the chances are that it does not flow well. It's not a beta's job to teach you grammar. That's your job. There's plenty of free resources available (Strunk and White's The Elements of Style is slightly dated, but available for free and in PDF form on the internet).

If you want someone to read it and go "OMG THIS IS AWESOME" then well, not it. If you want someone to read it, dissect it, and put as much red on the page as you do black, I'll give it a shot.
