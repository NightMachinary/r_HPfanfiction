I think quidditch is shit without even addressing the snitch problem. A half decent chaser should be able to just fly to the other side and score at will. Its impossible to defend three hoops with just one person (the hoops are pretty far apart according to the movies), bludgers are easily dodgable (Harry had one cursed on him and caught the snitch anyway, and hitting a moving target is way harder than dodging) and iirc chasers cant really manhandle the other team when they are on defense.

Now for some sports analogies to further reinforce how impossible defense would be.

Its like handball, except the keeper has to cover a way bigger area, is less mobile over a short timeframe, you have to defend an extra dimension, and defenders cant aggressively grab the other team. In handball, goals are already scored on like 40% of possessions, and defense is allowed to be extremely rough.

Basketball is closer in terms of how aggressive defenders can be, with the simple change that you are shooting at a comparably very small hoop and travelling exists, so you cant just hug the ball and stroll to the basket. Again, I would say about 40% of possessions result in scoring, nba average is a little over 1 point per possession.

I think the magical sport of choice should obviously be dueling or team battles. The latter gives you everything that you could possibly want from quidditch as a plot point: one man army is very much a real concept, you can make first years useful by limiting what spells can be cast (perhaps have different roles, like in quidditch, with different limitations), team spirit, and it can have huge variety.

While I am here I would also like to complain about how shit chess is in ff, or fiction in general. Anyone that is half decent at it wont get "lured in a trap" without realizing they are in a bad spot and then checkmated two moves later. Half decent here is a very low bar, I would consider everyone I have ever played with at least half decent.
