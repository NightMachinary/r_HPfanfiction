Good points. I mentioned in another comment how overpowered offense is in Quidditch. I know it's not a perfect example considering it was the finals, but the Quidditch World Cup had Ireland score like 18 goals while Bulgaria had 1 and apparently it ended very quickly for a finals. If even pro Keepers can't stop the Chasers from scoring virtually at will then no one else has a chance. it's like the opposite of football, where scoring is rather rare by comparison. That there is three friggin hoops would make keeping suck enormous ass.

Magical capture-the-flag could be fun to read or watch. The Switching Spell would be incredibly OP in it though, heh. Actually, that spell should be incredibly useful in general...

Honestly, I'm not great at chess myself but fiction does make it really dumb most of the time. The "traps" are obvious in those cases as long as you know how the pieces move. ðŸ˜‘
