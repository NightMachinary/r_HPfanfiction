Yes, I guess that is a point against my theory. Still, that could be explained away in two ways, though it would still sound a bit handwave-y. First one would be, Krum's catch didn't actually made sense as they still lost so the gamblers might have assumed if the score got to that point, the Irish would also catch the snitch because Krum would hesitate. Or they might have assumed Krum is far too good to allow the Irish to get such a lead, that he would have ended the game by that point.

But yeah, I concede this point to you.
