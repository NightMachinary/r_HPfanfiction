Eh, I think most of this doesn't really apply at the school level. CoS shows that just having better brooms is enough to give you a much better chance to win, and the school cannot really seem to afford to match that for all the teams. Similarly, the games are much shorter at that age and so the Snitch won all games mentioned besides one in OoTP (that's not to say it was needed to win, but it nearly guarantees it).
