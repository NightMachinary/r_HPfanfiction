Well, yeah but that's school so who cares, really? I like to look at it from a broader perspective. İn soccer --- or as normal people like to call it: football --- , the youth matches tend to average high scores, likes of which are rarely seen in professional leagues. But they still use goalkeepers.

The way I see it, the Hogwarts games are an imitation of the sport, showcasing the general rules and excitement without getting into intricacies. İt would make sense if the school put extra rules to increase immersion into the game and to keep the games safe, entertaining and fair but --- again --- who cares?
