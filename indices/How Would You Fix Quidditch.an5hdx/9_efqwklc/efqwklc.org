Nothing.

People often forget that Quidditch games, outside of Hogwarts, lasted loooooong. They have rules for when a game lasts longer than a day so you can reasonably assume that kind of thing happens in regular intervals. That means the scores probably reach high enough that the snitch, while still important, isn't actually enough to win a game by itself. Krum, the world's greatest seeker, lost the world cup due to such circumstances.

And about changing the bludgers, there are no rules against healing a player who is injured in the field. I'd wager if there was an injury --- let's say a broken arm --- a nurse or a healer would cast the bone knitting charm, and if Poppy Pomfrey's words to Harry in CoS can be taken at face value (duh!), means healing a broken bone wouldn't take more than half an hour, if that long. Honestly, that actually would make the game all the more fun, one team having to give hundred and ten percent while the other bombard the opposition to reap the rewards. To further compound this, we have the Irish seeker who returns to the field after plowing to the ground at high speeds, twice.

With brooms, I'd say take a look at the sports teams around the world. Even lower league teams can usually buy the best stuff.

Now that I've channeled my inner-Ron, it is time to get serious.

I can't believe you would waste your time with such ridiculous things when you could be out there, gathering signatures for this new House-Elf Protection Act!
