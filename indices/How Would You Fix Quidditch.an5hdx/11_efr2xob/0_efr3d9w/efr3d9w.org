Should also be mentioned that wizards are a lot more durable than Muggles. The Irish seeker guy flew straight into the ground on a Firebolt without slowing down.. twice. And he wasn't a broken mess on the ground, I think GoF just said he had a concussion or something. Not to mention Bludgers are balls of iron that try to knock them out the sky. Wizards are crazy, lol
