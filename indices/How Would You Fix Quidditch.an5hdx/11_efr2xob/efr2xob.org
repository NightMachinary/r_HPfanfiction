The variable length and dangerous bludgers are an important part of the feel. The wizarding world isn't nearly so risk averse or safety conscious as muggles, after all most injuries can be fixed easily, it's really only curses, magical poisons and magical diseases that can cause a witch or wizard lasting harm.\\
Many characters seem to love the chance of a really good game going on for days and it's the sort of thing that really fits the weird wizarding world.

I'd probably just make the snitch give less points, no more than 50 or so, still enough to swing a close game, but not so much that it routinely matters more than the goals.
