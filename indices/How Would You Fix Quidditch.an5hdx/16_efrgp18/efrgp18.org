Unlike just about everybody else I would change nothing about the rules as shown in the books. Instead I'd change the telling of the games to show more clearly what those rules actually mean - make the games in the books last considerably longer and show what that actually means to the players and the spectators. No substitutes, no breaks, enormous pressure to get injured players patched up and back in the game, exhaustion, the spectators wandering in and out of the stands while doing other things as the game drags on. I'll have at least one re-told anecdote of a seeker dying during a match and the game going on because that is not a sufficient condition to end it.
