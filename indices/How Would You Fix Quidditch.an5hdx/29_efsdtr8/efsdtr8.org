Snitch worth 33 or 55 points

and maybe give the different loops a different worth, like the middle loop is worth more, because it would normally the best-guarded one, but it would the casers a bit tactic in their play, go for the more easy shot on the sides or full on past the keeper.

Give it more of a handball feeling, with times out but keep the penalty shots, include more back-up players, like you could switch a beater for another chaser for a few minutes if you want to.

And like handball just play faster with more goals on a professional level around one goal per minute is reasonable
