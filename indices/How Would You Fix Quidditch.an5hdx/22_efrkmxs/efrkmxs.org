  the potential for disparity in team brooms
#+end_quote

I don't think brooms can make for more disparity than having players of vastly differing skill can, like in football. Imagine the likes of Real Madrid/Juventus/PSG/Manchester City playing some Chinese League teams in a tournament.

I don't think there is anything problematic with canon-Quidditch at all, including things like the snitch being the equivalent of 15 goals - in high scoring matches that go to hundreds of points (say a margin of 430-620), the snitch wouldn't matter at all. It can also balance out teams that have a strong chaser line-up with those who have a strong seeker.
