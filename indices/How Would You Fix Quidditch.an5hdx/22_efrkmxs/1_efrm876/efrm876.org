Of course they make a disparity, this is outright said and shown in CoS when Gryffindor played Slytherin. Otherwise the professional teams wouldn't bother buying a fleet of Firebolts.

That's, at best, applicable to the professional level though. As most fanfics take place in school, the Snitch is really all that matters. There's only one match, I think, where the winning team did not catch the Snitch (OoTP).
