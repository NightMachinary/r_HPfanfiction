  They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's way was clear.

  "SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!"

  Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.

  And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer --

  Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead --

  "Go! Go! Go!" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy -- Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him -- he was at Malfoy's ankles -- he was level --

  Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and --

  "YES!"

  He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers.

Since you mentioned the next book, Gryffindor were leading 80-20 against Slytherin when Harry catches the snitch. And yes, Slytherin were playing with N2001s.

No new players were introduced in either team, nobody got any new brooms.
