Um, no it isn't, they don't overcome it at all in that book, which is almost certainly why Harry had to be given a Firebolt in the very next book. Just checked, from CoS:

  He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, "Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero -"

  The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air.

In fact, there's no line in the entire chapter that says Gryffindor scores even a /single/ goal, and Harry says its because of Slytherin's better brooms. They only win because of the Snitch, showing that at school brooms matter incredibly much and the Snitch is too valuable. Harry ended the match quickly, which was the only reason Slytherin didn't win.
