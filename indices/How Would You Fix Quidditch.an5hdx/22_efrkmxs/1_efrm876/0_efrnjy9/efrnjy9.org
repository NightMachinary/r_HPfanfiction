  As most fanfics take place in school, the Snitch is really all that matters
#+end_quote

Most ff authors have no idea what they're doing when it comes to Quidditch. I've seen this scenario too many times to count, where the author writes a match between A and B, and has B's chasers /dominating/. After B wins, the author puts a final scoreline like 210-270 (after the snitch has been caught).

I mean...that's not a dominating performance by B's chasers at all.

  they make a disparity, this is outright said and shown in CoS when Gryffindor played Slytherin

And it's quite clearly shown that that disparity was quite easily overcome by Gryffindor's more talented players. In spite of having vastly inferior brooms (Harry's N2000 was the best by far on Team G, which is why they were so excited about it in Book 1), Slytherin were unable to take a lead of over 14/15 goals. In the book, Harry has to dodge the bludger for quite a long period of time, and had Fred try and shield him from the bludger for a considerable period of time.

Even with inferior brooms, and having a beater being pre-occupied (which is 50% more pressure from Slytherin), Slytherin still didn't score enough goals.
