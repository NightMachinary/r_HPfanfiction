I've don't remember having the chance to bring this up, but I agree with you.

​

People talk about the seeker being the only person that matters, but seem to forget about the other 12 people on the pitch.

​

Do people really thing that the beaters aren't aiming at the seekers, that the chasers aren't trying to get in their way, that it's just a wide open field with no obstacles?

​

Its like saying for baseball, all you need is the pitcher to throw a perfect game, why would any of the other players matter?
