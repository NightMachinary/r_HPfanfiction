Use the seeker as fourth chaser.

Focus more on the commentary when describing scenes. Use English Football commentary as an example and stick with simple terminology (pass, cross, block, tackle).

The game itself is fine, but seekers do jack shit for most of the match. Hence describing what the seeker is doing leads to boring scenes.
