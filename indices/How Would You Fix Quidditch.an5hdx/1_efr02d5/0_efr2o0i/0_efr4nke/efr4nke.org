Here is an example of a match I wrote with that in mind. Quidditch World Cup, Group Stage Lithuania vs Holstein in Holyhead, where the local stadion is made of platforms floating on the sea. The names are italic on FFN, but using Reddit's formatting to replicate that would be a pain. Also, Lithuanian names are gendered and the female ones have different endings depending on marital status. Researching that took hours.

  "And here they come! Captain Lina Paulauskaité once more leading Nojus Jonatis and Rasa Minkuté into the fray. Marko Oginskis and Rytas Ramius are watching their backs while Kalnietis and Gabija Rimsaité will play their parts. Their performance has been nothing short of astonishing so far and the critics have been shut up by the youngest team in this competition. All of them have received numerous offers from European top teams and as of Yesterday, Lina is our newest Harpy. Ladies and Gentlemen lets give her a thundering welcome!"

  The crowd went wild for several minutes, pushing the concealing magic to its limits. While there were spectators from all over the world present, the majority were still Holyhead fans and more than happy about the latest addition to their team.

  "And our German guests, with keeper Franz Möller leading them out over the waves. Möller played a superb season with QV Königsberg, making it into the European Semifinals and conceding only seven goals on average throughout sixty-one games. Mark Petersen and Fritz Jensen form his last line of defence while Claudia Schmidt, Marlene Thomsen and Simon Andersen are Holstein's backbone. And finally recovered from her shattered leg, Petra Hansen. Her quick catch against Japan and wonderful interferences during the Venice match made it pretty clear that she is back to her old self."

  "Today's referee, Carlos de la Cruz, just completed his final examination of the balls and the game is about to begin. There's the Golden Snitch, followed by the Bludgers. The Quaffle goes up and they are away."

  "There's a furball and possession changes back and forth. Jonatis gets away and he is alone against Möller and Möller shows why he's one of Europe's best with his aggressive defending. Jonatis lost the Quaffle but gets a Bludger instead. Meanwhile, Thomsen and Schmidt are already in the Lithuanian half. Oginskis chooses to slam one of the iron balls at Hansen for some reason, misses and Holstein gets an easy two on one goal. Zero ten and Paulauskaité tries to get some control back."

  "Now Lithuania is making the game wide with Minkuté flying above the guest stands while her teammates spread out but the German team is not impressed and they form a tight defence around their goals, letting them make the long crosses. Passed to Paulauskaité, then to Jonatis who crosses to Minkuté. Thomsen tries comes out to intercept - And that's a foul. Looks like Thomsen hit Minkuté's shoulder with her foot and Lithuania gets a penalty. Already taken and Jonatis fails to get around Möller, Schmidt catches the rebound but Paulauskaité takes the Quaffle from him and scores. Ten both."

  "Now Andersen makes a dash for it, gets nailed by Oginskis and Jonatis shoots only to be denied once more by Möller. If this will go on the boy will end up with nightmares about Holstein's captain. Thomsen with the counter, gets around Minkuté, only Kalnietis remaining, who takes an aggressive stance and gets outplayed by a pass to Schmidt, who scores. Ten to Twenty and now Lithuania back in possession."

  "Paulauskaité takes matters into her own hands now and charges down the field. Dodges a Bludger and goes around Schmidt and it's just her and the Keeper. Come on Lina, she shoots, no wait, that was a faint, Möller dived right and Paulauskaité leisurely throws it through the middle hoop. Twenty both!"

  The match fell into a pattern at this point. The Baltic team breached Holstein's defences with relative ease but their keeper kept them in the game with countless saves which would have made Oliver Wood green with envy. Holstein's offence, on the other hand, was based on quick counters which were not as frequent as Lithuania's attempts but more successful.

  Two hours and fifty-eight goals later exhaustion became the biggest issue as mistakes became more common. The breakneck speed from the opening hour had faded away and was replaced by a more controlled pace but the game was far from boring. Harry was amazed at how well the Seekers were helping their Chasers by being decoys and drawing Bludgers away from their team or playing chicken with their opponents. The Gryffindor saw over a dozen plays which he wanted to try in the upcoming season.

  "And now Holstein with Thomsen coming in from the right, crosses to - IS THAT THE SNITCH? Hansen in a corkscrew dive, Rimsaité is on the other side of the pitch and does not look like she knows what Hansen saw. Holstein's seeker now with an outstretched arm and she - OWWW, that had to hurt. Hansen goes for a swim as Ramius slammed a Bludger at her and hit her square in the back. The referee is flying over to fish her out of the water and it looks like the Snitch disappeared again. Holsteins coach is signalling for a timeout to get his seeker a new broom - AND IT IS OVER. RIMSAITÉ ENDED THE GAME WHEN NO ONE WAS WATCHING HER. LITHUANIA WINS 420 TO 310. What a finish to a spectacular game. I think you all here spent your Galleons wisely when you bought yourself a ticket because that was a game we will be talking about for a long time. Truly a performance worthy of the knockout stage, which will return to Holyhead on the fourteenth - "
