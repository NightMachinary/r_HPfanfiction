Reduce the pint value of the snitch to 100 points instead of 150. Change nothing else, this still allows for the seeker position to be what JK wanted, but it also makes it more possible for the game to be won by the chasers instead of having thier contributions be all but irrelevant except for when the game is a total steamroll anyway.

I believe it would make the teamwork aspect if Quidditch more integral to the game, as the snitch is less of a trump card than it used to be. An argument could be made that needing a greater than 10 goal lead in order to beat the snitch is still too much, in which case I'd say reduce the snitch value to 50, and change the seeker slightly so that they can either essentially act as a fourth chaser when not hunting the snitch, or make it so that they can enter the keeper area to help defend the goals. Although the second ootion is (in my opinion) much less sensible compared to the first, as it would be very easy to have the seeker and keeper each float in the gaps between the hoops to be able to completely stonewall the opposing offense with a rapid response regardless of which goal hoop they send the quaffel at.
