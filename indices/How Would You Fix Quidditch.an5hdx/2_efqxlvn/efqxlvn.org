- Catching the Snitch ends the game, but scores no points or just minor points (1-2 quaffle goals)

- time limit is 3 hours

That's it.

Edit: * maybe consider addition of high point scoring for fancy throws like in basketball.

Edit 2: Just to elaborate on the snitch. I hate that there's very little to no tactical component to the snitch. Catching the snitch is almost always a good thing. If on the other hand the snitch scores no, or almost no, points it will be a regular occurrence that the team that's behind has to have a seeker that is a good at running interference, preventing the other seeker from catching the snitch, instead of just good at catching.
