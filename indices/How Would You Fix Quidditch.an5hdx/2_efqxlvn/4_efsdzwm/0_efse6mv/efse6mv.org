  Long, unpredictable matches are some of the best parts of tennis

I agree, but in tennis this happens because the players are constantly neck and neck. In Quidditch it is possible (and even likely the longer the match goes on) that one team has no more hopes of winning. Maybe the time limit should only be invoked if one team leads by a margin of >100 points.
