#1: To me, catching the snitch is about the equivalent of watching two teams play basketball while their coaches play chess, and the team that wins the chess match wins 95% of the time. So, I'd figure out a way to change that. I'm not sure if it just needs to be worth less or what? Maybe catching the snitch is worth 50 points and if it's caught quickly enough another snitch comes out, also worth 50 points?

#2: Really, I might actually just get rid of the snitch.

#3: Time limit

#4: Multiple referees. How many Slytherin cheap shots were not called?

#5: This isn't a quidditch problem but it also seemed like the broom was more important than the flyer. It would seem the equipment should be standardized.

#1/2 is really the biggest one.
