I'd make it a legal move to smack each other with the beater's bats. Everyone gets bats and lots of padding. Okay but being serious I think that scoring with the quaffle should be more points, and catching the snitch less - like quaffle 20/30 points and the snitch 50 points. That way both skills are recognised without making one super overpowered.
