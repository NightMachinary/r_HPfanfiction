Harry /plays/ quidditch because Rowling wasn't very sporty herself in school, and let Harry have that bit of happiness and genuine popularity.

Quidditch is nonsensical because of /one/ dude in particular. The following is a fancy Rowling quote from somewhere.

"[Quidditch] was invented in a small hotel in Manchester after a row with my then boyfriend," she has written alongside the text. "I had been pondering the things that hold a society together, cause it to congregate and signify its particular character and knew I needed a sport... It infuriates men...which is quite satisfying given my state of mind when I invented it."
