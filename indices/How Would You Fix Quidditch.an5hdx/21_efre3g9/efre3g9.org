- Scoring with the Quaffle is 1 point
- Catching the Snitch is 3 points
- In single-legged cup matches (when tiebreakers are necessary), the team which caught the Snitch wins in the case of a tie.
- Make the Snitch significantly easier to catch. It should be a competition between two seekers, not between the seeker and a ball. It could even get easier over time in order to avoid very short games but discourage excessively long ones.

I would only bother in fics which focus on Quidditch, otherwise obvious changes from canon generally detract from the story.
