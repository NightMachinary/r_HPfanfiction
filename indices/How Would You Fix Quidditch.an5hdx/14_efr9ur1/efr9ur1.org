I'd emphasize that Hogwarts Quiddich is low-quality play, and that the rules make much more sense on the professional level.

Professional teams take more shots, because they're able to speed up each possession - sharper passing, faster flying, lots of small edges adding up - and so 150 points for the Snitch means less because the Chasers are putting up more points.
