It's a fair point, though since the overwhelmingly majority of stories that have Quidditch do so at school ages I think having tamer rules makes sense.

But now that I think about it... The fact that Chasers are scoring a lot more probably means that offense is overpowered in Quidditch. Like in football, actual scores tend to be pretty low. But if the Quidditch World Cup is on the upper end of scoring, that suggests even average teams are scoring quite a bit. Maybe the number of hoops should be 2 instead of 3.
