Catching the snitch earns one point.

That way, if the scores are tied, catching it still wins the game. But if the seeker's team is behind, their role changes from catching the snitch to defending it from the opposition's seeker, in order to give their chasers time to score and overtake.

In dramatic terms, this would have still worked. Harry could still be the match-winning hero when needed, Krum could have still ended the World Cup match "on his terms" and so on,
