- Make the snitch be worth fewer points.

- Make the snitch more likely to spawn for the team currently in the lead. It gives the rest of the team more importance as they have an actual motivation to score points, and it makes catching the snitch, if your team is losing, even more impressive.

That being said, I actually like how Quidditch isn't 100% logical ... like so many other things in the wizarding world. I don't know why but I just feel that it suits the general quirkiness of magical society.
