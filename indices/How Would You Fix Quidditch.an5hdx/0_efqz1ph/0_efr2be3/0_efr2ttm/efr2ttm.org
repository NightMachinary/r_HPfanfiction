yeah, I'm saying i would change that, so they won't even veer towards the nearest player, it has to be accurately hit at the player or even in the right direction to intercept. there can be mind games with using the bludger to force a player to change direction, players not juking, trying to outrun a bludger to pass it rather than be hit by it on the same trajectory. stuff that wouldn't happen when you know that the blunger will start chasing them if you just send it in close to them.
