I'd change the Snitch value to something like 55 or 75, A so the Seeker's job is less all in on catching the snitch, but a team with a good seeker can rely on him to end the game when they need to but can also use them in a offensive formation. Also I really don't like Ties, so by relying on the snitch to end the game ensures that there is no tie.

Bludgers don't target people like red shells in Mario Kart, but instead fly in straight lines, Reversing off of the limits of the playing area. Also if hit hard enough by any player they will change direction so if you want to risk the damage to your arm/hand/foot/broom you can send the bludger off.

I'd like to see penalty boxes like Hockey and Lacrosse where a penalty doesn't automatically mean a penalty shot but causes a man up/down situation.
