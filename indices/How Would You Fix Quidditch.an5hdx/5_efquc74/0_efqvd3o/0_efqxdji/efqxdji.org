In my opinion, bludgers also inject an element of danger that is integral to the canon's worldbuilding. I think that Muggle society advanced culturally largely as a result of the development of new technologies created to solve problems that are nonexistent in a world governed by magic. Because the wizarding world didn't need to innovate and progress in the same way, I think wizard culture is largely still stuck in the middle ages when the idea of safety regulations was unheard of. Plus, magic allows you to deal with injury much better than Muggle medicine so a few broken bones is much less of a big deal.
