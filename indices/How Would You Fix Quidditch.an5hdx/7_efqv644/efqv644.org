I try to balance the need to "fix" it with a desire to do the least violence to the feel of JKR's world. So I don't do a complete revamp. In VP the change I made was to say that catching the snitch ends the game, but comes with no points. It makes the role of the seeker more strategic than a game-winner on its own, keeps the whimsy in the fact that the game is of an unpredictable length, and nicely results in each position having a single distinct function.
