I like "the snitch scales up in value the longer the game runs," with a lower starting value, as well as the idea of the Seeker being able to act as an extra Chaser as needed.

IMO the timer is a kinda lazy/bandaid fix that doesn't fit the intent of the game, Quidditch games are supposed to be structured like fantasy cricket and should be able to last for several days.
