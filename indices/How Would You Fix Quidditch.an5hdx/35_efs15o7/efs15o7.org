Anytime you have a thing that can only happen once a game you should use it to prevent any ties.

*Make the snitch worth 15 points. One goal and it wins ties.\\
*Disparity in equipment is a problem, but not like the schools fund that stuff most of the time. No reasonable solution, but it is surprising there isn't legacy student's funding for this.\\
*For school play, not necessarily pro level, put a fucking safety net or magical equivalent. The only reason no one died is JK didn't want one to, there has to be a ton of deaths.\\
*Make the snitch easier and easier to spot over time. No time limit, but have it so the beaters have to play protection for the snitch against the enemy seeker if you're behind. I kinda like the quirky insane possibility for time. Also, so far as I can tell, time really isn't that big of a concern for wizards.\\
*Finally let the seeker be able to work as chaser. If this is the case, probably revise the snitch points back up to 35 or 45 so it is a harder decision. Actually maybe even 155, 33% more chaser is a hell of an advantage.
