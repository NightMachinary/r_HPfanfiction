Good stuff. Should note part of the reason no one seems to die (not often anyway) is because wizards are a lot more durable than Muggles. We see that Irish seeker in the world cup fly into the ground on a Firebolt without slowing down. Twice in fact. He only had like a concussion or something. Hell, Bludgers are balls of iron that are supposed to slam into players at high speed.

Granted, there should be some kind of spell to slow things down nearer the ground, though I guess that means the Snitch can't go too low otherwise no one can get it.
