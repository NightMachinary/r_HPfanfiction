As a avid sports fan here is what I would change

1) 2 One Hour Long Halfs but no penalty time after like in Soccer.

2) Snitches are worth 5 goals a piece or 50 points down from 15 goals

3) When a Snitch is caught their is a five minute break where the Seeker becomes a fourth Chaser or additional Keeper before the next Snitch is released.

4) Three Bludgers - Keeps everyone on their toes as their is one unattended Bludger flying around

5) Any player even Beaters can score with the Quaffle
