- The snitch is a pure point booster, worth about 50 points. It is released 3 separate times during the game.
- Seeker is not it's own dedicated role. Rather, each team has 4 chasers, with one designated as Seeker. When the snitch is released, that player may decide to go after the snitch, or support the other chasers.
- The game has a set time limit of 90 minutes.
