Legit just have more games. Standings depend on a combination of number of wins and overall point totals, but I think that seasons should be played more like hockey. At the Hogwarts level, I'd say a minimum of 3 games per month from October to April, each of the four teams getting one bye week of every four. For the pro league, why not have them play like 80 games a year? The snitch would still matter a lot during a game but a good chaser squad could significantly affect the standings across long periods of time.

I'd also probably cap the length of the game to avoid absurdity. Maybe to 7 hrs? Then the team with the most points scored wins, or they got to a sudden death shootout.

I'd also allow substitutions. A team should have a full backup team. However I think the seeker should only be allowed to switch once - once you're out, you're out, and if your replacement gets KO'd or something, then you forfeit.
