Quaffles don't seem very magical. They're the only thing that isn't completely absurd, so, I think, in the interest of fairness, they shouldn't have a shape. Snitches have charms, bludgers are cursed, herbology has the pitch, potions has the medics, but transfiguration isn't represented.

Clearly, the quaffle should either have no shape, or have multiple shapes simultaneously. This looks like an overlooked fact, James Potter was good at transfiguration and he no longer has a form, ergo he was good at quaffling. Sirius has multiple forms, therefore he, too, is good at manipulating things with multiple forms.

Remus gets an E for effort for trying not to be a werewolf. Thank you for coming to my presentation.
