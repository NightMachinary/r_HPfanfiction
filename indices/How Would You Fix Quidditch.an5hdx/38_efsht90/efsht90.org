Make a game be a best of three rounds. Each round lasts 40 minutes or until the snitch is caught. The snitch is worth 25 points instead of 150, and the team with the highest score wins the round. The seeker can (if they want) act sort of like a queen in chess, helping or disrupting chaser plays and so on. This still gives the seeker a lot of influence, but doesn't make it so they often can single-handedly determine the outcome of a match, and makes their role much more strategic.
