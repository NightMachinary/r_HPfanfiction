The main thing I would do would be to institute a time limit, because I think it is absurd that a Quidditch game does not end after a reasonable interval of time. Like say, the game is played in two halves of, I dunno, a maximum of 3 hours each. And if the Snitch has not been caught at the end of the second half, the game ends regardless, and the winner is whichever team has the highest score. If the score is tied, it goes into overtime(max 2 hours), which ends /automatically/ as soon as the score is no longer tied.
