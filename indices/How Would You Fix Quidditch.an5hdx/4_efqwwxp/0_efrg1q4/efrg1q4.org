Test Cricket goes for 5 or so days doesn't it? I'm sure the time limit can be one form of the game - maybe even write is as a fad among younger kids.

That said, overtime golden goal as a rule is flawed. Especially considering that each time routinely averages >10 goals/hr (based on a rough estimate of the Quidditch world cup). A shorter time period or a penalty shootout is probably preferable.

Last, overtime is strictly for knockout tournaments. Outside of the world cup, league play will allow ties and will use point differential/snitch catches/etc to break ties. Note that the Hogwards Quidditch League used points differential (that's why Gryffindor needed to win by 200 points).
