I've presented this before, in case some find it familiar

  And in sports today...

  Chairman Hassan Mostafa wrapped up the third day of pre-season hearings by the International Association of Quidditch for consideration of rule changes in the Wizarding World's most popular sport.

  Much of the controversy in this year's hearings came from the office of the British Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, or rather from the spokeswitch of that Department, Hermione Weasley. Mrs. Weasley's exhaustive rule set and arithmantic proof of 'enhanced entertainment value' for her proposed Millenium Quidditch was reported to count at 1043 feet of scroll.

  Thankfully, in anticipation of the proposal's review, Mrs. Weasley has provided us a highlight of the most significant rule changes:

  - The three goal hoops are to vary in size and point value. The center hoop is to be made half as large, to be worth 20 points. The left hoop would be enlarged to twice size but worth only 5 points and the right hoop is left at standard size and point value.

  - The snitch is to be worth 42 points, making a tie game impossible. It isn't released onto the pitch until ten minutes after quaffle play has commenced. A Protean charm on the snitch closes the hoops of both teams the moment the snitch considers itself caught.

  - Brooms are to be shared- that is, everyone brings a broom for the pile, but the team captains pick from those brooms available to equip their players; by doing so, there would be little chance of disparity in the performance of the equipment. Choosing starts with a coin toss, and the captains will be challenged to stay familiar with the capabilities of all official brooms.

  Chairman Mostafa today declared that the proposal will require serious consideration, but that Mrs. Weasley's lack of brevity has consigned any decision on its merits to be delayed until next year's pre-season hearing.

  Mr. Ragmar Dorkins' proposal to change the value of the snitch to 250 points has once again been heard and denied. Mr. Dorkins, as many readers know, is the Manager for the Chudley Cannons. His analysis that such a change would result in the Cannons being more competitive was met with some sympathy. He was given a plate of cannoli.
