I've never heard Lightning Era before, but that sounds like it could refer to the time of the books, named after Harry's scar. Other than that, there's Marauder Era of course, plus Next Gen (Harry & Co's kids), and Founder's Era (Hogwarts founders). If there's anymore named era's than that, I don't know them.
