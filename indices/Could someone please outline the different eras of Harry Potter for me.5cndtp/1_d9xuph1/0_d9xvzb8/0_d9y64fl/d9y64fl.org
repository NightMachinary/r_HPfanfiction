There's also the *Riddle Era*, which is when Tom Riddle went to school, and the *Transformation Era* when he travelled the world and transformed himself into Voldemort.

Another rarely seen one is the *Merlin Era*, which according to canon falls after the *Founders Era*, but most people tend to write it as before so that they can use Merlin as a mentor to the Founders.

I'll edit this and add more if I can think of any.
