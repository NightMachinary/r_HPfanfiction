There are two I can think of where the "cast" is mostly in character. "It could only happen to Harry" and "The Power of Seven". Both are centered around the need for some ritualistic sex in order for Harry to survive. The first has more sex, the second one a little more character development. Due to Rule 5, no link for the second one, although it does not sexualise the age of anyone. It happens to have underage characters, but it does not have those cringe-worthy "her blooming chest" phrases or similar creepy shit.
