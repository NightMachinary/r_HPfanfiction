So! I just finished reading a beautiful fic that fits what you're looking for: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] It's honestly professional quality level of writing and world building. All the new characters are so well rounded and developed it's bonkers. This fic is also the /only/ story where the parents react the way any normal muggle would react to finding our magic exists: weekly Diagon Alley trips regardless or not their child is with them or at Hogwarts. It's set in the 1930s and 40s and all the dialogue and narration is historically correct üòçüòç
