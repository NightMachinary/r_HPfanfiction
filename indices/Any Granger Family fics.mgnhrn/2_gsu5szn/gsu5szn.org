I am actually looking for a fic that fits your description and maybe someone knows about it? I read it some time ago. Harry went back in time and had a fake adult illusion to be able to move around in the world. At some point he owned a small island and the grangers were heavily involved in rune development. Eventually they had a van that was turned into a submarine as they wanted to keep the island hidden so couldn't aparate to it. Don't think the fic was complete when I read it and I have no clue what happened with it...
