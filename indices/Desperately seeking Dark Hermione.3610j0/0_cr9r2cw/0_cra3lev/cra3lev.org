I really loved the pureblooded, victorian style upbringing she got in that story. 'A lady glides', I felt myself identifying with Lily as she was jealous of how cultured Hermione was without even paying attention to it. It was also nice to see a story portray pureblood culture like that without coupling it with bigotry.
