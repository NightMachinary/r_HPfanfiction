Not to mention how delicious Lucius was. When he wore jeans that one time... whoa. And the changed dynamic with Snape was really refreshing as well. We got to divulge into Lily's life more which was nice, as well as getting a front row glance into pureblood society. Hermione was super smart, super talented, and super pretty but I was never left feeling like I was reading a Mary Sue. Probably because there is a logical explanation for her natural skill. Character dynamics where also realistic and engaging. Only negative comment I would make would be about the slightly lack luster climax. I believe it was done intentionally though, and not without humor, so forgiven.
