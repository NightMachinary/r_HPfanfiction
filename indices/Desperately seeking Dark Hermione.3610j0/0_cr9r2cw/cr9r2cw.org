This Hermione is not dark dark... she is fighting for the 'right' side. She does, however, have Slytherin traits (many-- the girl is sneaky/talented/cunning). It is super AU, takes place in the Marauders era, she is shipped with Sirius but its not that 'serious' a plot point till they are older. The story begins when she is 11 and covers her years at Hogwarts. I don't want to give anything big away but you should really check it out. One of my favs. Excellent world/culture building. Take the chance.
