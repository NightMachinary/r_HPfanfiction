[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] - Very dark story but she fights for the light.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4546325/1/The-Contract][The Contract]] - Hermione gets married to Tom Riddle by Fudge's idiocracy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027125/1/The-Green-Girl][Green Girl]] - Hermione sorted into Slytherin. I think this might be the closest to what you're asking for, although it does have romance as a strong motivation.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418411/1/Life-of-a-Pureblood][Life of a pureblood]] - Pureblood Hermione is sorted into Slytherin. currently year 1-3 is complete and year 4 was updated just today. Check author's page for other years. She's straight up evil in here, so perhaps not to your liking but I find it amusing so I put it in here.

Edit: I just read the last paragraph of your post, and I think the first one might not be to your liking, because of torture/rape, and her not actually turning to the dark side. I'm leaving it in here for others that might be interested though.
