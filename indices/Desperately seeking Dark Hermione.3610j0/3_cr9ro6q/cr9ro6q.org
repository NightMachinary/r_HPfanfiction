I can give you a story, but I have to stop short of recommending it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5010568/1/In-Too-Deep][In Too Deep]]: Hermione is the Dark Lords' most prized death eater. But when he sends her on a mission to befriend Harry Potter, her sworn enemy, things don't go quite as planned. When she took the mission she never anticipated falling in love with her target.
