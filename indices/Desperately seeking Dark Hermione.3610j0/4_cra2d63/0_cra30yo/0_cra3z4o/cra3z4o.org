Hehe. I've also re-read the story a few times, although I've been following the story for a few months now. If you're really desperate you might want to know that whenever a new chapter comes along, if will be posted [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/applied-cultural-anthropology-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cruciatus.256787/][here]] at least a few days before it appears on ff.net. Also, you can filter that thread for only the author's [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/search/40957210/?page=8][posts]] if you want to read stuff like reviewer replies, potential spoilers and the author's general take on fanfiction and the hpverse.
