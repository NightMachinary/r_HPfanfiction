Ah, I was afraid of that :(

That's the horrible thing about finding the perfect story, nothing else will ever measure up. I've already re-read it 3 times waiting for the next update, so I'm kinda just hoping for something similar to tide me over in the meantime before my obsession turns into full-blown hysteria. I'll give Reign of the Serpent a go, thanks.

Thank you for the recommendation, I did check out the author hoping for some similar stories. Unfortunately I have no love for fanfiction apart from HP, and no knowledge of Naruto whatsoever, which might make it a little awkward to read.
