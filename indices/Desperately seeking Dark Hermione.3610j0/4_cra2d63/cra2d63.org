I'm afraid you've found the top of the mountain, from here on all roads will lead you down again.

I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]], alas it's on-going and far from complete. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

Also, if you're into Naruto fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2675402/jacobk][Jacobk]] also writes an amazing Sakura who would probably fit your taste.

There is also a very good crossover where Hermione gets reincarnated as Sakura: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/2/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundus]]

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.
