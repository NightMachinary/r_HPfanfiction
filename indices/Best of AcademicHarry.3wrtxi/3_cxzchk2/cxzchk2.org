Have you seen linkffn(the arithmancer)? It's not harry, but if you're looking for "protagonist studies to untold heights of magical knowledge" then the arothmancer (and the sequel, lady Archimedes) are about as good as it gets.

Also, and I'm just reposting the list of unfinished fics that I posted in my request thread that you replied to, there are a whole batch of unfinished (but great!) fics in this mold, including linkffn(the ectomancer), linkffn(forging the sword), linkffn(forest of valbone).
