I asked something similar recently when I asked for good Harry in Ravenclaw fics. I really want to read stories where harry, while having lots of power, doesn't have a clue how to use it and only learns to use it by studying and more generally is genuinely and deeply loves magic for it's own sake and not just to "WIN THE WAR RARGH". In fact, it might be fun to just remove that whole evil threat factor from the story all together and concentrate on the wonder of magic and friendship, mysteries and stuff.
