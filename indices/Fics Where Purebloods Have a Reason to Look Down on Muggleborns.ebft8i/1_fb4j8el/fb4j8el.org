Oh crap. I know of one but forgot the name of it.

Harry lives past the war, then gets assassinated. He meets Dobby at the all white 9 3/4s, and gets sent to a world where Harry Potter died, but he ends up in the past and is 10 again. Ends up freeing Sirius by impersonating his son (who doesn't exist), and getting him a trial. Gets blood adopted by Sirius and a bit of DNA from his now dead fiancee.

After all that, he's told that Muggleborns Magic is considered "Wild" and won't have talents. Harry ends up having a talent as an Assessor, also ends up in Slytherin.

Strange fic that's still getting sporadic updates. Annnd I still can't remember the name of it. Hoping this will get recognized by someone.
