In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] Pureblood families have hereditary magical traits and family rituals related to comuning with their magical ancestors on certain days. The latter books in the series (four and five) go deeper into that aspect of worldbuilding. The first book is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]. linkao3(12608820)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] has some of the most unique (and strange) worldbuilding I've seen in this fandom. In that fic Purebloods have a method of directly absorbing knowledge from old tomes without having to actually read them. 'Dark Magic' is powerful instinctual magic that can only be done by thinking in a sort-of pre-enlightenment unscientific way. Such methods are still preserved by some Pureblood families but are derided by modern-minded wizards. linkffn(10629488)
