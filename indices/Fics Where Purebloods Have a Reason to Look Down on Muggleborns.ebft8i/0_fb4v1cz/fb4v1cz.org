Fics that come to mind are:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived): as espoused by Calypso, muggleborns seemingly rarely if ever develop extra-ordinary magical talents (it happens, but they are an exception and not the rule).
- linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): because of the noticeable imbalance of wizards to witches, purebloods (particularly witches as its a distinctly matriarchal society) have every desire to make sure muggleborn witches are less able to take away the few magical males from them. I'm not advocating it, but I do at least understand the logic from their point-of-view.

There are also plenty of fics that depict things like family magic, natural talents being related to specific lineage, and of course the real-world parallel of the idea that an invasive outside culture seeks to alter the wizarding world as it sees fit (this is something that appears to occur basically in every human society, just with a different target and degree). All of which are offered up as reasons for why muggleborns are discriminated against.
