I can't think of the fic's name, but it's mainly about how muggleborn charge into the world, don't learn anything about the culture and start tearing things apart. It goes on to show that the purebloods weren't that mad about James/Lily because she actually went and learned the history/traditions.

â€‹

Then, there's stories like Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!, linkffn(3695087) where it's all about family magic and muggleborns almost never bring anything magic related (spells/books/etc) into the marriage. At one point Hermione did her jinxed contract bit and impressed the hell out of Narcissa Malfoy and congratulated him for getting himself a "proper pureblood marriage". Sure, it's a parody/crack fic, but the family magics part is a pretty neat story mechanic and I'd like to see more fics with stuff like this involved.
