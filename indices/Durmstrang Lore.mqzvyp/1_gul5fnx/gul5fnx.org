I always imagined Durmstrang to be in Northern Norway or maybe in Lapland region of Finland based on what people describe of it in book 4. Word Durmstrang seem to come from Germanic Art Movement "Sturm und Drang" so I think Norway is more likely.

I think they would be speaking Norwegian or maybe German. As for Slavic members such as Victor Krum and Igor Karkaroff, It can be explained the same way why Hogwarts have Patil Twins.

I think Durmstrang is a private school designed for rich purebloods and recuits students from all over europe as long as they are able to pay their fees and are willing to attend. Being a private school, Durmstrang does not follow ICW approved material and teaches Dark Arts too. Basically it is a school designed to spawn likes of Lucius Malfoy. Maybe hey even have a class on pureblood supremacy or something.
