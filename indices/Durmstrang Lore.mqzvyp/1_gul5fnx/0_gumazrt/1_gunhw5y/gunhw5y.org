I am not a native. From what i know Pretty much all of Scandinavia was ruled by Denmark in early middle ages then Sweden broke out causing some wars and stuff. Linguistically Sweden and Danish is in the same branch while Norwegian, Faroese and Icelandic are on the same branch of North Germanic Languages although they are apparently still pretty similar except for Icelandic due to its long isolation. Finnish language spoken in Finland is an Uralic Language completely unrelated to rest of the languages except for the languages of nomadic Sami people in Northernmost parts of Scandinavia.
