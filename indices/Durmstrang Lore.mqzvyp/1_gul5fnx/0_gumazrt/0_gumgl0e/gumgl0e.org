Sweden, Denmark and Norway formed a personal union (common monarch) from 1397 to 1523. Denmark was the strongest kingdom, but the union collapsed after the Danish king executed much of the Swedish aristocracy. That caused a series of wars between Sweden and Denmark and hostile relations that lasted for around three centuries. Ever since there has been some bickering between the nations, because they both consider themselves the traditional great power of the Nordic. In the 19th century there was a short period when the reforming of the union was considered, but then the Danish got upset when Sweden did not help in a war against the unifying Germany.

Norway continued in a union with Denmark until 1814, but it was always the weaker, poorer and less important kingdom. Then it was annexed to Sweden, because Denmark had sided with Napol√©on while Sweden had not. The union of Sweden and Norway continued until 1905, when the Norwegians left the union peacefully. Norway was a poor country until the 1970s when the discovery of oil suddenly made it immensely rich.

Finland was a province of Sweden from the Middle Ages until 1809 when Russia conquered and annexed the country. Finland became independent in 1917 and industrialised and became wealthy rapidly after the Second World War. However, it remains the least prosperous of the Nordic countries. Finns traditionally consider Sweden as a "big brother," but there is a long-standing grudge caused by Sweden not officially siding with Finland against the Soviet Union during the Second World War.

As far as I know, Swedish and Norwegian are very close to one another, and Swedes and Norwegians can understand each other's speech. They undestand written Danish to some extent, but can't understand Danish speech. Finnish is not a language relative of any of them, and practically nobody in the other Nordic countries understands Finnish unless they have a Finnish background. Most Finns learn at least a little Swedish.

Then there is Iceland. Its population is very tiny, it has the closest ties to Denmark and its language is quite close to the archaic Nordic language spoken by the Vikings in the early Middle Ages.

The population of the Nordic countries together is about a third of the British population. I think that's quite a small base for a school. Durmstrang seems to have quite a lot of students from the Slavic countries, and that's why I think it's more likely that Durmstrang is in Russia. It probably has some history with Germanic nations, though.
