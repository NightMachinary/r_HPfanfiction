Durmstrang is confirmed by Rowling to be "somewhere in Scandinavia". Russian school is called Koldovstorezt (although its name means Magic Castle in Russian wich makes it seem to be made up in the last second so maybe you might be right).

Also name of Durmstrang comes from German art movement Sturm und Drang which means brew turmoil in German if i am not mistaken(Could be the motto of Durmstrang)
