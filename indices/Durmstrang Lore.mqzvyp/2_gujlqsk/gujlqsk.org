I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did teach in English. Egad, did we get around in our Imperialistic days. Even if you only include people who have it as a second language, there's still a shit-tonne of folks around.

It's not the route I'd go, though. If they're outside Scandinavia, I'd probably have them speak something German-ish and perhaps historical - maybe old Prussian?

If they're within Scandinavia, I'd put them in Finland. The Finns are appropriately hardcore that the idea amuses me greatly - they were the ones to invent molotov cocktails as an accompaniment to the aid-food-package bombs the Russians were dropping on them at the time, and that vibes considerably with the kind of 'ridiculous iron-man reality-show meets military boot-camp' vibe fanon seems to have given Durmstrang.
