In my story there is a subplot in one chapter in which the secret location of Durmstrang is investigated and eventually discovered:

#+begin_quote
  No outsider knew where Durmstrang was located. Even its students did not know; I knew this, because I had tried to learn the location from their minds with Legilimency during the months they had been sitting at the same table as I. There was probably some spell in place preventing them from learning their location.

  What was known was that the majority of Durmstrang students came from Slavic countries and that the institute was under the jurisdiction of wizarding Russia. However, that meant little, not only because Russia was vast, but because wizarding Russia had no clear geographical borders. In many parts of Northern and Eastern Europe magical population was so sparse that they had not bothered to form actual magical states. It was like a magical frontier, almost a lawless region, but if the people living there needed a political authority, they usually relied on the People's Commissariat for Magic in Moscow. Those few wizards who lived in the frontier usually had much closer ties to the Muggle societies around them than to other wizards, much to the disapproval of the International Confederation of Wizards.

  As far as any outsider knew, Durmstrang could be located anywhere in this vast frontier. However, a resourceful person capable of problem-solving could rule out much of this area just by considering certain facts.

  First, the institute's name was Germanic, suggesting that it had a long history with Germanic nations. Medieval German wizards would not have established their secret castle in Siberia or any other part of wizarding Russia that would have been impractically far from their sphere of influence.

  Second, Durmstrang students wore thick cloaks and furs, meaning their school was somewhere far in the north where they had to protect themselves from the arctic cold. But even the northern reaches of European Russia were enormous, so I had needed more hints. I had used Legilimency on the Durmstrang students and found a piece of information someone might have considered trivial: every winter in Durmstrang there were around three weeks when the sun did not rise above the horizon. That meant the institute had to be located somewhere north from the Arctic Circle. It was on top of a hill which meant it received more sunlight than the surrounding plains, so it had to be some distance further north from places where the polar night was three weeks long.

  This narrowed the possible location so much that finding Durmstrang should, in theory, be possible simply by flying north of the Arctic Circle and checking each hilltop.

Later, after weeks of fruitless searching the main character (sorry for the first person point-of-view) decides to visit a Muggle tourist centre and ask if anyone has seen Karkaroff (who he is after), because the Muggle world seems to be a good place to hide.

  "Hello," I said to a Muggle in a tourist centre. "I'm looking for someone... a foreigner... and I think he might've been seen somewhere around here."

  "What does he look like?" the Muggle asked.

  "He's an old man, he has a beard and the last time I saw him he wore a uniform, a red set of robes. And -- someone might call him a wizard."

  The Muggle stared at me as if I was out of my mind.

  "Everyone knows him!" he said. "You're speaking of Father Christmas!"

  /Oh no/, I thought, my hope deflating.

  "Father Christmas isn't usually seen this time of the year, but his workshop is not that far from here. It's a magical place hidden from the sight of ordinary people, but everyone knows it's located on top of Korvatunturi, a hill on the Russian border."

  /A magical place of an old bearded man wearing a red uniform... hidden from the sight of ordinary people... on top of a hill in the Arctic region.../ This was too fitting to be a mere coincidence. Many Muggle legends had origins in the wizarding world. Why could Father Christmas and his hidden workshop not be among them?

  ...

  Soon Korvatunturi (the Finnish name literally meant 'Ear Fell') loomed ahead of me. I was quite sure I had checked it on one of the early days of my trip, but of course good wards could make a place hidden even from those who were actively seeking it. This time I focused on landing on the hilltop, nothing else...

  ... and for some reason the hilltop always eluded me, but with such a subtle way that I had to do it many times to be sure.

For your information, according to modern Finnish folklore, Father Christmas does live on that particular hill, not the North Pole. Durmstrang's connection to this folklore snapped in place in my mind the moment I realised that in the Harry Potter books the Durmstrang uniform is red.
