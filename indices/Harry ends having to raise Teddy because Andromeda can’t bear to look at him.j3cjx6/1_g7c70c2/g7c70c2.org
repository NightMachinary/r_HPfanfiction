Since I am presumably responsible for this prompt [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j0fcaa/teddy_lupin/g6uoqo4/][based on this thread]], I would like to clarify that, at least in my opinion, Andromeda would not be unable to look at Teddy or unable to raise him, but would detest his last name and either outright adopt him and rename him Tonks or ask Harry for some shenanigans with the Black family name.
