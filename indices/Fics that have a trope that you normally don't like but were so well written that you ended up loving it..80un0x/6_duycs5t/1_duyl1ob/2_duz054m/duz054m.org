Do not be mean to my best friend Achille. :( Just because he really likes a story that you don't like does not mean you can be mean to him! :( Yes I do not like methods of rationality overall, but I do enjoy some parts of it like certain plots and characterizations like Quirrell, and how Harry and McGonagall interact, even if I didn't understand the science stuff and did not like Harry's characterization, BUT none of this stops us from being BEST FRIENDS!!! :( It's just a story! :(
