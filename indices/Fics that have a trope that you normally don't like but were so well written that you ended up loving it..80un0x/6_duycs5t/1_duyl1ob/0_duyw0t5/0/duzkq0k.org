There are a lot of people who find Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres just plain obnoxious, and unlikable as a result. Which can't really be helped. What /could/ be helped is the less defendable assumption that Harry being an obnoxious jerk translates to the /author/ being an obnoxious jerks --- a lot of people think the story is a (terrible) self-insert.

Then of course, there's the people who think the AUness is either offensive to canon, or an excuse for the author not doing the research because he's lazy. I... won't dignify /that/ with an answer.

And finally, there's the people who disagree with the philosophical arguments in the story (mostly the praise of rationality above all else, and the thorough anti-death stance), and just can't like the story because of it.

So there you have it. I don't /like/ that everybody hates it, but here's why. Go forth and be confused no longer.
