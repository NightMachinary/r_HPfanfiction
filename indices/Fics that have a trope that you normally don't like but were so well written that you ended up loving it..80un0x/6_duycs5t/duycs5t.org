linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) with non-permanent Transfiguration. Rather than just a misunderstanding of canon like it often is, the story makes it work as a central element of the AU, and it all ties very nicely into the rest of the lore (for instance, the Philosopher's Stone). The stories has flaws otherwise, but were I to hate it for something, it would /not/ be for the Transfiguration.

Also, obligatory linkffn(Core Threads) for magical cores.
