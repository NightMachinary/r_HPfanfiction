Linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs)

Personally I'd disagree and put my vote for the above. I really liked how the final battle plays out and Darth Marrs has generally good plot arcs along with something always over the top thrown in. Horcrux baby 2.0 anyone?

As well written as Amplititude it's abandoned before anything really happened.
