This has Lily Moon. linkffn(7796463) She's pretty normal, but the fic is centered around the Potters. Shame it was abandoned. It was one of the most original and funniest fics out there. Really, top notch work.

P.S. Well the bot doesn't seem to be cooperating so I'll just post the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7796463/1/AntiHyphen]]
