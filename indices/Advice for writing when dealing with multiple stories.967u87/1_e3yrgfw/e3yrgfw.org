When I was writing my super-long story, I would get ideas for sort of offshoot stories. Some of them were so captivating that I just had to write them immediately, so I did. I think in the year it took to finish the long one, I wrote 3 or 4 one shots and I think 1 multi chapter. I feel like doing this helped the main long one I was working on--I integrated some of the things I'd come up with in the one shots into the larger story.

Right now I'm working on a multi chapter and I'm pretty much sticking with that one. I've jotted down a couple of scenes for some new ones, but nothing has grabbed me by the throat and demanded I write it. Do whatever you feel like. You're not under any kind of publishing deadline or obligation. You haven't spent any advance money and no publisher is breathing down your neck. :D
