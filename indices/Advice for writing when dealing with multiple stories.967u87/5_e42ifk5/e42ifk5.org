I feel I write best with 3-5 stories in progress at once. One is too confining and I get frustrated and stop entirely. 6+ gets hard to keep track of.

Ideally, once I've got several stories ongoing any other ideas I may have get a scene/description so I can come back later, but sometimes something grabs my attention and I end up writing way more. In general I try to keep the number of active fics low. I'm getting close to finishing my first major fic after two years, struggling to update my second after one year, and making reasonable progress on three other smaller ones in between.

Ultimately, as long as I'm writing something each day I consider it a win; whether that's on my main project or a side-scene that doesn't go anywhere.
