I'll give you some rather unpopular advice: Don't feel obligated to write a specific story, just write whatever you feel like. Your work will suffer if you force yourself to sit down and focus on something you aren't 100% invested in.

I was in a similar situation, my primary story that I had been working on for a month I just couldn't focus on. I had other ideas I wanted to flesh out and my heart wasn't in it. I noticed whatever I wrote wasn't my best, so I gave in and moved to my other ideas. *My motivation and quality of work improved greatly.* My primary story isn't being worked on(sorry readers), but you know what that's ok. I was enjoying what I was doing, and I was making good progress on my other works.

I honestly think having a lot of 20k/30k works isn't a bad thing. This is after all not a job nor an obligation. As long as you are having fun and improving as a writer *why would you need to change*? Just do what you have been, focus on whatever you want. It's ok not to make progress on your primary story.
