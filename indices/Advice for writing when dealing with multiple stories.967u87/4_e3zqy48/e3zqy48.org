I have been dealing with this since I began writing THREE YEARS ago! I have been working on the same story for two years, but have done some drabbles and short stories here and there.

There is another story (really a trilogy) I've been wanting to write for about two years as well. I keep putting it off until I finish my current big one. However, it is very frustrating and I feel like it will never get written if I don't just start.

I have a few other, shorter stories that I would like to write as well, but have done how you have and hashed out the major plot points.

Advice: This is extremely frustrating. My advice is to let your imagination run wild! Make notes and partially write a hundred stories if you want. You may forget some important things and regret not taking detailed notes, so do NOT put it off. Work on whatever stories you want, but have the main story that gets most of your attention then you can move onto another. Or work on three major ones at a time. The more time you spend writing, the quicker you can get to another, but make sure to enjoy writing it. Just DO YOU. You feel like you need to work more on one? Work more on one. You want to write several? Write several.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
