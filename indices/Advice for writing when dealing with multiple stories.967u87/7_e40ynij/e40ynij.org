I'm writing about three or four stories right now, but it changes, it depends on my mood. Generally, I sort all my stories into their own folders: each story is separated into three docs. The first one is the actual story, the second one the story line, and the third one is a methodically written out explanation of every chapter, all the way to the end of the story. Then I keep to my plan. Usually works pretty well. Good luck!
