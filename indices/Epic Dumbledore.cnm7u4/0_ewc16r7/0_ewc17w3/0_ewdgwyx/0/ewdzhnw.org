It had all these amazing ideas and as usual was very well written but I think Harry instantly integrating Dumbledore's skills and personality doomed the story from the beginning. It was never going to have a satisfying climax as Harry became instantly OP.

I think if someone picked up this idea and made the integration slower or less consistent it could be a decent device for an improved 7th year.
