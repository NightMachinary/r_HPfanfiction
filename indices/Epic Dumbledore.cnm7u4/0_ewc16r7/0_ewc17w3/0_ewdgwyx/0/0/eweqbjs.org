The One He Feared was intended to be a story about two inter-related things:

1. Defeating Voldemort.

2. Harry finding himself through the fog of Dumbledore's life experiences.

If it were just an action story, then you'd be correct that an anti-climax was inevitable. But the climax to the story was always intended to be an emotional, character-based climax in which Harry found the balance between Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore.

The first four chapters are very much the "Dumbledore" arc, in which Harry completely relies on Dumbledore's knowledge and world view. This arc culminates in Harry losing a duel with Voldemort, sending him the message that /being Dumbledore is not enough/. Therefore, to defeat Voldemort, Harry needs not only Dumbledore's skills but must also re-discover those parts of Harry Potter which Dumbledore lacked.
