You are the foremost expert on the topic "What [[/u/Taure]] planned to write", and your plan for the fic sounds amazing. In my defense I would just say that as a reader I can only judge a fic by what's written and not what's planned. Also, you rock and your fics have brought me and thousands of other much joy.

Do you have a seminar on how to portray Dumbledore in a fanfic? Because I think it's badly needed by many many authors.
