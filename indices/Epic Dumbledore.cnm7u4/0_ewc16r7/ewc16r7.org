I mean technically linkffn(The One He Feared) is this, though with something of an twist to that though.

Additionally, the snippets of him in linkffn(What You Leave Behind) certainly fit his nonchalant badassness to a tee.

Would also say linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) though you have to make it to ~Chapter 11 for it to really get epic (can you say undead Basilisk anyone?).
