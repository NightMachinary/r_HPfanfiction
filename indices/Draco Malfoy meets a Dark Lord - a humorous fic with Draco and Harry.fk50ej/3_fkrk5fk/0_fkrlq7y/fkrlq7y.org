Thanks for commenting. Honestly - no idea. I treat this as a fun and enjoyable way of getting back into writing and I just improvise the whole thing without planning beforehand. For the next few weeks, I should update with new chapters practically daily, since I'm at home for obvious reasons. When normal university classes start again, the update rate will certainly get slower. So, anyway, back to your question - sorry, but I don't really know.
