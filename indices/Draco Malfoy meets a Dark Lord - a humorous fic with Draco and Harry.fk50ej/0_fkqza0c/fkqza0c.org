I love the premise you set up, so I gave your fic a read.

I liked the subtle foreshadowing that Draco would become a Gryffindor from the start. And it makes sense- he's pretty brave to decide to befriend someone he thinks is a Dark Lord.

The "some wizarding families think they are better than others" bit is hilarious. It makes sense though, Harry based so many of his decisions on initial impressions and since his initial impressions are so different... *shrugs*

The only thing I would change to make it better is to add some sort of monologue in the first chapter really talking about how Parseltongue is the mark of a Dark Lord. The jump from him speaking Parseltongue to him being a fearsome Dark Lord feels a bit choppy, and I think adding a bit more context would help. You could talk about how other Dark Lords like Herpo the Foul or whatever spoke Parseltongue, and then regale the audience with over-the-top tales of their villainy.

Overall I liked your fic, the idea is very original and I especially like your characterization of Lucius.
