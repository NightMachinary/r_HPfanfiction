Hey, thank you so much for giving it a read and for you detailed comment, I really appreciate it.

I'm happy that you enjoyed it, especially the characterization of Lucius, he's very fun to write in this way.

Thanks for your suggestion about the first chapter, I might rewrite it, since it was written a year ago (and was supposed to be a one-shot). Once more, thank you :)
