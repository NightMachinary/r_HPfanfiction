I just finished all four chapters, and have to say that I enjoy it so far. I really like the premise, and don't think I've seen something similar, at least for a while.

I'm at my work computer, and can log in to reddit, but not fanfiction, so I'll have to remember to give your story a follow later today.

Keep up the good work!
