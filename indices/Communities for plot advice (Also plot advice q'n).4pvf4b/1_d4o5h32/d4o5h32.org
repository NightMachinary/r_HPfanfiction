I actually like DLP, but you do have to have a bit of a thick skin. Most of them aren't mean, they are just honest, and they don't pull punches. But the advice they give is sound, and the criticism productive. Of course, it also depends on what you're writing. There are some tropes that are universally despised on that board lol.

I belong to a few other HP forums, but none of them are worthwhile for writing advice... Unfortunately. I hope someone else has some insight, because I've been looking as well. :-)
