The idea is enticing, the execution is not. DLP for all its faults will definitely help with the execution aspect. Post in Work by Author and you will get some constructive feedback.

This is the stage of a story/ficlet that is the most difficult - you could have Harry become a ghost of sorts and flesh this out only so much as to tell that story or Harry could decide to use his invisibility to do... or Harry could lose his ability to be invisible at will and...

The difficulty with fleshing out a story like this into a longer fic is believable interaction as Harry is nearly a magical creature/raised by wolves sort of character. Having him write or talk or make friends is a real stretch.

However if you keep it concise then the story needs to stand on its own which it cannot do as a series of headings followed by exposition with a nice few paragraphs to lead it.

You might consider what you want to write, outline it, edit your outline so that the plot points are sensible and then, using what you have and what you write, create a cohesive short story and flesh that out. This kind of idea is great for a shorter work, almost a parable. With that in mind, find what you want the moral to be and leave things more open ended. Let the audience draw the conclusions.

This could be a nice one shot story if you will decide what your parable/fable will be and fit the story to it and then edit, edit, edit. I look forward to reading it.
