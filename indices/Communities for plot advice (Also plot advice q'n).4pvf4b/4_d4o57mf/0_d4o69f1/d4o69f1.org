Just read it. I really like the concept. Several grammatical errors, some sentence structure issues... The first part from the Dursley's PoV is good, but the other sections seem like a lot of explanation and background information rather than part of the story, if that makes sense? Can't tell if that was intentional or not. I'd like to see where you go with it.
