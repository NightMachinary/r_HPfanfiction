Harry uses magic to defend Hermione, Ron defends Lavender from Harry.

The sound of spellfire attract the Gryffindor common room. Soon the Gryffindors have picked their sides. The battle escalates until the whole school is in a civil war.

Ravenclaw threw their weight behind The Queen of the Nerds and her King; The-Man-Who-Won-The-The-Battle-Of-The-Library. Hufflepuff directed their loyalty to the Queen of Gossip and Weasley-Is-our-King. Most of the Weasleys are Behind Ron, but rumor has it that The Twins provide better weaponry to team H&H. No one really knows who the slytherins are behind, with some being accused of playing both sides.
