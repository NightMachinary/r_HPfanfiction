"Not my boyfriend you /bitch/!" Lavender launched herself at Hermione, attacking her with all the jinxes and curses she knew.

Hermione, unaccustomed to any manner of retaliation, was taken off guard. Her teeth were lengthened again, her hair turned to snakes and biting her.

Harry quickly took action and undid all the transfigurations in the room. A look at Ron passed all the information on what he was about to do. Harry looked at Lavender, nodding his headz showing her understood why she did it.

Harry picked up Hermione and started taking her to hospital wing. He leaned in to say, "Hermione, just because Ron did something you didn't like doesn't give you the right to attack him. I won't report this to McGonagall, but look at how you're behaving this year and think to how many friends you'll have if you continue like that."
