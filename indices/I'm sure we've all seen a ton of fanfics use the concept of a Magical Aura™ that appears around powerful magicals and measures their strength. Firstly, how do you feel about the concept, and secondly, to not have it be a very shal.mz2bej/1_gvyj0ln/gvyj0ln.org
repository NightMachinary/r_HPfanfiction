I always have it either as a bit of a parlour trick that isn't at all hard, or a hereditary thing that is either like tongue curling kind of thing like super not a huge deal but genetic.

So in canon Hermione's hair sparks when she's angry, and I have carried that through as like, the Blacks have always claimed that's a Black trait (a la Bellatrix) and they sort of get away with it because they intermarry with so many lines, but then Hermione does it and Draco freaks out because she's muggleborn.

I'm not particularly strong with cellular biology but I always think of the spark hair or aura flex as something cellular, like your skin cells leak Magic? but who the fuck knows how that would work lmao
