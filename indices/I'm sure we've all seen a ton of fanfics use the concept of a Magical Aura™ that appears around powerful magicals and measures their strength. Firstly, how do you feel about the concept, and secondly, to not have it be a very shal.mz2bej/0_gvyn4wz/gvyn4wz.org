I think a variation of it seems fitting. Not something that literally measures their strength, though - but having extremely high concentration of magic /warp/ the air around them slightly, a more extreme version of the way magic fries electronics?

Well, I kinda like that - where it's a sign of power, not a measure of it.

It's used like that in linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), where the most powerful magic users (called mages there - people like Flamel, Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc) have that sort of aura if they don't reign in their magic. It can make them feel like strange, inhuman figures - and I think is fairly well done.

I think anything that puts a concrete number to scale it off of is not a particularly good system - it loses a lot of the charm in that, and often is just a lazy way to just say that character X is stronger than Y. But it can be used well in a descriptive manner
