What makes a magical person different from a nonmagical person is that their soul is capable of reaching out and claiming parts of the surrounding world, and altering those parts to the person's liking. The part of the world that's been claimed by a magical person's soul is that person's aura. Accidental and wandless magic are rapid alteration of the contents of an aura, but most alterations are much slower and subtler "passive" magic in order to save energy and avoid causing confusion. Hogwarts is so strange because centuries of students have all layered passive magic after passive magic on it.

The "proud to have a witch in the family" attitude Lily's parents had is the remnants of a genetic instinct from before there were wands or the Statute, when things just kept going better in the presence of magical people, and so nonmagical people in the same communities tended to be more successful. As a result, an instinct to be friendly with magical people in order to exploit passive magic was selected for. Because of recessive genes, Petunia didn't inherit this instinct, and was resentful of not being the favorite child.

Under this system, wands work mostly by resonating with the soul and directing it to claim far away things in a certain direction, at the expense of range in all other directions. When you point a wand at a matchstick, you're telling your soul that it should prioritize including the matchstick in your aura over including, for example, the air behind your back. But also your wand helps your soul understand your words and gestures as requests for specific magical effects.

If you want to write OP!Harry, say that the killing curse disrupted the anchoring of his soul to his body, so it's able to reach further from him, and his aura is bigger than it ought to be. But this piece of magical theory is just as interesting without this detail.
