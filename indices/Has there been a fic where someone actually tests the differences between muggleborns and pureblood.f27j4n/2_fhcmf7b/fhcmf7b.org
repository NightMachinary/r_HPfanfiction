  Obviously racism and eugenics are awful no matter the results
#+end_quote

What? No, racism and eugenics are awful because the results show they are awful. It sounds like semantics, but it really is an important distinction. Racism is bad because it's just objectively inefficient and needlessly cruel, not hiring a worker to do a job because he's bad at the job is a perfectly legitimate and moral reason vs not hiring a worker to do a job because he's black is a racist and bad reason.
