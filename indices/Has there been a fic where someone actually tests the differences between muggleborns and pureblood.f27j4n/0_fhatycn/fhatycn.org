Not exactly what you are asking for, but in Apple Tree by Philo Draco discovers that he is a healer and can feel and manipulate other people's magic.

It causes a change of heart for him, instead of following in daddy's footsteps he found something that he loves doing and is simply his. At first his father is opposed to the idea of his son becoming a healer, but then Draco gets marching orders from his father and the Death Eaters to figure out the difference in the magic between muggleborns and purebloods. He finds out that there isn't one, something the healers have been telling the pureblood supremacists for centuries. It is just that the supremacists insists that there must be a difference and that the healers are lying.

It is a very small subplot of the story.
