There was one where they were really hostile to each other Harry mocked her at one point calling her a mudblood knowing she hates the word then she tried to slap him and he broke her wrist and then after she went to Dumbledore to tell him what happened he did something where Hermione in the bathroom heard a voice hissing saying she's pathetic she knows the two words then she saw a flash of green light and heard "Avada Kedavra!" when she came to she saw her wand and engraved on it was "AK" but I can't for the life of me remember what fic it was. It may have been the same one where Harry gets information from Rita Skeeter by invading her dreams as Darth Vadar. I know someone knows what fic I'm talking about so I'll just leave this here
