I know right?

"Kukuku, I, Hadrian Potter, am the heir to Lord Voldemort's dark empire. My only contact with other people has been Death Eaters, and I've grown up hearing tales of Pureblood superiority and how Muggleborns are filth. But that Hermione girl is getting good grades so I guess this suddenly means that everything I've ever heard was wrong."

I fucking hate when they try to use "Oh Hermione is great at schoolwork!" as a reason for why the entire Pureblood ideology is wrong. That isn't to say I agree with the whole 'Purebloods are superior' angle. But come on people, these kids have spent their entire young lives learning that Muggles and 'Mudbloods' are inferior to Purebloods. They aren't going to magically change their entire outlook on life just because one muggleborn girl happens to be the best in class.
