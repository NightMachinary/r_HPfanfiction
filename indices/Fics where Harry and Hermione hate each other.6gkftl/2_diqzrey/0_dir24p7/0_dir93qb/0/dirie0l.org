I can live with turncoat Weasleys. They did some pretty suspicious stuff that you can interpret that way (Molly not reporting Harry's abuse to the authorities, Arthur seeing muggles like intelligent pets and belittling them, Ron and his jealousy...)

But Hermione was the one who erased herself from her parents memory for him. The one who never deserted him. Who knew that the DoM was a trap and still went because her best friend insisted on going. The betrayal plot simply doesn't work for her.
