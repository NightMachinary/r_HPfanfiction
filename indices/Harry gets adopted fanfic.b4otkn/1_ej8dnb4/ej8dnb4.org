/Innocent/ by Marauderlover7, a Sirius "kidnaps" Harry story with sequels up to fourth year as of now, ongoing.

/Living with Danger/ by Anne B. Walsh, aka whydoyouneedtoknow. OC/Lupin, the first of the Danger-verse. This series actually has side stories upon side stories, and its own AU.

/Stealing Harry/ is the first of a series called /Laocoon's Children/ by Copperbadge. Wolfstar slash, but otherwise a decent story, albeit abandoned at third year.
