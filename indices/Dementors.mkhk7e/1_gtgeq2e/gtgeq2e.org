They don't feed on emotions, they feed on souls.

Why do you think they affected Harry more than anyone else?

Lupin thought it was the trauma but every kid has trauma. Susan bones lost her whole family. Luna saw her mother die in front of her. Neville's Parents were tortured to death and he has to see them every week. Harry doesn't even remember his parents.

So what makes Harry special? He's a Horcrux. Two souls for Dementors to feed off. Two tortured souls, one broken beyond repair, one lost in grief. That would make Harry irresistible.

The scream Harry hears? It's the last thing Voldemort heard before he was obliterated. Hearing his mum isn't Harry's worst memory. It's Voldemorts.
