Dementors make you recall your worst memories, so for Ron that might be the time his teddybear was turned into a spider which would make him feel pretty shitty. Harry however would recall his parents death, his not so happy childhood, his confrontation with Quirrel/Voldemort and the Basilisk and Riddles diary.
