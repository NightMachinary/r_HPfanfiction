An interesting prompt that could lead to some big changes (didn't Harry chose his electives with Ron and so would go in Rune too?)

Except I'm not convinced by the reason of the change. Divination books also probably didn't change (since Trewalney if the teacher since 1980) and at least one Weasley took Divination before (Percy).

But the reason could be anything I guess, maybe they just got lost and found themselves in Trewalney tower, and were totally desabused by the drunk supposed to teach them.
