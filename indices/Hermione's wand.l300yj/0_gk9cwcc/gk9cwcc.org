After a Google search I found various woods called "vine wood" intended to be put in terrariums or pet cages, though I'm not sure specifically what wood they are. Maybe it doesn't refer to a specific wood, but just any wood considered a vine - they might have similar or the same magical properties. Or JK Rowling just didn't think of that which is more than likely.
