I'd heard these claims before and I actually did some research into the origins of Goblins in folklore and myth and it really looks like they were standard Fey creatures originally and any antisemitic parallels were emphasized later. It's a pretty big accusation and it doesnt fit with Rowlings opinions, writings, and actions on race. I do think she just went with the common representation of Goblins rather than intending anything malicious. My pondering is about if that is okay given the nature and meaning behind all other creature relationships
