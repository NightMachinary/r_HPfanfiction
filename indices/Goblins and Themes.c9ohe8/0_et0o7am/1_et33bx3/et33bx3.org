Interesting way to look at it. I do wonder about the implications when considering their sentience though? It actually almost feels like a discussion seen in scifi circles regarding aggressive alien races. Do the violent, proud, and warlike Krogan deserve to have their ability to reproduce properly stolen from them? Do the Goblins deserve to live under a system that denies them wands and leads to an entire history of rebellions and revolts?
