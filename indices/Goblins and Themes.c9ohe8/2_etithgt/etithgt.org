I'm majorly a fan of said connections and symbolism, even what JK missed. As result I like to take context of unreliable narrarators and draw parralels between the treatment of goblins and the treatment of jews and / or arabs seeing as, regardless of the intent of the author, she did kinda sorta deploy a whole lot of tropes allusions and sterotypes that very very much fit the mold. I know she herself had no antisemetic intentions or what have you but in this case the tropes have been deployed which makes it real interesting to see them acknowledged and fucked around with rather than ignored or dismissed, especially because they make their way into most things regardless. Much the same way as I like to see the slytherins and the bullshit sent their way being acknowledged and fucked around with beyond this one asshole had a crush on the MC's mum and was bullied so it's all good, even if it's just going further into that one because with more development that could have been a really interesting plot line(and indeed several fics have made it an epic plotline).

​

Of course that doesnt resolve how to actually treat the goblins themselves and more how to treat their relation to how other's treat them and how others treat them. Personally I don't really care for the common set of fanon tropes, we all know the ones, and every time I see the name "ragnok" I want to roll my eyes. Just as well maybe it would be nice to have lives and culture beyond "running an english bank" be a thing would be pretty dang nice though I can only think of like 7 fics that ever did that and three of them were pure smut.(Can I say how dissapointing it is when the fics that delve into interesting facets of interesting cultures are pure smut, like really?)

​

So uh, JK fucked up big time but that's almost okay because she really didn't mean to, the popular fanon is disappoint, and I think we should really be taking JK's fuck up and going interesting places with it rather than accepting or ignoring it because despite it it has the ability to turn into some really interesting story regardless. Where we should be going I have almost no clue save for that it's, in my opinion, not where we usually go with it. That sums up my opinion on the matter I think kinda sorta.
