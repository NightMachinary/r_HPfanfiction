Agree to disagree regarding the way Slytherin house as a whole was written by Rowling.

We definitely get most of canon Goblin interaction from Griphook and that colors a lot of fanfiction representation of Goblins. Honestly, the most three dimensional description given for Goblins by Rowling is their view of ownership. I just wonder why there is such a pushback in the community against Goblins as a species being relatable and or decent.
