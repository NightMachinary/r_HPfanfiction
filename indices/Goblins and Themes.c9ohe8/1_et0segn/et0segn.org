First of all, Slytherin House is not written off as "unredeemingly evil." In addition to Snape, there's Andromeda (grew up in a blood purist family but married a muggleborn), Regulus (turned on Voldemort after he left Kreacher to die), Slughorn (not a paragon of virtue, admittedly, but hardly evil), and even Draco (a right little shit, but with moral lines he won't cross).

As for goblins, it's true that the one we see the most of - Griphook - is not portrayed in the best light, but neither is he totally unsympathetic. He noticed that Harry dug Dobby a grave (which most wizards wouldn't have done), the text takes seriously his claim that Gryffindor stole the sword, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all acknowledge that their plan to trick him is wrong, even as they create it. I think the point is that the way wizards treated goblins was still wrong, even if the goblins weren't blameless themselves.
