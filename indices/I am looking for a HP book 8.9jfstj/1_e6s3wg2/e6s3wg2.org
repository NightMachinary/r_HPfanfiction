I'm not sure about /erasing/ it, but if you're interested in a story that does a similar job only much better, then you could check out linkffn(Backward with Purpose) and particularly the sequel, linkffn(Backward with Purpose II: The Book of Albus).

The first book was decent, but the second was the real standout.
