[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), for AU. It's the most popular fic on this sub and very fun

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], for canon compliance. It depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), for time travel. Draco's 'redemption' is a fun side plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), for a major AU in which Harry grew up under her loving and BAMF aunt, Dr Petunia Evans.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), for what it could have been if canon adults were just slightly more competent and less negligent.
