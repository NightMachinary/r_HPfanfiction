Hmm. I guess my feedback is that it's about the drama and writing. There really doesn't seem to be much plot, or what there is is hidden by the writing style. Maybe try to do a re-write?

Every word does not need to have an adverb/adjective. You'll want to vary that a bit. Good writing (which is very difficult!) means writing so that the reader can't see that you're a good writer and just reads through the whole thing excitedly. At the end, the reader realizes that it was an awesome story.

The other thing is that you're writing fanfiction. If the characters are canon, you don't need to explain every detail about them--readers will already know this and get bored.

Hope this helps!
