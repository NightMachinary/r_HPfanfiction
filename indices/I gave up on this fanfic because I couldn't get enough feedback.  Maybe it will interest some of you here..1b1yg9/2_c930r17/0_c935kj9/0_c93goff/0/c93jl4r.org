This is exactly what I was looking for! I figured it would need some work and you have given me some great directions to start with! You have also given me the stark realization of the fact that, somehow, my villain is really just Voldemort with Quirrell. I may just throw the entire story out minus the Phoenix and start brand new. The ironic thing was I had a beta at one point...She just kind of fell off the face of the earth though...Anyway, back to the drawing board! I appreciate your excellent input!
