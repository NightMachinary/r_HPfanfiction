I tried writing one years ago where Harry was the Avatar after Korra, that was going to follow the Last Airbender structure of three books, each dedicated to a different element, which would cover years 5, 6, and 7. In it Hagrid was his Earthbending teacher, Ron his Firebending teacher, Dumbledore (who was actually Tenzin in disguise) was his Airbending teacher, and Tonks was going to be his Waterbending tracher.

The story I had developed was that the world of Avatar was separate from the world of Harry Potter, but Korra discovered a way to travel between them using the Spirit World. Her travelling to the Harry Potter World caused bending to form as a part of Magic, there are no Muggle benders, but not ever wizard is a bender either. Korra was killed by Voldemort who saw her as a threat, and he tried to kill Harry because the prophecy foretold he was the new Avatar.

Around the time Harry was meant to start at Hogwarts, Hagrid chose to take him and start training him in Earthbending. Hagrid would also take the newly hatched Eagle-horse Buckbeak who would become Harry's animal companion. They would return to Hogwarts at the start of 5th year.

Harry would quickly befriend Ron, a naturally talented firebender, and would reveal to him that he is the Avatar and recruit him to teach him firebending. Some backstory for Ron is that after accidentally burning one of the twins when he was young, Ron dedicated himself to mastering firebending so that he would never accidentally hurt someone again. The first book would cover Ron teaching Harry while they deal with school and Malfoy, the focus would be on them at the start, but would slowly shift into the more serious stuff, culminating with Voldemort attacking Hogwarts to get to Harry. Dumbledore would reveal himself as Tenzin and they would escape while the school falls to Voldemort.

In book 2 Tenzin would train Harry in Airbending while Ron and Hagrid rescue their friends and family from Death Eater camps. Harry would finally connect with Korra in this book who would reveal the Horcruxes to him as well as the presence of the one in Harry.

Book 3 would involve Harry tracking down a Waterbending master, eventually finding Tonks. Working with the Order they would slowly take back control of Magical Brittain, working their way to Hogwarts. There Harry would face off against Voldemort, and use a combination of energy bending and Unalaqs spirit control to force Voldemorts soul to piece itself back together.

I outlined this and tried writing it between Book 1 and 2 of Korra, so there are some changes I might make. Some of these would include not making Tenzin and Dumbledore the same character, although Tenzin might have trained Dumbledore, and including Raava.

Here is a list of who can bend what.
