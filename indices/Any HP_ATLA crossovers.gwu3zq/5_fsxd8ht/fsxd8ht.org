Ninja Wizard linkao3(10824855)

Book 3 is Harry traveling to another dimension for a vacation. He lands in Avatar-world and joins the Gaang early in their adventures.

In Book 4, Harry realizes that magic is leaving Earth and tries to convince everyone to move to Avatar-world.

Book 5 is about the magical colonists settling in as the fifth nation of Avatar-world.

The series does have good guy Tom Riddle, which some people find irritating, but it's completely justified by the existence of this exchange:

  Harry: “Now, are there any questions?”

  Death Eater: “Yeah. Who died and put you in charge?”

  Tom: “That would be me. Do you have a problem with that?”

  Death Eater: “Uh...n-no. No, milord. Not at all. Glad to have him, really.”
