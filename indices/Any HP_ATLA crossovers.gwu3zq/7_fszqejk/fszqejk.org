You don't mind what's recommended? Well I hope you don't mind this because it's the only one I've read that I like. It's ongoing with sporadic updates. I've been reading it since it came out. The writing at the beginning is decent if a bit clumsy. However, as the years pass, the author has developed better writing skills. Each chapter is written better than the last. That alone makes it worth it in my opinion.
