There was one that had some interesting world building. Basically starting by transplanting Hogwarts characters and setting into the world of Avatar. Taking place quite some time after the events of LoK. London is like Imperial City, Bender-Nonbender tensions are high. Some mysterious group has been following the avatar cycle and killed them as children. Harry is the avatar but doesn't let himself know it. Pretending he's just a firebender instead. The changes to Hogwarts structure using the elements for the houses and interhouse bending tournaments read really well.

Unfortunately abandoned before anything major really happened. Just a bunch of really engaging set up. Really felt like things were just on the cusp of kicking into gear.

If you are okay going into it knowing that it ends abruptly without any closure it does give you 15 chapters of a merged HP/Avatar world.
