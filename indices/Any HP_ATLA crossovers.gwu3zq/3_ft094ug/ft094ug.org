The only one I could ever think of is deleted now it was a GOF story where during the first task the Horntail escapes and attacks and Breaths fire onto Harry, he passes out and wakes up in Southern Water Tribe Territory, found by Katara and Sokka he becomes a founding member of the Gaang and a Firebender who is learning his own powers alongside Katara and Aang. Harry could Summon black flames when angered. In the last chapter we saw the Other 3 Champions were also in the Avatar world and were benders as well, Krum was either a water or earth Bender, same for Cedric and Fleur was a Air Bender. All three like Harry seemed to have powerful Bending abilities while also having features of another Bender type (Harry was originally thought to be a Earth Bender, Krum likewise was mistaken as a Firebender)

I'm so sad I can't find it
