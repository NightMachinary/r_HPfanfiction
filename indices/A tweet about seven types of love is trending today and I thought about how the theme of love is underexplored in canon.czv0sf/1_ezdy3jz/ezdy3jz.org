I like the narrative concept... but the whole 'X greek words for love' thing is bullshit. /Ludus isn't even Greek/. It's Latin for 'game'.

(You see /Mania/ and /Xenia/ pop up in some other lists. Those don't mean 'love' either.)

From what I can tell, only /Philia/, /Agape/, /Storge/ and /Eros/ in that list are legit. The English word 'love' can be used for all four concepts (although it probably wouldn't be the best translation for /agape/ or /philia/).
