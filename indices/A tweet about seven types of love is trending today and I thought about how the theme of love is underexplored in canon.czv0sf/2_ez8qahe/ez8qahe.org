Hmm, you could almost fit them into canon, with a little stretching of concept...

Eros - Ron destroying the locket while confronting his fears over Harry/Hermione. He achieves confidence in his passion for Hermione and hers for him

Philia - The diary, the cup, the locket, and Nagini could all work here. The cup is my current choice through a process of elimination

Ludus - Dumbledore and playful love would seem to go together most naturally, but it isn't really involved in the destruction of the ring. This one is a stretch, but the more playful/childlike way 2nd year Harry and co approach the puzzles of the diary and the Chamber would seem to fit best

Agape - I agree

Pragma - The story of the diadem is tied up in the feelings of the Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron towards each other.

Philautia - The locket could fit here too, but I agree that Neville and Nagini is the most apt

Storge - No parents were really involved in destroying horcruxes. Dumbledore, as a surrogate parental figure, fits best though. His self-sacrifice with the fake locket fits pretty well, and is also wrapped up in what he did with the ring, so we'll shove the ring here and call it a day
