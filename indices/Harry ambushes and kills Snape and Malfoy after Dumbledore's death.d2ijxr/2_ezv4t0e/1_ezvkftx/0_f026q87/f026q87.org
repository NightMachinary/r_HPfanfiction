Indeed! Hell, Draco may be a spineless coward and a follower (who can't stomach torture and killing because he's a spoiled, pampered asshole!) but those are even more dangerous (they'll stab you in the back instead of coming at you from the front!), especially if you corner them! So taking this dangerous enemy (who might also buy his way out of prison, especially since he hasn't truly commited any truly bad crimes yet!) is kind of common sense IMHO! Just like killing every deatheater and snatcher is (not every purge of a society is bad, if done for the right reasons and during war then it can be a very good thing!)
