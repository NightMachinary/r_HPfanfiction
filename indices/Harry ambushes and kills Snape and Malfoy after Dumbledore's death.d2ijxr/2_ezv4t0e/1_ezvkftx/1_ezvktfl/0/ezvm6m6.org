I'm assuming Malfoy being a kid would be a great comfort to the victims of his crimes? And Harry killing him in combat wouldn't be murder; Malfoy had employed lethal, /unforgivable/ means in the past and it would make sense if his opponents retaliated likewise.

Legality and even morality is irrelevant to the request anyway as long as the premise itself is not /implausible/.

Harry may not be a killer in /canon/ which is why I've asked this in a /fanfiction/ subreddit.
