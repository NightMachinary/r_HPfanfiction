I've always been puzzled over Dumbledore's insistence that Snape be the one that tells Harry that he needs to die, for this exact reason -- Harry has no reason whatsoever to trust Snape, and to him, killing Snape in an ambush can be nothing but a good thing.

No matter what you think of Snape, him dying off in such a case is going to make things very problematic.
