  Hermione is the most boring, goody-two-shoes character I can imagine to exist.

Then you are totally wrong about her character.

Hermione is the most ruthless and vicious of the Trio, as long as she thinks she has the right cause.

Someone who sets a teacher on fire at age 12 is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who steals rare ingredients from a teacher, brews an illegal potion, knocks out two classmates, abducts and impersonates them, and interrogates another is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who traps a slandering journalist in a jar for days and later still has the nerve to blackmail her is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who starts an underground student armed gang is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who curses a contract, cons fellow students to sign it, and will scar violators for life is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who cheats by using memory charms on a broomstick flyer high up in the air so her friend can get on the team is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who goes out with the most disgusting jock in the school just to make her potential boyfriend jealous is goody-two-shoes?

Someone who makes her parents to think they are totally different persons is goody-two-shoes?

Gimme a break!

Out of the Trio, she's the most at risk of going dark. Considering what they went through, maybe she's one already by the end of DH, or she might never make it to the position of the Minister in that cesspool known as British Ministry of Magic.
