I highly recommend Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7. It definitely has a very dark Harry that really struggles with the whole good vs. evil thing. I recommended this to someone yesterday and I'm way too lazy to rewrite my opinion lmao so I'm gonna copy and paste what I wrote.

Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 was absolutely incredible, although it's definitely a hard read. I've only done 1 read-through, and I've been trying to get around to reading it once more. It's a WBWL fic where James and Lily are still alive, but Harry still gets sent to the Dursley's (around age 8 I think). James and Lily never abuse Harry, but he grows up in the shadow of his twin Skyler. As he gets older he becomes more resentful of them, and feels the need to prove that he's a better wizard than Skylar. It's a much darker Harry because due to certain events he ends up living with Bellatrix, the Lestrange brothers, and Voldemort. You can imagine what kind of childhood that leads to.

The reason I loved it so much was because of how the author writes Harry's character. Harry is not a great guy in this, but you can understand why he does the things he does, and you can sympathize with him. He‘s childish and naive in his resentment towards his family, but that's because a 13/14 year old is still a child. So many Dark!Harry fics have him characterized as an “adult-child”, where he acts like a fully grown man at the age of 13. This is a dark, angry, bitter Harry who has the understanding and outlook on life as a growing child. He's always a bit more mature, but that's because he goes through some horrible shit that forces him to grow up fast. But even through this, you can see through his “adult” act, and that underneath he's just a scared kid who wants to prove himself.
