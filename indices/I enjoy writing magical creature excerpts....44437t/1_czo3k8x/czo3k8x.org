The [[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/][monster blog of monsters]] is something like what you are writing, but of course a blog on tumblr. If you don't like tumblr, as Wordhammer suggested AO3 is great for this sort of thing, as unlike FFN it doesn't have the same limits on content, and you can also embed images.
