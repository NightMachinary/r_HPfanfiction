This looks like it could be a fun fanfiction supplement- something to post like a series of brief articles. If you just want to crank out a bunch, I'd suggest making a story file on Ao3 (where they aren't wedded to limits like 'no scripts, no lists, no meta content').

Name it something like 'Snorcack Society Field Observations'. Each chapter would be a different creature. If you later wanted to expand on it, you could add a story about the witch or wizard's encounter that led to the article, or about how someone followed the guide and found something quite different.
