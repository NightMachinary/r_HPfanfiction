It's a fairly common trope for the Chamber to have Slytherin's library hidden in it. Here are some examples:

- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] series (first book is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]) - Harry finds several important things in the Chamber at the end of book 2. He starts using the Chamber extensively in book 5. linkao3(12608820)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] - Harry uses the Chamber's library to learn about the history of Slytherin and other important lore. linkffn(6254783)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12405748/1/][Harry Potter and the Curse of Undeath]] - Harry returns to the Chamber in year 4 looking for power that might help him survive the Triwizard Tournament. linkffn(12405748)
