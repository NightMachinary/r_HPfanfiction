Well, if you want him to become sorta insane, show DEVELOPMENT. Show him battling with maybe and addiction to the Dark Arts.

Try to avoid him just being evil. I've seen this hundreds of times. What you need to do is show WHY he is evil, in like a prequel or something.

He also needs a PLAN. Why is he a dark lord? Is he fighting to change something? If so, what and why?

EMOTIONS! He has emotions, maybe not remorse, but you don't want a Dark Harry who is just emotionless, even if he appears that way.

His followers, what was their BACKSTORY? Why do they want to follow him? Or are they forced?

DWPEB- Be warned I have just made this up...

Development- Where is this Harry going to go? What pushes him over the edge?

Why- Why is he evil? Why is he a ruthless Dark Lord?

Plan- You don't want a stupid Harry who always fails, but you don't want a Gary/Mary Sue.

Emotions- What was he feeling the first time he killed/torture someone?

Backstory- His followers need a backstory. Saying, “oh they were abused as a child” isn't going to cut it. --------------------------- But do try to avoid long titles for Harry such as Lord Slytherin-Gryffindor-Perevell, etc.

I said it once I'll say it again. NO MARY/GARY SUES PLEASE.
