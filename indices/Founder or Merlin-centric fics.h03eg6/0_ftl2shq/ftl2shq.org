I'm writing one! Linkao3(23957842)

It's Set several decades into Hogwarts existence, with the founders as major characters but not the main characters. It's set just after the Norman Conquest, and follows a lot of the political fallout of that within Hogwarts.

So far I'm on a fortnightly update schedule and have published three chapters but written seven, so, plenty of material even if it's not all available right now. Let me know if it sounds up your street! It's also available under the same name on FFN.
