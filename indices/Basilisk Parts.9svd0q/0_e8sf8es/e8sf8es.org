I touched on this in a discarded draft I did. It was overdone as a whole, so I just deleted it. Anyway, the price for Basilisk venom /was/ insanely high, more money than anyone would ever know, but it was a trap to lure people into the Ministry and to be tossed in jail for illegal breeding of XXXXX creatures.

In the end, I simply decided against it and just waved it all away, claiming Basilisk pieces would instantly disintegrate when the creature died, something about the blood burning all the scales alive. The only way to get the parts was to gather it from a live Basilisk, and they were too prideful to give it up, even to a Parselmouth.
