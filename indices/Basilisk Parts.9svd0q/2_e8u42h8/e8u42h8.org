I think you're discounting some things. Making a Basilisk is easy but it's impossible to make it safe. It's capable of killing a wizard from birth by two means that are really easy to fall prey to with a moments inattention: "Oops, I looked it in the eye" or "Oops, I didn't notice it hatch and it bit me. Too bad I don't have a phoenix on hand...".

Basilisk parts are almost certainly very valuable (not absurdly so, but enough that you might be tempted I'd wager) but it's just not worth the risk when you can use dragon skin and such. The fangs probably have no real equivalent though.
