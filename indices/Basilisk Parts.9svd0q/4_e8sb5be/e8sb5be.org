Since basilisks are made, not bred, if there was anything economically worth harvesting off the blighters, 'basilisk farmer' would be a job you could get. Now, maybe there is such a thing and Harry just never comes across it during the books - dragon farmers are clearly a thing, since dragon parts are sold as a commodity on Diagon Alley. Whether the dragon reserve that Charlie Weasley works on is also a dragon farm - there's a "wild boar reserve" near me that sells the meat, it's basically a farm you can visit to look at the animals - isn't said either.
