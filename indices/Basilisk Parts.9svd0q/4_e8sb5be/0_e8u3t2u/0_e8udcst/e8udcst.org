  I think the problem is Basilisks are even more dangerous than dragons.

That's a health-and-safety-at-work issue, though, not an insurmountable obstacle: the more dangerous the production process the more you charge the customer. Nuclear materials are, as you say, dangerous, but there are safety procedures in place for working with them - there's a nuclear fuel processing plant just about visible from my house, and I know a couple of the workers there socially. The procedures for dealing with Uranium Hexaflouride are more than a little stringent, I'm told.

Now, that resulting price may well mean that nobody can afford to deal with basilisk-sourced ingredients so the knowledge has either been lost or was never discovered to start with, which removes the economic incentive to devise safety measures for farming the beasts.
