The issue is two-fold though. Dragonskin is apparently plentiful enough that every Hogwarts student (and presumably every other school student, likely anyone making potions anywhere) has a pair. And they're likely just as effective at blocking or weakening magical effects as Basilisk skin. So the demand for that would be low since an equivalent alternative is readily there. The Basilisk fang is another story, but given it's powerful enough to destroy anything (Horcruxes included) probably anyone needing a powerful acid would use anything else.

And consider, dragonskin is taken from a dead adult dragon. You're not getting diddly from a baby Basilisk (doubt the skin would be matured enough to risk it at that point), and you surely can't let it grow to an adult to harvest its materials. According to Pottermore, the main impetus preventing dark wizards (who'd obviously want a powerful beast) from pumping them out is that the Basilisk usually kills the person who hatches them. Production is only possible if it's actually possible to produce them. And short of being a Parseltongue it doesn't look to be possible, so now I'm not actually sure there's an incentive for it. Either it's too expensive to be worth it (because getting it safely and in abundance doesn't seem possible) or no one would bother due to the alternatives and so it'd be priced lower.
