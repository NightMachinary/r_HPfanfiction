I think the problem is Basilisks are even more dangerous than dragons. They're not just massive (something like 60 feet long or more) but they can kill with a look and have incomparably acidic venom. So it would obviously have valuable parts like dragons (the fangs we know have worthwhile use) but since a Basilisk is mortally dangerous from birth it's just not feasible economically.

It's a bit like nuclear weapons in that regard. Oh sure it'd be worth tons if you could sell a nuke. Good luck doing it given just the danger of being near radioactive materials.
