The Hogwarts Basilisk should be worth a bunch even without the typical potions stuff. The novelty of owning the skeleton of the hundreds of years old Basilisk from the fabled Chamber of Secrets should be worth a small fortune for some pure bloods.

The observation, that just leaving the carcass down there to rot, is utter lunacy is a fair one made by lots of fanfictions, but as you pointed out the "Harry gets a fortune from the Basilisk corpse" trope has become super cliche. So if it were up to me I'd just find a way to get rid of the corpse.
