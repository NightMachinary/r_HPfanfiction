It might be getting old that the basilisk is basically sold in "every second fic" - but then again:

It is a damned magical snake that can basically kill everything (even Dragons have a hard time fighting it!), not to mention that this one is ANCIENT (at least a thousand years old!) so yeah, people would want parts (scales, venom, teeth, bones, skin, organs etc.)! Hell, the very fact that Harry killed it is probably worth a markup! Seriously there's bad childrens books in HP that tell bad stories (seriously unrealistic, even in a world of magic!) that have Harry's name attached to them and they probably do sell (Ginny had them!), so yeah:

Harry's fame sells! Books and probably even basiliks parts (even if there are no potions that use them - which is probably unlikely, as getting basilisks is rather easy, I bet dark wizards did have them from time to time, maybe the DoM, too etc.)
