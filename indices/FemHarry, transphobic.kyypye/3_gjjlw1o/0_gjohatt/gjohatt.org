To expand because I was reading through again:

I agreed with a lot of points made on this thread and I do think it is the responsibility of writers to step out of their comfort zone as they continue to write, but I think it's important to note that I believe this type of development should be coming with time and experience.

From my experience a lot of fem!Harry writers tend to be younger girls who are utilizing Harry more as a self-insert as he was the character they made the deepest connection to because we followed him in the story. In turn, I find a lot of these writers to be lacking in experience and these fics are often their first fic or towards the beginning of their writing experience. At least for the usual ones that lend towards ships that would typically be slash.

I think writing at all is out of their comfort zone at this point in time and for a first experience, this is understandable. It allows them to explore the relationship dynamics of the personality of cannon characters without adding the pressure of having Harry obviously out of character or dealing with themes they haven't experienced themselves in their personal lives to draw inspiration from. I don't think their rendition is necessarily discrediting the work of the slash renditions of the same relationships who I think are just providing another layer of to the relationship that makes them a bit more difficult to navigate.

In turn, I think it minimizes the blatant objectification to a degree because I feel when authors cannot relate to their characters especially in slash fics they will puppet and degrade them to far worse a degree because they are viewing their characters less so as people. They will rely on poorly formed stereotypes and will base all their characters' struggles around their sexual identity because it is the most central characteristic to the fic. There may be an element of internalized homophobia to that but I also think it is because they are viewing the characters as fictional moulds to be manipulated and the coloured, and not as a breathing extension of themselves, which is what I believe results in the most realistic and thought-provoking writing. Learning to manipulate yourself to mold a more diverse array of characters comes with time and research and I think it would create far more damage for everyone if writers are pushed too quick to step far out of there realm of experience when writing for fun.

As they grow as a writer it is true that they need to expand on the skills they acquired, but I personally think it is only fair to welcome inexperienced writers to express themselves in the community and hone their craft and this happens to be a very popular way to start doing so and I don't think it implies underlying homophobia in this scenario.

I mentioned above that I don't think I can personally write slash at least not as the premise or central to my story because I don't know what it's like to be a man who loves another man and no matter how much I research I fear I'm coming to rely on someone else's words which I am only reiterating and passing off as my own. I can't breathe life into these characters because I can't relate to this perspective and so I push myself out of my comfort zone in other ways. I explore world-building and power dynamics that I need to research and design. I implement gay characters that are still prevalent in my stories but are not the main perspective I am writing from so I can portray them fairly. I will explore an educated racial narrative that has a role in a story, however being a POC is typically more of a detail on my character that is mentioned in an occasional parroted discussion or as a comparative to the pureblood/mudblood wizarding narrative because the truth is no matter how hard I try I will never truly understand what it is like to be a minority I can only hope to imitate.

I think it's very black and white to color our tropes in fan fiction as one way or another and everyone has a right to their interests. Homophobia and transphobia though very real, can be very heavy terms and should be assigned when appropriate and never generalized lest the term be discredited when it is most needed.

Likewise, I read an amazing au which was presenting a multiverse concept and touches upon the concept of thousands of renditions of every character and in this dimension happened to be a Harry who was born a girl with Lily's features who was able to cross dimensions to raise a young Tom riddle in another dimension. It was one of my first serious reads of a fem!Harry fic which I had been shying away from because of the poor reception I'd heard from the trope and I absolutely loved it.

Ignorance is not an excuse, but I do believe that inexperience supports room for growth and it will come with time.
