I can see what your trying to imply and I just want to give a second perspective.

I have read plenty of books from a males point of view and slash before, but from a writing stance I find myself feeling that my portrayal would do a disservice to the character or the community because I am basing from a frame of reference that is not my own.

I would only feel comfortable if I was consulting a bunch of other people and had done a lot of research to write a male Harry written fic where he is intimate with another man simply because I don't want to misrepresent the character or the relationship by using stereotypes to make up for a lack of understanding.

I know there are plenty of people that do not struggle with these points . Some great slash and male Harry's are written by women (such as JK Rowling, but she had an editor so...) but for some like me it's a way of getting your feet wet in writing a character and a ship that you like from a perspective you are more comfortable with.

I personally just write ocs because of this but that's an even greater sin.

Hope that makes sense.
