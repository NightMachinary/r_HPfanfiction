The thing is that while writers often have some level of implicit bias that colors their stories, in general, most often seen are just examples of "No, I don't want to write that." For example, many straight people don't feel comfortable writing LGBTQ relationships, so they don't. Wanted to write Drarry but don't feel you'll do a good job depicting a gay relationship? Or do you feel you're going to struggle with writing from a male perspective? The answer people will come to? Write fem!Harry/Draco. While I personally believe that people should try to branch out and write things they might not be comfortable with more often, I approve of the decision to shy away from a topic a writer isn't comfortable with.

Genderbending stories can often be attributed to this experiment: Assume every character is straight. Swap a gender, what new relationship pops out at you? This is a mirror to the idea of: Assume every character is gay, what ideas do you see?

Problems arise with the handling of your new female character, in most cases if people assume that the character was female the whole time, nothing changes in the story. If Harry was Holly nothing majorly plot-relevant would change. If you try to have them change overnight, then congratulations, you've given your character gender dysphoria. I have personally not seen any instance where the fem! character changes overnight and is instantly ok with it but I'll take your word for it.

LGBTQ issues do come up in fanfiction all the time

I do however have some issues with slash. Male-on-male in fiction can often become well... objectifying for the male characters. One needs to only look at the Omegaverse to see where the problem lies. A lot of these /elements/ can be seen in the fanfiction community as well. I find these much more damaging than genderbending.

However, none of this is to say that the issues which you pointed out don't exist in genderbending, I just don't think it's the majority of the community's motivations.

[[/u/cest_la_via][u/cest_la_via]] raised an interesting point about magical transitions for the purposes of mpreg! and the implications that they have seen in stories that included it. In the context she brought it up in, I agree that it is in fact /always/ homophobic. For a number of reasons. Though now I'm thinking about whether or not it could be used as a viable medical procedure in order to procure an egg so that you could have a child that's biologically your own to give to a surrogate. As in transition one member of the couple temporarily so a doctor can obtain an egg from them, then fertilize using the other partner and give to a surrogate. The transitioned person is turned back, and everyone lives happily ever after. I like Magic. It makes a weird thing like what I just said possible.
