My point is that genderswapped characters allow you to write fanfiction within your comfort zone. Just because we have the resources to write characters outside our own particular frame of reference doesn't mean we want to. Writing comes in many spheres, and writing the story you want is perfectly fine. That's why they don't step out of their comfort zone. Because it's not a crime to have one.
