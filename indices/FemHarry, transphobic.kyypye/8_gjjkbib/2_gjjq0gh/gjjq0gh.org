I won't care about the downvotes and say that you're right. People really have gone soft, just because you said a joke about something doesn't make you racist or homophobic. If someone says something to you that you don't like, just ignore it and move on.

This is one of the things in the fanfiction community that I don't like at all, for some people if someone doesn't do what they want or behave in a certain way it's offensive and should be banned.

Regarding your first point I agree with that too, when I read fanfiction I try to put myself in the position of the main character, try to feel like he feels, think like he thinks, etc, etc. But if the main character is either trans, homosexual I just won't read it because I can't identify with him. I don't mind people reading and writing about these kind of characters, I don't care what they do with their life. If you want to do it, do it. Just don't call others racist because they don't like these kinds of things.
