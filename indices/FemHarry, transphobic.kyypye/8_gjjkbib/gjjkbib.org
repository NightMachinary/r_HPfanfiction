I honestly don't think that's true for the most part. I think many people have a difficult time putting themselves into the shoes of a trans person for example. How they feel, how they tackle issues concerning their gender identification, etc.

And I also think you may simply be reading too much into things. I think people have gotten too soft, and this PC culture is getting out of hand.

Let's say I make a joke about a trans person, or a gay person. Does that make me transphobic, or homophobic? Does me making a joke about a black person, or an Asian, mean I am a racist?

No, it does not. I'm just making a joke. Understanding the intention behind a joke is just as important, as listening to the words. Seriously, if things keep going the way are, we're going to destroy humour.

I'm telling you, people get offended much too easily. And then there are the idiots who get offended on other people's behalf. Even when the supposed victim isn't even offended in the least...

Sorry for the long rant. I'm just so damn tired of people getting offended by every possible thing...ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£
