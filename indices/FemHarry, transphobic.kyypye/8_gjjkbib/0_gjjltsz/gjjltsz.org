Okay, to start, there's a lot I disagree with in this.

Racism and homophobia is everywhere. If you make a joke about a queer person or a trans person, then fuck yea you are being homophobic. Same thing for a POC. A joke is only a joke when it doesn't insult someone's very existence.

I'm gonna ask you something even though I probably already know the answer: are you white and/or straight?

If so, then you probably don't understand. People are killed and victimized everyday because of who they are. If someone is trans or openly gay, they are more likely to be fired or attacked for just living.

Look at the BLM movement. Even small stuff like making a rude joke or immediately blaming/accusing/suspecting someone who's a POC or queer is adding to racism and homophobia. People focus much to much on the big things, you don't bother to think of the little things. The things that feed the flame which sets off the bomb which is the big things.

We aren't getting offended by ever possible thing, we're getting offended because you just insulted our very identity. To be fair, everybody has a different rate of how much their sexuality or race impacts their life. Some view it has an important and vital part of their existence, other see it as just something that they are; sort of like what their favorite type of ice cream is.
