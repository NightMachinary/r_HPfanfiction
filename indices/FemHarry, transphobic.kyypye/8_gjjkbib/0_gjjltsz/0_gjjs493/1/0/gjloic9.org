Agreed. It's just that every gay person I know likes to make jokes about their sexuality. I was at a party a some time ago, and while I do not remember quite how it started, we started speaking about sausages, and a lesbian friend of mine mentioned she loves sausages. (She has two lovely kids) I, of course, could not resist, and pointed out to her that she obviously doesn't any more.

Everyone laughed at that, and my friend laughed the hardest. I guess my point is that people's experiences vary, and obviously that will dictate to some extent how we see things.

Anyway, I wish you all the best, and stay safe ðŸ˜€
