Religion has nothing to do with it. It's just an excuse. My ma grew up in the 60s with a very religious family; the kind that goes to Church on Mondays as well as Sundays. She's perfectly fine with me. I don't think we should do away with religion, that's just stupid. There are thousands of people who love their religion and don't use it as an excuse to be assholes. I personally am not religious(I'm agnostic atheist which is a whole nother conversation) Maybe I didn't make myself clear. A joke is only a joke until is disrespects someone's very existence. Ergo, some jokes are okay while others are not. It depends on the context. Those two examples are the big things.
