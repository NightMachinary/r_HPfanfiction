Religion is the the root of so much evil in the world, that the cost of keeping it around is too high, in my eyes. In almost any place where religion plays a massive role in society, there's just so much strife, hate and intolerance.

And there is no space for open minds or hearts in those places. And then, there are the things that people do in the name of their religion. Not to mention the fools that allow themselves to be brainwashed by those in power.

Priests get away with abusing children within the Catholic church, and simply get relocated, because what they do mustn't stain the church. And of course, they just keep up their disgusting habits in their new place.

Young girl's genitals are mutilated every day in some places, just so that they can't enjoy sexual intercourse, because if they did, then surely they would bring any man into their bed. I don't care that it's some kind of tradition. It vile and despicable.

And then, you have the Nordic countries. Up here, religion is pretty much an afterthought, and no laws are passed, based on religious beliefs. Our countries are some of the safest, least violent in the world. I don't think that's a coincidence.

Look, I understand that religion has, and does help alot of people through difficult times, pain, suffering and loss, and that's a good thing. However, I think the cost of keeping religion around is becoming too high for society to bear.

Having said all that, I suppose humanity would just find something else as an excuse to kill each other, so I suppose it doesn't matter, in the end.
