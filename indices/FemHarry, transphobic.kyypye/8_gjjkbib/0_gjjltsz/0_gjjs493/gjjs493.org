I understand what you're saying, and I agree that there are a lot of things that need to change in society. There are just ao many stupid things going on, that need to stop. Being biased against someone because of the colour of their skin has got to be one of the worst. It makes no sense. And no one was talking about accusing/blaming anyone. I was talking about jokes.

And why do some people hate someone for being gay, or trans? It's none of their business. People should mind their own business. Often it's about religion, but that's a whole other point how I think humanity should do away with religion...

Look, just treat everyone the way you wish to be treated. Be respectful, that's all we need, really.

I do stand by my original point about the jokes, though. It's not quite the same thing, especially given what the minorities we're discussing here have gone through, and still are, but I'm a bit on the short side, and people tend to crack jokes about that. Do I scream at them, or report them to my boss? No, I do not. I just take it in the spirit it was intended, and rejoin with a quip of my own.
