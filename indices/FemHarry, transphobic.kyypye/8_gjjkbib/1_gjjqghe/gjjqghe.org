In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with making jokes like that - as long as you aren't making anyone uncomfortable. If you make jokes like that around your friends who also enjoy that sense of humor then that's perfectly fine! - Just make sure you're being polite, and refrain from those types of jokes if you know the person does not enjoy them. I think jokes like this can be funny, but I understand some people don't have this sense of humor and that's fine too! They do have valid reasons for not enjoying it. The bottom line is to just always be respectful.
