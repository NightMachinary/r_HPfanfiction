I dont think making Harry female is transphobic.

Some writers just do it for the concept and how it changes the canon. And others, for example teenage girls, write and usually change the gender of the main character to put themselves into the story. Its a power fantasy because Harry is the most important character in the story, has a tragic past, a overfilled dramatic life and tons of secondary characters that the writers like and can ship with the main character.

Being trans is not an experience everyone will have or can relate to and many teenagers hardly think of making Harry a girl as a transition. Its just Harry was always a girl in their story so no transition ever happened or, if he transformed into a girl later, magic made the change easy.
