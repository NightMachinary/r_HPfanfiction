It depends on the context, I think. For example, if you're writing, say, a drarry fic and make one of the characters Fem! that can be taken as homophobic. You set out to write an originally slash pairing, but then you make it, for most intents and purposes, a straight pairing.

I've heard the argument that lots of people who write Fem! characters are experimenting with their gender, trying to see if they're trans or what. This is great, but I suggest you write a gen fic for that. I would kill to read a well written fic where a character I love is going on a journey of self-discovery.

But in most cases in which I encounter it, Fem! can be taken as homophobic and/or transphobic.

Another point is this, quite often(this is seen in Mpreg as well which can definitely be taken as transphobic/homophobic as well) their genitals magically morph into those of the opposite sex(ergo a male gets a vagina). Quite often, even if unintentionally, its implied that they like fucking a vagina better or something to that tune. This is /always/ homophobic and transphobic, no matter the circumstances.
