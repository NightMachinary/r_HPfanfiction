  the use of phobic is weird
#+end_quote

It's not all that weird. There definitely are and have been cases where people were so unfamiliar with the concept of eg same-sex attraction that they flipped out upon encountering it. There was even a "gay panic" defense where if someone of the same gender comes on to you, and you immediately kill them, you could claim reduced responsibility - it's not right, but that's the law for you. I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist as a defence any more.

So in cases like that, calling it a phobia makes a lot of sense. But not as a universal term.
