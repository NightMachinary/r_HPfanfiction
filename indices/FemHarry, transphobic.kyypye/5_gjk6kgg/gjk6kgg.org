The fem!Harry fic I'm most familiar with us The Pureblood Pretense, which draws on Alanna the Lioness and so the main character needs to be a girl impersonating a boy. So, nothing transphobic there.

(Incidentally, I really dislike using "phobic" to describe every kind of opposition or disagreement. A phobia is a paranoid irrational fear, which might be an accurate description in some cases but far from every case. Let's not perpetuate name-calling.)
