  except the Pottermore stuff to me is non-canon
#+end_quote

Same here. If things are hinted at in canon, but not really explained and they get expanded on Pottermore then I'll consider it but won't really look at it as canon. But when something comes out of the blue with nothing linked to canon at all like [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America][this]], I'm more hesitant about thinking of it as canon.
