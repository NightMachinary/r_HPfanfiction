I think it depends on the story, honestly. I mean, if the pairings in the fanfic are not canonical (and let's face it, a whole lot of them aren't) then you can't really use the epilogue of DH. The whole thing becomes an AU before it's even really started.

Personally when it comes to the divisions in communities, I've learned it's best to keep your opinions to yourself and not get involved. Because when you open it up to debate then not everyone wants to be civil in it and can get quite aggressive when they say their piece.

But when it comes to canon, my foremost source is the actual set of books that she wrote. I regard Pottermore and any of the other fansites as secondary sources. They're more headcanony than anything else.
