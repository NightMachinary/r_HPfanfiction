My problem with that is that many authors take that as an excuse to change anything they want for no reason at all. Of course it's fine to change things, but there has to be a reason. If we did know that Draco and Astoria had marriage issues, for instance, it wouldn't make sense for them to disappear just because the fanfic author wants them to. There has to be a reason for every change presented, or it's just bad writing.
