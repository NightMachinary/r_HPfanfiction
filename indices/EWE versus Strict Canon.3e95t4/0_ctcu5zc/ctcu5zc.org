It's *fan*fiction. The fans have the say. How is disregarding the epilogue any different from shipping Hermione and Draco or not killing Dumbledore?

If you, as the author, want to disregard something, who the hell cares? If you want to follow JKR as a god whose word is the truth/law, be my guest.

But don't go after people saying, /"Well, JKR said that Draco and Astoria have marriage problems in an obscurely-worded tweet last month, so your fic doesn't make any sense!"/. That's just stupid.
