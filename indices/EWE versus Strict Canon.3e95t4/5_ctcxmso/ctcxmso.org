If it's not explicitly mentioned in the books, it's up for grabs. If it's intended by Rowling to be canon, well we'll see what the sequels will have to say about it. Until then, I classify it as a maybe.

Also, I dislike and tend to ignore the epilogue, though I do appreciate fics that make it work.
