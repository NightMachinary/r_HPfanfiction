To me it's weird to think of it in terms of the author being "right". Sometimes people want to write stuff set after DH that contradicts the epilogue, or just that diverges from canon after DH.

There are a number of things I dislike about the epilogue. There are quite a few things I dislike about the series as a whole, doesn't mean she was wrong to write it that way.
