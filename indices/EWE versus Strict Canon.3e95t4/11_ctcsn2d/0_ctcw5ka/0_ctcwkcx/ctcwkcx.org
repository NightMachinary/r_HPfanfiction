I'm not saying everything should be canon complaint. The majority of what I read isn't. I should have clarified. I do enjoy reading other pairings, what if's, AU, etc. I specifically don't understand EWE. I don't understand when people agree with everything up until the epilogue but then refuse to accept that chapter. It's the same author creating the lives of her characters. Just because it doesn't match up with whatever they had imagined or thought would happen doesn't mean it's invalidated. I find it strange to selectively choose what parts you think the author is "right" about.
