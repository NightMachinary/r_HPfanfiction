I feel like you're trying to pick an argument with me. I do read and enjoy stories that deviate and change it up. Like I said, I specifically don't understand EWE. Where people don't like how that chapter turned out so they don't consider it canon. THAT doesn't make sense to me. EWE is different from someone writing a noncanon compliant or AU story.
