A lot of readers, I think, felt like the epilogue was such a radical departure from the track the stories appeared to be on by the last non-epilogue chapter of DH, or that the epilogue was completely unneeded and unnecessary as a story element. I don't very much like the epilogue myself and don't consider it to be canon in the same way that the rest of the story is canon, but I don't care if people are epilogue-compliant in their storytelling. I just think that JKR seriously dropped the ball when writing it.
