The epilogue is badly written but I only use it as a jumping off point; it's pretty empty of detail except for names and relationships. I pick and choose post-book info as I like, and I don't abide by authorial intent.

I don't mind what people prefer. The only thing that ticks me off are people who insist canon is /always/ better and any deviation from canon is seen as a flaw--reinventing canon is part of what fanfiction is about. If a fic sets up the deviation, is well-written, and carries the spirit of the HP stories and characters, then how is it worse for it?
