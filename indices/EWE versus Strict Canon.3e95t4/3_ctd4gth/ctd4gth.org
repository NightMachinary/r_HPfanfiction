I am very much of the EWE camp. I hated the epilogue with a fiery passion because it felt so pat, even twee and it did not add anything of particular value to the plot or story.

I simply cannot be bothered with Pottermore, although I have read all the extra material out of interest.

Moreover, there are times when I simply disagree with assertions JK has made, things which simply don't simply follow the internal logic of the world (happy to expand on that, but I won't bore you unnecessarily in the meantime) but more than this, I get annoyed with the constant drip feed of new information that self appointed "Canon Police" want to beat you with.

Its been almost 20 years FFS, either write more books set in this world or /shut the fuck up about it/. No work is perfect, even if written by genii (How many children had lady Macbeth?) and there is a massive, enormous section of the fanbase whose enjoyment is derived from finding those grey areas, gaps, holes and loose threads and using them to create new tales of fan fiction, after two decades to still be embroidering over them because you made it up and are the boss of the whole thing just seems... mean.

Regarding the divisions within fandom, my interactions for the most part have seen me find lovely people with a "live and let live mentality". There are exceptions, and you can engage and let it get nasty and rob the enjoyment of the experience or you can let it slide by and do your own thing or seek out people who engage with the material the same way you do. I don't see much point in the drama to be honest.
