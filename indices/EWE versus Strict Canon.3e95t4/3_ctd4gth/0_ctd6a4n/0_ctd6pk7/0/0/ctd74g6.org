Speaking of which, the "pop out babies as soon as you get married" thing really irks me too. For one, it's archaic and sexist. For another, it's out of character for them, because in the rest of canon, Harry and Ginny both seem to be self-driven people who don't care very much for archaic standards and pleasing Molly.
