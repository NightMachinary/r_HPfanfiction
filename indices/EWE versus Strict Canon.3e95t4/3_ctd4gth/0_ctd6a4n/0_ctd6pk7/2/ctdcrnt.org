Except we don't know that. For all we know she picked the names because her children know her family. They grow up with them and they're in their lives. So to give her children a link to HARRY'S family they get their names. (Which is why I still wish it was Lily Nymphadora not Lily Luna. I have fan wanked it to them leaving Nymphadora for Teddys future children)

It's an old fashioned society. Even now it's not uncommon to have children named after dead realtives.

And on the surnames I can aboustly believe Hermione changes her name. It's aboustly fine to change your name. It's fine to keep your name. It's your choice.
