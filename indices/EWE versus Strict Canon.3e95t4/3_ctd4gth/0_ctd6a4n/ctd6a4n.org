  I am very much of the EWE camp. I hated the epilogue with a fiery passion because it felt so pat, even twee and it did not add anything of particular value to the plot or story.

Me too. I didn't want to say so in the original post because I felt it'd be too divisive...

But honestly all the pairing up of characters made me cringe, the "Ginny Potter" and "Hermione Weasley" nonsense did not fit with canon characterisations at all, and the naming of Harry's kids ALL AFTER DEAD PEOPLE made me want to AUGH.
