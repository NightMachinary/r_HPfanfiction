I understand :) I don't mean to be divisive, although I realise my views can be considered heresy by some. The truth is I have no problem with those who only read and/or write canon compliant stuff. I'll read and enjoy anything as long as it is well written, I only ask that if I have clearly labelled something as "AU" that people who don't like non-canon compliant stuff steer clear instead of choosing to read it seemingly just to be able to complain. Lol.
