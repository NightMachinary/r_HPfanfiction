God, imagine the shit storm in the fandom if JK announced that Ancient Runes was a language course, basically just studying hieroglyphics.

No more special wards made up from carving intricate runic seals!

No more runic tattoos that lead to incredible benefits!

I've always thought that half the fun was coming up with your own interpretations for the, relatively unexplored, nature of magic in the HP-verse.
