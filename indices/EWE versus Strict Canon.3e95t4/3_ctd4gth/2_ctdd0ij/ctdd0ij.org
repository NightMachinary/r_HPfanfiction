  I am very much of the EWE camp. I hated the epilogue with a fiery passion because it felt so pat, even twee and it did not add anything of particular value to the plot or story.

Whilst I don't hold the same opinion, I can sympathise with this view. In fact as a friend of mine said about this, they viewed the entire epilogue as 'fan service' for the Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny fans. The same friend is of the opinion that the ending was designed to make it all have a fairytale ending, much like the fairy tales you read as a kid. Which, in retrospect, is nice if you're a kid who's reading it all for the first time. But with age and re-reads, opinions change.
