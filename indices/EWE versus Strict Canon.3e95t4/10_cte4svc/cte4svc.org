Northumbrian writes epilogue compliant fic painfully well. On the other hand, my favorite writer writes a Nevile,Hermione, Draco triad, while suggesting the Gryffindors would run postwar death squads.

I try not to lose sleep over it, and just read what I like. I'm sorry that people are so angry about it either way. The writers that I enjoy the most aren't, or at least don't fan the flames of division.
