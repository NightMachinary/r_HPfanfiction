I write post-DH and next-gen stuff, so it can get really frustrating because there's all these little tidbits out there from pottermore or the wiki (like Fay Dunbar, who the hell is she? She's never mentioned in any of the books, but she's listed as one of Hermione's roommates). My primary source is 'if it's in the books then it's canon', and then from there I'll pick and choose what out of the interviews/pottermore I'll include. I use most of the major stuff, like Neville/Hannah, occupations for Harry and co. who all the Weasleys married and their children's names. Some of the details for the minor characters I'll ignore, like there's some debate whether Lavender lived or died and I wrote Umbridge once and was told she went to Azkaban.

I'm pretty flexible with the pottermore/interview stuff since not everyone's caught up on it. Especially since JKR likes to tweet or give extra things out, so for all I know she might say tomorrow that Neville never had any children and that would completely mess with anyone who ever gave the Longbottoms a child.
