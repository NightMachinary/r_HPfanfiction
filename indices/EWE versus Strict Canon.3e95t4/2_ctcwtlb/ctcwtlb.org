I dislike the epilogue not because of its contents but because of the damage it caused and still causes in the fandom.

I feel that the chances for new people to enter the fandom almost vanished because of the epilogue, there's almost no space for the whole "I wonder what could happen" thing that motivates writers and readers. I mean, I know the fandom still exists but there could have been /more/ writers, /more/ readers, /more/ ideas, and that loss is what makes me dislike the epilogue and the barrier to entry it created.
