My answer's super boring, but I think it's just like real life talents. You need some level of innate ability, practice, and confidence to do well.

Innate ability (and genetics): examples would be the entire Weasley family (Head Boys, Quidditch players, good duellists, have the ability to do well on OWLs), Harry and his parents (overall considered talented, each with their specialty subject too). Like sports or music, some people have a natural affinity for one sport/instrument over another. Or maybe you can't play anything at all (non-magical).

Practice: Ron and Harry do really poorly in some classes because they're dicking around, but can do stuff really well when they apply themselves (almost straight-E OWLs, Harry learning /accio/); whereas Hermione always gets stuff before anyone else - I assume she's the type to look at spelling words before the pre-test - and overall does exceptionally because of her worth ethic. Practice makes perfect.

Confidence: Neville Longbottom is my example here. His early spells are powerful-ish IIRC, but he has a difficult time getting stuff /right./ I assume it's a confidence/motivation issue, because in the DA he's 'one of the fastest improving.' After years of thinking he's practically a squib, he probably lacks the confidence. I used to play volleyball, and I sucked at hitting because I always second guessed my timing, whether I could get it over etc.

Back to comparing to sports - I also think wands are as important as sports equipment. Using a hand-me-down is okay, but not ideal. I can play hockey with a righty stick at a mediocre level (secondhand wand), but a lefty stick (wand that chose me) brings me to a better level. I can hit a low quality volleyball, but not nearly as well a good quality one that's pumped to my preferred hardness.

So yeah, that's my boring description. I don't headcanon magical cores or natural superpowers. I just think some people are better at magic than others the same way talents work IRL.
