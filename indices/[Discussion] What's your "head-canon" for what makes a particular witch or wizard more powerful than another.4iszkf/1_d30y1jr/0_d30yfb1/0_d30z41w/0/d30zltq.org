Sorry, I can't find one, I don't have the books handy but I do remember that Albus had several of his papers published while still in Hogwarts - if Hermione Granger, the epitome of hard work was not mentioned to have had a paper published, what does it take to get one published? Sometimes I wish J.K. Rowling did more world building and went into the past of more individuals. All I know about Grindelwald was that he was expelled from Durmstrang for being too into the Dark Arts or something of that nature?

- I'm not disagreeing with you that hard work and effort should make a person more powerful magically, but it doesn't really fit in with J.K. Rowling's world. It just seems that people become weaker or stronger depending on what J.K. Rowling wanted to accomplish.
