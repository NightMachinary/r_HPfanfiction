Yes, from 'The Secret Riddle' chapter of HBP, we know that TMR was able to perform wandless/silent Hovering Charms and a host of other feats, many of them geared towards punishing people he did not like. In my view, JKR cheated her narrative a bit here by making TMR special by default.

I wasn't able to find a quote to substantiate the claim that AD and GG were able to perform extraordinary magic without any formal education. Do you have one handy?
