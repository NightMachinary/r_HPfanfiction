My headcanon is that magic is chaos and it's our willpower forcing it into the shape we want. The less willpower one has, the less ability. And as it is chaos, it touches those who have greater willpower/affinity and marks them, such as dumbledore's eclectic style, the Potters' untameable hair, perhaps even Hermione's mane.
