I hate how in all the fan-fics I've read, not a single one of them describe the interactions between wand types. The most a fic will do is go over how the Elder wand is supposedly made out of Elder wood and Thestral hair. I think it would be amazing for a fic to describe how different woods and cores enhance or weaken a person's magic.
