linkffn(Core Threads) is the end-all of OP!Harry. See also linkffn(RuneMaster) and linkffn(Blindness). You could make a case that the Harrys of the ever-hilarious linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them) and the very good linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) are OP as well, though not to the same extent.
