The whole thing is bathed in warm and fuzzy feelings, which is nice. In fact, the story simply wouldn't work if there was the slightest bit of angst. It's one of my favorite fics simply because of that.

Funnily enough, there's a fic in the /Worm/ fandom I like called /Taylor Varga/ that has a surprisingly similar premise and tone: child gets absurd power and proceeds to have fun and wacky adventures while mentally dealing with the fact that they could potentially end the world if they had a bad day; meanwhile, their friends get power upgrades as well while they get drawn into the adventure.
