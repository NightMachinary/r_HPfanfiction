Harry was looking forward to History of Magic because everyone said it was the only class taught by a ghost. He was disappointed, then, to enter the room and see not a pearly, translucent apparition but a young woman barely older than the oldest students.

“It's not a loss,” Ron muttered beside him. “My brothers say Binns was dead boring, as well as dead. And it'll be nice to have a professor who never taught any of my brothers.”

Harry tried to be happy for Ron, but he still thought it would have been interesting to learn from a ghost.

“Are you Ron Weasley?” the woman, who introduced herself as Professor Khanna, asked eagerly. “How is your brother Bill? I used to have the biggest crush on him.”

The tips of Ron's ears turned red. “He's fine. He's in Egypt, breaking curses for Gringott's.”

Professor Khanna sighed dreamily. “He always said he was going to be a curse breaker, just like I always said I was going to be the youngest professor in Hogwarts history.” She bounced eagerly on her toes. “We're going to have so much fun this year, Ron. I mean, Mr. Weasley.”

She giggled and turned away, finally seeming to notice Harry beside Ron. “And you're Harry Potter! I've read all about you, of course! Maybe you can teach a class on yourself.”

Harry didn't know whether she was trying to embarrass him the way Professor Snape had done. “Everyone else knows more about me than I do,” he said.

Meanwhile, the rest of the class had taken their seats, and Professor Khanna fairly skipped to the front of the room, where she held up a copy of /Hogwarts, A History/. “How many of you have read at least part of this book?”

Hermione Granger's hand shot up, to no one's surprise. Professor Khanna beamed at her and gave ten points to Gryffindor.

Hermione and Professor Khanna spent the rest of the class discussing their favorite bits of the book, which gave Harry and Ron time to have a long whispered conversation about how best to handle a midnight duel with Malfoy.

“Well, we'll never have to pay attention in this class,” said Ron as they were leaving. “She and Hermione are never going to let anyone else get a word in edgewise. Fine be me.”

“Mr. Weasley? Mr. Potter?” Harry froze as Professor Khanna called them back to her desk.

“Yes, Professor?” asked Ron.

“Have you ever heard of a spell called /Rictumsempra/?”
