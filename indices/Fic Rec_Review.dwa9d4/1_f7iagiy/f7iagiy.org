I'd /really/ like to find good stories that are focused on mind magic, but mind magic should be about intricate psychology and magical theory, as well as creative fun with and insight into other people's minds, not a full-length story about physical and mental self-mutilation.

Not saying the story'll definitely be bad, only that your description makes me think it will be, and that subjectively it's not what I am currently interested to read.
