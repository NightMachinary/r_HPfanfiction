Hey, props to you for being honest. I've read posts where people will claim that a fic portrays the "Real Snape" and then the fic portrays Snape in such a way that he's basically an OC. I just have no love for the character to the point where if he's a prominent, main fixture in a fic, I won't read it. I just have some... very hard (and, admittedly, perhaps even irrational) feelings about him.

THAT SAID: I did, genuinely, love the review, even if the recommendation itself isn't quite my speed. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for any future recs that you do.

*a toast*
