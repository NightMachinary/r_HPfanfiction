Thank you for the lovely compliment! I'll endeavor to recommend a story that might be one you'll enjoy. I like finding little-known gems, and I decided I would like to share some of them here, for others to investigate, and hopefully, enjoy.

I will never recommend a story full of SPaG (spelling, punctuation and grammar) errors, or stories that consist of gratuitous smut. I do have some standards (winks)! My preferences include short- to medium-length (up to 50K words) fics, and one-shots. I adore the impact of a well-written one-shot! I deeply respect writers who are able to sustain the planning and execution of novel-length fics; however, I have difficulty staying with long fanfics.

I appreciate your feedback and look forward to more thoughtful commentary from you, as I hone my reccing abilities!
