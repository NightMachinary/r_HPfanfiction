I always preferred the idea that occlumency required pain, stress, and negative emotions to learn which is why so few actually know it. It would require people to face their demons to an extent that most would find distasteful.

Legilimency on the other hand would be more prevalent. A skill that powerful and intensely curious wizards develop somewhat naturally. And that while not meant to be defensive in and of itself there would be a natural defense mechanism of attack. Say for example that if you see someone looking at your inner thoughts, you have the ability to â€˜jab them in the eye'. Most people's defense would work this way and the way it's determined who wins is who jabs the hardest. Only a few extremely controlled individuals know occlumency because it's so difficult to learn and master. And this would be why Snape never got caught. Because Voldemort assumes that Snape is only a ligilimiser (spelling?) like him and 95% of other people that know mind magic and is incapable of defense that is misleading and the art of hiding.
