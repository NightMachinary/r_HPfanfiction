I always think of Sirius as the smarter of the two. I think Sirius always found something wrong with the rhetoric he was confronted with, but couldn't put a finger on it until he came in contact with muggleborns and halfbloods. He was a boy who constantly asked "why". Why do we hate muggles? Why does out blood make us better? Why do we have to be Slytherins? And so on and so forth. Combined with a lack of respect for authority and you got a free thinking little wizard there who makes his own path - if only out of spite to the people who never gave him satisfactory answers to the "Whys" he asked.

In Hogwarts he meets James, Remus and Peter who further solidify a path apart from his family's ideologies. I think that in the first few years he still hopes to find some acceptance among the Blacks, however at this point I also think he was already the traitor in his mother's eyes and his general disobedience made the rest of the family look at Regulus with hope. In the end, they pushed him away by not moving an inch. Unstoppable force, meet unbreakable wall.

In school I imagine Sirius to be good in the things he has interest in and just good enough in those he hasn't. As i said, I think he's an intelligent man (crippled by Dementors and depression in the books) and was an intelligent boy. His knowledge gain was probably very project-oriented. If they had a need for a spell for some prank or joke, it would be Remus figuring out /which/ spell and Sirius mastering it pretty quickly. I see him a lot like his godson in this regard. Like Harry I feel like Sirius would be the type who has a grasp for magic that is more gut-based than Hermione's or Remus' knowledge based approach.

I don't think he was a womanizer in the sense of "every week a new girl". However, I do think that Sirius was extremely love-depraved. At the point of his budding interest in women, he was already well and good on his way out of the Black family. Summers were hell, and feelings were only negative between him and the people who /should/ show him love and affection. In general that leads towards either an isolationist behavior, or seeing that Sirius is a rather open guy, a superficially flirtatious behavior, mixed with serious trust issues. Sirius seems like the guy who couldn't let the girls in and would break it up once the getting-to-know-you part of the relationship was done, and deeper feelings were sought. He then just went to the next one and repeat the cycle. Sirius just never met his Hermione or (post-battle) Ginny - relentless women with patience and perseverance. For that reason I'm also fond of the thought that Sirius was jealous of James when he came together with Lily. By far not enough to end a friendship, but enough for the "thoughts you aren't supposed to think" scenarios when Sirius was alone in bed and pondering (I remember a fic where only James died by Voldemort's hand and Sirius and Lily ended up together afterwards. Anyone know what fic I'm talking about?).

This was, of course, a lot of just projecting and building things on meager sources. Its all just fanon, but I think it's somewhat reasonable. In turn, for Regulus we know even less.

I think Regulus was overall not quite as intelligent and skeptic as Sirius, but the more gentle and kind of the two. He had a good relationship with a creature he was not supposed to have any sort of relationship with beyond being it's master. Kreacher. He was also trying to do right in the end, for whatever motivations, we don't know.

I do believe that Regulus soaked up the family's ideology like a sponge, and even more so after Sirius was faced with the consequences of disappointing expectations. I would believe that being at home after Sirius got sorted into Gryffindor was a hellish experience for the boy. At that point /every single bit of expectations/ rested on his shoulders. From then on out it was a relatively clear cut path. He got into Slytherin, was fed the propaganda and swallowed it whole with seconds. Because, truly, it only had advantages for him. Slytherin accepted him readily. He had like-minded friends. His family was proud. However, I do also think that Regulus was convinced that what they did was just; a righteous fight. In the end he became savvy of the depravity of Voldemort and ended up a traitor to the Dark Lord.
