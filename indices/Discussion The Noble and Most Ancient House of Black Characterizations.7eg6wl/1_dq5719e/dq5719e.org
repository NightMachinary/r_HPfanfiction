Firstly, I want to say that I see the Blacks as being very inbred and more than a wee bit mad. They're very attractive people, it seems (Bellatrix and Dromeda are beautiful but dark, Narcissa is beautiful, Sirius is very handsome), but there seems to be a running insanity among them that is probably passed down a lot, on top of a troubling home environment for each branch of the tree, as it were.

*Walburga Black.*

- Probably genuinely mad. She definitely got less rational as she got on in age, and her anger isn't just passion for an ideology - it seems to be much more than that, and much more aggressive. I think Walburga certainly loved her children, but whatever mental illness she strugged with (which I would guess? involved periods of rage and depression, but that's different person by person) masked that hugely.
- Definitely believed in Pureblood ideology, and likely saw Muggles and interbreeding as a very big threat. Believed in /heritage/ and the crucial importance of it, and was massively obsessed with the future. She was probably second-guessing every second as "how will Sirius and Regulus' children see this?" even as Sirius and Regulus were still babes in arms, and that probably explains her hyperfixation on disowning people from the family tree.
- I would headcanon as not a hugely talented witch herself. She's just too focused on other stuff to seem like she had a lot of talent in alternate areas.
- I'm not gonna make another section about Orion because I don't really care about him, but basically, I think he was probably very self-isolating and quiet in comparison to his wife, but I don't think he disagreed with a lot of her actions, and was pretty glad to let her take the lead.

*Sirius Black:*

- Biting wit. Sarcastic, sharp, and genuinely capable of cruelty. He grew up around harsh people with harsh words, and he definitely doesn't really know how to temper his words while teasing, or when to stop when he's getting rough with another student.
- Well-dressed, and charming. Despite not knowing when to stop, Sirius is magnetic, funny, and great at parties, despite having a slight tendency to cruelty - he's honorable, and he's noble.
- Probably picked on Remus & Peter in turns when bored - more so Peter, but I don't think Remus was completely free of it. I definitely see the Marauders, and especially James, acting as some part of his impulse control.
- Grew to truly despise his family's ideology, but views family as paramount. He loved his brother and his cousins, until 3 out of 4 were out of reach. He loved his Uncle. He loved James, and the Potters.
- A hugely talented wizard. Excelled at school, a terrifying duellist, and undoubtedly not somebody you'd want to face in a fight.
- Definitely had some of his mother's madness in him. I don't think Sirius was a completely rational boy of sound mind, and I think as he grew up some moments of rage and depression probably cropped up as he was a teenager.

*Regulus Black:*

- Desperate to impress his parents. He was the "spare", not the "heir", remember: he had to work harder to be seen as equal to Sirius.
- Probably threw himself into the Pureblood ideology to try to impress his parents and be the "good" son.
- Likely wanted Sirius' approval too, being several years younger; he was likely very jealous of James, and the whole thing was probably brought to a sudden stop when his mother disowned Sirius.
- Wasn't as good a wizard as Sirius. A decent wizard, sure, and probably studied extremely hard (with huge intellect), but likely became frustrated that he wasn't on Sirius' level; this explains a fascination with the Dark Arts, which seem easier to approach to get huge power earlier.
- Joining Voldemort was an ideological next step. He probably regretted it soon after - perhaps he became disillusioned with his mother's irrationality and cruelty, perhaps he hated how easily Voldemort killed and tortured. I don't think he necessarily stopped believing in the ideology, just in Voldemort.
- Thought the suicide was worth it. His family was on the way out: he had nothing left to live for.

Might add more thoughts about the Black sisters, Cygnus and Druella on their side, as well as re: Alphard, but I'm not sure.
