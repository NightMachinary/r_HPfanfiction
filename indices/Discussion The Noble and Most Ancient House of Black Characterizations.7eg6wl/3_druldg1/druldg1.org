Funnily enough, having delved back into the fandom recently and started writing again, this is what came up. What came of it was me (and my usual writing partner) ending up doing one-shots on various family members to try and sort them out and having a lot of fun doing it.

Sirius to me is the livewire; especially pre-azkaban, he's like a charged spring that looks completely still but isn't. I think he also reacts very quickly to things without thinking about why he's doing them, is a pretty manipulative person (though I'm not sure he knows he's doing it), an unreliable narrator, fiercely heartful and does not want to be the last person left giving a damn. I think he and Regulus have a lot of similarities but end up expressing themselves in different ways. I also think a lot of it comes down to how you view the family, and how they were raised.
