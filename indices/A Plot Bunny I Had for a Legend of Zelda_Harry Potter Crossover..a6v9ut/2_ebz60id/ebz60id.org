There's also a kind of neat parallel between the Hollows and the pieces of triforce.

*Triforce of Wisdom* : I'm going with the invisibility Cloak here, as it was the third brother's wisdom that choose the boon in the first place. There also isn't much courage in using the invisibility cloak to hide so you can live another day, the courage comes in taking it off and passing it down the generations.

Obviously the fact that Potter's heirloom is the invisibility cloak and not the resurrection stone doesn't make it a perfect parallel, but your idea of having the memories of the past links does also fit with the 'spirits of the past' theme that the Resurrection Stone represents.

*Triforce of Courage* : While the Resurrection Stone might not be a perfect fit, the proper use of it is what allowed Harry to have the necessary courage to walk to his death.

*Triforce of Power* : Clearly the Elder Wand

Overall, with sufficient tweaking, there is potential in such a mashup of these two universes.
