In that case, consider this:

Write the sorting self contained as a prologue, pretty much what you already have, then start in Fourth year with Chapter 1. As earlier things become pertinent, either flashback or reference them quickly to keep the story moving.

It might be a little weird at first, but it will but the story right to the core action. Sure we might need a bit to figure out the whyfores and thereofs of all the relationships and changes from canon, but that makes the reading fun.
