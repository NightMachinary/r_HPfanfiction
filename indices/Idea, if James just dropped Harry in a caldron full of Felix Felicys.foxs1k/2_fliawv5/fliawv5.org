/Filthy muggle-lover./ thought the most evil dark lord in history, The Dark Lord Voldemort, to himself. He had just executed another detractor and thorn in his side, an insignificant wallfly named Potter, and was currently gliding up the stairs of the very modest, homely home.

(the dissonance of the two atmospheres would have given anyone a stroke, but (un)luckily, the Dark Lord himself was immune to such trivialities, having sacrificed his sense of atmosphere for the ability to wandlessly set fire to things quite a while ago. There was a reason Bellatrix was in charge of the Lair decorations.)

He slid into the room beyond the flimsy wooden door after reducing it to ash, and found the target of his hatred inside a small crib. Before that crib, there was an obstacle. He would have blasted her into the afterlife already, had he not promised her to Severus. (Un)luckily for him, he had not yet executed the dark ritual planned for that evening, one which would sacrifice his sense of loyalty to one's subjects for another piece of power. And so he gave the foolish girl a choice, and she choose. And she died.

With little fanfare and zero remorse, the Dark Lord pointed his wand at the infant, drew the dreaded rune in the air, and hissed the darkest curse in history with as much hatred as he could. There was a loud rushing noise, and... nothing? The baby hiccuped. It lived!

/Weird,/ thought Voldemort to himself, and demonstrating an extraordinary lack of sense, did not attempt to find out why the unblockable curse was blocked. Sacrificing one's sense of logic in the case of choosing clothes for the ability to imperius ghosts tends to have that effect. All logic is linked, and he had sacrificed quite a few bits of it. He was not the most rational man.

And so, he cast again. And again. And again.

After a while, he began noticing a small pile of dead flies and mosquitoes on the floor directly in front of his wand, and stopped casting.

/Well, it's not as though I don't know any other lethal curses./

And so he prepared to cast something different. A piercing curse, to be precise. It would fire a lance of force that pierced stuff, pretty straightforward.

But then, he fumbled while casting, and the curse hit the crib again. So he cast again. And he fumbled once more.

His anger was rising now.

He began casting darker and darker and more and more gruesome curses, but they were all averted by the most ridiculous series of coincidences he had ever witnessed. Spells interacted with magical currents in the air and became harmless. Random insects, dustmotes and sawdust from the ceiling blocked his curses. The crib was pushed by his own foot, making him miss.

After a while, he gave up and pulled out the vial of basilisk venom he carried with him.

But even that did not work. He had to be very careful, and the vial almost slipped from his fingers three or four times as he lowered it. He did NOT want it to splash him.

So he dripped a drop of the venom above the boy, only for him to sneeze suddenly.

The Dark Lord fell back and clawed at his crimson eye, because the drop had landed in it. Demonstrating the ability he had gained for sacrificing the blood connection to his father, he gripped the slowly melting eyeball with his claw-like hand and tore it our of his head, before bellowing in rage.

Now one-eyed and slightly blinded, the dark wizard gripped the vial in both hands, ripped off the dropper, and poured all its contents over the crib.

But nothing happened. The venom hit and corroded through an empty sheet, because the boy had stood up and was laughing at him.

Laughing!

He hated the child. The boy was as annoying a target as his parents. If magic or venom did not work, he'd have to do it muggle style. What did muggles do with their kids again? suffocate them with a pillow, at least that's what he'd seen at the orphanage from time to time.

However, there were no pillows. Anywhere.

"Well, guess this will be a little more bloody."

Then he demonstrated the gift he'd gained when sacrificing his love for cats, and his fingernails grew into grotesque claws, which he stabbed into the boy.

Or at least, tried to.

Because you see, just because James had pulled his plan, did not mean Lily had not pulled her plan.

There is a quirk in magical rituals, which states that power in must equal power out. A human life has a great amount of power, enough to overcome the certain death of the killing curse, but once that was done, it was gone. One life for one life. Lily was not just life, she was magic as well, and that magic is what guided the enchantment in an alternate Harry's first year, when it burned the mortal shell of the dark one's wraith.

However, Voldemort had not used the Killing Curse, whose structure was derived from the Veil at the heart of the Department of Mysteries. No, he had used his body.

And if a mere sliver of magic could burn that body to ash, an entire life and magic could do so, so much more.

Voldemort burned that day, in more ways than one. The sacrificial energy worked like fiendfyre upon first his magic, then his life, and finally his soul. He was scorched from the outside in, and the energy followed every tether, every hidden corridor and connection. All the marked Death Eaters lost their arm that day. The Dark Mark combusted, and when they figured out how to dispel the magical fire, few were left with anything but a scorched bone. A small connection also burned that day, mostly unnoticed. A Tiara's gem melted. A ring slowly became shinier. A golden cup exploded into a thousand shards, instantly killing the woman tasked with watching over it. A diary smoldered and leaked ink.

The Dark Lord was gone.
