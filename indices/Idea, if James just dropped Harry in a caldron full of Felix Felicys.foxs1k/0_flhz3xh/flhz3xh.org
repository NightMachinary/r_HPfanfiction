What would you call it? The Obelix Gambit? Pot of Luck?

It's definitely an interesting concept. I suspect it would be easiest to pull off as a crack fic or, once Harry's life is Voldemort free, perhaps the law of unintended consequences would make it ripe for angst? (I mean, based on what we see in HBP the potion is very much a "not what you want, but what you need" type deal.)
