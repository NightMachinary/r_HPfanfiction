You can even use the idea as a post Canon Crossover. I mean what is the limit on infused Potions and injest-ables in one person, perhaps The DOM use the Infusion capabilities for the Muggle government's "Super Solider Program" and a similar idea can be use to make Harry into Union Jack or a significant altered and nerfed Captain Britain. Perhaps the government wishes to get British Representatives on the Justice League and thus "Leonus" is Born.

The idea of Infusing basically super powers into Harry Pre or Post Canon is a great idea either way
