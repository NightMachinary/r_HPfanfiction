There is supposedly a potion made of blood of Re'em that grants it's user super-strength, so it could be used for this. I think the effects were said to be permanent, so it wouldn't even have to be done with any special means of making it permanent. Would be interesting seeing the Dursley's trying to raise a baby Harry that could quite easily and carelessly rip their arms out. Not sure if it would change much in his Hogwarts years or in the war though, physical violence is not much used later-on.

Now I'm thinking of this Harry finding a Superman comics and believing he is a kryptonian.
