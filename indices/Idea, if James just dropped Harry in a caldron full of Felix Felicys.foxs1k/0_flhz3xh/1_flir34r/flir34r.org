Actually by what we see at the sixth book I would say that the potion simultaneously affect the world so things will fall in their place (Harry managing to get out of the castle without being spotted and finding the doors open) and affect the user so that they will take the best course to what they want to happen (Harry disregarding the plan and information they were working under before taking the potion and going visit Hagrid)

Also it seems to only do what the user wants, otherwise Harry would have found some short-cut to kill Voldemort or at least Racenclaw's Diadem instead of only Slughorn's memory. And this is assuming that Voldemort does have some protection that prevents Harry's luck from just outright causing a serie of accidents and getting him killed.

Tough this brings up the question if he and Dumbledore could have gotten the whole Horcrux hunt over in a day or even a week using the potion, I kind of remember that there was some kind of protection against the potion on the cave and Gringotts probably would also have this same protection bait the locket was out of the cave, Hogwarts obviously don't have this protection and the diary and the ring were already destroyed the only ones that they would have to try and find would be the cup, Nagini was with Voldemort all the time so could be killed with him, the same for Harry.
