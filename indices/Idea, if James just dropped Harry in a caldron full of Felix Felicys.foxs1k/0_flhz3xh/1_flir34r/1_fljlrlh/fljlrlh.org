Yes, this is precisely what I mean.

Look at what happens to Harry. He grows up in precisely the right environment, meets precisely the right people in the right order (imagine if he met someone with more subtlety than Draco in Madam Malkin's) and so forth. It all boils down to someone who would believably walk into the Forbidden Forest with no intention of walking back out. And, for that reason, Harry survives.

But is this the best course?

One of the things that really annoys me about Manipulative!Dumbledore fics is the way they deal with Horcrux!Harry. Invariably they find some alternative method to remove the horcrux (most of which are actually every bit as risky, if not more so than the canon solution) and then use Dumbledore's failure to pursue /that/ option to criticise Dumbledore's plan.

The important point here is that whatever I think of how the fanfic authors use their solutions, I do think they're often plausible sounding. And they're frequently tied up with plots that are worse for Harry. Most of his positive relationships with adult characters are destroyed, he's often got to do worse things, he's pushed into strange circumstances etc. etc. I think some of them are even in the "you've got to kill people in a war" vein of reasoning.

Conclusion? Canon's course is the best course to achieve James' intended action "Harry survives". And it's why I think you could make a fairly angsty fic from this prompt.

But... to answer your point about the Horcruxes?

When Harry listens to Felix in HBP, I think we see two limiting factors to its viability. Firstly, on the theme above, we see that Harry doesn't really see things play out as he intends. It uses knowledge Harry doesn't possess and contrives to ensure Harry is in the right places at the right times. It's hard to get a sense of "need" versus "want" since Harry's objectives are so specific. Basically the only incidental thing that I remember happening is brushing against Ginny and thereby causing her breakup with Dean. And /obviously/ Harry wants this to happen but Ginny is also part of Rowling's canon course, so by the reasoning above its also something Harry needs to happen. I think that's more than sufficient evidence that "liquid luck" isn't reliable. I also think it's evidence for "what you need, not what you want" but that's a stricter burden to meet.

Secondly, Lucky!Harry's actions are completely ineffable to his friends. There is simply no way that anyone could work with someone else while dosed up. There's also no particular way to ensure that one's actions are consistent with one's friends' wishes. Look at Slughorn's exploitation of Aragog's corpse. That sort of thing could play out very differently.

I seem to also remember Hermione's saying something like "it just exploits things you weren't consciously acting on". Harry knew there was something going on with Aragog. Harry knew Slughorn was greedy and liked his mum. He just couldn't see how these things could all fit together. If Aragog died the following week, say, this interpretation might imply that the events of that night would've played out to the effect of making Slughorn and Hagrid friends. That way Harry and Slughorn both get invited to the funeral and Harry would have the opportunity but necessarily the instinct to exploit it as Lucky!Harry did in the book.

If Hermione really did say that, then it's obviously a very strict limit on the capacity of the potion. But I think even from just the first two points, no amount of luck could speed up the Horcrux hunt... except, presumably, in the sense Harry might have tried to open the Locket earlier.

And then there's the whole addictive thing that's in some fanfics. I think that comes from something Rowling said? This is another quite strong limiting factor.

I think any two of those arguments make "Felix's help" either unwelcome or insufficiently game changing.
