You do have a good point in the whole cannon was the best course of action and so the potion wouldn't have changed much. But what I'm really interested are the possible changes inside cannon structure, like, Harry wants to know who is Nicholas Flamel and stumbles in a book talking about him, or just immediately remembers the card if we are going by the limit Hermione establishes. Or him reading the exact answers of Snape's quiz just before class.

“Secondly, Lucky!Harry's actions are completely ineffable to his friends.” Yeah, that's true, but to be fair it could be used to just make the story even more interesting, like explore different characters reaction to a Harry that seems to behave like he's permanently under the potion, the Dursley's for example, how would they react to someone who seems to be able to see the future? How about other Hogwarts students? Would they believe that Harry is a seer, or would they treat him like Luna? And how would the other characters behavior affect Harry? And for that matter, how would Harry himself perceive his behavior in context with other people?

The whole addictive and poisonous thought become a moot point. Harry didn't drink endless doses of the potion over his whole life, he merged with it. But this brings up the question of if other characters would become lucky by consuming his blood for example. This could have as a possible effect turning Voldemort in someone as luck as him if he used the ritual at book 4.
