I'm suddenly reminded of linkffn(Little Guy by Clell65619) where this happened to Snape, and turned him into a muscular bronzed Adonis who had every woman who saw him throwing themselves at him, couldn't walk around Hogsmeade without constantly tripping over bags of money, and couldn't enjoy making potions anymore because no matter how many mistakes he made, they'd always turn out fine, so there was no challenge. He very quickly had a breakdown from being so damned lucky.
