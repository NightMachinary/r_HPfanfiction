This is true. However, we're also talking about the kid that thought buying a golden cauldron would be neat, so we can infer that Harry has no idea how much things cost. Not only is the potion a volatile and dangerous time dump, but we can also infer that at least two of the ingredients could be relatively expensive due to source material: ashwinder eggs (which burst into flames) and occamy eggshells (which are precious metals). Those would most likely need a specialize buyer that a Master Potioneer would use. There's at least some reason that this potion's recipe is only listed and never attempted as a class.
