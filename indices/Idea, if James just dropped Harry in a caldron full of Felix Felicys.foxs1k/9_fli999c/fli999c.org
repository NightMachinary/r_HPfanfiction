There was a fic some still some time ago (before the author deleted it I guess) where the premise was that Draco needed an heir to get his fortune ASAP and Pansy wasn't going to work out for some reason. So he ends up making a pregnancy potion and somehow hitches up with Harry, then tries to hide the pregnancy from him. Incidentally, Harry fell into a cauldron of Felix Felicis when he was a baby so he's pretty lucky, but it's not the main point of the story. Unfortunately I can't remember the name, it was hilarious. And now it's deleted, can't reread it even though I want to for the third time in 10+ years.
