I like to imagine that once the ritual is done, and Harry has his lifetime of luck, Voldemort's efforts to kill Harry become a comedy of errors for the dork lord. He'd always find himself stymied and never know why his plans never come to fruition; meanwhile, Harry is living his best life doing normal kid stuff and somehow avoiding ever being in any serious trouble. Maybe he'd even be oblivious of his plight as Voldemort's sworn nemesis, which makes all of Voldie's screw ups all the more satisfyingly hilarious!
