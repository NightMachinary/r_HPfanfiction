I try to comment in the stories that I like, but most of the time I only do it once or once every few chapters if I really love it. English is not my first language so a lot of times its hard to comment something interesting, so I feel that if I comment every chapter it will be very repetitive for the author, cause I don't feel comfortable writing a lot of things in english
