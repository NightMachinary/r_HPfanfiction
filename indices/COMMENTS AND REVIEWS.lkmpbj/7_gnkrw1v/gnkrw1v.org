I don't comment a lot because I put a lot of effort into my comments, and that's not always effort I can give depending on how I feel with my health issues. I would even say it's not an effort I can give most of the time. Once in a while, though, when a story is really /that/ good, I'll leave a review/comment that's somewhere between 200-1,000 words long, because I want the author to know how much I love their story.
