I lurked as a reader on various archives for nearly 20 years before I started publishing my fics. In my case it was a matter of simply not realizing just how meaningful comments are to the authors. Since I started publishing 5 months ago, I've left more comments on fics than I have in the last 10 years at least. I personally understand now just how validating and motivating those comments really are.

To other lurkers: The more you comment, the easier it becomes! I'm especially fond of comments that quote a favorite line from the fic or point out just 1 thing specific that reader enjoyed, so that's what I try to do now when I comment. But even a quick "This is good, thanks for posting" means the world to us authors.
