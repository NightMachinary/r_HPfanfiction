I have noticed this a lot as well. For years when I was in the Harry Potter fandom, I urged people to critique my writing and they could say whatever they wanted. I found that I got more reviews on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] than I did on archiveofourown. I did get a lot more kudos and bookmarks on my work, though. I always assumed that people were waiting for the fic to be done before they commented on it. I found on A03 that people were more receptive to a story that was completed than the ones that were being updated every now and then.

But I think it depends on the fandom as well. I participated in a very small fandom that wasn't Harry Potter and I got a lot of reviews on my fics as I was uploading them.
