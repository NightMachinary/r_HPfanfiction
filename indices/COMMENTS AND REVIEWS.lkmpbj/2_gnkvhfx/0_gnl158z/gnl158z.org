There's a guy who commented on every single chapter I posted, the same review every time: "Awaiting more" That was it. One day I PM'd him on a whim, and we actually had a great discussion about what he thought of the story and things he liked/disliked about it. That convo never would have happened if he hadn't been willing to post a simple two word review.

Just saying :P
