To be honest, before I started writing I almost never left reviews. Now, I try to always tell an author if I enjoyed their story.

As for why, when I think back, I honestly didn't really think much of the author; I wasn't a very dedicated fanfiction reader (never made an FFN account until I published my first fic), and I'd only read maybe 2-3 stories per month.

I think that it is like another commenter said, that readers just aren't aware of how much work goes into writing our fics. The favs and follows (I use FFN, not AO3) make a lot of sense if you think of your readers strictly as consumers. They're not really invested in the process, not interested in how/why you go about writing it, they just want to read it. That's flattering, although I agree with you it isn't as satisfying as actually reading someone's review telling you that they enjoy your work!

Truthfully, making my own discord channel was the best decision I ever made RE: fanfiction. Even though only about 5-10% of my readers joined, it still helps me out so much to be able to have conversations with them, offer them sneak peeks, talk about my plots, and get instant feedback. Idk what your numbers are like (I didn't create a discord until I had over 1,000 fav/follows on my first story), but it may be worth considering for you!
