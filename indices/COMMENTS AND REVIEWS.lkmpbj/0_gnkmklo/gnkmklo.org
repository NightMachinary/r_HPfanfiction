Alot of peoplenarent comfortable with commenting think if they only leave a few words its rude bitntheyre not good at reviews or if they want to say a lot they'll come off as assholeish pointing out flaws or something. As long as you're getting kudos and bookmarks people enjoy it and aren't pointing out glaring mistakes or leaving highly critical and/or rude comments you're doing pretty well. Maybe say something in the authors notes saying how you love hearing form fans no matter what or something like that
