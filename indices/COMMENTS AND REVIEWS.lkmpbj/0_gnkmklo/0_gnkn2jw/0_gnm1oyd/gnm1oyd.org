A lot of people are likely to be uncomfortable giving criticism anyway, though, if they like the story and appreciate the author's effort. In fact, the more they like it, the less they'll want to come across as "that person who just turns up to complain".

There's also going to be a percentage of readers who come across your story when it's complete, or at least has a lot published, and are just too interested in continuing to the next chapter rather than stopping to comment :).

And then there's the fact that "please read and review" is fairly ordinary and therefore easy to overlook - yet there are in fact authors who are less open to criticism, and who respond badly. I was able to turn to a Discord server and get some actually useful feedback on [[https://archiveofourown.org/comments/379742895][this conversation]], but it's certainly a turn-off from commenting on strangers' work.
