I guess I generally think of one-shots more in terms of trying out interesting ideas than succeeding. Like experimenting with cooking, so long as it's edible and you learned something from trying it, it doesn't have to be restaurant-ready to achieve its purpose.

But like I said, in hindsight I can see the issue. That's just my thoughts on how I ended up making that comment.
