I only recently found this post by searching Ouroboros on a whim so sorry for the late reply and first things first hello dear author, I'm in love with your story and am so stoked that I've found you on reddit. Thank you for the masterpiece that is your story. It's the first ever self-cest that I've read and thank you for welconing me over to the dark side lol.

The main reason I don't review or comment much is that hasn't been mentioned in this thread yet is because of the nature of fanfiction itself for me personally, mainly that it's free. I love talking about things that I've read with people, pointing out characters and plot holes and things I don't like about the story itself when I spend money on it.

Fanfiction on the other hand, is free. I don't spend my money or support the author in any way. So writing reviews often makes me uncomfortable. Add to that English not being my first language and my terrible writing .I suck at writing even in my native language, so I prefer speaking because it gets the tone right-something I feel I always fail at when I write so I'm usually afraid that my comment, however well intentioned it is, might come across as off putting to the author when I try to honestly review their work- which they selflessly spend their time and effort and made available for free.

I haven't ever come across a story where I liked everything (that's why fanfictions exist in the first place) but another thing is that for me fanfiction is meant to be fun, a hobby so I'm cautious about telling the author I think their OC is a dick or that the story is dragging or I don't agree with their characterisation, or I would have preferred it if they wrote more about a plot point I feel they rushed, and no I don't think most 11 year olds behave or speak like that, the story is getting too convoluted with all the sub plots and the hundreds of characters that I'm having trouble keeping up etc. , something I won't mind talking about if it were a published work I bought.

So basically I rarely reviews because for me it's a self indulgence for the author which they've gennerously shared for free, so with my limited English and lack of writing skills I would feel like an asshole if the author was affected because of something insensitive I wrote because I didn't get the tone right or wrote something that could be misinterpreted, even if my intention was to praise the story to heaven and back I honestly feel it would be better to just lurk and be safe than sorry.
