Oh I am so happy you like Ouroboros! Your reasons are completely valid, of course! But if I may suggest, I hope you don't mind, what you said in your first paragraph is a lovely comment. You could leave something like that for any author whose story you enjoy and it would make them very happy. Even a ‚ù§ or a "i like this!" Is enough for most authors to enjoy. Like you said, we write for free. We don't make money or any profit. So us authors only get comments as "payment" so to speak. Kudos/likes too, but the comments are the moat valuable. Anyway, thank you for your answer and btw, your english is great! I am not a native speaker either, but I understood you just fine!
