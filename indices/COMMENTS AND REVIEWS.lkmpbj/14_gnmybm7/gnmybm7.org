Personally, it kinda hits my social anxiety.. i can give a kudos, but to try to say words on a bad day can just be paralyzing. On good days i can drop an emoji bomb of love, but i find myself consuming the most fan fic on my bad days.

Sorry. I'm not trying to hurt those i look to during my self care time.
