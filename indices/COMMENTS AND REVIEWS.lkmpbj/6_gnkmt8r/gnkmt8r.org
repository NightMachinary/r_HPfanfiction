Let me start by telling you I love your story! It is truly one of the best I ever read and I posted here once or twice.

I guess this question isn't for me, because I always try to comment - on any work I like, not only yours, but that is because I am an author myself.

I don't think people realise how had it is to write and they joy we get when we see people's thoughts. I think it boils down to that.

There were also some of your chapters where I didn't comment because I was so amazed, I couldn't even find words.
