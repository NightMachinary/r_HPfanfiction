I don't comment because I have nothing to say. This is author's story, so I let them decide where they want to take it, I'm a reader not a writer, so I'm not going to give them writing advices, I know nothing about the craft. That leaves me with having to write "good chapter" or "nice story" which is frankly pointless. Hearts and Kudos give the same information.
