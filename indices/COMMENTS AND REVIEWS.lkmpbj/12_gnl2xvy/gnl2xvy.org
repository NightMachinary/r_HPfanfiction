Commenting is really difficult for me because of anxiety and some toxic expierences I made in the past. On most days it is pretty much impossible. And I know a few other people with similar problems. I do want to comment and I often feel bad about reading a story without leaving any review at all, but I found that trying to force myself or stressing about it just makes it worse. I love the kudo function on ao3, because it gives me the chance to show my appreciation at least a little bit. It's great for the quieter and shyer readers!
