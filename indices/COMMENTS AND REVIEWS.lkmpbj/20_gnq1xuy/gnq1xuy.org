I tend to believe that it means my story didn't connect with them enough for them to leave a review. Basically, that they didn't like it enough or that my characters didn't inspire them enough emotionally. To me, review/fav ratios are an indicator of a reader's engagement with the fic. A low ratio means that the story doesn't connect with readers for whatever reason, and many readers couldn't even be bothered to leave an in-depth comment. So I find that it's a form of criticism in itself.
