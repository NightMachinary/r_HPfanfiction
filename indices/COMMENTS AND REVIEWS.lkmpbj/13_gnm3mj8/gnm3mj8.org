I normally try to leave reviews on stories I've read. But sometimes I tend to spread the reviews out. Especially if I don't have much to say outside of "I like this, please write more." Which I personally feel is counterproductive over time.

So, I tend to leave a review when I really have something to say, when it's a work in process. Or, if it's a completed work, I will leave a review at the final chapter, thanking the author for writing it, what I liked about it, etc.
