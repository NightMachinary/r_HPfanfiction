Albus doesn't do things for "The Greater Good". He was interested in that as a teen, but was horrified by what that brought about. That's all Fanon garbage.

Also, the reasons for the massive mistakes are that the first three books are supposed to be childrens fairy tales. The later books became more serious. If the former books had been written in the latter style, these plot holes would have been covered.
