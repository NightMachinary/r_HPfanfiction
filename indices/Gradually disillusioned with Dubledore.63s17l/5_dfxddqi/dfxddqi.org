There's a lot I love about this fic, in that it has so many interesting concepts. Harry starts out firmly as a Dumbledore guy, but details come to light, and while information he receives isn't technically wrong, it's still manipulative because of the "history is written by the victor" mentality. Eventually, he becomes conflicted because he's just not sure who is right anymore, and he doesn't want to be caught in the middle. There is a turning point as well where Harry (and others) finally say fuck it, its too much, but I won't spoil it.
