He should have made Harry learn stuff so that his search wasn't so dependent on luck and happenstance. Not facts that he couldn't have known, but magic. Harry was way too dependent on others, specially Hermione. Remove her from the equation and the situation goes from 'have some chance' to 'snowballs chance in a dragonpit'.

Telling Harry that he was a horcrux would probably have been a bad idea yes. But he manipulated too much and left knowledge and resources in bits and pieces like a scavenger hunt. He planned his manipulations to continue after his death, when he couldn't even control the situation besides giving advice to people via portrait.

For Harry to survive the AK, he was needed to tank it full well intending to die knowing he was a Horcrux. What if he hadn't found out? What if Snape died sooner or Harry wasn't there. It was just way to chance-y for my tastes.
