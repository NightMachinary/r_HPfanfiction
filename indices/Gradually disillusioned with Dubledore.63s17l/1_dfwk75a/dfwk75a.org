There's a pretty good fic, written pre-DH. We see the ugly side of Dumbledore and how he wasn't quite the saint the books made him out to be. It tries to redeem Snape though, so YMMV. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows).

Just a word of warning, Harry kind of acts his age here, so the Dumbledore-bashing is a bit more nuanced and realistic than in most fics. Also, the author ships Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, which might not be your thing. DLDR
