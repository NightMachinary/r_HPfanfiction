  Harry potter thought that now he'd destroyed voldemort, he'd live happily ever after in an isolation from everyone. However, a new prophecy and then a mysterious incident leads him to the world of WESTEROS after earth's destruction. How will he cope in this world which is itself rife with corruption, treachery and manipulation? MoD, lil-selfish, rich harry. Harry/Daenerys pairing.
