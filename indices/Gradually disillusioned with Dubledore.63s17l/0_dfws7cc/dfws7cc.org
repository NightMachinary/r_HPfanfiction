I'm ok with Dumbledore being a mean manipulative bastard, but at least he should be manipulating for the win, weakening his enemies, and not always sacrificing his own people! Most manipulative!Dumbledore fics just had him out for Harry for some vague 'Greater Good'.

The only fic I found so far that handled this really well is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. The kids figured out sometime during Year 6 what his game was, and were less than pleased. But they also had to keep playing along because his plan was effective and sound.
