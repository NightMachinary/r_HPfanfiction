'The House of Potter Rebuilt' has Hermione organizing regular meet-ups with former students of Gryffindor with the current ones, where they talk about their job and life, give tips, their opinions on current society, etc. I remember those to be pretty interesting and well done. I recall Celestina Warbeck talking about what it means to be famous, a pair of father-son duelists about the decline of their sport since the ministry supports Quidditch and Arthur Weasley explaining the inner structure of the ministry with all its flaws and prejudices.
