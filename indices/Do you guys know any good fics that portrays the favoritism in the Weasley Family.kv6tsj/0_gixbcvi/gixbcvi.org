There are parts in linkffn(11191235) Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, but it is then justified a bit. The problem is that the Weasley family is so inconsistent that you can make them out to be just about anything. On the one hand they are so poor that Ron can't afford his own wand and they have a handful of coins total in their vault, but then they blow most of 700 galleons on a single holiday and the entire family have their personal good quality, if not cutting edge, brooms for quidditch. They are relatable everymen, but his father is a department head and his older brothers include two head boys, a Quidditch captain and the twins who outperformed decades of professional R&D by other joke shops while still in school. Even Molly outduelled Bellatrix.

If you want to complain about Ron getting unfairly treated blame JKR. She sets him up as an 'average' relatable figure, then keeps raising the bar. In the books he doesn't underachieve, but from Hermione to Harry's patronus to Snape's potions book to the Marauders' animagus transformations to Barty Crouch Junior's exam results to his own brother, everyone else overperforms, constantly raising the bar until poor Ron is left at the bottom, losing out to 'power creep' effectively.
