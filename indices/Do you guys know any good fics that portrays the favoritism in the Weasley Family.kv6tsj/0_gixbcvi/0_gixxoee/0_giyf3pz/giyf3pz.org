I sometimes think of them as people who are so bad at managing their own money. There are people like that in real life. They would scrimp on the daily necessities because they really are poor but would splurge on useless things whenever a huge amount of money came instead of saving it.

I also sometimes wonder if this was one of the factors that made Percy distance himself from the family after he got a better position in the Ministry. Maybe he wanted to change his outlook on life and money by hanging out with a different crowd. After all, this is something motivational speakers often talk about - to change your mindset, you have to change your environment. Too bad that it was a bad crowd that he got into.

Speaking of Percy, here's a story that somehow talks about the dynamics in the Weasley family. It involves next gen characters. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley]]
