No need to be so vitrolic against a genre you dislike reading about.

Anyways, I have three recommendations. None I have personally read, but they are in my friend's favorites and she /generally/ has a good taste in fics. I hope one of them suit your tastes.

Linkffn(5490079) and Linkffn(9527368) and Linkffn(4386931)

Edit: Not sure if the two Veela fics have Harry as part creature, but I figured they would be worth it to link anyways.
