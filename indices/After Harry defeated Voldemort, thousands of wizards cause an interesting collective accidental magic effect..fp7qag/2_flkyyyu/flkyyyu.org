This is mostly my head canon as well, but I believe determination causes closed loops, not emotion. It isn't emotional overload that causes Time Turners to work, it's the sheer determination to exploit causality to your own ends. Most people would probably be too afraid to risk causing an unstable paradox (cowards).

So because Harry is someone who was uniquely commited to stopping Voldemort with little concern for the consequences (consider Hermione's handwringing about rules or likelihood, or Ron leaving in year 7), he was the one prophicized. Which is one reason that I don't think Neville was ever really in the running for Boy Who Lived (the other reason being Voldemort's inability to value people who did not remind him of himself). And why I don't think a similar prophecy could have been made about Dumbledore; Dumbledore didn't shoot Voldemort when he waltzed into his office, while Harry would have.

How this squares at the end is a little more ambiguous. Harry doesn't hesitate to get himself killed at the end, but he doesn't ever try the Killing Curse, and tries to caution Voldemort to have some remorse. Perhaps the whole rising from the dead thing and dramatic speech was enough to shake Voldemort's confidence and so at the critical moment, Voldemort was sort of vacillating between killing Harry and fleeing.
