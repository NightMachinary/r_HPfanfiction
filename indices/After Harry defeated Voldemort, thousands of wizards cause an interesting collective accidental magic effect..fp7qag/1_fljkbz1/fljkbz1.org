As a thought; Voldemort set up a contingency plan in the event of all of his horcruxes being destroyed and his own demise, which would preserve the remains of his soul and send it back in time informed of future events (so he could hide his horcruxes better).\\
But, with this bizarre accidental charm in play created by the whole of magical Britain, Voldemort finds that no matter how successful his plans and schemes are, something will consistently spectacularly derail them at the very last second.
