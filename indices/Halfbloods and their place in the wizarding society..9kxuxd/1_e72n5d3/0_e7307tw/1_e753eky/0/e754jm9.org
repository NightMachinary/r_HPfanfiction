I definitely agree that he is not an idiot. He's intelligent, but still misguided, something that was pretty unavoidable after his upbringing, if you could even call it that. I think you're right that him seeing so many of his own characteristics in Snape, as well as the similar backgrounds they had, was a major contributing factor in his trust of the man. Another would have to be Snape's apparently magnificent skill in occlumency and his ability to project nothing but trust and loyalty towards Voldemort in a believable way. Still, he's so paranoid in other areas that I wonder whether Snape was manipulating him in some other sneaky, underhanded way to maintain that level of trust.
