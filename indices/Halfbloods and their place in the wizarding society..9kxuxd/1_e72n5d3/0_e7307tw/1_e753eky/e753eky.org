My suspicion is he probably saw a lot of his own traits in Snape and recognized them. As much as fanon likes to /claim/ he's an idiot and self absorbed lunatic he shows a pretty strong and cohesive level of self awareness and how people tick in the books.

Voldemort, Snape, and Harry all have relatively similar backgrounds and traits and he repeatedly sets his plans in action based on that.
