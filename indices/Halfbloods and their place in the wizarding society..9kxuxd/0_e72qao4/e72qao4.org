To be honest, though I am aware that JKR has said that half-bloods make up the majority of the wizarding population, I think this may be another example of JKR being not great with numbers.

In truth, the magical population should trend towards being pureblood, because even where a Muggle or Muggleborn marries into a magical family, while their kids will be considered half-blood, their grandkids will be pure-blood. So any "dilution" of blood is self-correcting within 2 generations. For a large part of the magical population to be half-blood, there would need to be many more magical-Muggle marriages or many more Muggleborns than we see in canon.
