In The Words Of Ginevra Molly Potter is a very good one. The books and movies are mentioned early on, then later on in the story too. Also JK Rowling is a character in the story. The story is basically Ginny's POV of the seven books, and a teensy bit afterward, with a very good ending.

There was also another one I read recently, but can't remember the title at all. It is about an OC character grew up in the muggle world not knowing she's a witch, however familiar with the world of Harry Potter as seen in the books. However the real wizarding world is a bit different from the one Rowling writes. The person is discovered by Harry and the characters who are trying to stop a threat in the Muggle world, I think.

Wish I could remember the title, it was a pretty good story.
