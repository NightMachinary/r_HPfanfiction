This isn't /quite/ the same thing, but your post made me think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4940094/1/Strawberry-Fields][Strawberry Fields by Minstrel Knight]]. "A hypothetical AU in which a most unlikely person removes a baby Harry from Privet Drive and leaves him with the Grangers, along with seven popular children's books. HarryGinny."

The books aren't published in universe, but they exist alongside the characters. The books were actually published in an alternate universe where they were pure fiction, then were brought to the universe of Harry Potter by The Doctor. The crossover-ness with Doctor Who is minimal to barely existent, though. (I've never seen Doctor Who and there was nothing off-putting or confusing.)
