- Remus would be under controlling spells too. I like the versions where remus is a successful PI and dumbledore oblivates him to ensure that the only one he can rely on is dumby.
- Purification ritual discovers Horcrux in lestrange vault, he gets to keep the vault per goblin policy.
- goblins have ritual to defeat all parts of TMR. (Besides wraith which survives because it's possessing stuff)
- he loves Paddy calling him cub/pup/kiddo even if he's 160000 years old he misses his only family
- alt sorting: becomes headmaster
- if sorted any house other than Slytherin Draco gets killed or something because for some reason 11 year old draco is jelly of his harem and does something creepy, but it's cool to kill him off at 11 because he is kind of a meanie
- if sorted in Slytherin Ron dies for a similar reason
- mandatory use of term "slimy snakes" and correction of texture of Snakes
- no fanfic is complete without the Gred and Forge "we're not worthy" /bows 100 times/ when meeting Marauders scene.
