I think that by the time the last three books were written, the films had changed Rons character irreparably, at least in the eyes of Movie fans, and probably to Rowling herself.

The locket affects the trio in different ways, specific to who they are and what they're faults are.

Ron, with his blood loss, and a lack of nutrition to make up for it (you would be complaint about food to if you had a life threating wound from splinching) wallowed in his self doubt and anger, until it exploded.

Hermione, still guilty for splinching Ron, was pushed into a cycle of incompetence, rereading the same books over and over again, and losing her ability to discern solutions from any of the text.

Harry, being the brooding, obsessive and paranoid guy he is, became obsessed with watching the map, and then paranoid about his friends talking amongst each other.

Eventually, Harry's Paranoia and Ron's self doubt comes to blows, Harry is the one who tells him to leave, the one who makes light of how hungry he is.

In the movie, Ron reminds Harry that his family is dead. In the books, he told Hermione that her parents were safe and away from all of this (which is an admitted shitty thing to say) before then Harry then brings up his family being dead.

The reason why Ron seems to be the only one who is acting poorly, is because the story is told from Harry's perspective, who is definitely being affected by the horcrux to make him see his friends that way.

Did anyone else notice how Harry and Hermione barely made a dent in the mission while the horcrux is with them, and when Ron comes back and destroys it, they actually make some progress?

There are only two things they manage to do in This period: a. They figure out that the sword can be used to destroy horcruxes (which isn't much considering the information was practically in their faces the entire time). b. They go to Godrics Hollow, which Hermione knew was a trap (but was too afraid of Harry, and forced into desperation by the horcrux to properly go against the plan), nearly getting killed by Nagini, and losing Harry's wand.

When Ron destroys the thing, all three are much more trusting of each other, and are a much more effective team because of it.

As for HBP, Ron may have acted like a little shit, but Hermione acted just as nastily. Unlike Ron however, she attacked him for being with another girl. Frankly, once one party engages in physical violence, any pretence of them being on the right is lost. Hermione almost blinded one of her best friends, and other than a few nasty jokes, he never retaliated or tried to harm her.

Meanwhile, Ron is villainised used for a few mean words and the giving her the cold shoulder, something Hermione did just as much as Ron throughout the book.
