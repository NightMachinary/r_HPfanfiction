I felt like DH Ron was getting more affected because of how huge his family is. Say what you want, but Ron was constantly around people. At home, it's the siblings and parents. At school it's shared rooms in the dorms. He never spends one moment where he's truly by himself.

Hermione is an only child. Harry, when at the Dursley's, spends hours in his room by himself. Both characters are used to solitude. You get a gregarious, fairly well cared for (poor as they were, I seriously doubt that Molly stinted anyone on food, or warmth, or creature comforts) and shove him out into the woods in relative isolation.

Harry never had that, and Hermione is able to compartmentalise to a scary degree. Because Harry can handle solitude, and lived most of his life with no comforts, he can cope. Hermione would have had a relatively comfortable upbringing (both parents are dentists), but she can be raging inside and still shunt that part of her brain to its own space while handling her shit.

Frankly, I'm surprised he held out as long as he did.
