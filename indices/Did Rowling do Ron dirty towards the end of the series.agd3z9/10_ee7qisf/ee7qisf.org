  Another thing I want to mention is Ron's behaviour in the tent. Now obviously a lot of it is caused by the locket, but Rowling could have done a better job at explaining why it affects him so much. A lot of people point out that he's more prone to the negativity that the horcrux feeds and he does say that himself. But for me, it didn't feel like a strong enough justification. And even in that chapter, he's pretty unpleasant before he even begins wearing it. Infinitely more so than either Harry and Hermione were.

Ron was more vulnerable to the locket than Harry and Hermione because he had been wounded. Hermione accidentally splinched him when escaping the Ministry, and Ron lost so much blood that he turned grey and lost consciousness. He was a 6 foot something teenager, who was already skinny, and now he was supposed to recover a huge blood loss while eating some soggy mushrooms? No wonder he was cranky, everyone would be in that situation. And on top of his injury, he was wearing the locket and worrying about his family. And I think it's important to remember that Ron never seemed to have thought about leaving before Harry yelled at him to leave /thrice./

  Half Blood Prince didn't help matters. The whole scenario of him being furious at Hermione for kissing Viktor makes sense from the perspective of how a teenager acts. But I think a lot of people didn't feel that he got enough of a comeuppance when it came to that drama. To my knowledge, he's never said to have apologised to Hermione about it. He might have done so off camera, but that's most likely not enough for the casual viewer.

I think Hermione lost any right to an apology for him being cold to her when she physically assaulted him (she sent birds to claw and peck at every piece of his skin they could reach... no wonder the movies changed the scene, it would be hard to feel sympathetic to Hermione after watching that) and ignored him for several months, they were both extremely childish, but at least Ron never attacked Hermione.

  Any thoughts on this? Should Rowling have given Ron more positive attention?

Yes, I think so. While I do think the movies and fanfiction have made people think book Ron was worse than he was, that doesn't mean he couldn't have had even more great moments. He does have many great moments in DH, but most of them are off-screen, overshadowed or blink-and-you-miss-it.
