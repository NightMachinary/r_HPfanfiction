I think Rowling should've gave Ron different attention rather than more positive attention honeslty. While I love Ron and I think hes a total bro, nothing he does feels like it would ever endear him to a girl like hermione without it being either just hermione's type or a pity date situation, which isnt doing ron justice honestly. At the same time though it's not like he doesnt get a happy ending. He ends up happily married with kids and a bright future ahead of him. But it feels off somehow. Feels like what should've happened is that instead of Ron and Hermione getting together being the happy end for both of them, why not have them both achieve their goals and mature be the happy end, itd be easy too. Instead of them getting together they become close friends and then eventually they help eachother out, hermione helps ron be a little more emotionally receptive and helps him overcome his inferiority issues, and in return when hermione ends up making a single relationship horribly complicated ron is there to aggressively simplify things (I'm thinking a cute scene where Ron just sets up a dinner date in like 3 seconds between hermione and the guy shes wanting to ask out and Hermione just sitting there dumbfounded cause that somehow never even occurred to her in the countless hours she spent trying to plan this) idk even if they do end up together have it be a little more natural, honestly the fact that Ron's only dating experience is lavender and hermione, couple with hermione only having experience with ron and maybe victor,(wish we knew a bit more about what happened with that lol) and it just feels like jumping the gun, and then getting shot with said gun.
