It's funny because if you look at Ron's feats in book seven alone, it's pretty crazy.

- Headshots a death-eater while on a broom
- comes up with the idea of using the fang
- leads the group in his return
- Disarms Bellatrix Lestrange
- Escapes from a group of five snatchers, even comes away with a second wand
- beats Greyback with only Neville
- breaks Voldemort's silencing charm
- destroys the locket
- Saves Harry
- makes a near perfect Pettigrew impression to keep Lucius from finding them

However, most of the moments lack the proper weight to really be memorable to his character. After all of that, the most memorable action by his character is him leaving. It just makes me shake my head.
