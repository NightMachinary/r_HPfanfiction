I agree with most of this except for the chess part. It's brought up a lot especially in FanFiction where Ron's ability in chess means he's a brilliant strategist in real life fights. Radio is in Witcher 3 says it perfectly I think. “They say it's the game of kings. That chess teaches one to think strategically. What a load of rubbish! Both sides have identical pieces, the rules stay invariably the same. How does this mirror real life?”
