I definitely think Rowling had plans for Ron's development at the start of the series and then wasn't really able to follow through with them. His ability to play chess isn't really mentioned ever again after PS, and in the earlier books he was the gateway of knowledge to the wizarding world. He got to do a bit of this in DH, but not enough.

The arc he has in PS is far more developed than in the rest of the series put together and it's such a shame because he has a lot of potential as a character. His maturity and growth was too rushed in DH, although I did like that there was a key turning point and that he and Harry were able to get everything out in the open.

I hate to say it because I love him, but Rowling should have followed through with her original plan and killed Arthur in OOTP. She chickened out because it would have changed Ron's character too much, but I think that would have been a great thing for his development. Take it from someone going through it right now, nothing matures you quicker than losing a parent.
