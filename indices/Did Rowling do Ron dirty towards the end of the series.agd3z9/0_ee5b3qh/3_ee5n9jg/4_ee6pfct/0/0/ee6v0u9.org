All wizards do things like that. Hagrid and the twins both use magic on Dudley (a muggle child) for the lulz. Yes, it is pretty messed up, but the whole system is messed up if you /really/ think about it. Even them obliviating the muggles is pretty unethical even if it is for a good reason. I think Rowling just intended it to be comedic and nothing more serious than that.
