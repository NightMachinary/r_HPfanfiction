  Wizards have a very different culture than we do applying muggle morality to a wizard situation is the wrong way to look at the situation.

So we should not condemn cultures if their habits are cleraly wrong? Magicals assaulting muggles is fine because it is part of their culture, so the death penality on homosexuality in the Islamic world is fine as well since stoning gays is part of their culture? Or where do you draw the line, and why exactly there? Mind manipulation is fine but a ban on homosexuality is not? How about FGM? A cultural tradition but also barbaric. How about arranged marriages?

And again, why do you draw the lines where you choose to?
