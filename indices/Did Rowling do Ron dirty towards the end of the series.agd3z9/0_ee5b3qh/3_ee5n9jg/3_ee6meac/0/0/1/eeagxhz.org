Why does consent matter here? I don't consider it a tragedy when I incidentally forget things without my consent. I agree that major mind restructuring would be bad, but Obliviation to make someone forget an hour or two seems basically fine, especially when done to help society as when done to protect the Statute.

All magic is deeply unsettling.

  You can live with fear, I think, Stan would have said if he could. Maybe not forever, but for a long, long time. It's offense you maybe can't live with, because it opens up a crack inside your thinking, and if you look down into it you see there are live things down there, and they have little yellow eyes that don't blink, and there's a stink down in that dark, and after awhile you think maybe there's a whole other universe down there, a universe where a square moon rises in the sky, and the stars laugh in cold voices, and some of the triangles have four sides, and some have five, and some of them have five raised to the fifth power of sides. In this universe there might grow roses which sing. Everything leads to everything, he would have told them if he could. Go to your church and listen to your stories about Jesus walking on the water, but if I saw a guy doing that I'd scream and scream and scream. Because it wouldn't look like a miracle to me. It would look like an offense.

But that's not an argument for not using it if it's real and you've got access to it. You have to work with tools that exist, even if they offend you.
