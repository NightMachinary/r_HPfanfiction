You can blame the wizards as a whole on that one. Even pro-muggle wizards use magic on muggles. (example: Dumbledore obviously using magic on that lady at the orphanage and then getting her drunk on purpose to find out more about Riddle)

I am sure Rowling herself intended it to be a joke, even though it has dark implications. The whole system of "obliviating the muggles" is actually darker than it is made out to be. Erasing someone's memories is unethical no matter the reason.
