  "I need to pass this test? No biggie, I'll just use magic on that Muggle" is something you would expect from the likes of Malfoy, not the good guy.

While I think the world of HP treats casual assault a little flippantly, I think we do have to consider this in the context of the series. The confundus charm was used numerous times throughout the series, most often on other wizards. Hermione used the same charm on McLaggen during Ron's quidditch try out.

That's not to say that what Ron did was /right/, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to say he did it out of some deep-seeded feeling of superiority over muggles. A bit of casual assault is just sort of par for the course in the wizarding world, even between each other.
