Huh that's not what I mean. Wizards have wands. A muggle is completely helpless against a wizard. He can't even call the aurors or go to St. Mungos to have himself checked for curses! He doesn't even know that Magic exists for God's sake... my wheelchair analogy was way too mild. At least the wheelchair guy knows what fists and feet are.
