  Wizards have wands. A muggle is completely helpless against a wizard.

This is irrelevant. Everyone is helpless against something done while they aren't looking. It's not like confundus is something you use in a duel. You use it when someone is least expecting it to confuse them.

All the firearms knowledge in the world won't stop you from being shot in the back. We wouldn't (or shouldn't) consider shooting someone who owns a gun to be more okay than shooting someone who doesn't; so why would casting a spell on someone without a wand be worse than the alternative?

The crux of the issue is that, in any sensible world, confunding someone would /always/ be viewed as very dark. It's akin to slipping drugs in someone's drink. It's an egregious personal violation that should land someone in jail. /But/, that's clearly not how it's regarded in the Harry Potter universe. It's taught in school, and treated like a harmless trick. Therefore, /within the context of the series/, what Ron did is viewable as harmless chicanery rather than as a sinister, dehumanizing act.
