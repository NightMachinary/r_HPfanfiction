  That's your opinion, and I would hope a fairly uncommon one. Just because someone could potentially shoot you back doesn't make shooting them any less wrong.

Stop twisting my words. They are both wrong, I made this very clear. One is just less wrong than the other. Like genociding 6 million Jews is a million times worse than shooting the unarmed guy in the back, you know? It's possible to have degrees of evil, they are all still evil.

  It is never explicitly stated that resisting it involves any magic whatsoever, or that muggles are incapable of resisting it
#+end_quote

So, it's also never explicitly stated that Muggles can't use legilimency. What kind of point are you trying to mind? It's very possible that you can't even begin to fight the imperius if you don't have magic, no matter whether you're the most highly leveled willpower person on the planet.

  If you don't care about how people in the book regard it, then we aren't even having the same conversation.
#+end_quote

Of course I care how they regard it. They think it's great fun. I judge them for their regard, because it's not fun, it's evil, they are wrong for thinking it's fun, and ron is an asshole for doing it too.
