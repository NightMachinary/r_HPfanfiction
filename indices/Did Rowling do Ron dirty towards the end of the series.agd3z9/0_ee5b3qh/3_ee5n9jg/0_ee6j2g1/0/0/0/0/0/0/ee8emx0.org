  shooting someone who's unarmed in the back is a million times more despicable and cowardly than shooting someone who's a master marksman and armed to the teeth.

That's your opinion, and I would hope a fairly uncommon one. Just because someone could potentially shoot you back doesn't make shooting them any less wrong.

  if you can fight the imperius magically you can bet your arse that you can fight a "weaker" spell like a confundus.
#+end_quote

This is fanon. Canonically, fighting off the imperius is only described as requiring exceptional willpower. It is never explicitly stated that resisting it involves any magic whatsoever, or that muggles are incapable of resisting it. So, unless you believe that muggles are inherently more weak-willed than wizards, this point is moot.

  Why do I care how fictional people regard it?
#+end_quote

Because the original post I responded to described Ron's use of it in a comparative sense; more a /Malfoy/ action than a /Hermione/ action, let's say. If you don't care about how people in the book regard it, then we aren't even having the same conversation.
