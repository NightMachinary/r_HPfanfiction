There really should have been more payoff for, or growth beyond, Ron's vision in the Mirror of Erised. That was quite clearly initially put in there as a foreshadow of Ron's arc but it never really came explicitly to fruition imo. Ron should either have come to be the centre of attention and appreciated it - showing maturity and success past initial adversity, come to be it and disliked it when it happened - showing growth and character development, or explicitly have come to move on from that dream to another dream. Instead it just feels like a dropped plot thread that may technically have been fulfilled (Quidditch, epilogue!marriage + being a businessman) but doesn't feel like it quite landed emotionally.
