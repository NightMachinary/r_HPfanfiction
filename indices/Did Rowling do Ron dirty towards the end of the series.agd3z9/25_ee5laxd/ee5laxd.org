Ok, so the whole let's send three teens into the wilds to find these trinkets is stupid anyway, but Ron actually getting invited is even more SOD breaking. Sure you can accept him back as a friend after the whole GOF mess, but he should have never been trusted with a secret that could win or lose the war. I suspect that Rowling forced him into that role to separate Harry and Hermione so she would get her OBHWF. It isn't that she did him dirty, its that he shouldn't have been there.
