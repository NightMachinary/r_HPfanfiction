Ron was fine. I personally enjoyed his character in all of the books.

Yes, he was flawed, but you know what? Flawed characters are more interesting. If we didn't have flawed characters then we would likely not have a plot at all. Ron's mini arc in DHs is actually my favorite part of the book and I loved the moment where he destroyed the locket.

Having chess skills doesn't necessarily mean that you're a brilliant strategist despite the stereotype. Playing a game is simply different than being in a stressful situation in real life. That being said, I do think that Ron was pretty smart, he was just not an intellectual. For some people being intelligent is synonymous with being an intellectual, I actually find that this is not necessarily true. There are many people who are quite smart, without caring about intellectual pursuits.

I don't think Rowling did Ron dirty by not showing him as some brilliant strategist. I think Ron was quite smart as he was. The "Ron is dumb" meme mostly comes from fanfiction.

The real reason why Ron is hated is that people don't have patience for characters that show too much weakness, no matter how "realistic" it might be. Harry is also hated for showing weakness in OoTP even though he was just a teenager in an impossible situation. Fanfiction is full of Gary Stus or at least "borderline" Gary Stus who act nothing like the teenagers that these characters are supposed to be. There are fanfics out there where Harry acts more like a 40 years old aristocrat than a teenager. In this environment is it really a surprise that Ron gets bashed a lot? Ron is the archetype of the flawed and immature teenager, of course he has no place in fanfiction.
