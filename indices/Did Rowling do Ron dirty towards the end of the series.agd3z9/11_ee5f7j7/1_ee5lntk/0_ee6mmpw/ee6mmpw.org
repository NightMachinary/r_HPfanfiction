It depends, there are people who obviously hate when a character shows too much weakness. (usually those prefer Gary Stu, powerful!Harry fics)

Then there are those who like hurt/comfort fics but only if a character reacts in a way they see as "appropriate". Reacting with anger is usually less tolerated , probably because it's considered a "masculine" emotion and most of the fans seems to be women.
