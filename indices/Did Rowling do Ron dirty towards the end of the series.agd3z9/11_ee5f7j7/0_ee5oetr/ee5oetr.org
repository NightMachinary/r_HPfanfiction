  Ron is the archetype of the flawed and immature teenager
#+end_quote

more specifically, he's an archetype of a flawed and immature /male/ teenager. he's casually sexist, his slobbishness is exaggerated, he slacks off at school, etc. i've seen a lot of women that dislike ron & [[/r/hr][r/hr]] project onto hermione who disdain him. he doesn't have a lot of the hooks other hermione 'ships use e.g. he isn't rich, pretty and 'troubled' like draco, he isn't the male lead/hero like harry, he isn't a genius like snape, or a nightmare dressed like a daydream like riddle
