I personally think that he is no more "sexist" than the average teenager in the 90s was. Seriously, if you take Ron and put him between regular teenagers, he's not bad at all. He would actually shine as a beacon of light and moral integrity if he was real because he risked his life at a young age. He probably looks bad because he's compared to extraordinary characters like Hermione and Harry.
