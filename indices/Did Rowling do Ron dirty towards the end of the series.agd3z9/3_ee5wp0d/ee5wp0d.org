I feel like the only character who didn't get done a little dirty in some way toward the end was Neville.

Harry went from being an academically okay but magically powerful wizard (being able to conjure a corporeal patronus strong enough to dispel a 100 dementors as a teenager c'mon) to being mediocre and reliant on luck and deus ex machina.

​

Hermione got nigh character assassinated in HBP and acted totally irrationally and behaved in almost total contrast to how she was in previous books.

​

Ron went from the funny bro to the guy who comes close to being a fair-weathered friend and frankly something of a misogynistic child in HBP (I don't throw the term around lightly)

​

Dumbledore goes from being the occasionally funny but ultimately wise and benevolent headmaster to the guy who manipulated most of Harry's life and, despite his intentions, negligent in the care of someone he considered vital to Voldemort's downfall (abandoning him to a home he knew to be abusive right after he had been tortured, watched a friend get murdered and forced to witness his greatest enemy become revived with his own blood at the end of GoF not to mention basically all of OotP)

​

Ginny went from being a background character with potential to be more once she got over her crush to Mary Sue and basically Harry's clone in the effort to make her the perfect soulmate for him according to Rowling

​

Snape in a way was actually done the opposite of dirty (Cleaned? Seems paradoxical for him.) when his past and his relationship with Lily was revealed but at the same time it soured things in a way since now everyone likes to preach about what a hero he was when he was an abuser of children who never got over his grudges as a schoolboy

There are others but you catch my drift.
