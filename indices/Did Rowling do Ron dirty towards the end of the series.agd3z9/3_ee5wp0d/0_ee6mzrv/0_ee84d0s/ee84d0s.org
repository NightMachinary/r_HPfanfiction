  Hermione got character assassinated in HBP? I don't see it. Sure, she was a bit jealous of Harry's success, but she ended up being at least partially right about the HBP book, didn't she?

Of course she was partially right. Still, she acted completely irrationally about it for no reason. It would have been reasonable to help Harry research the spells and try them out safely. It would have been reasonable to actually want the book for herself, because Hermione is all about secret knowledge from books. All kinds of things would have been reasonable, nothing about her behaviour is.

She doesn't believe Harry that there might be something up with Draco *fucking* Malfoy. How does that make any kind of sense? She punched the dude. She came up with the idea to brew Polyjuice. She has just as much reason to hate Malfoy as Harry. It makes no sense to suddenly give Draco the benefit of the doubt over her best friend. Even if she doubts Harry's hunch, why would she so completely reject him?! This girl went with him to the Ministry, knowing that it was most likely a trap! ... suddenly she can't even humor Harry about his misgivings in regards to Draco?

Oh and don't get me started with her ridiculous OOC behaviour in regards to Ron and McClaggen. It's completely ridiculous in every way. How can you say that she wasn't character assassinated in that book?!

Obviously she was written that way to isolate Harry (angst) and make the romance with Ginny more viable.
