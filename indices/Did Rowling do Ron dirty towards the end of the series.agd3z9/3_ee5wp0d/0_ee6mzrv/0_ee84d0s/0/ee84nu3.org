I think the point is that they didn't believe that Draco was a Death Eater specifically because recruiting a 16 years old was something atypical for Voldemort.

As about Hermione and the HBP book, I think she was written that way to make her look flawed as Rowling was probably worried that she had made Hermione way too perfect for a teenage girl.
