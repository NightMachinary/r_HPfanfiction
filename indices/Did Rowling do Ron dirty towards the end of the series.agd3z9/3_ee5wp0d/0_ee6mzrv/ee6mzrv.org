I am not sure I agree with your descriptions.

Harry relied on Deus Ex Machina since day one tbh. Realistically he should have never survived even Quirrell. It's not something that only happened later in the series.

Hermione got character assassinated in HBP? I don't see it. Sure, she was a bit jealous of Harry's success, but she ended up being at least partially right about the HBP book, didn't she? She also physically attacked Ron with birds but the text made her out to be justified, so I don't see how it's character assassination.

Ron was not a misogynist, maybe he was a bit sexist with his sister, but no more than most teenagers in the 90s were.

I agree about Dumbledore and Ginny.
