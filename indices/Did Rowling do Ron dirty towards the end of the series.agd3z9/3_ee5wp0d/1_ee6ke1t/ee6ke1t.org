I get what you mean; though I do Not feel like anything you describe is somehow unreasonable. Life has written more obscure and irrational stories. Except for Dumbledore and Snape all of your mentioned characters are developing themselves over the span of 7 years. Basically their whole Teenage years are for us to read.

Just looking at myself during that period of time Makes ne able to believe Rowling and the characters. I had a stable childhood and was Never touched by war murder or totalitarian regimes and I changed quite a bit. Looking at most of the HP characters it is actually amazing they turned out so well.
