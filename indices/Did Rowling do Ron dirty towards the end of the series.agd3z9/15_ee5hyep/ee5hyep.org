Of course she did. I've previously wrote a long comment about how there could have easily been a way to write a sort of 'enlightenment' of Ron from the petty asshole he is in GoF. Having him, in DH, completely flounder and defeated by his own character flaws *again*, so close to the endgame, is a huge mistake and his pseudo redemption (apparently Dumbledore knew that he'd fail his friends eventually, how nice) doesn't work.

  There is the one scene where Ron comes up with the idea of using the basilisk fang to destroy the remaining horcruxes. But it felt like that was only thrown in there to make him winning Hermione over in the next page more plausible.

It was obviously a very desperate attempt by JKR to have him be useful. The idea that he could somehow learn Parseltongue by hearing Harry say 'open' once or twice years ago is on its face ridiculous and one aspect of canon I completely reject. Makes no sense. Everyone would try to learn Parseltongue and command snakes if it were that easy.

Ron's character arc should have been entirely different after the first task of the Triwizard but Rowling completely mucked it up. He's a bad character and now I have to dislike him.
