  though he defends a Hermione, it never seemed that he actually cared for her.

Really now? Because I remember him being pretty upset when Draco said in CoS that it's a shame that Hermione only got petrified and didn't die to the point where Harry and Dean had to stop him from beating up Draco. (page 284 in the Greek edition of the book, no clue about the British one) Why would he be so upset if he didn't care about Hermione at all?

  And if he was so good at strategies why did he not think of making friends in Slytherin, because openly hating someone is not strategic even small children know that.

Ron didn't openly hate Slytherins despite what fanfiction says. If anything Ron was /indifferent/ towards Slytherins except for Draco and his gang who went out of their way to bully him. Also, whitewashing Slytherins is a recent thing. It's obvious that originally Rowling just intended them to be the bad guys and nothing more.
