Ron is not "abusive" because he doesn't want to go to the ball with an ugly girl. That's just called being shallow, but tbh, most people would avoid dating someone they don't find at least a bit physically appealing.

Besides how is Ron abusive towards Hermione when he never called her personally ugly?
