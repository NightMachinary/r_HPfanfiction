I think you're being intentionally ridiculous and you know it. Saying that you don't want to date someone ugly is not abusive, if that was the case then everyone would be abusive one way or another.

Ron and Hermione were both often jerks to one another and it was never one sided, Hermione usually gave as good as she got. Hermione even physically assaulted him twice , something that Ron never did. The point is that both of these characters were like 14-16 years old when these things happened. I don't know about what kind of teenagehood you had but I personally find that the overwhelming majority of people have moments when they act like jerks in that age.
