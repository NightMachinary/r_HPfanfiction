  I don't know what teenagehood you had, I didn't have that many friends, but none of my friends would have told me that they would never date ugly trolls like me to my face.

Well, but Ron didn't say that, did he? You're just putting words in his mouth. He never said that Hermione is ugly.

Ron and Hermione were generally pretty good to each other despite their fights. They would probably die for each other, like they would die for Harry. I am personally not confident that my own friends would /die/ for me, but maybe you're one of the lucky ones and can say that you have better friends than Ron.

The point is that saying that Ron wasn't generally good to them is ridiculous. Yes, he had his moments but he was also ready to sacrifice himself for his friends. If Ron was a jerk to Hermione, then so was she as I have pointed out with various examples.
