  The idea that insecure Ron, who's desperately afraid to be over-shadowed by others, would tolerate her becoming Minister for Magic while he tends to a Joke shop is ridiculous.

Honestly, he probably just got over his insecurities eventually. Besides, at least Ron decided to take a less demanding job for the good of the family. Harry and Hermione on the other hand were both careerists. Would they even have time for each other at all with her being the minister of Magic and him being the Head Auror? And who would look after their kids? Uncle Ron?
