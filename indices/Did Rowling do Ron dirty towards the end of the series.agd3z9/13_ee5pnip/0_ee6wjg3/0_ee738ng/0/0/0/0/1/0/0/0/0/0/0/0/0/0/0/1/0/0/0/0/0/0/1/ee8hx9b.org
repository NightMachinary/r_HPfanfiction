  I have my own headcanon too. However, I recognize that my own headcanon is not the actual canon.

Sure. I'm not delusional. I know that Ron is supposed to be a great friend and that he was happily married to Hermione. I didn't think that needed to be established. When I'm analyzing the literature like that I'm doing a kind of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author][Death of the Author"]] type of analysis and ignore any authorial intent and take the scenes as they are written without preconceived notions about "this is supposed to be a good guy, so I'm going to ignore all the iffy stuff he does". Of course if you axiomatically assume that Ron is nice and good, because that's what Rowling intended we have nothing to argue about. I'm arguing that she failed to realize her authorial intent on paper successfully (but enough of it is there that we know what she was going for). Obviously she was also trying to write convincing romances between the main characters. She disastrously failed at that too.

  If anything, I would argue that it's the opposite. Hermione is almost superhuman compared to how most actual teenage girls are.

Right, she is. But we have established this for *five* previous books. You can't just give her [[http://superman.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Kryptonite][Green Kryptonite]] and have her lose her superpowers for a book because you want there to be more drama and angst. That's bad writing (honestly, that's almost fanfiction levels of bad writing). Especially if you immediately return all her superpowers in the subsequent book. It also makes no sense and gives me an easy out to disregard parts of canon that I don't like.

Ron is the opposite: He's completely average, boring and uninteresting, but he gets some super-juice occasionally so that he has a reason to be in the story.
