  He totally couldn't have. Two of his direct family members work for the ministry. His family is prominently known as "blood traitors". There's no wait out for him, unless they all agree to pack everything up and run out of the country... and Molly is never going to agree to that so it's a moot point.

Nope. He easily could have. The fact that they didn't outright execute his whole family when they invaded at Bill's and Fleur's wedding despite them being known blood traitors and Harry's allies proves that they weren't willing to touch purebloods unless absolutely necessary. Another example is how they didn't go after Neville and his grandmother until /much/ later even though they were known as Harry's allies. They only really persecuted purebloods when they actively resisted them. Ron could have easily hidden behind his pureblood status if he really wanted to.

Anyway, Ron was not abusive because he said something insensitive at the age of 14. Lol. If that was the case, then almost everyone would be abusive one way or another. It's your right however to believe whatever you want.
