  Ron is a great friend , that is based on facts.
#+end_quote

I mean, that's just your opinion. I interpret the same facts differently.

#+begin_quote
  He has been following Harry on dangerous missions since he was only 11 years old, surely that has to count for something
#+end_quote

Sure. It shows that Ron is very brave and a glory hound. He'd also have followed Seamus Finnigan into battle and if Neville had been the boy who lived Ron would've been best friends with Neville.

  They often risked their lives over merely having a hunch without even having a real plan
#+end_quote

We've been through this. There's plenty of reasons to risk your life for Harry without being a good and loyal friend, especially for Ron, who desires recognition.

Again, even Dumbledore who has no respect for Harry as a person and literally raised a child for slaughter would have died for Harry. It's really not a super-duper good argument for a great friendship in this scenario. Unless you want to claim that Harry and Dumbledore were great friends as well?

  What more do you want them to do to prove that they're loyal to each other?
#+end_quote

Reconicile how Ron secretly despising Harry for his "wealth" and "fame" makes him loyal. Also the abandonment. Oh, also the No. 1 concern of this loyal friend is that the friend doesn't hook up with the girl Ron is interested in, almost on the edge of killing said friend for a petty reason like that. Such loyal! I mean, I don't really understand this... Rowling went out of her way to write scenes where Ron is completely disloyal in two different stages of his life and people turn around and go "oh he's so loyal". I don't understand this definition of loyal. Apparently anyone is loyal as long as they don't outright kill you.

  A bad friend would have not followed Harry anywhere and nobody would have even blamed him for it.
#+end_quote

If Harry were a random nobody Ron wouldn't even be his friend. He definitely wouldn't die for Harry.
