Do you think that the books themselves are not valid as canon? I disagree. Whether we like it or not, it's how the characters are written. I'm totally with you if you want to argue that the Cursed Child and a lot of Pottermore nosnense shouldn't count as canon though.

Anyway, when it comes to Hermione and Malfoy, she never said that he's a "good guy". She only said that it's unlikely that he's a Death Eater specifically because it would be atypical for Voldemort to recruit a 16 years old.

I think you probably put Hermione on a pedestal if you think it's so unlike her to go out with a jerk like McLaggen out of spite. Hermione is still just a teenage girl after all. From my understanding, you're male yourself and men tend to put certain females on a pedestal for various reasons, but it's the wrong approach. I say it in a friendly way, but you will be in trouble if you expect women to act like saints.
