  Ron later asked Hermione to go to the ball with him proving that he did not find her ugly. If Ron had called Hermione ugly to her face, then I would agree with you but he obviously did not.

That's complete bs and you know. She was a last resort. He actually found her so unattractive that he didn't even realize she's a girl until late.

  If you want to go that far, well , Ron himself was "insecure" about his skills as a Keeper and Hermione in HBP implied that Ron was a bad Keeper when she was trying to get revenge on Ron. (when she said that she only dates "good Quidditch players" before going to the party with McLaggen) Does that make Hermione "abusive for playing with Ron's insecurities? Obviously not.

Sure, fits perfectly well into the pattern of an abusive relationship. I agree 100%. The victim will sometimes retaliate and continue the pattern of abuse.
