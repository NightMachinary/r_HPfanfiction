  Harry and Hermione on the other hand were both careerists.

How is Harry a careerist? I can totally see him being happy as a modern house man. He has no interest in being in the spotlight.

  him being the Head Auror

Harry becoming an Auror, the dude who got shafted by the ministry many many times and distrusts corrupt politicians all the time is another ridiculous idea from the epilogue. Harry would be fired for questioning orders one week into the job. Makes just as little sense as Hermione marrying Ron.
