Just as a side-note: I think I have a pretty decent idea how the whole Ron & Hermione thing might have been salvaged in DH (though a "real" fix probably requires a complete rewrite of HBP and DH):

In the tent it should have been Hermione who had the freak-out. She never showed weakness, but now she has all kinds of reasons to lose hope: She just gave up her parents, has all the pressure on her, does all the magical shit that they need to survive in the wild and they are making *zero* progress. Everyone is relying on her! Imagine the burden! Of course the Horcrux affects her the most!

So, Hermione has some kind of serious break down, is threatening to run away, kill herself, whatever. Ron is the rock. He calms her down... relates to her how he sometimes feels hopeless too, how difficult it can be to be Harry's friend and how it's okay to sometimes fail (because... he failed Harry himself before). They have a heart to heart and Hermione finds new strength in *not being perfect all the time, because Ron is not perfect all the time, but he's perfect for her in this moment*. Something like that. BAM! Ron looks great, Hermione looks human and less of a super-girl... everyone gets character development and it makes total sense for them to end up together.

Instead we get this shit with Ron abandoning his friends while they are all on their own. What a fucking shame.
