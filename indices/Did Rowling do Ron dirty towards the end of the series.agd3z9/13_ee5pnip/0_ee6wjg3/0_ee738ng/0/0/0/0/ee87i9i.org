Ron later asked Hermione to go to the ball with him proving that he did not find her ugly. If Ron had called Hermione ugly to her face, then I would agree with you but he obviously did not.

Most people would want to avoid going to the ball with someone they find ugly, Ron is just honest about it. Is he crude? Yea, possibly. But that's hardly "abusive".

If you want to go that far, well , Ron himself was "insecure" about his skills as a Keeper and Hermione in HBP implied that Ron was a bad Keeper when she was trying to get revenge on Ron. (when she said that she only dates "good Quidditch players" before going to the party with McLaggen) Does that make Hermione "abusive" for playing with Ron's insecurities? Obviously not.
