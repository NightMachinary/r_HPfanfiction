  Do you think that the books themselves are not valid as canon? I disagree. Whether we like it or not, it's how the characters are written.

This is difficult to put into the right terms, but an interesting question: I think there are severe inconsistencies in the books that put the whole thing into question. Let's imagine a little story (I'm making this up as I go along).

"There once was a little man. One morning the little man left his house and fell into a well while the moon was shining in the sky. The man died. Three years later he married his high-school sweetheart and got crowned king of the country. The end."

(of course this is highly exaggerated and the HP story is not as inconsistent as that)

If I asked you now: Do you think, that canonically the little man became king at the end of the story, what would you say? Yes of course, because that's what was written, but how can he be king when he died? Also the story says that he went outside in the morning, yet the moon was shining. Something is amiss.

The best way I can say it: In my "headcanon" I disregard plenty of things from the books, because they make either none or very little sense (the epilogue, large parts of HBP). So what I'm left with is that the epilogue (or other parts that I take objection with) is "wrong"/"false"/"error", whatever that means.

  Hermione is still just a teenage girl after all
#+end_quote

Sure. That wasn't such a bad idea to humanize Hermione in that regard. JKR went way overboard. Even if Hermione is going through a difficult hormonal phase she's still a rational person and would notice that she's acting nothing like herself for months on end. Like, even just one of those Hermione subplots would have been more than enough, not all of that shit. The only way I could accept those is actual potion dosing, Malfoy imperius/confundous or an actual psychotic break with personality disassociation.

  I say it in a friendly way, but you will be in trouble if you expect women to act like saints.

I know what you mean, but don't worry for me. That's absolutely not what I believe.
