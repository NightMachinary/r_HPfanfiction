Hey, I'm sorry, this discussion has been going on quite a while, you may be getting confused: We are actually discussing the validity/sense-making of canon in this debate! :) I'm actually aware, for example, that canonically Ron and Hermione ended up together and didn't actually have an abusive relationship.
