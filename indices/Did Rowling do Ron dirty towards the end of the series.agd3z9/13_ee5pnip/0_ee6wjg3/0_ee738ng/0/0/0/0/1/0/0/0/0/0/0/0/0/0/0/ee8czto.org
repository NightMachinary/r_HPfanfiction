  They only really persecuted purebloods when they actively resisted them. Ron could have easily hidden behind his pureblood status if he really wanted to.

How... his parents are actual members of the order of the phoenix, they aren't just going to 'lay low'?! This is only a valid scenario if he imperiuses at least two members of his family. Besides that it's a complete impossible fantasy.

  Anyway, Ron was not abusive because he said something insensitive at the age of 14. Lol.

Why are you so hyper focused on this one scene? There's plenty more like that, like him expecting her - like his property - to leave behind their best friend in the tent so that Harry can get himself killed alone. If she had gone along, Hermione probably would have blamed herself all her life and eventually commit suicide, but many roads with Ron probably lead to that destination for her if you look at it honestly. The idea that insecure Ron, who's desperately afraid to be over-shadowed by others, would tolerate her becoming Minister for Magic while he tends to a Joke shop is ridiculous.
