  b) a pureblood and he could have easily hidden and not fight in the war at all,

He totally couldn't have. Two of his direct family members work for the ministry. His family is prominently known as "blood traitors". There's no wait out for him, unless they all agree to pack everything up and run out of the country... and Molly is never going to agree to that so it's a moot point.

  Do you think that Hermione would have ended up with him if things were so bad all the time?

Yeah sure, people end up in abusive relationships *every day*. None of them do it knowingly. Saying "well she didn't think it was abusive, therefore it won't be" is like, really dumb. Sorry.

  Hermione was neither dumb nor desperate.

post OotP Hermione was pretty lobotomized, remember, this is the girl who actually thought that Draco was a good guy or something and went on a date with a jerk like McLaggen (thanks for bringing him up). Her judgment is clearly compromised. All of this fits pretty well.

  The fact that she ended up with Ron shows that she obviously saw good things in him.

She also saw good things in Draco, a *literal* Death Eater who was actively trying to murder people in the school while she defends him.
