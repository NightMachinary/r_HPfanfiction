  The "crime" is that Lavender clearly wants more from their relationship than Ron but he keeps it going in order to snog her (or possibly more).
#+end_quote

Those are just assumptions. We don't know what Ron knew about her feelings at all or if she ever made her feelings clear.

  And it is also pretty clear that he started the whole thing either to one-up Hermione after being snarky about Krum for almost two years or take advantage of Lavender's crush on him
#+end_quote

Partially. But it was more like Lavender threw herself at him and who was he to say no.

#+begin_quote
  If Ron was genuine in his affection towards Lavender or if he broke things off as soon as the divide between their expectations became obvious, we would not be having this discussion.
#+end_quote

Well, he said that he did want to break off but it was hard for him and that was why he was /avoiding/ her. Obnoxious? Sure. But that's more him being inexperienced instead of him being malicious.

You're honestly making Ron sound as if he was some machiavellian womanizer or something when we both know that the guy could barely recognize basic social cues. How do you expect someone like that to read Lavender's mind and know about her feelings? He was probably oblivious the whole time both about her feelings and his own.
