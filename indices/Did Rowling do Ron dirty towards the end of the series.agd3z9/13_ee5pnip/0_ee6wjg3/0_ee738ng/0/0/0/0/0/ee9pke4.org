She merely retaliated for the Lavender thing, a fling with no deeper meaning to Ron, who keeps it going by abusing Lavender's feelings for him despite not returning them. He basically does that to either

1) Get his dick wet while ignoring her feelings

2) To one up Hermione while completely ignoring Lavender's feelings.

Perhaps Deathcrow takes this argument a little too far, but Ron is definitely a dick when it comes to his treatment of women. Deathcrow he has another point. Ron only asks Hermione as a last resort and then does not want to believe that anyone would have asked her. That is not a sign of considering your date attractive.
