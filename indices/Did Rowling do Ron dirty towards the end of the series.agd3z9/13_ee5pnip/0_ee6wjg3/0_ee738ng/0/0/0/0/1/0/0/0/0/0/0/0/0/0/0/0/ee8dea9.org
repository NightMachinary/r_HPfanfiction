  How... his parents are actual members of the order of the phoenix, they aren't just going to 'lay low'?! This is only a valid scenario if he imperiuses at least two members of his family. Besides that it's a complete impossible fantasy.

Exactly. They were known members of the Order Of the Phoenix and Ron was known as Harry's best friend yet they did /nothing/ to them. That shows that they were really desperate when it came to purebloods. They wouldn't attack purebloods unless they absolutely had no other choice. Even with Neville they did nothing to him until he started actively resisting the Carrows.

If Ron really wanted to, he could lay low and they would do nothing to him.
