  I know that Ron is supposed to be a great friend and that he was happily married to Hermione.

Ron /is/ a great friend , that is based on facts.

He has been following Harry on dangerous missions since he was only 11 years old, surely that has to count for something. They often risked their lives over merely having a /hunch/ without even having a real plan. What more do you want them to do to prove that they're loyal to each other?

Sorry, but I personally doubt that my friends would be ready to die for me and I hardly think that's a typical requirement that people have of their friends. So yea, Ron was a pretty good friend. A bad friend would have not followed Harry anywhere and nobody would have even blamed him for it.
