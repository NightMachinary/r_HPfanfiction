  If Ron was a jerk to Hermione, then so was she as I have pointed out with various examples.
#+end_quote

Why do you continue to bring that up? I totally agree with you!

#+begin_quote
  Well, but Ron didn't say that, did he? You're just putting words in his mouth. He never said that Hermione is ugly.
#+end_quote

I've tried to rephrase that after I posted it. If you've seen my edit already: How are you still not getting it?

#+begin_quote
  The point is that saying that Ron wasn't generally good to them is ridiculous
#+end_quote

This isn't a discussion about utility.

  They would probably die for each other, like they would die for Harry.
#+end_quote

Dying for someone, especially when a war is going on is probably pretty easy. Living with each other is hard.

Not to mention that we have actual people who would have died for Harry, like Dumbledore or Snape, who are still 'bad' for Harry.

  I am personally not confident that my own friends would die for me
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure they would if you were some kind of prophecy child and their only hope to save their family and friends - no matter how good or terrible your friendships are. Dying for Harry is really not all that hard.
