  I don't know about what kind of teenagehood you had but I personally find that the overwhelming majority of people have moments when they act like jerks in that age.

I don't know what teenagehood you had, I didn't have that many friends, but none of my friends would have told me that they would never date ugly trolls like me to my face. It's like having an autistic friend and saying about another autist: "Who would want to date a stupid retard like that?" How can you not see that?

And yeah, me and my friends usually treated each other nicely. People who didn't weren't my friends, just acquaintances, like Ron would be for me if he ever said something like that. Those were the bullies and the assholes.

In my experience it's pretty typical for teenage development that you learn you don't have to be friends with people who put you down. Sadly poor Harry and Hermione don't know any better for a lack of other friends.
