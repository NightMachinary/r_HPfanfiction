  The best way I can say it: In my "headcanon" I disregard plenty of things from the books, because they make either none or very little sense (the epilogue, large parts of HBP). So what I'm left with is that the epilogue (or other parts that I take objection with) is "wrong"/"false"/"error", whatever that means.

Well, I see what you mean. I have my own headcanon too. However, I recognize that my own headcanon is not the actual canon.

Here's the thing, the HP books themselves are not terribly inconsistent. There are some small inconsistencies but not to the point where they are /unbelievable./ Most of the things that do happen are at least within the realm of possibility.

The reason why I don't accept Cursed Child as canon is specifically because a lot of the things that happen there are completely unbelievable based on what we know from the original books.

  Sure. That wasn't such a bad idea to humanize Hermione in that regard. JKR went way overboard. Even if she's going through a difficult hormonal phase she's still a rational person and would notice that she's acting nothing like herself for months on end. Like, even just one of those Hermione subplots would have been more than enough, not all of that shit. The only way I could accept those is actual potion dosing, Malfoy imperius/confundous or an actual psychotic break with personality disassociation.

If anything, I would argue that it's the opposite. Hermione is almost /superhuman/ compared to how most actual teenage girls are. Most teenage girls are neither the "brightest of their age", nor do they continually figure out things before adults do. And of course realistically it's unbelievable that an average looking 14 years old girl managed to attract an 18 years old intentional sports star with dozens of fangirls. However, this is fiction and there's nothing wrong with Hermione being capable and smart. I am just saying.
