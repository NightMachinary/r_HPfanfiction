You do realize that people in abusive relationship rarely marry a guy that punches them in the face, right? It always starts like this... Of course that isn't positive proof that it would turn into any kind of physical violence, I'm not that paranoid. I'm just pointing out the pattern.

Most/all long term couples I've seen treat each other with respect and kindness though.
