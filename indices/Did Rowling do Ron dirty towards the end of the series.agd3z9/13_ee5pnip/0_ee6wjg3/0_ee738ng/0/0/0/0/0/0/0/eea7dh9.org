The point is not that Ron wants a casual fling. Hell, I'm all for such things in fiction because that's what teenagers do. The "crime" is that Lavender clearly wants more from their relationship than Ron but he keeps it going in order to snog her (or possibly more). And it is also pretty clear that he started the whole thing either to one-up Hermione after being snarky about Krum for almost two years or take advantage of Lavender's crush on him. If Ron was genuine in his affection towards Lavender or if he broke things off as soon as the divide between their expectations became obvious, we would not be having this discussion.
