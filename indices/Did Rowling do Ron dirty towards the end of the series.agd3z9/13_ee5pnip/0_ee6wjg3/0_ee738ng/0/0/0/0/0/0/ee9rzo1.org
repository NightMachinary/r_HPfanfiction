Okay, I deleted my previous comment to reply to this one based on the context.

Why is Ron wanting to have a casual fling such a crime? Does he live in Saudi Arabia? Did Ron ever promise Lavender anything? No. Are we supposed to persecute him for being promiscuous? Was he supposed to /marry/ her just because he dated her at 16?

Hermione intentionally hurting Ron's feelings and physically attacking him is arguably worse than Ron merely wanting to have a casual relationship with Lavender. Yea, maybe he did not handle it in the best way possible. But what Hermione did was way worse. She used McLaggen for purely manipulative purposes and she pretty much intentionally hurt Ron's feelings.

I truly don't understand the logic of some fans. Ron wanting to have a casual fling: capital crime. Hermione literally physically attacking someone with birds: perfectly okay.
