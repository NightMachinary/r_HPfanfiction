  Not to mention that we have actual people who would have died for Harry, like Dumbledore or Snape, who are still 'bad' for Harry.

Not even comparable. Snape didn't care about Harry , he had his own reasons and Dumbledore never had the luxury of choosing to not be involved in the war.

The point is that Ron was a) a teenager, b) a pureblood and he could have easily hidden and not fight in the war at all, yet he still risked his life and had been risking his life for his friends since the age of 11.

If you think that it's a typical requirement for your friends to be ready to die for you, then you must be lucky.

  Dying for someone, especially when a war is going on is probably pretty easy. Living with each other is hard.

The point is that these people were generally good to each other and that's why they were friends in the first place, how do you not get it? Their fights were mostly an exception to the rule. Do you think that Hermione would have ended up with him if things were so bad /all/ the time? Hermione was neither dumb nor desperate. The fact that she could casually find dates , like McLaggen proved that. The fact that she ended up with Ron shows that she obviously saw good things in him.
