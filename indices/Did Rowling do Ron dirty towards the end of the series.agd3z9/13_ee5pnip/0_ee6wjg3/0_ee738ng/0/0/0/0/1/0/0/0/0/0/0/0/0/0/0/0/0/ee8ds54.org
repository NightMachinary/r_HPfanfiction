  Exactly. They were known members of the Order Of the Phoenix and Ron was known as Harry's best friend yet they did nothing to them. That shows that they were really desperate when it came to purebloods. They wouldn't attack purebloods unless they absolutely had no other choice. Even with Neville they did nothing to him until he started actively resisting the Carrows.

  If Ron really wanted to, he could lay low and they would do nothing to him.

I totally don't follow. Are you saying all of the Weasleys are just going to lay low after Voldemort wins and stop their resistance? What about the creature Fleur and their bastard child? I thought I was the Weasley hater on this subreddit O_o
