  Why would he be so upset if he didn't care about Hermione at all?

Sure, and every one of those scenes gets made up for by scenes like this:

  “We should get a move on, you know ... ask someone. He's right. We don't want to end up with a pair of trolls.”

  Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.

  "A pair of ... what, excuse me?”

  “Well --- you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I'd rather go alone than with --- with Eloise Midgen, say.”

  “Her acne's loads better lately --- and she's really nice!”

  “Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.

  “Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you're going to take the best-looking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horrible?” “Er --- yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.

  “I'm going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls' staircase without another word.

The way Ron treats Hermione pretty clearly follows the pattern of a typical abusive relationship, like in this instance making her feel inferior for her imperfections.

  The danger grows, subtly, insidiously, through each successive image, but you'll also notice, if you look closely, moments of enormous tenderness and vulnerability between the man and woman. Those snapshots are poignant reminders of what abuse victims hold onto in staying with their abuser. They don't stay for the pain. Their desperate, often palpable hope, if you sit in the room with them, is that the abuse will go away. *And they tend to block out all evidence to the contrary. In point of fact, they stay for love. Many abuse survivors cling to the positive traits in their partners -- like being affectionate and reliable.*
