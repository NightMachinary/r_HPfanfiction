These are all 'if so' moments and moments where Ron already hates some people, though he defends a Hermione, it never seemed that he actually cared for her. It just shows that he took the advantage of that situation to remove his anger on the person(Snape and Malfoy). He is too childish a character for me to bear. About him supplying (?) happiness in Harry's and Hermione's life, it is never shown in the book though commented on. Boys want to have friends that are boys, and Ron was his only friend at that time, what would happen if Harry liked someone else too(ex.Cedric)? is the question. ......kill us.... This is said in the heat of the moment. In DH book he was more concerned about havig good food prepared by his mother than his life, though he was influenced by the horcrux still is this not childish .\\
He sees Harry in trouble everyyear and he still thinks Harry gets more out of it than he gets, he wants to be a hero so he has no problems in life but cannot understand that being a hero causes one of the worst headaches of life. And if he was so good at strategies why did he not think of making friends in Slytherin, because openly hating someone is not strategic even small children know that. Due to his hatred of Slytherin Harry couldn't make any friends in Slytherin bcz lets face it not all slytherins were bad....though Hagrid and Malfoy also contributed there too. In bk 2 he uses a broken wand ,though it was teachers work to handle it it was also his work to understand that broken wand means disaster (he lives in wiz world afterall) its like using a broken gun, everyone knows that its dangerous (remember the slug scene and Lockhart-oblivate scene) will any good parent allow his or her child to use such dangerous weapon, he didn't tell his mother due the fear of getting scolded. His jealously? Don't let me start about it....
