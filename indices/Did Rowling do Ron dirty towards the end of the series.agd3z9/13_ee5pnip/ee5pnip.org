I think there's plenty of justification for Ron's actions in the tent, even without invoking the influence of the Horcrux. He was risking his life, and his family's lives, by going with Harry, and Harry really didn't have much of a plan, and honestly Harry was pretty dismissive about Ginny's safety - "they've faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!" is not terribly comforting, given that Harry and Ron both almost died in it in CoS.

Furthermore, JKR repeatedly makes it clear just how important Ron is in the trio, often by highlighting the effects of his absence. In GoF we get the line, "Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend," and in DH, Harry says, "After you left, she [Hermione] cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other."

Ron doesn't have the planning skills or extensive knowledge that Hermione does, but that's fine - Neither does Harry, after all. One of the things Ron does have is fierce loyalty to Harry and Hermione - he automatically agrees to be Harry's second in the duel and physically fights Malfoy during the Quidditch match, he curses Malfoy (or at least tries to) for calling Hermione a Mudblood, he talks back to Snape for calling Hermione a "know-it-all" (which earned him detention), he throws a crocodile heart at Malfoy for taunting Harry (costing Gryffindor 50 points), he put himself between Harry and Sirius even after he broke his leg saying â€œIf you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too," he draws his wand on Scrimgeour after he threatens Harry, he tries to volunteer to be tortured in place of Hermione at Malfoy Manor, he's the first person to break Voldemort's silencing charm, and honestly I could go on. For all the attention fandom pays to Ron leaving in GoF and DH, I think they forget that those moments are important precisely because they are so atypical for Ron.

TL;DR JKR gave Ron plenty of positive attention, it's just different than the positive attention she gave Harry and Hermione.
