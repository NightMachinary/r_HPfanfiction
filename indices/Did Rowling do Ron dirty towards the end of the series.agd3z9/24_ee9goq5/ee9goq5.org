I totally agree with Deathcrow on the matter of abusive relationship. In HP canon all three are insecure, but Ron had the best of them. He's a pureblood, has parents in wiz world has three brothers and a sister in school,two more outside giving him plenty of support he requires. We don't see any sibbling fights(elder ones) in the book. He keeps attachment with none of his brothers bcz they are successful and he's jealous of that, also keeps no significant knowledge with himself about wiz world. Whereas Hermione a 'mudblood' and without her parents support (except monetory, ) studied everything on wiz world, though we know her to be smart, all people wouldn't do that. Ron knew of Harry's homelife(when he rescued him from Dursleys) and still was jealous of him.
