Yes, I definitely believe she should have. I think Ron has a lot of potential as a character, particularly as a flawed one. Rowling could have done really well if she expanded upon Ron's chess skills / tactical skills, giving him a unique skill set while continuing to play on Ron's insecurities involving his family (peep what he sees in the Mirror of Erised). Ron's character arc could have included him finally coming to terms with himself and gaining self-confidence to be his own person.
