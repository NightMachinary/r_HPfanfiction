Also, the two moments where he really is shown to care about Hermione are

1. when Malfoy curses her in GoF and he puts away his spat for a minute. But that is completely ruined by his behaviour during the Yule Ball.

2. After nearly dying in HBP, but that one is also a dick move because he kept a thing going with Lavender without returning her feelings. I know she has a bad rep, but if he was annoyed by her behaviour he should have ended their relationship long ago.

And the Horcrux scene is really bad because instead of worrying about his family safety or the Magical Nazis carrying out a genocide, his biggest worry is that his best mate shagged the girl he liked. Talk about priorities. It should have been something like Molly's boggart, his whole family slaughtered, maybe Hermione and Ginny raped by Death Eaters, or even something about all three of them failing to stop Voldemort.
