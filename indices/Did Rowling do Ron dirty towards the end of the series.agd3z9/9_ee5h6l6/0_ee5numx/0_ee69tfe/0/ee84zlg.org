  but making Ron angry at Harry just might make him attack Harry with the deadly, basilisk-poisoned sword he's holding--which even Harry seemed worried he'd do for a moment.

Yeah but that's the point. The thing that is motivating him is his insecurity/fear about Harry & Hermione hooking up. As you said, the Horcrux is not a mindless boggart, it's picking the thing he's most insecure about. If he actually feared for his family or hermione dying more than anything else it would have shown him scenes of all of them dying in gruesome ways and then an evil voice yelling: "Kill Potter and your family and everyone you love will be spared!" or whatever.

What motivates Ron most to possibly betray his best friend is his irrational and insane jealousy over who gets to have the girl in the end, not his desire to protect or really anything wholesome. The Horcrux is either really stupid for picking something that is not the best suited to convert Ron or this is a condemnation of his character. I can see plenty of other potential "Horcrux visions" where - if Ron killed Harry - I'd say: "Well he's an evil git, but I get where he's coming from" (like trying to protect his family). But with the vision Ron saw, I don't see where he's coming from. He'd just be an evil git if he killed his friend for petty reasons like that. Nothing more nothing less.
