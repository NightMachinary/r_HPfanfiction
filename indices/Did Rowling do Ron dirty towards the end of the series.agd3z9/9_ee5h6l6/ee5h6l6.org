The thing with Ron is that he kinda falls flat on his face throughout the series with his jealous antics. He should have had a big redeeming moment at the end or he should have died in a dramatic fashion. Not that I hate Ron but his purpose throughout the story is sometimes a bit questionable (post Book 1). Having him contribute in a major way (not that he did nothing but in contrast to Harry/Hermione it feels lacking) or majorly impact the rest of the cast by dying would have massively helped his presence in the story.
