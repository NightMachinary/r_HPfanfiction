Yes, Ron should have gotten more positive attention. Best bet would have been for him to handle all the cooking, and adding more moments where he showed humor and ridiculous confidence, so that his departure really screwed with Harry & Hermione's mental states.

I balk at making him a strategic genius or anything, but he should have been the most loyal, steadfast, and reasonable one of them to create a better balance of virtues and faults between them.

It doesn't help that Steve Kloves made him into a buffoon whenever possible. Ron's better moments were in the third movie, but he was still being framed as the clueless one and his better moments from the book were given to Hermione (like facing down a mad killer who they thought wanted to kill his best friend).
