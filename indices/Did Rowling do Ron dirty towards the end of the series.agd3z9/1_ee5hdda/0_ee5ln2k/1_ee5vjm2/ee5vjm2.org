I think that the argument in GOF is pretty misunderstood, mainly because Hermione says Ron was jealous, and we all know the she couldn't possibly be wrong.

The way I read it, Ron had spent three years having Harry's back, and from his point of view, after going on every adventure and risking life and limb, Harry went and put his name in the goblet by himself.

Obviously Harry didn't do that, and it took less than two weeks for him to realise he was wrong, swallow his pride and apologise in public.

I think if Harry and Ron were both a bit less pissy the night the champions were announced, the argument wouldn't have happened at all. But they were fourteen-tear-old boys, so maturity isn't a default for them.
