Fair point, which is why I say he '/should have been/ the most loyal, steadfast, and reasonable'. That was one of the moments i despise from the novels, along with Ginny not following through on her mention of being possessed and the way she was dissed by everyone including Harry before the Battle of Hogwarts in book 7.

For Ron, I'll repost what I mentioned a while back:

  Ron the betrayer.

  I'll go one better: I wish that there had never been a canon instance of Ron turning his back on Harry. He stood by him to face giant fucking spiders and stood in front of him when he thought Sirius Black was going to kill Harry. It could have been a bromance of the ages, if Ron had been the one to stand up and say 'I believe Harry' when his name came out of the Tri-wizard Cup, and I think it would have been a better turn if Hermione was the one to get mind-bent by the horcrux enough to get separated from the trio in the last book.

  Could you imagine that? Dumbledore believes in Ron enough to give him a book of fairy tales but hands the light-stealing/giving device to Hermione, knowing that she will become frustrated or might be lost along the way and need to find Harry again. When she leaves, EVERYONE would think Harry and Ron are essentially screwed. Ron would agree to visiting Godric's Hollow because he understands how important family can be to a person.

  In her absence, the two men would fight but afterwards they would also confess their feelings for the girls in their lives. Ron would resolve to tell Hermione how he feels with Harry's encouragement... if they ever find her again. In the meantime, they'd listen close to Potterwatch in fear of hearing that she'd been captured.
