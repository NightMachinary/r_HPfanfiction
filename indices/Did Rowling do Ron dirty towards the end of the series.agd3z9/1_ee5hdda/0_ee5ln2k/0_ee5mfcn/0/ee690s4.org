As a Hermione fan, I can definitely see this story. If you go back to Book 3 starting with the Firebolt incident and project forward, it would definitely fit.

Book 4: I'm not sure Hermione would outright disbelieve Harry, and I don't think she would be jealous, but she would definitely be suspicious, constantly probing for holes in Harry's story and becoming preoccupied with how he got entered in general over actually helping him. Ron openly admits he is jealous and has a few surly moments, but his loyalty is stronger, and he still defends and tries to help Harry.

Book 5: Hermione goes behind Harry's back to tell McGonagall about the Black Quill. It probably wouldn't change much for better or worse, but Harry resents her for it, and Ron takes his side.

Book 6: actually, Hermione's characterization here feels just about right. Ron, however, believes Harry about Draco and thinks Hermione is being closed-minded. Ron is also portrayed more positively for (sort of) taking the same romantic advice Hermione gave Ginny.

Book 7: Hermione gets fed up faster than Ron about making no progress on the Horcruxes. Twisted by the locket, she accuses Harry and Ron of not really trying and leaves to try to do it on her own, only to get in way over her head and need weeks to find her way back to them.

The rest is pretty much as you described, although the reconciliation scene when she returns needs to have more impact. I think one of the reasons people hate Ron so much is that his reconciliation feels incomplete (despite saving Harry) because Harry lets him off the hook so easily for the things that caused him to leave in the first place.
