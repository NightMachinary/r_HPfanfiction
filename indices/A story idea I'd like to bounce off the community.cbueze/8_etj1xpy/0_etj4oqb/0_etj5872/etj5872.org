  But they all might have the scar, so idk if that would work on that route.

Maybe he toddles out of the closet Frank and Alice hid he and Neville in, trying to save Mommy and Daddy, and a Death Eater reflexively curses him, leaving a smudge or birthmark-style burn right over the scar? Or maybe the Longbottoms hid the scar on purpose with magic, so nobody would know that Neville's 'twin' was a Potter.
