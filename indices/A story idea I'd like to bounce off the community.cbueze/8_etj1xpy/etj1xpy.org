  I'm not sure about the sixth or seventh if there even is seven just yet, maybe Hagrid or dumbledore lost one? Or maybe Sirius was never caught and kept one with him?

Six goes to the Longbottoms, Bellatrix and company use him as a hostage to escape capture, he grows up on the run being bombarded by pureblood propaganda (as they believe him to be Neville, who had been much quieter and went unnoticed).

Seven is adopted by Crouch as a PR move, fast-tracking the paperwork without Dumbledore's knowledge. When Crouch, Jr. gets found out, he doubles down on raising Harry with zero pity for Dark wizards, though Madam Bones tries to be an ameliorating presence in his life when possible.
