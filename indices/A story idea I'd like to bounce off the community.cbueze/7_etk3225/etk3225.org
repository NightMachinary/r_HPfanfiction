I think this would be especially funny if Dumbledore wasn't the one who found them. I'm not sure how it would work, but maybe through accidental magic, the baby potters scatter themselves throughout the house. Maybe some of them hide under invisibility cloak. Every time someone comes into the house, they find a baby potter.

So there's the one Dumbledore finds, which goes to the Dursleys. Maybe butterfly affect means that Sirius comes a little later, and something convinces him to take the baby and hide (maybe the scar for this one is a bad omen in the Wizarding World, or the baby is injured somehow). Maybe the ministry has one. One gets found by the muggle Child services. Maybe McGonagall goes back after Privet Drive and finds another one, and thinks accidental magic brought the baby back somehow. Maybe the potter's house elf finds one and takes him to the Longbottoms. I could go on, but you get the gist.

Everyone disguises their Harry, either on purpose or accidentally until things come out. Bonus points if two of them interact before Hogwarts by accident.
