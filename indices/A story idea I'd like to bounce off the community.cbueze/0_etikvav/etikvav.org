Would all the Harrys have a scar? If so, perhaps you can give each Harry a different Voldemort trait. For example, one Harry is a parselmouth, one is a charismatic manipulator, one can control animals (like how Riddle made a rabbit hang itself), one is a legilimens, one can fly without brooms, etc.

  I'm not sure about the sixth or seventh if there even is seven just yet, maybe Hagrid or dumbledore lost one?

The Longbottoms would be a likely candidate. Both parents were aurors and members of the Order. Them being tortured into insanity could be avoided if they too go into hiding after getting a Harry.

To contrast with the Dursleys, a loving muggle family could find a Harry in the rubble (the charms on the Potters' home broke after their deaths) before Hagrid arrives.
