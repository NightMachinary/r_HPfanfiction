Maybe one of the Harry's could go with one of the teachers, flitwick or maybe snape. One could also end up with the longbottoms, or perhaps a darker family. You could also have them share dreams and be able to communicate during them. Just to help out Dursley Harry. Oh and a last thought, one of the Harry's could go to a non magical orphanage.
