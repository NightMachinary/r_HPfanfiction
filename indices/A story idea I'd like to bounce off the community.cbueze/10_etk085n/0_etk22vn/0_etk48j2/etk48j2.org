If you like the Blood Purist raised Harry idea, you could let it fall apart come Hogwarts and have that Harry be taken away and sent to live with the Weasleys and be unhappy about it. Or you could have the Lestranges approach Malfoy just before Hogwarts, having kept their Harry a secret till then and have him take in their Harry since he was officially pardoned. Have him do some political maneuvering to prevent the good guys from taking him back.
