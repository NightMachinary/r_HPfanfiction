First of all. Absolutely genius idea I think. Going off of the other comments, I would say that Crouch Harry would probably be the best for six, giving some interesting ripple effects on canon.

The Longbottoms would be interesting for the ripple effect of keeping them from insanity possibly, but doesnt make for a significantly different version of Harry from Andromeda Harry. I think either would work great though. (Side thought, I've read a number of fics where Harry's regrowing his hair was a sign of latent metamorphmagus abilities. You could have those abilities be something that needs encouragement at a young age to develop properly and only Andromedas Harry gets them)

I think the best bet for another unique perspective on Harry would be to have him grow up in the home of one of his muggleborn classmates. This would give another perspective on muggle raised Harry and give him a connection to another classmate that would be interesting to read. Easily justified as wanting to hide Harry somewhere completely out of the magical world for now and with no connections like the Dursleys, while still giving him some connection come Hogwarts time.
