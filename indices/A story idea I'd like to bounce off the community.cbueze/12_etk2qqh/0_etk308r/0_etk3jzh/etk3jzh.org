It depends on what genre you want to stick to, but having Dumbledore conduct a ritual or something to put them back together at age 11 (when magic matures, settles, whatever) would be great for a competent Harry without Dumbledore bashing. On the other hand, seven Harry's could be very comedic for Voldie. Also, there was a fic where the killing curse divides Harry into 14 and they all have to live with the Dursleys who struggle financially to feed them all and Dudley is super scared because they gang up on him if he tries to bully them.
