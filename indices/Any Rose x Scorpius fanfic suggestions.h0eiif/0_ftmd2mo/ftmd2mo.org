I really like linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) ... it is long, all seven years, but I still consider it one of the best next-generation stories at all. It is light on adventure, heavy on character development and it has a lot of other subplots. Also, Scorpius turns out to be eventually a musician, so there are some songs (from TRL) attached to it (don't worry, it is not a song fic).
