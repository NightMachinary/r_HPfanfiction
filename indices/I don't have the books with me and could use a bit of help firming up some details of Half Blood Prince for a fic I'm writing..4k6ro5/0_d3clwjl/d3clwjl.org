Nobody is using Grimmauld Place in this book bc Sirius is dead and they're afraid Bellatrix will be able to get in. Harry's picked up 'a mere fortnight' into the holidays, so in mid-July. They go to the Burrow, but there's not many Order members around - besides Tonks who's getting tea and sympathy from Molly. OotP is the yelling one - Harry knows all about the prophecy in HBP (and tells Hermione and Ron when he sees them in the summer) and the Order and everything.

Ginny is dating Dean Thomas right now and they'll be together until March or later (whenever Aragog dies) in canon, so no flirting, but she's pretty friendly with Harry. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione appear to be psychologically unscathed by the DoM ordeal - it's mostly Harry grieving for Sirius.

Dumbledore picked up Harry for security purposes; visiting Slughorn was the added bonus. It's still completely plausible for Dumbledore to get him via Side-Along. In DH the original plan was for Moody to Side-Along Harry, so that is also a feasible option. Really, any high up Order member could take him: Lupin, Shacklebolt, Tonks, etc.

Previously, hes travelled via broom (OotP-the Advance Guard), Floo (GoF with the weasleys), and Knight Bus (PoA). Side-Along is the most secure method, followed by Floo. Brooms are necessary if they need to avoid magic. Knight Bus is not a secure mode of transportation if they want to avoid DEs and people in general.

The kids spend the summer playing Quidditch and making fun of Bill and Fleur (who are also staying at the Burrow - actually I'm not 100% on if Bill is, but I know Ginny's got to share with Fleur). Fred and George have moved out already. Hope this helps!
