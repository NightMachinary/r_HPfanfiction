I strongly advice you to read the series again before you start writing. I'm sure you can get it second-hand for cheap. Your memory of canon is very faulty, which may lead to adoption of some very bad fanon. The current answers in this thread are faulty as well, btw.

Dumbledore picking Harry up was important for several reasons, mainly talking with the Dursleys and arranging things for the next summer, as well as discussing Sirius' will and summoning Kreacher, to check if it was safe to keep using Grimmauld. If you don't want to do this scene, just let some Order member side-along-apparate him.

Harry spent two summers in the Burrow and one summer in Grimmauld at this point. Dumbledore indicated that they will keep using Grimmauld as headquarters.

Christmas has some important interaction with Lupin.

Any particular reason you're not doing Slughorn?
