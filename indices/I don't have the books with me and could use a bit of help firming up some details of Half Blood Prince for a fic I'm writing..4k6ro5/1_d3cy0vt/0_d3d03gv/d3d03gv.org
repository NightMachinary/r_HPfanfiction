Yeah, I don't want to adopt bad fanon, it's truly been a while since I've read canon. I would say that this is especially true for OFTP and HBP since I've only reread them twice compared to the dozens of times for all the others. I could really use a reread on all of them to get the Weasley dynamic right among other things, reading fanfics just doesn't always cut it. I'll see how soon my sister will be coming over next and see if I can convince them to bring them over then, it's too tedious for me to do a 3 hour bus ride in total just for books and I don't currently got money to buy my own copy.

The reason why I'm ditching the Slughorn scene is that Harry is in such a state in my fic that it would be impossible for him to do a convincing job with Slughorn. Maybe I should just have Dumbledore pick him up, see the mess that he's in and do the testing for Grimmauld/Kreacher and just bring him over there? I kind of wanted Lupin to see him first and start their character development (which is going to be slightly different then canon, both a bit stronger and a bit more tense if that makes any sense) so maybe he'll enter the room first then they'll enter the living room with Dumbledore for a slightly rewritten version of the Dursley scene.

Anyway, thank you very much, your information is enough for at least a rough draft until I get the books again.
