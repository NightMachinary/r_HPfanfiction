1. Just portkey his ass, or side-along him. The Ministry is still operational, so magical transportation like a portkey is still viable.

2. None, really. Security reasons, but then again, whos gonna be a danger to Harry if he apparates?

3. Yes. Burrow the first time in the summer before second year. Grimmauld Place the first time before his fifth year.

4. Basically the entire Order when meetings were going on. If Harry saw them all, I don't know, but he got a plausible chance to have a good overlook over every member of the Order. I forgot who actually lived there besides the Weasley, Sirius, Harry and Hermione.

5. That was OotP.

6. Psychological effects for sure. Grief for Sirius, worry for Harry but not much more than that. Ron got these brain-scars thingies (how those looked, don't ask. That was a minor detail) and Hermione had to heal from a pretty bad cursing, but the books focus was completely on Harry's grief for Sirius.

7. Nope. She's together with Dean. Eternal love and everlasting bond between hearts kickstarts late in the schoolyear.

8. None that I remember to be overly important.
