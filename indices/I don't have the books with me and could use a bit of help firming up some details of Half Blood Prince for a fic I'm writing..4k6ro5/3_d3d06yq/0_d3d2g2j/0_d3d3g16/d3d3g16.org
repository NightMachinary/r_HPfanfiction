If you'd rather that Lupin and Harry bond ahead of time, I'd say have Harry contact him so that they can grieve together (and maybe not waste time at the Dursleys doing absolutely nothing). Lupin would be able to come visit Harry well ahead of Harry's Dumbledore-approved migration to the Burrow. They'd be able to work out the Grimmauld situation and Dumbeldore could still show up to side-along Harry to join his friends following a brief Dursley harassment.

I'm fairly certain Lupin can apparate with the best of them since he did come to fight in the Department of Mysteries battle. Whether Lupin side-apparates Harry a few times to prep him for the headmaster's visit is up to you.
