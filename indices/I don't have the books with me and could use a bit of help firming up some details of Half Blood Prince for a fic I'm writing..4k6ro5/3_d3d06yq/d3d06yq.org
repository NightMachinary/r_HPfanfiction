Dumbledore comes to 4 Privet Drive to retrieve Harry for a number of reasons. He takes time to chastise the Dursleys for doing much less than he expected of Harry's family, while assuring that Harry will still have a chance to stay there the following summer.

Dumbledore gets Harry to take command of Kreacher, thereby proving the security of Grimmauld Place as headquarters. Up until then the Order had been avoiding it. Even if you skip the Slughorn stop, Albus brings Harry to the Burrow via Apparation as a first demonstration of the process. This helps him by appearing informed when others get anxious about Apparation classes during the year, and emphasizes Harry's allegiance to Dumbledore, since the Headmaster personally handled this relatively small task for Harry. Albus also tells Harry that he should trust his friends with the Prophecy.

Most of these things wouldn't be accomplished by Lupin picking him up. Regardless, the Order is quite careful about letting anyone in the Ministry know of Harry's movements, so they wouldn't go with Harry being ferried in a flying Ford [2nd year], taking the Knight bus [3rd year], going by Floo [4th year], flying a broom [5th year] or using Muggle transit [6th year movie, though Harry only went a-flirting].
