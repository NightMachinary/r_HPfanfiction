Maybe. I certainly can't say no, it won't happen. I often end up surprising myself by writing a story and seeing the possibility for more stories based on the original story. I had no intention of writing more stories in the universe Lottie's found herself in when I began "Long Way From Home", but now that I'm getting near to the end of the story, I do have some ideas for a story for Ren that I might end up doing in the future.

All of that said, I do see Lottie as having led a fulfilling life (as short as it is) she loved, was loved, and leaves a meaningful imprint on the lives of so many.

I'm happy you've come to like her character as much as you have. She's a fun one.
