  Harry Potter was passionate about Quidditch. It was one of the few escapes he had; he found freedom in the air as he chased a small golden ball. Therefore, he wouldn't allow anything to tarnish the game. Not even one of his closest friends.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.
