Not the best, since Cauterize has already been linked and call me basic, but it's my favourite one-shot. Lady Altair does have lots of good one-shots (I like how she focuses on Hestia Jones, despite us knowing next to nothing about her), I guess her other one-shots are also well-written, such as linkffn(4182741) and not Harry Potter but an original work also by the same author, Yew and the Sea was lovely. Linkffn(3891375).

However, linkffn(3904401) was heartbreaking. Linkffn(3807997) was pretty good as well. This one's also good, linkffn(13323518).
