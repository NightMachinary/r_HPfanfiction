I don't think I have come across many fics that specifically focus on exploring how the wizarding world is as good as or better than the muggle world. What I've seen most is fics just mentioning little things, like abuse not really being a problem since magic equalizes things, or the comfort and ease of magic shops and stuff.

The story below is 'These Cuts I Have' by Melindaleo and it's sequel is now being written. It's one of those stories that starts right after the battle. Harry leaves his muggle past with the Dursleys behind. And as he now has to live on his own in the wizarding world and has always done stuff like cooking the muggle way, he learns some spells from Molly do to things the wizard way. Just little things like that. I don't think that's exactly what you're looking for, but it's what comes closest in what I've read.
