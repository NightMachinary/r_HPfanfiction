I remember reading a similar fic where Wizarding world had things like bathing in a water tornado, Auto-cleaning your butt when you're done with the loo, and spells that clean your clothes for you.

I lost it, unfortuantely, but it has influenced the way that I write about the wizarding world ever since.
