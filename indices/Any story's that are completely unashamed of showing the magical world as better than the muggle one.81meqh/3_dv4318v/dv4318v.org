You know, there was a fic a number of years back (say, 2008?) that would have been perfect for you. I don't remember much about the fic itself, but I do remember that it opened with a long descriptive passage ruminating on differences between the Muggle and magical worlds, and in particular different sanitary habits. In this fic Muggles literally smell bad to wizards who are used to magically clean environments and personal hygiene.
