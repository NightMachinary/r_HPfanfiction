Meh, it's no big one way or another, but I'm very happy that you shared your perspective, because it's getting me to think of the world in a different way that I hadn't previously considered, so I think that's pretty awesome! Seriously, thanks for the insight into where you were going, because I wanted to get that kind of discussion rolling, you know? Like, it's literally why I wanted to bring up the points that I did--even if I don't necessarily 100% agree with everything you say, I wanted to know what it is you say, because I think it adds a lot to the fandom to think these things through.

Long story longer, thanks for making this thread, and thanks for thoughtfully responding. :)
