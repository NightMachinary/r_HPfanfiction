What you've said is pretty subjective. Why mass produce clothes when you can repair the ones you have forever? Why use a ball point pen when you have selfinking quills or ones that can write for you. Why have cheap paper when you can summon or duplicate it? Books are one of the few things you can't physically magic yourself, stories and knowledge are one of the true real luxuries. As to entertainment, why watch a film when you can literally fly, apparate or travel around the world or invest in potions that have such variety that they can literally make you lucky? I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong, just that there are different perspectives and so many open doors to explore. Not sure why you've got a downvote though
