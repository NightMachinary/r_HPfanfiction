Hm. I can see how in certain issues, like gender equality, sexuality, acceptance of different races, and overall not giving AF about petty stuff, the magical world is totally superior. But then other stuff like ball point pens, mass produced clothes, cheap paper, mass produced books (because in the stories, the books are freaking expensive; an issue that would be quite neatly solved by offset printers), and vastly superior forms of entertainment (you don't hear of wizarding world having TV, Internet, movies ...) also electricity, I'd say the muggles are doing just fine.

There's this one crack~ish fic called Harry the Hufflepuff that sort of explores these things from a humourous angle, rather than super serious, and it's a fun read. I'm sure you've seen it, but wanted to throw it out there just in case:

Harry's thoroughly impressed by the magical world's ability to be endlessly lazy, but also invents little ways to bring his muggle stuff with him to enhance the laziness further. It also plays with that trope of how the hardest workers are the lazy, because they'll find as many ways as possible to avoid doing work.
