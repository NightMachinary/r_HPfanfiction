Wizard still have a higher quality of life then muggles although it may vary by how much better its is because a wizards quality of life is in a lot of way tied to the magical ability.

The the average wizard might enjoy a quality of like that we won't achieve for at least another hundred years but a wizard of Dumbeldores magical ability can have a quality of life that would won't be able to achieve in a thousand years if we ever can.

A wizards magic also allows them a greater independence than the muggle world will ever able to achieve.
