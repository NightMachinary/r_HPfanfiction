I'm not sure where you are getting this from the books. Pretty much every example in the books of quality of life is the same or worse.

An uncertain government does horrors to a nations efficiency. As does a high risk of death (through accidents or social unrest). Or even just living in fear. There seems to be an entire lack of Monetary policy in the wizarding worlds, one of the main tools of running an economy.

Pretty much everything in the series suggests magic was more advanced than the muggle counterparts when it started, but has not advanced at all over time.

The only thing I can think off that suggests a higher quality of life is that Ron's family, who are depicted as poor, don't have food insecurity or the inability to send their children to school. And that is pretty weak given the complete mess of their governmental system and societal strife.
