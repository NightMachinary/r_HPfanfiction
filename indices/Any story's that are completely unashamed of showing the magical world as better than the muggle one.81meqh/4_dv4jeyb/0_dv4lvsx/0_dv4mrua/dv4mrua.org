Not at the level that is in the books. Magical Briton is downright disfunctional. Healthy institutions, both governmental and press, are necessary for a functioning democracy. One that doesn't get taken over by terrorists. The country has one school, and it is rife with child endangerment and bullying. And several provably incompetent teachers. The governments stability is all shot to hell.

I've read books that promote systems I am not enamored with well (Webber's Harrington books and their love affair with constitutional monarchy comes to mind), the HP books don't try to do that. The magical society is basically a gimped version of the muggle one so Harry can come in and save it.

One idea I do like is that magical society had it easier than muggles with a higher quality of life due to magic for a long time, but it meant that the magical society didn't have to grow or change thus why they are behind now.

And yes, the rest of the magical world isn't that much better in cannon. But for fanfic, I would still call a fic using the books but discarding epilogue/later works as less AU than one that changes everything. And since you were looking for fics, I was giving my two cents on how this would work.
