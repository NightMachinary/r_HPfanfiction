Of the problems you have listed how many of there are really a problem for the average member of the magical world?

And things like government corruption exist in the muggle world as well, in the magical world you have malfoy in the muggle world we have turned what malfoy does into a job we call them lobbyists.

And from what we see in the fantastic beasts movie I would definitely not consider Magical America better than magical England.
