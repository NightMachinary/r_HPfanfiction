Umm the British magical world is pretty objectively shittier than the muggle one in Cannon.

Of course anything seriously AU can do whatever they want, but it is hard to see anything trying to stick to cannon showing its system as better.

There is certainly a range you can depict the magical world in (for example, depictions of the hospital range from NHS to Malfloys private hospital. Or the women's rights being downright repressive to full egalitarian).

However, it is hard to get away from an insular society that rejects learning from it's muggleborns. You have rampant government corruption, weak institutions, gullible public, weak news organizations. These are all plot points in cannon.

If you wanted a 'better' magical world, IMO your best bet is to leave Britain. Have magical America or France have a better system. This would likely involve magicals being a bit more tuned into what is happening in the muggle world, or subverting that and having magicals be behind most of the advancements in the muggle world. (To draw a contrast with Britain) Or you could have the 'Shining example of the magical world' be set somewhere that doesn't have good regular institutions. Magical Iraq or Zimbabwe?

It is kinda a neat idea to have the wizarding cultures in the 3rd world be highly advanced while the ones in the 1st world be recessed and behind.... And it fits cannon, cause magical Briton has some problems...
