Well in my magical world in all my stories I do portray it as MUCH more progressive, and I do always have characters point it out and notice how the nonmagic societies are very far behind on things like sexuality and gender. :) Yes my magical world headcanons are that it's even better than we are now in modern years in that regard, with lgbtq witches and wizards being able to marry each other and stuff for centuries already. :)
