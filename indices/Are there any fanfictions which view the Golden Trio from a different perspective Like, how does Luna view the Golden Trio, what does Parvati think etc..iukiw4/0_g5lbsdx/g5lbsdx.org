a) yes, please, there are not enough stories from different perspective than the Golden Trio. More stories like “Daphne Greengrass, Side Character by LinzRW” linkffn(11145058)!

b) did I say The Golden Trio perspective? That's wrong, all we have mostly is just Harry's perspective (and Hermione or Ginny, but only limit to their romantic life). There is not enough stories (more or less canonical, not “Fate by TheTrueSpartan” or “The Changeling by Annerb”) from Ron, Ginny, or Hermione's point of view. And both Hermione and Ginny are bound to have different view on The Trio having part of their lives hidden, e.g., canonically we know almost nothing about relationships in the girls dormitories.
