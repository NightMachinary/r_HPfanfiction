[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent Into Darkness]] explores a similar idea. It's an HP/LV fic with a sequel that seems to be dead.

Harry and Hermione translate an ancient book written in the elven language which he found in Slytherin's library. They find out that elves were apparently the dominant magical race on earth before wizards became common. House elves are the cursed descendants of elves who defied the elven high council. The rest of the elves apparently left earth to escape the prophesied end of the world.
