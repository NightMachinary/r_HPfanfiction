linkffn(Heroes Assemble) - Harry spends several years exploring the world after killing Voldemort and ends up lending a hand when the Chitauri invade New York. Things snowball from there. Eventually touches most (if not all?) of the MCU.

linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep) - A fluffy story where Harry runs a bar and serves drinks themed after various mythological figures.

linkao3(On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads) - Loki is Harry's father. (James Potter was a disguise he used.) Harry is not pleased when he finds out. The title rather gives away what he does. Not crack as such, but definitely humorous.
