You probably already read and post on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]], because I've found that most HP/Dresden fans do, but if you don't, it's a good place to drop by for betaing. People there are quite experienced, and it's far easier than trying to fix off of FF.net, with their retarded anti copy/paste settings in place.
