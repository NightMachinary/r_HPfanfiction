"Clean" by olivieblake is really good. The relationship is built beautifully and it is just an incredibly well-written story. It takes place during their 6th year and the sequel "Marked" is in their 7th. Draco's not a spy but Hermione knows about his mission and it's a whole thing.

For future reference, the Tumblr page "dramioneasks" is really good for recs. Also, [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] is pretty useful.
