I used to tolerate slash, but now I just skip any fic tagged with it, as it will perhaps inevitably be fifty percent badly written bad porn, and thirty percent teenage relationship angst.

I used to try to read Snape/Harry redemption stories, but I don't care for Snape wank, which is what they tend to be.

On that note, Snape wank. Rowling gave us a single dimension, horrific example of a human being. I don't understand the fascination with trying to redeem him, or worse, giving him a pedophile twist by pairing him with a student.

Romance in general. Over the past decade I've become quite the unrepentant misogynist, and I nope right the fuck out of any romance centric fic.

I can still stomach a lot of tropes and clich√©s, if they are well written.
