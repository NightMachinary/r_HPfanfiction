I started in 2007 with a dial in connection and a Buffy fanfic addiction. Took my mum with me who despised reading from screen and printed all novel lenght fics double sided on A4. I still can see her reading on the couch with a 5 inch stack...

After Buffy came Lord of the Rings, a small side step to LOTRRPF, Harry Potter and Sherlock.

Tl;dr : I'm 11 years older. Yes, I'm different now :)
