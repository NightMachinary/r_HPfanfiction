I have gotten a lot more picky today, as I hate:

- Canon rehash, especially in time travels
- Ice Queen of Slytherin
- WBWL
- Potter and Weasley bashing
- Voldemort and Death Eater apologies
- Damsel in Distress Hermione
- Hermione agreeing to marriage law
- Leather pants Draco
- Manufactured drama and angst
- “Good guys don't kill” trope
