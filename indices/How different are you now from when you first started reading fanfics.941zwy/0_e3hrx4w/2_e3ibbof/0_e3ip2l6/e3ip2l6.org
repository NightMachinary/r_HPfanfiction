Canon rehash occurs when an author changes various characters actions, but keeps the plot points the same.

Now to be fair, some events aren't impacted by, for example, Harry.

Assuming Harry didn't go to Hogwarts/is in a different house/is blind/is paralyzed/has been transfigured permanently into a rather large cockatiel:

Year 1 - Stone still in Hogwarts, Voldemort still tries to jack it. Maybe he succeeds - this is a point the plot /could/ diverge, but often doesn't.

Year 2 - Tom's diary goes to Hogwarts, because Lucy Malfoy wants to discredit Arty Weasley's "Muggleborn Protection Act". Unless either of these characters are fucked with this event happens.

Year 3 - Sirius gets his paws on Fudge's paper and sees Peter Pettigrew on vacation. Unless you've messed with the Weasley family dynamics, Harry doesn't actually figure into Sirius breaking out of Azkaban.

Year 4 - Often a point of divergence, as if Harry isn't around/important etc he might not factor into the Triwizard tournament. Although if he is around old Voldy probably wants his blood for that ritual.

That is the problem with canon rehash - a lot of events are predicated on secondary/tertiary characters, none of which are actually influenced by the main characters. So we inevitably wind up rereading bits of plot over and over again.
