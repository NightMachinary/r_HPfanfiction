And this ends up being the thing I'm struggling with while trying to write my own fiction.

I'm not writng a time travel fic, but it still makes sense to start at year one because I want to write a different version of Harry. But then I'll have to redo all the plot points of at least the first three books, because none of those things are in a child's control.

And that's even more boring to write than it is to read. Even trying to think of new, inventive ways for Harry to make his way through the various plot points is tedious.
