Basically canon rehash is the same events happening over again regardless of changes.

If a fic includes the Chamber of Secrets and Triwizard Tournament it is very likely a rehash of sorts.

This gets incredibly annoying very fast.

For example: If Harry travels back in time to first year, the Chamber of Secrets should not happen under any circumstances. Harry knows exactly how to prevent it. The author will then say some bullshit regarding "preserving the timeline", which is a codeword for being lazy and unimaginative.

This then prompts the question why did the protagonist travel back in time if he isn't going to change the past? That's the whole damn point of traveling back in time in the first place.
