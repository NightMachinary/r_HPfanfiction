I started out in Fanfiction reading HP fics. I unfortunately like many people here started reading the shitty cliche stuff that nowadays makes my eyes hurt 2 sentences in.

I have actually expanded a lot of my different fandoms especially in regards to Naruto, where I know everything in canon but have never actually read the manga or seen the anime.

I am exceptionally happy I am not the same person I was when I started reading fanfic, for one I like being an adult, and also I have a much better reading speed/comprehension/ability than a lot of my friends.
