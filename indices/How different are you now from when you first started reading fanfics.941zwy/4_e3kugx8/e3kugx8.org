I started reading fic when I was like 12 so my tastes have changed a lot. Off the top of my head:

-I used to almost exclusively read 100K+, these days I keep scrolling once it's pushing 40K, and over 75k I just won't do unless someone specifically recc'd it.

-I very rarely go for anything terribly intricate plot-wise anymore (HPMoR, time travel fic, etc.), ditto anything with heavy angst/serious topic. I'm more in the "came here to have a good time, not to have my feelings hurt" camp now.

-I tend to prefer more character-driven fic; that hasn't changed, but I'm much more of a stickler for accurate characterization than I used to be.

-I wouldn't read ship fic at all for several years, now I'll read it but usually more as a function of other elements present in the story than the specific ship. There are still ships I won't read, but not any that I really look for.
