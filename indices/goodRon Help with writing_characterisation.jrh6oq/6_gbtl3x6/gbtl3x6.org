I'm working on a fic where Ron is fairly minor. Originally I was going the idiot/vicious route but changed my mind. So he's impulsive with a quick mouth and still jealous at times, but by 5th year can be talked down before a public explosion (it helps that Hermione points out that he'll draw attention from Draco's tantrum and become the new disruption in the hall). You may have to talk fast, but it can be done--and he wants a full explanation soon. He's also loyal to Harry and genuinely wants to stay friends; in the scene Sirius comes up in discussion and while most of the students still have a negative impression, Ron is very much "Harry says he's a good guy and I trust Harry." That loyalty wins out even over some of Molly's demands. And his strategic mind does eventually accept why Harry was being cagey with his secrets.

I think it's a matter of emphasizing his more positive traits while acknowledging at least some of the negative, but also dropping the fanon notion that he's stupid or slow.
