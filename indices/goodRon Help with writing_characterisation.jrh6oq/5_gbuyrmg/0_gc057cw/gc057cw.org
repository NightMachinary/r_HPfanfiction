That actually makes some sense, the dueling thing.

Hermione is great academically, but we see right from the first book with the Devil's Snare (in the book, not the movie which gave a lot of Ron's stuff to her) that she panics in emergencies. Which is fine, not everyone is good at everything. I see her as the sort who in a conflict would think of so many things that could happen that she'd lock down. Eventually she'd be able to train out of it, but she just wouldn't be as good as someone who can focus on the now as much.

So many fanfics take 'She is smart' and turn her into 'she is a dueling genius'. It boggles my mind, knowledge of spells doesn't equate to combat or all the people testing students for OWLs would be badass uber-warriors.

Frankly, a broad knowledge of spells is probably not required to fight effectively. I saw this once in a fanfic, I don't recall the name. It's likely better to know a few spells that fill the various combat niches REALLY WELL. Then you can expand to have more options for those niches, but ability to fight well (nerve, reflexes, experience) is better than having an encyclopedia of knowledge.
