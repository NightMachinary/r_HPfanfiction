First and foremost, Ron in book 4 and 7 is out of character. Especially book 4. I don't care what anyone says, there is no way in the world Ron would even think Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire.

So just don't write that conflict, at all. Ron believes in Harry from the very start, he never has any doubt and there is no "jealous streak".

Other main thing is, all practical knowledge and how the wizarding world works should come from Ron. He's the only one of the trio who has actually lived his entire life there since he was born.

This may sound unpopular, but I think he should be the second best duelist and second best in DADA after Harry in his year. He should easily beat Hermione when it comes to quick and practical use of magic.

If you want to write Romione then don't do the Yule Ball fiasco with Krum. And if you don't want to write Romione, then /definitely/ don't do the Yule Ball fiasco.
