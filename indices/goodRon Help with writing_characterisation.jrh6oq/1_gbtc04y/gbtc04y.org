It all depends on what you want to do. Personally Ron should be the one to give Harry and Hermione the inside scoop on how things work in the Wizarding world, as he was intended before Hermione took that role away from him.

There has to be a turning point for his character, an event where something happens to Ron and he makes a change for himself for the better. What event from the books (or something that happens/will happen in your AU) do you want to work on?

Book 2 can be a good starting point--Harry's outed as a Parselmouth, his wand is messed up, the Polyjuice fiasco, elective selection. Maybe something happens w/his wand during class or when brewing Polyjuice and he says, "Bugger this, I'll learn non-verbal magic." (Canonically weaker than verbal magic, and hey, he's done it before ("Eat slugs, Malfoy!"). Plus he's had to have seen Bill/Charlie/Percy do it/talk about it, so it'd make sense that he knows about it before Harry and Hermione.)) Maybe he's seen Bill work with fanon!Runes during one of his visits home and wants to emulate him and Bill teaches him a bit over the over after first/second year and he becomes a savant at it.

Book 3--Ron gets his own wand. Maybe that motivates him. Maybe he joins Harry for Anti-Dementor lessons. Or he can be more proactive in trying to find out why Chrookshanks wants Scabbers so badly (and protecting Scabbers by keeping him in a cage or something).

Book 4--Triwizard Tournament. The standard canon feelings of being left out/jealously occur, but Ron tries harder to repair things before or after the first task, working w/Harry and Hermione in training Harry for the events. For the events surrounding the Yule Ball, maybe he doesn't get jealous of Hermione and Krum, and treats Padma better, leading to a good friendship/relationship later down the line. Maybe he does get jealous and works to make it up to Padma afterwards. Maybe he doesn't work it out with either of them and him and Fleur become a thing after the Second Task. Who knows?

Book 5--O.W.Ls and Prefectcy and Voldemort returns. This could be the kick in the arse that he needs to raise above "slightly above average". He could motivate Harry (since Harry leans more towards Ron's opinions than Hermione's) to work harder, keep his head down around Umbridge, and ignore his dreams.

And so on and so forth. There's dozens of pathways any event could take.
