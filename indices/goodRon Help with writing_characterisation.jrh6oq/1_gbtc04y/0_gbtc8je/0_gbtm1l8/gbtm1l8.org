I like these :) i would like to add some things.

Book 2: after a year where Harry gets bullied, and hermione and Ginny getting attacked his inner Molly awakens: fiercly protective and nurturing Ron. He would focus less on himself and more on others. He could be a protector of the outsiders against bullies (Luna, Neville, maybe some muggleborn/halfblood snakes) and mentor for the younger years when he becomes prefect. He shows signs of these behaviors troughout canon like eat slugs malfoy and thinking of the houseelves during the battle of hogwards. I think het would be an amazing and caring prefect focussing on helping and nurturing the firsties vs a Percy who is only focust on the status of being one.
