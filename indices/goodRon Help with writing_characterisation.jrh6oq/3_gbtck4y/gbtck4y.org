Well, in my mind, one of the best characteristics of Ron, from Harry's POV, is the fact that he is the loyal, cool, sometimes a little loud-mouthed friend that any friendless boy who just stepped into a new world wants. He knows enough people and enough of the said world in order to make Harry's transition easier. Furthermore, while I'm not going to list the so often quoted examples around here, he is shown to be willing to give his life for his friends. Even if they bicker constantly, he is the only one who truly stands up for Hermione even against Harry when he is mean to her (Harry doesn't do the same). He has his friends over all the time and even goes to check up on them when he thinks something doesn't seem right. Sure, he gradually falls in Harry's shadow and he has some moments of jealousy, but what teenager who has a bunch of accomplished siblings wouldn't, especially in their formation years?

And, for reference, I am going to compare him to Hermione. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love book-canon Hermione but I hate the Mary Sue Hermione from the movies and most Harmony fics (seems like she often is a projection of a female writer in those, hell, even JK said that she's her projection). Hermione is a very smart, knowledgeable and empathetic girl. But at the same time, I think she can be quite a bore with her tendency to only talk about schoolwork (unless situation arises), can be (to quote Snape) "an insufferable know-it-all", can be quite nagging and, downright, ignorant about some things. Even when Harry and Ron have their first fight in GoF, it's stated that Harry didn't really enjoy Hermione's company as much as Ron's. Harry also acts quite shitty towards her in DH after she breaks his wand and it's quite clear he is making an effort not to bring up Ron in order not to upset her. So all those fics making Harry and Hermione best friends without Ron as the bridge always seem quite OOC for me.
