  So all those fics making Harry and Hermione best friends without Ron as the bridge always seem quite OOC for me.

The reason why those fics exist is because Hermione-lovers feel like she deserves everything in the world because she's a hard-worker and gets excellent marks. Ron's out of the running for "Hermione's soulmate" for a number of reasons, either canonically-backed or not, so Harry's the next best thing. He's the Chosen One, and only the Chosen One will do for Princess Hermione, so they force the two together like someone trying to fit into jeans that are three sizes too small. They all hate Harry and Ron for being bad friends to her (Ron more so, in their opinion, because he was a bad friend to Harry in Book 4 and 7) so they kick him to the curb and make Hermione mold Harry into her ideal partner.

I will say that not every Harmony fic is like that. In Harem!Harry fics Harry molds Hermione.
