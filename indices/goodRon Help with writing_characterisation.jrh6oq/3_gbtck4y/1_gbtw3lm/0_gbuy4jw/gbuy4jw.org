Agreed.

To me Hermione seems to be one of those people who, while they themselves feel deeply, logics her way through other people 's feelings. This leads to her being able to disregard those feelings she sees as silly or unimportant (WHY would they not see feeling like this is stupid? Come on!), while at the same time being pretty good at realising /what/ somebody is feeling.
