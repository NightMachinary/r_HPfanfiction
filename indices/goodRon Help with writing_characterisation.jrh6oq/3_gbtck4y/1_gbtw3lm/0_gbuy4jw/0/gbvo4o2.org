This is a really good insight into something that seems quite paradoxical in Hermione. She clearly understands the feelings people have, but on a logical level, not because she empathises.

In fact, if we think about the pets, it's Ron who shows empathy to Lavender, while Hermione repeatedly sticks her foot in her mouth.
