yeah that's the goal. Someone said it so well a while ago that with Ron Rowling kept sending him back to zero while everyone else developed. I think you sad it really well that Ron is a conflict maker in canon, and that's perhaps why I'm finding it hard to shift him in my mind. I think looking at canon from that perspective that helps a lot, so thank you
