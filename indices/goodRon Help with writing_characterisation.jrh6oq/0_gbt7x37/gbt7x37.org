The thing to remember is at first, Ron was the really loyal friend who had a big mouth. He didn't think before speaking, so he tended to be abrasive, but he was absolutely loyal. This is the kid who, to get Harry through the challenges in book one, willingly took himself out. The kid who was totally willing to charge a basilisk to save his sister. Too bad for the ponce Lockhart.

Issue is, Rowling increased this up to eleven as time went on, using Ron as a conflict maker. Yes, fanfic exacerbates it, but it's still frustrating.

I'd actually let him start /growing up/ around book two to three, keep his loyalty and have his tendency to stick his foot in it slowly end, and have him start taking life a bit seriously.

I'd make him the nurturer, the heart. Hermione is the organizer and big brain. Harry is the leader and if you ignore Rowling making him an Everyman later on, the power of the team.
