Ron is a pretty awesome character in canon, at least early on in the series. For the most part he's a likable kid. If Harry hadn't befriended him I get the sense that he would have spent a lot of time hanging out with Dean and the other boys doing teen guy stuff and focusing on quidditch.

Anyhow, in canon he had a lot more in the way of witty lines and was a lot more compassionate and protective of his friends. He was dumbed down quite a bit for the movies and some of his best lines were given to Hermione since the writer was a Hermione fan. Also I think because the movies were being made before the series was finished, and the screenwriter shipped Harry/Hermione so didn't nurture those nice Ron moments.

Example: When Draco called Hermione a mudblood in the books, she was like "Whatevs I don't know what that even is." It was Ron who was furious on her behalf and tried to defend her. In the movies, poor poor movie-Hermione got all teary eyed as she explained to all the wizards in the room how she was called mudblood and it means dirty blood, poor poor movie-Hermione.

Or when Hermione got the Tales of Beedle the Bard from Dumbledore. Ron explained to them what those were because he knew Harry had a muggle upbringing and wouldn't be familiar with wizarding children's stories. In the movie he had a "hurr durr I like Babbity Rabbity" moment then acted confused when the others looked at him blankly.

In short, write some witty lines. Give those witty lines to Ron. When characters have important insights, give some of those insights to Ron too. If there are things his friends wouldn't understand about wizarding culture due to growing up with muggles, have Ron be aware of that and ready to help them.

Ron needs an overarching goal. You can give him a new goal. Or go with the canon one which was to be recognized as an individual by his family and the wizarding community. As Harry's sidekick/bestfriend, that role is at odds with his goal sometimes and I think that's where some of the conflicts came in. But it has a lot of potential that wasn't really explored to its fullest in canon.
