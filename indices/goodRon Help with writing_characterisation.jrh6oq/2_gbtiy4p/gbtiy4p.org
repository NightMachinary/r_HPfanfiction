The bit that I always think of for Ron, for me, is I think in OotP. Ron and Hermione are having an argument about freeing house elves. Hermione has been knitting clothes and then hiding them. After Hermione storms off Ron uncovers the clothes but leaves them, saying that the house-elves should at least have the choice. He might disagree with Hermione, but he respects both her and the house elves to find a compromise rather than just taking advantage of her absence. He has a very keen sense of fairness.

Ron values choice. Ron chooses repeatedly to endanger himself for Harry, for his family. Ron and Harry's fall-out in book 4 could also be viewed through this lens. Harry and Ron had discussed entering, they both said they would if they could and then Harry is entered but never gave Ron the chance. I believe that had they both found a way to enter and Harry had been selected, Ron would have supported him best he could. The issue was related to how Ron never had the option.

When people see Ron as lazy and demotivated I can see that through his perceived lack of choice. Bill was Head Boy, Charlie was Quidditch Captain, Percy was Head Boy, the twins have been on the quidditch team for years and also have their own brilliance and popularity. What can Ron choose? What options does he have that can be his rather than following in the footsteps of his brothers? Ron doesn't have options that he can see as his own, so he just gets by.

If I wanted Ron to take a bigger role in the story I would introduce a goal for him. A large part of Ron's character is his lack of a goal, something many of us face in our own lives. It means that Ron doesn't ever work towards something. I believe you have a real opportunity for character growth if Ron confronts something that causes him to have an ambition. Maybe it is teaching/coaching, maybe it is through helping others, I don't know. I think Ron could become more if he had something that was truly his that he earned through his own hard work and that he wanted enough he worked for it.
