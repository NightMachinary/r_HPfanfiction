If you're a Hermione/Harmony fan that is indifferent towards/mildly dislikes Ron you'll like the fic. Ron's basically a cheerleader for Harmony after he gets over Hermione's months-long callousness towards him and Lavender.

If you hate Ron, there's won't be enough bashing for your tastes.

If you like Ron (like I do) the fic reads like so many other "Harmony fic, no Ron bashing!" fics do: Harry is basically Hermione's bitch, Hermione thinks she's better than everyone else while behaving worse, and together they can do anything. Ron's his canon self but still a cheerleader for the ship and everyone falls over themselves saying "I knew you and Harry were perfect for each other!!1!" Hermione makes it very clear in her thoughts and actions that she thinks she's superior to Ron and Lavender but still thinks she's being fair.

But don't take my word for it, more opinions/reviews are available [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/hermione-granger-and-the-paradigm-shift-by-petrificus-somewhatus-t.39364/][here]].
