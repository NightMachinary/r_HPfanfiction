In other words, it's a realistic story about teenagers then?

I love how everyone complains about 11-year-olds in fanfiction acting like adults, but then shits all over teenagers having teenage drama.

Paradigm Shift is an excellent story; one of the few Harmony fics that mostly conforms to canon and has H & Hr have flaws and value their friendships with other people.

Don't trash the few good Harmony fics out there.
