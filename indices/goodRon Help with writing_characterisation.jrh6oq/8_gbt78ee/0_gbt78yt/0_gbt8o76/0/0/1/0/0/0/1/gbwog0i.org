I do like the story, but I /am/ curious to see what you write. So many of the people on this sub that trash other people's work either a) don't write, or b) put out garbage.

I will check out the links. And I don't leave negative reviews for amateur work, so don't expect any flames. It's incredibly shortsighted to attack authors that volunteer their time for our collective enjoyment.

As for Paradigm, I don't find it offputting to have "-ly" words, as you put it, it helps me understand the tone and speech of the comments. What I liked most about it was what you didn't - namely, that it felt like I was reading a believable POV of Hr during Book 6. No one was super-powered, their solutions to conflicts were within the range of possibility, adults generally acted like adults with knowledge and experience greater than children, etc. Perhaps it is a statment about HP fanfics overall, but Paradigm was standout IMO.
