  Paradigm Shift is an excellent story; one of the few Harmony fics that mostly conforms to canon and has H & Hr have flaws and value their friendships with other people.

  Don't trash the few good Harmony fics out there.

Please, it's mediocre at best. And anyway, whoever linked it shouldn't have at all. This a thread about writing Ron's character well. Linking a Harmony fic (which, as a category, is pretty well-known for Weasley/Dumbledore bashing) was a dumb move, even more so when the OP didn't ask for recs.
