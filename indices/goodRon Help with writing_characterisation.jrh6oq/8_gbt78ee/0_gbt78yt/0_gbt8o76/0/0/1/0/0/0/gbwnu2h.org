  I'm curious, if it is mediocre ("at best") what you've been writing lately?

Lol, I see what you're doing. I insulted one of your favorite fics so you're asking to see /my/ work so that you can judge it by some arbitrary metric. Well, if you want to take a gander, here's my profile pages for [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/StarsandSunkissed/works][AO3]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3794507/SolarSolstice][FFN]].

As I said in my original post, you don't have to take solely my word for it. Even some objective Harmony fans have said it's a "decent time waster" and "Readable but bland", "amateurish" and, one of my favourites, "Want a H/Hr story with zero stakes and recycled story-lines from over 20 years of fanfic with a coat of polish? This is the story for you."

Also, I'd expect this sort of story defence from the author, not some random fan. It's an average fic, both in terms of plot and from a technical standpoint--too many verbs and -lys, eg "she muttered unthinkingly", "he began calmly", "she replied angrily", "she replied sadly", "he muttered quietly", "she asked tentatively", "he tiredly replied"--see what I mean? It makes the writing feel dry, and this is all in the first chapter!

There's also the overuse of (...) and spelling out every single thought and emotion for the readers, because the author seems to think we're children that can't understand subtleties.
