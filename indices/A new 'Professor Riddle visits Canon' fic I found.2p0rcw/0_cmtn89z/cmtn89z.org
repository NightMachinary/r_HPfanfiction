I read this and on one hand, it is rather well written, but on the other, Riddle isn't acting like a Slytherin, let alone someone who has been their head of house. He has no ambition, has shown no cunning, and is acting more like a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw than anything. Publicly taking an unbreakable vow that would limit him forever just to make people feel good is /not/ Slytherin - it opens him up to people using his words against him for the rest of his life. More than that, Sirius, Remus and Harry taking an immediate liking to him (well, within the first week of knowing him) is just wrong on so many levels.

I read one comment that pointed out his treatment of Snape in chapter four being a cheap prelude for evil!Snape - I reread the chapter, and found it quite interesting: Snape raised valid concerns. Riddle's reactions? Saying he deserved the scene at the lake because it was caused by Snape's big mouth and that he was essentially a little bitch. That's how he treats his colleagues and former house members. Not only did he not stop the bullying of his students, he actually holds it over their heads /and joins in/ two decades later.

That ticks me off to no end; avoiding the bullying angle by saying the victim had it coming is disgusting. Having a head of house act that way shows he is utterly undeserving of the job. I get it that the author wants to blame Snape for not teaching Harry occlumency so Riddle can teach it to him an a week to show us all how awesome he is, and how much of a better character judge he is than Dumbledore (you know, the Marauders had it right from the start and all)... but the execution of it is just childish.

Dumbledore isn't an idiot, no one deserves to be bullied and much less deserves it thrown in their face in public, Sirius wouldn't get over his loathing of Slytherins within an hour of meeting a new one, and no Slytherin would act the way Professor Riddle does. The story is interesting, and written to a much higher standard than most. Unfortunately, Professor Riddle seems like an excuse to put an overpowered good guy as a "twist" on canon. After reading enough fan fiction, I just can't bring myself to read more of this.
