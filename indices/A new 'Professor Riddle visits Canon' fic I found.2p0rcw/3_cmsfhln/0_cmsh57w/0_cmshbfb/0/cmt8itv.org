Mostly these ones aren't too bad. There were one or two times that I couldn't figure out what the author was trying to say. There were a few times where the author missed capitalizing "Harry", and that was a bit annoying.

Not as annoying as the author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/28/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], who always uses lower case for "Mr" and "Mrs". At least s/he's consistent about it.
