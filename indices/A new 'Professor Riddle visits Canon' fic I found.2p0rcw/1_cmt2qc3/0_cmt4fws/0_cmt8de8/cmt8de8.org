I don't object to him not being power-hungry, but this Riddle doesn't seem powerful nor intelligent, which are supposed (IMO) to be two defining factors about Riddle.

He also hasn't demonstrated any cunning nor ambition, which I would also want. Not that the ambition has to be power or otherwise negative. I mean, I assume he wants to return to his own universe, and so that would be his ambition. What cunning plans are he developing to achieve this goal? Er, he's going to teach at Hogwarts? Er, right ...

So far, I don't think the author has demonstrated any of the attributes that Riddle should have, and so it seems like some random OC with the same name. This Riddle simply isn't that interesting to me.
