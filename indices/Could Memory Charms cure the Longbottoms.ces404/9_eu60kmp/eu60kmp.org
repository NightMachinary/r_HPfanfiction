I feel like it would be a no. My headcanon is that the cruciatus trips all your nerves with pain and that caused sensory overload(not sure this is right or not) and that's what made them insane. They felt too much and it was pain on top of that over a long enough period of time that it drove them insane. I look at it similar to the idea that if a person cant talk and loses all their senses then after a long enough time that person is going to go crazy.
