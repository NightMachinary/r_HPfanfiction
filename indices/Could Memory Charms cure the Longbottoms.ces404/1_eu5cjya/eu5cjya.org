I always read it as though the Cruciatus had, essentially, caused them to disconnect mentally to avoid the pain. I think of it like cutting the cord on a pair of headphones that are blaring too-loud sound. The headphones stay on, but suddenly there's no audio coming through them, and because the cord was cut, the pathways that all other sounds would follow no longer exist.

I think it's an idea that could work if the legwork was done to explain why, in your universe, it's possible (and why nobody thought to try it sooner).
