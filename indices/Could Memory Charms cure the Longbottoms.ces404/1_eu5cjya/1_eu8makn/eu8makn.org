They never encountered this problem before. They knew there was no block for the curse. Someone comes in mentally damaged by the curse? They go “huh. Guess that's a new side effect we didn't know about. Since we don't have a real treatment for this except having them sleep it off and if it doesn't fix itself, oh well.”
