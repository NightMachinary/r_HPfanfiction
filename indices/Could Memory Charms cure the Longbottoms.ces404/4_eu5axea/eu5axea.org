Thank you for this post. I had the same thought a few years back when i was trying to design a VR Harry Potter game, for no apparent reason since im not programmer. It does seem to fit with the lore of HP that you could obliviate the bad memories away, but maybe the memories were like a virus? taking over even the good memories til all that was left was the bad, and then they were stuck in the bad? The way to find out, in my opinion, would be to get a pensieve and extract the memories physically, kind of like blood under a microscope
