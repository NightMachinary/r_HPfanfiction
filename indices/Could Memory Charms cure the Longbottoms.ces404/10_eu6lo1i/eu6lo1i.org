Memory charms have been shown to cause damage, e.g. muggles from book 4 showing negative affects after memory wipe after torture, so the damage from the memory charm would probably make things worse, not better. We also don't know how different magic affects the body; nerve damage, brain damage, or "soul" damage would have to get different treatments. If say the cruciatus only affected the soul or the nerves and obliviate only affected the brain, it's unlikely they'd be able to interact.
