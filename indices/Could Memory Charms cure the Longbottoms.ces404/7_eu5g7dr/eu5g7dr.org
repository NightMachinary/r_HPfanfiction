It depends on where exactly the damage is.

If it's psychological, then removing the memory could help.

If it's actual damage to the magical mind or soul, then it might but probably not.

If it's the physical brain (neurons) that are damaged then it's possibly comparable to Huntington's or ALS, in which case memory charms won't help but a MRI might provide helpful information.
