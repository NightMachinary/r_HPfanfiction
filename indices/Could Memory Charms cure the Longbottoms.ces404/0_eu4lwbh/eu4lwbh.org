If the cruciatus curse is actually described as causing no physical damage at all then hypothetically... maybe? If the reason they went insane is because the pain was too much then removing that pain from their minds should cure them in my opinion.

A hilarious idea just popped into my head, about Lockhart being the only one proficient enough at such detailed memory charms to cure them xD
