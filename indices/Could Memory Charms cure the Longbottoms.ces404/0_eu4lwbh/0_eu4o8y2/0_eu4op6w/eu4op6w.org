Probably a reasonable conclusion as well, however since this is Magic and fanfiction as well. If they went away into their heads to escape the pain, then you could pull off the cliché of a ”mindscape” (already rolling my eyes) and them being unable to leave their mindscape due to the horrific memory of the pain waiting for them outside. And since they have no perception of time in there, they are unaware that years go by and their son is growing up while they try to muster up the courage to face the pain.

Then if someone removed the memory of that pain, then they would have no reason to stay in their mindscape. They wouldn't even know why they went there in the first place. Thereby they would come out and essentially be cured.

(A lot of conjecture and made up stuff in that text for sure, but it's fun to imagine things lik that nevertheless)
