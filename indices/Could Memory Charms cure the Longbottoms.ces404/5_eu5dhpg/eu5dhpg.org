Depends on how the MC works and what Cruciatus damage is:

​

| Memory Charm works by:\Cruciatus Insanity is:                                                                                            | Damage to physical brain                                                                                    | Damage to magical brain or soul | Entirely mental trauma or similar |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| Cutting off access to the memories                                                                                                       | Does not help.                                                                                              | Does not help.                  | Might help.                       |
| Erasing memories from physical brain but not magical brain or soul (assuming at least one of those two exists)                           | Might help, but only if the method of erasing replaces the brain tissue or reverts it to a pre-memory state | Does not help.                  | Possibly cures.                   |
| Erasing memories from physical brain and magical brain and soul (or neither of those exists or they don't have anything to do with this) | Might help, but only if the method of erasing replaces the brain tissue or reverts it to a pre-memory state | Might help.                     | Almost certainly cures.           |

However, since in canon Bertha Jorkin's Memory Charm was broken via torture, it almost certainly works as per row 1, which only even maybe helps if the entire effect is entirely mental.

​

Thus, unless there are other version of the MC that act to erase instead of obfuscate, or other methods that do so, this is a dead end.

However, note that Snape placed memories he did not wish to risk Harry seeing into his Pensieve. This implies that it is at least possible to mostly remove memories from one's mind by that method. In fact, this method was employed in the fic "A Wand for Skitter", a quite excellent Worm/Harry Potter crossover.
