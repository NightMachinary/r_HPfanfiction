On a vaguely related note, I just watched the Queen's Gambit, and Dudley showing up as a Kentucky Chess Master was pretty crazy and unexpected. I immediately began formulating the fanfiction in my mind: clearly he picked up wizarding chess while on the run from Voldemort, then moved to Kentucky and changed his name to Harry in an act of rebellion against his parents. (He also plays a poet without limbs in the Ballad of Buster Scruggs... I'm thinking it was a time-turned related accident).
