The sheer amount of A-List talent rendered completely unrecognizable in those films is astounding.

Kenneth Branagh is a big one but Emma Thompson as Trelawney, or John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick always blew my mind. I don't think I realized Gary Oldman plays Sirius until OOtP lol.

I also experienced the reverse of this when I watched Killing Eve and Fleabag and realized that Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) appears in both. She has a dialog in Fleabag that goes, "Do you wanna fuck the priest, or do you want to fuck God?" and honestly I still don't think my mind has recovered from that bit of cognitive dissonance.
