  The sheer amount of A-List talent rendered completely unrecognizable in those films is astounding.

Absolutely. Mr Weasley as Father Brown in the TV series. Also, Maggie Smith is many many other famous roles. E.g., Lady Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, on Downton Abbey (2010--2015) or I loved her as a governess in A Room With A View (1985) next to Helena Bonham Carter, i.e., Bellatrix Lestrange (or many other roles she mastered).

And the story goes that Kenneth Branagh got the role only because Hugh Grant decided to make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Weeks_Notice][“Two Weeks Notice”]] with Sandra Bullock instead (it is probably better not to ask him how happy he is about that decision). See [[https://is.gd/UcKvGF]] for other famous actors who missed the role in HP universe.
