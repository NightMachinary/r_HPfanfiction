Didn't know John Cleese played Nearly Headless Nick. Never gonna be able to watch him play Q in James Bond again without thinking about that. Also I can understand the mental blow that the quoted dialog from Fiona Shaw would have on a person. I think I would have needed therapy after something like that.
