A tactical foul would be one of the Slytherin chasers grabbing onto a Gryffindor broom to stop them from scoring. Clean, preventing an obvious scoring opportunity, and no one is hurt in the process. That's akin to someone grabbing onto an attacker's shirt so they don't get caught out on the break.

What Draco is doing is akin to John Terry kicking a player off the ball, trying to either injure them or throw them off their game. Or elbowing them in the head. Or slowing down and elbowing the player oncoming to them.

It really broke character when Hermione says that Harry ran into Draco while, in reality, Draco intentionally slowed down to elbow Harry.

There's a line between a clean, tactical foul (or even a hard tackle) and an intent to injure and Draco quite obviously crossed that line from the start. That Hermione would defend his actions just doesn't strike me as fitting for her character.

I understand supporting the team/House, but Hermione should be smart enough to recognize the difference between a tactical ploy and an intent to injure. She does not or is written as not recognizing that, and it just seems very OOC for her - even in this story.
