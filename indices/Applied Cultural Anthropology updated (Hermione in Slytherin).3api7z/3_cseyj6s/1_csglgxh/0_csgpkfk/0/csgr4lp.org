  Hermione should be smart enough to recognize the difference between a tactical ploy and an intent to injure.

My reading was that the intent to injure was baked into the tactical Polly from the very start, maybe even suggested by Hermione. And because of the high level of physicality in the game as well as magical healing, it (in my mind) could very well be in tactical foul territory.

  It really broke character when Hermione says that Harry ran into Draco while, in reality, Draco intentionally slowed down to elbow Harry.

In the sport I competed in, there are some situations where the person in the lead has the right-of-way, no matter what. The same sort of thing would be legal, although it wouldn't make any friends.
