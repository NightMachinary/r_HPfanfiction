Hmm. Maybe the fanon whitewashing has blurred my perceptions of Hermione a bit. For someone that writes a lot of HPFF, I certainly haven't read the books in quite a long time.

I won't bother jacobk about it. The story is one of my favorites and high standards do bring out picky criticisms. I just really don't think Hermione would be all that interested in Quidditch, but perhaps trying to maintain her position in the House would require more knowledge of the sport - moreso than canon. Either way, there's still a fallout to deal with, so I can't make any harsh judgements on her character until then.
