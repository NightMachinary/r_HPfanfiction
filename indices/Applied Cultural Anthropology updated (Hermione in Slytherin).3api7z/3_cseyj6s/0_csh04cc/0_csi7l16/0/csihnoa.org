  I still think Hermione would tend to fall in the category of Lawful-Good than Neutral-Good. When Hermione disobeys orders, it is because it comes from an authority that doesn't promote goodness. My memory is fuzzy, but I can't recall a scenario in which Dumbledore/McGonagall/whatever authority deemed as good explicitly tells her, "Don't do this" and she disobeys them.

That's easy. In PS, McGonagall says: don't go after the Stone. Hermione joins Harry and Ron in going after the Stone (and is the only one to assault another person in cold blood to do so). For that matter, after the Troll Incident, she casually lies to McGonagall about what had led her there. That's with six books to spare.

Anyway, how many times do we (and by "we", I mean Harry, since he's the PoV character), see someone deemed good order her to do something even remotely controversial in the first place?

Pretty much the only instance I can think of is during OotP, when Hermione, on Dumbledore's orders, refrained from putting any potentially sensitive information in her letters to Harry over the summer. (By the way, contrary to fanon, both Ron and Hermione wrote to Harry; they just didn't include any information about what was going on on the Voldemort front.) Now, to me, that seems like basic operational security: you do not mail intelligence via an easily intercepted medium (an owl) to someone with a mental link of unknown nature to the best Legilimens alive. Ron, by the way, also obeyed that directive, and there's no way he's Lawful anything.

  But these are shades of gray, a character doesn't just fall in one categorization.

You're the one who brought D&D alignments into this. If you want to concede that Hermione can't be assigned a proper alignment on the Law-Chaos scale --- which means Neutral probably fits her best --- please go ahead.

  I think the larger point I was trying to make is that Hermione should recognize the difference between playing "hard and physical" and "cheating to injure." This particular exchange baffled me as I don't think ACA!Hermione or Canon!Hermione would ever be pulled into this kind of homerism.

On reread, I think that this is, indeed, a possible issue --- though there's no reason to perpetuate bad fanon to make the point. At the same time, Hermione has every incentive to rationalise. Like I wrote, she's the one who told Draco to help the team by obstructing Harry --- to engage in unsportsmanlike behaviour to win. For her to condemn Draco now would be to condemn herself in part. She also has a lot invested in her pride and identity as a Slytherin, caught up in the moment, and resenting Harry for the special treatment that she perceives him as getting. So, I suspect that she might feel bad about it later, but, in the moment, her behaviour makes sense. (That might be worth poking jacobk about.)
