I still think Hermione would tend to fall in the category of Lawful-Good than Neutral-Good. When Hermione disobeys orders, it is because it comes from an authority that doesn't promote goodness. My memory is fuzzy, but I can't recall a scenario in which Dumbledore/McGonagall/whatever authority deemed as good explicitly tells her, "Don't do this" and she disobeys them. But these are shades of gray, a character doesn't just fall in one categorization.

I think the larger point I was trying to make is that Hermione should recognize the difference between playing "hard and physical" and "cheating to injure."

This particular exchange baffled me as I don't think ACA!Hermione or Canon!Hermione would ever be pulled into this kind of homerism.

  ...Hermione was beside herself. "Draco's allowed to hold his position! If anything that's a foul on Potter for running in to him."

Anyone with two eyes knows that Draco was trying to injure Potter and it was nothing about holding position. That Hermione would display this kind of homerism just broke character for me as it seemed like the author was trying too hard to force Dark!Hermione.
