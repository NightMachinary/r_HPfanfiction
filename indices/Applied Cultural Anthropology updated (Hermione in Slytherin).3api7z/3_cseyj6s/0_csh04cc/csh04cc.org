I like your fics and all, but my guess is excessive exposure to fanon is the reason.

Hermione wasn't Lawful Good in canon; why would she be that in Slytherin, of all places? In canon, she only looks Lawful because Harry is Chaotic Good, or, really, Impulsive Good, while Hermione actually tries to think about the consequences of her actions. To the extent that D&D alignments are meaningful, canon Hermione is Neutral Good: most rules and regulations are good idea most of the time, but nothing wrong with defying or breaking them if the cost-benefit calculation works out. (If there's an LG character in canon, it's probably Dumbledore or McGonagall.)

She's the one who all but told him to do it. Perhaps she hadn't intended for him to be so violent about it, but it's not like Hermione is good at figuring out when she's gone too far.

  But perhaps this is her character and she would actually condone Draco's actions. Either way, it painted her as very annoying. Not that she isn't in character, but I make the comparison to AQ. Well written, but it makes me dislike the character.

The problem with AQ, IMO, is not that AQ makes bad decisions and gets in trouble, but that she /never/ learns from her mistakes, no matter how huge and consequential, making the exact same mistakes the year after. Hermione in ACA, on the other hand, is learning the lessons life in Slytherin is teaching her /too/ well. Sneaky, vicious behaviour has paid off for her time and again, starting with her earning her first friend in Slytherin by repaying her bully fivefold in one day, and, most recently, getting Pansy back in line and solidifying Draco's view of her as his leader.
