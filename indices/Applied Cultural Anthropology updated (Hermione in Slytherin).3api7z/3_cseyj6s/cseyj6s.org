For some reason, I just didn't buy Hermione defending Draco's actions. I think regardless of what House she would be still be Lawful-Good and disagree with Draco's blatant cheating.

But perhaps this is her character and she would actually condone Draco's actions. Either way, it painted her as very annoying. Not that she isn't in character, but I make the comparison to AQ. Well written, but it makes me dislike the character.
