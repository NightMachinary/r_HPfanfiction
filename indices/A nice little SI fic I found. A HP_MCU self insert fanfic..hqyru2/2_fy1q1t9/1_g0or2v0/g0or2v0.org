if you are still interested:

- [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki][FanFicFare]] - I recommend the Calibre plugin version... allows you to download a whole =Threadmarks=-page from SB/SV/QQ/AH.

- +[[http://www.omnibuser.com/][Omnibusser]]+ - Combined a =Threadmarks=-page into a epub that one then downloaded... but it has broken down and been discontinued.

- I would stay away from /WebNovel/, as it's owned/run by *Qidian* (Popped up when Noveltranslations got big(ish), strong armed a formerly vibrant scene into moving over Translations to their site by having ownership of original works... then started using MTL^{Machine Translation}-quality Translations while nickle&diming users for access... and stealing translations/novels etc etc.)
