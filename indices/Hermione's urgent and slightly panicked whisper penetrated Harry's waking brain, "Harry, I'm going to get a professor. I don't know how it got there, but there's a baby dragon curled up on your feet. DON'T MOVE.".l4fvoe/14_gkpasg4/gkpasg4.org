"Harry, I don't know how it got there, but there's a baby dragon curled up on your feet. Don't move."

Harry opened one eye. "I knew about the dragon, Hermione. Why are YOU in my bed exactly?" He croaked and shifted to look at her sleepily.

Hermione's face instantly transformed from surprised and worried to red-cheeked and avoiding his gaze. "I... ah, you see... I... we... oh bother."

"I'm not complaining, Hermione. Well, now that I've woken up with you, I suppose I am complaining it won't be every day. So why exactly?"

Hermione's eyes widened and she tentatively looked at him. "I..." She sighed. "I was imagining what it would be like if you were my boyfriend. I'm sorry, Harry, I'll go." She tried to roll off him, but he kept her where she was by holding her thigh in place.

"So don't imagine." He said, looking back into her eyes.

Hermione's cheeks reddened even further, and she took several deep breaths. "Harry, will you... be my boyfriend?"

"About time, Hermione. Of course I will. As if there could be anyone for me but you. And Olive, of course. Isn't that right, baby?" Harry lifted the covers and hissed at his feet.

The dragon started to purr.
