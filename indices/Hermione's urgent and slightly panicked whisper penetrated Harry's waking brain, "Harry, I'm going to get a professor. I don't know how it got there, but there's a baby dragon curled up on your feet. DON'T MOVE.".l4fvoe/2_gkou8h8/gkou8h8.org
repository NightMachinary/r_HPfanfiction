"Don't wake him, Hermione," Harry whispered, sitting up gently. "Are you trying to get me set on fire?"

"No, but-" Hermione looked down at the creature with wide eyes. "Why?"

"Hagrid asked me to look after him." Harry yawned and reached for his glasses. "I figured after Norbert, well, I could handle it."

"It's a dragon, Harry!" Hermione bit out. "Not a Labrador. It could burn your dorm to ash with a sneeze. And why couldn't Hagrid take care of it? You're not the Gamekeeper. This isn't your responsibility!"

As though she'd been summoning a demon, the tiny dragon twitched, letting out a sneeze of fire that set Ron's bed curtains aflame. Harry grabbed his wand and sent a few water charms at the blaze, putting it out as the tiny dragon peacefully slept on.

"What the bloody hell?" Ron sat up, looking around in shock. "Hermione? What're you doing in here? Harry, is that a dragon?"

"Go back to sleep," Harry said, waving his hands. "It's just a dream."

"Oh, okay," Ron said, rolling over onto his side.

"Professor McGonagall will hear about this," Hermione said, reminding Harry of a younger Malfoy.

"Tell me what she says," Harry replied, leaning back on his pillows. "Night, Hermione!"
