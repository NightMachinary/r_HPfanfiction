Harry opened his eyes, blearily. Last night was a blur - he remembered going to Hogsmeade, for a night of celebration that it was all finally over. Voldemort had been defeated - for good this time.

Slowly, more memories started to trickle in. He'd got into a drinking contest with Fred and George, something about their joke shop expanding into alcohol. After that, it remained a mystery - though he remembered something about a Felix Felicis based cocktail.

It took quite a while for him to register exactly what Hermione had said, and it took the remainder of his willpower to not panic. There, indeed, was a baby dragon curled up at his feet. He was in the Gryffindor Common Room, thankfully clothed and with no strange females anywhere in sight, but with a baby Norwegian Ridgeback curled up at his feet.

"H'rmione? Wha... Wha'happened last night?"

Hermione paused. Harry was clearly hung over, slurring his words and looking a mess.

"Well, I remember you getting into a drinking contest, and then going on a walk through Hogsmeade. I think at some point you hugged Ginny and serenaded her-"

Harry woke up even more at that. While at this point everyone knew Harry and Ginny were a couple, it would have still been extremely embarrassing.

"Merlin. Please tell me it wasn't that Weird Sisters song, at least..."

Hermione confirmed that, in fact, it wasn't - it was instead a song by Frank Sinatra. Harry didn't know which was worse, as sober-him knew /exactly/ how ill-suited his voice was for that - but at least the lyrics would have been classy.

"Well, could have been worse. Anyway, how'd I get a baby dragon?"

"That would be where I tell the story" said a new voice. The aforementioned Ginny Weasley. Harry blushed, stammering an apology, but Ginny waved him off. "Don't worry about the song, Harry. It was actually kind of sweet - nice to know you're still a loyal boyfriend even when you're ratted. Didn't even blink at Romilda and Cho Chang flirting with you, just headed straight to me."

Harry blushed even harder, but motioned to her to continue.

"Well, after the serenade, I realized you were obviously plastered - and given the kind of mood you were in, I thought it'd be best to keep an eye on you."

Ginny paused to sit down next to him. The baby dragon, miraculously, didn't respond - it was still fast asleep. Hermione took that moment to leave, making good on her promise to go get a professor - Ginny knew more than she did, in this one instance.

"So, you serenaded me, then tried to snog - emphasis, tried. It was by far not your best work, and I will have fun getting you to do better." Another stammer from Harry was her reward, he was pretty easy to tease in this state.

"After that attempt at snogging, we went off - I steered you away from the Hog's Head, but you managed to find a little pub that I'm sure wasn't even there the day before. I could stop you from buying more drinks, but you did end up playing poker with this bloke from the dragon reserve - did you know Norberta had her first clutch of eggs?"

Harry nodded, absorbing the information as best he could.

"Well, when you realized he was betting a dragon egg, you Stunned him and called the Aurors, but you refused to let the egg go cold so you put it in the fireplace, right there in the pub..."

"And well, it was a lot closer to hatching than it probably should have been. Next thing we knew, there was a Norwegian Ridgeback sitting in the fire."

So that was the full story, Harry mused. At that moment, Professor McGonagall came in, Charlie Weasley in tow - a panting Hermione Granger behind them.

"Well, Mr. Potter. I daresay even your father could not have topped this one - a dragon? In all my years..."

"What confuses me is how docile it's being. From what I remember of Norbert, baby dragons aren't normally this content to just... Sleep, when people are near them." Harry mentioned.

"Well, I think I have an explanation there. Did you, at any point, shoot fire at it from your wand?" Charlie Weasley supplied.

Harry frowned. He couldn't rightly remember doing that, but it sounded like something he would do.

"He did." Ginny supplied. "Said it looked cold, so he'd better warm it up - then cast a fire-lighting charm at it. Got us kicked out of the pub. The dragon kind of followed him around after that."

Charlie suppressed a snicker. "Well, congratulations, I guess. You are now the proud mother of a Norwegian Ridgeback - they imprint on the first thing to shoot fire at them. Professor, sadly I can't actually take this one - unlike Norberta, this dragon actually has someone to call mommy, and they don't like being separated so if I take this one to the reserve it'll destroy everything. All I can do is submit Harry's name for qualification, so at least the Ministry won't have to be on his case - dragons are illegal without a license..."

McGonagall frowned. "Well, Mr. Potter. You heard it, she- or he, is now your responsibility. It's lucky for you that I cannot actually assign a detention, expulsion, or even take points off - of all the dangerous creatures, it just had to be the one that is explicitly 'its own punishment' where the school rules are concerned..."

With that, she walked away, leaving Harry to wonder what exactly he was going to do about this - he supposed he'd have to actually raise a dragon. At least he wouldn't be alone in it - he could make Hagrid's dream come true if he asked the half-giant to help him out.

Harry supposed it could be worse - he could have been arrested. Or worse, expelled.

--------------

This was exactly the sort of nonsense I needed to be proceeding with at this moment, so thank you.

I'm not a fan of Harry/Hermione, personally (it feels like shipping siblings together), so while the prompt mildly suggests that ship, I elected to go in a Harry/Ginny direction. Also, Fred gets to live because a practically-offscreen death is not how we treat important characters (you may also assume this about Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and a few others).
