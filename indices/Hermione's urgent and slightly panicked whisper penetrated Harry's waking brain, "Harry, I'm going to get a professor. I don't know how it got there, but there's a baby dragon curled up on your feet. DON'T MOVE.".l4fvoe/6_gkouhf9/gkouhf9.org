‘Don't move.'

The words floated in Harry's subconscious as if suspended in honey. It took him a few moments to overcome the inertia of his grogginess and process what Hermione had said.

A dragon.

A dragon?

/A dragon./

Aha. This was it then. He cracked one eyelid and gazed down toward his feet -- swelteringly hot despite the fresh morning air.

Sure enough, the dragon was there. As advertised. As /planned./ Harry gave a lazy, languid stretch and shuffled up into a sitting position. He brushed a stray leaf out of his hair. Nothing like a little end-of-year camping out in the castle grounds to unwind before the term ended and make the most of the balmy weather.

Hermione's footfalls faded quickly. Harry counted to twenty, then stuck two fingers in his mouth and whistled. A great, rustling sound came from the bushes to his right, and out popped the bearded face of Rubeus Hagrid. The rest of his body followed soon after.

‘I don't know about this, Harry...' he mumbled.

Harry just flashed his best winning smile and tapped his watch. Time was of the essence.

Five minutes, two stubbed toes and thirty-seven bad words later, they were set. Harry scurried into the foliage with Hagrid and found a suitable vantage point, peeking back out at the clearing he had recently vacated with a gleeful grin across his face.

They didn't have long to wait.

Hermione's voice reached them first.

‘Harry, nobody was awake! But I banged on Professor McGonagall's door until she stirred. She threatened to turn me into a turkey, but she's coming! Just hold on, she'll be here-- /aaaahhh!/'

Hermione had entered the clearing. Harry felt that his face might actually split in two, he was grinning so hard.

Where the small, juvenile Welsh Green /had/ been sitting when Hermione left, there was now a slightly larger dragon. Same colouration, same markings, only about two feet longer and much, /much/ fatter. Hagrid called him Porky.

‘/Harry!'/

Hermione's wail roused every bird within about a three mile radius. She collapsed to the ground, pulling at her hair. Her face was a mask of agony. Harry had a slight inclination that he just /might/ have gone a little far, here.

Porky, true to his name, simply cracked one eyelid and grunted, not fussed in the least.

‘How /could/ you?!'

Harry wasn't sure if this was addressed at himself, or the dragon. He and Hagrid had messed up his bedroll good and proper. A splash of fake blood and a ripped sleeve of his pyjamas. It just might have been his finest work.

‘You can't, Harry. You can't leave me.'

There was real grief now. An uncomfortable twisting sensation squirmed in Harry's gut. Behind him, Hagrid shifted his weight awkwardly.

‘Not after all we've been through. Everything that still lay ahead of us. I was... I'd been thinking. It was time for /us,/ Harry. Together. Truth is, it's /all/ I've been thinking about, lately. I'm almost positive I failed an O.W.L or two. And now...'

The wailing started again. /Oh, shit./

From behind, Hagrid gave Harry a firm nudge. Harry tried to shake his head. Hagrid tossed him bodily into the clearing.

‘/Aiii!/ What are you--? /Harry?'/

Harry swallowed audibly. ‘Surprise.'

Hermione's eyes darted from him, to his torn-up bedroll, to the fat dragon squatting on his pillow, and back. It didn't take Hermione Granger long to figure things out, and today was no exception.

‘Harry Potter, you little--'

/‘Oof!'/

Balled fist met solar plexus. On the list of all the things that she was good at, why did throwing punches have to be on it?

He doubled over, slowly sinking to the ground as Hermione elaborated in great detail as to the error of his ways.

She climbed atop him to further his education. A few finger jabs in the chest drove home points he barely comprehended. Little existed beyond the sudden, cavernous shortness of breath.

A bubble of coherent thought rose to the surface. He thought on Hermione's earlier words. A moment of daring followed shortly after. He snatched another finger jab from mid-air, leaned suddenly forwards, and kissed her.

And all his pains melted away.
