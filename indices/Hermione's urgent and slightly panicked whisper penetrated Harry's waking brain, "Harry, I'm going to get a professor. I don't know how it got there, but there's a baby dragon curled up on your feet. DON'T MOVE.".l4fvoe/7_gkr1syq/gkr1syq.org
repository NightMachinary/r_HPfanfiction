"Wha...?"

Harry blinked blurrily up at her, his brain still slow and fogged from sleep; the best one he's had in while. As his vision clears he notices the following: Ron is standing next to his bed, face pale and eyes wide and staring at something down by his feet; the baby dragon, just hatched it seems, curled around his feet, marron scales shimmering gold with youth; and Hermione's wide eyes, standing by the door, Professor Snowbell's forearm clutched firmly in Hermione's frightened grasp.

"Oh."

He looked down again and slowly draws his knees up to his chest, disturbing the sheets. The Firehorn whimpers and shifts. He pauses. The dragon curls into itself and settles. Harry moves again, this time not pausing until he has his knees firmly to his chest, his arms wrapped around himself.

"He's actually kinda cute, isn't he?"

Hermione blanches, although Snowbell--who had approached his bed but didn't dare get too close--looks like she's contemplating his words, then nods a knowing smile dancing on her thin lips.

"You, Mr. Potter, are one of the lucky few to experience a South-African Firehorn mate."

He chokes, shooting her a startled look. "/Mate?"/

Snowbell laughs, apparently having gotten this response quite a lot. He can't imagine why.

"Not in the way you must think. Much like Ashwinders, Firehorns are born from the remains of magical fires left to burn unchecked. Unlike Ashwinders, however, Firehorns are not wild nor free-spirited by any means. When they are quite young--this one seems to be not more than a fortnight born--they find a witch or wizard with unquestioning loyalty and a bounty amount of magical power and mate for life. You become their...well, there isn't really a word for it. Owner or master would be closest, I suppose, but not quite the dynamic. Partnership, maybe. You are theirs and they are yours. Quite remarkable, isn't it? No one has seen a true one for almost two centuries."

"Why?" Hermione's eyes are bright with curiosity and she has that look she gets when there's something interested to be learned.

"Because they die." The words were factual, yet remorseful. As if Snowbell felt this on a personal level. "When there isn't a powerful enough witchard near at the time of their birth and they are left unmated for any longer than one month, they die."

"Oh."

"Well we ought to let you get back to sleep, no? Big day tomorrow. I remember my own graduation..." Her voice trails off as she leaves with Hermione, presumably waxing about the grandiose occasion her own graduation had been.

He smiles back down at the dragon and lets his feet down. He allows the Firehorn--he thinks he'll name it Mushu--to crawl up his bed and settle in his arm. He closes his eyes, but doesn't miss the glance Ron throws him as his friend settles back into his own bed.

AN: I'm actually very proud of this. I wrote it(and came up with the South-African Firehorn dragon species and that information) in less than five minutes. I didn't even edit. I'm loving this. It's actually very good, isn't it?
