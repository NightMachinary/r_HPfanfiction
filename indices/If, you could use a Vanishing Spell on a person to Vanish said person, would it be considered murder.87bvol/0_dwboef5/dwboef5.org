I think it would depend on intent. If you intentionally do it with the thought of getting rid of the person forever. Yeah, that's pretty much murder.

If you're like going to vanish your trash and it reflects off that mirror you forgot you threw away and hits your best bud in the head and bam he's gone. Well, probably just manslaughter.
