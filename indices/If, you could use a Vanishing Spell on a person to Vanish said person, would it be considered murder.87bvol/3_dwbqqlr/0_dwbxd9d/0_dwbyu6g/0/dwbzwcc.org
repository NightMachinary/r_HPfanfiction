  for example in order of phoenix to hide parchment when Harry entered a room.

I don't remember this instance. Does it say the parchment was vanished or did it say it just disappeared (through means unknown)?

  And I was under the impression that vanishing cabinets vanish you and conjure you at the different end. Otherwise the name wouldn't really be fitting.

The 'Vanishing' bit simply refers to the fact that the contents are gone from the cabinet they were placed in (and appear at the other), but they obviously aren't vanished since they are teleported elsewhere (or in the case of a cabinet with a broken pair, sent to some kind of limbo). They were used in the first Wizarding War to get families away from danger, hence vanishing cabinet. McGonagall said that Vanished objects are gone, they go into non-being.
