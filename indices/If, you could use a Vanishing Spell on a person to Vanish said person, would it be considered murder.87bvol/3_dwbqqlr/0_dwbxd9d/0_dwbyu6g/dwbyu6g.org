  Since when is Vanishing reversible?
#+end_quote

the have been instances in canon where vanishing was used to temporarily remove an object. for example in order of phoenix to hide parchment when Harry entered a room.

And I was under the impression that vanishing cabinets vanish you and conjure you at the different end. Otherwise the name wouldn't really be fitting.
