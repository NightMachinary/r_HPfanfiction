No one in canon was Vanished, but the OP asked 'if you could Vanish a person...'. The Vanishing class in 5th year Transfiguration included several instances of un-Vanishing. Therefore, 'a Vanished person' assumes that the person could be and was Vanished.

Also, my headcanon is that this is how house-elves travel, which is why they aren't affected by anti-Apparation jinxes.
