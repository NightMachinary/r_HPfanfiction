In the broken Vanishing Cabinet, which was more like a teleporter imo. Supposed to teleport between 2 linked cabinets (like in the end of Half Blood Prince) but it was broken so it put you in like a midway place that you can't escape from normally.

I think Vanashing is a bit of a misnomer. It's more like teleporting items somewhere (Vanishing items to the dump or scrolls to somewhere hidden like in lower down this thread) and the cabinet was a special case because it was enchanted to Vanish its entire contents instead of a specific item, which allows for teleporting people.
