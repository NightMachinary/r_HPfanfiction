In the linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19339288/chapters/46005901]]) and sequels, Harry Potter is killed along with Voldemort on the Halloween of 1981. The rest of the characters never know him.

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee) features a post-DH Harry transmigrated to an AU whose indigenous Harry was killed in a car accident along with the Dursleys. (This results in very different political dynamics in that world.)
