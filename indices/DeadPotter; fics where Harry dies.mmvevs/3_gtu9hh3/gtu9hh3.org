I am getting annoyed with myself right now. I know I've read a fic like that before.

(I'll leave a general overview of the plot if someone knows what it is and would link it, I'm looking for that author too)

Harry was beaten to the point of death, and in the last few moments he died, a massive burst of accidental magic caused an explosion at Privet Drive. The Hogwarts staff found out the next day, I believe. In one of the epilogue parts, it said that Sirius died in Azkaban because he never had a reason to breakout.
