1. I have a headcanon that, out of Molly's children, only Percy and Bill completed 7th year. Charlie spent the summer after 5th year with a friend in Romania, and they visited the dragon sanctuary. He came back and attended 6th year for only about 3 months (during which he was Quidditch Captain.) He left right after his 17th birthday, returning to Romania and receiving a number of Howlers from Molly that he just ignored. (And Ginny and Ron just didn't return to school after DH.)

2. Kingsley was put on Sirius' case in GoF. He did suspect that Harry somehow helped him escape and was keeping in touch with him, and he even knew of some Sirius Black sightings around Hogwarts. He was at the school during the final task, planning to speak to Harry after it was over (and using the event as a way to avoid being blocked by Dumbledore.) He believed Voldemort was back because he saw Harry that day in the aftermath of the graveyard.
