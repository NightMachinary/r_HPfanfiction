  Kingsley was put on Sirius' case in GoF. He did suspect that Harry somehow helped him escape and was keeping in touch with him, and he even knew of some Sirius Black sightings around Hogwarts. He was at the school during the final task, planning to speak to Harry after it was over (and using the event as a way to avoid being blocked by Dumbledore.) He believed Voldemort was back because he saw Harry that day in the aftermath of the graveyard.

This sounds like it'd be a great fic.
