Isn't Kingsley working on Sirius' case canon? Anyway, he is such a great character who is criminally underutilized in fics. Mostly he is just there in the background as an Auror, Order member or later Minister for Magic. I want shipfics! Fics about him leading the resistance after Voldemort took over! So many possibilities
