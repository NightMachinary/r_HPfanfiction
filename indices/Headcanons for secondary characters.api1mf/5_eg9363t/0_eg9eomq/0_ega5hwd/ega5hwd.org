Yeah, it's canon that he was on the case in OotP. The headcanon part is when he got put on the case, how close to the truth he was, and him being present at the Triwizard Tournament and believing Voldemort's return primarily because of Harry.

I agree that there's not enough Kingsley. This is a wizard that managed to get some respect from even the Dursleys. He's special. I'd read a time travel/redo fic with him as the lead, Kingsley becoming Harry's mentor post-ootp, or whatever. In fact, thinking about this has just made me want a Kingsley/Lily fic in a world where only James gave his life for Harry.
