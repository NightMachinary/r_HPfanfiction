I have a headcanon where Snape, Minerva, Filius and even Pomona end up talking about Dumbledore and the school as a whole.

"Did you hear that Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas got together? Filius whispered, looking around as though they would suddenly appear in mid air.

"No! I thought that the youngest Weasley would end up with Harry!" Pomona murmured; a hand over her mouth in shock.

Severus scoffed and turned to leaf through his Potions book; to see if there were any particular questions he could ask the younger years, that they wouldn't get, so he could properly scold them.

"I'm sure it's just a matter of time," Minerva joined in, matter of factly.

"I'll give it a year before young Weasley and Harry are together." Pomona said.

"I'd give it 6 months." Filius said.

"You're on! Loser has to buy the best of the best Firewhiskey." Pomona said.

"Deal!" Filius agreed, shaking hands with her.

Just that idea is so funny to me.
