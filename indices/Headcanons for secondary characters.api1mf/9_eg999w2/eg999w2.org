I love the idea of a few of the teachers (ie, Snape, McGonagall, et cetera) just meeting up every once in a blue moon and having a night where they put aside their differences and just get pissed together. It's their way of coping with the insanity that is Hogwarts. (This is especially true in fics where all of the students are pranksters, mini-lords, insane or /whatever/, because the teachers in those fics really need some sort of support group.)

Outside of that, I think linkffn(Slytherin Career Day) has some of my favourite adaptations of a few of the Slytherin students. /Especially/ Daphne and Blaise. And Pansy. And/---okay,/ they're all brilliant.
