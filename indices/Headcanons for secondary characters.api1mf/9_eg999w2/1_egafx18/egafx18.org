Ditto about the teachers. I like to imagine that Snape and Professor Burbage (Muggle Studies) spent a lot of time together, too. In Malfoy's Manor, Burbage called for Snape to help her saying that they were friends.

+linkffn(Just Another Tuesday)+ linkffn(Just A Random Tuesday) has some pretty good teacher interaction.

Edit. lol what mix up. /Totally/ different stories. sorry
