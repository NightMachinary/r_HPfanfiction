Crabbe and Goyle are actually savant druids. They understand magic in a different way than what is taught and can't explain it to the others in Slytherin due to their paranoia that different = bad. As a result they keep silent unless when talked to and speak in a simplified manor, as they are enraptured into the magic in the air surrounding them.

Flitwick started the choir in the hopes of finding another bard (he supplements his charms and dueling with song spells that he's created).

Professor Sinistra is actually a vampire, which is why you don't see her except for her classes or at night. Part of her contract was only taking of animals blood, which is why she was such good friends with Grubbly-Plank and Hagrid.
