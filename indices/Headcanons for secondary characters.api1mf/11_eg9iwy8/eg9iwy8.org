I never really understood Fleur moving to the UK and starting a part-time job at Gringotts. We know from the books that the Advanced Guard took Harry to Grimmauld Place on the 6th of August 1995, and we find out from Fred and George that Bill is helping her "improve her English". It's safe to assume she moved there in July.

​

Okay, why the hell would you move from France to the UK after you participated in a deadly tournament, which was completely staged by a fucking Death Eater, obviously meant to secure the opposing school's win, and which ended in another champion's DEATH and, also, the resurrection of the darkest wizard of all time?? And only mere weeks/days after it happened.. WHAT!!!

​

I've read fics where she did it because she wanted to help, or that she was trying to prove she was brave. I don't buy it. I find something like that sappy and unoriginal.

​

My headcanon is that she did something *bad*, either during her stay at Hogwarts or as soon as she came back home. She had to run away, ashamed, and she decided to go to Britain.

This stupid idea came to me two nights ago, and I started writing a fanfic. Of course, with this kind of thing, you can go in various directions. For example, the bad thing she did was being falsely accused of murder/she actually committed murder/she stole something - ta-dah, here you go, a crime fanfic. I am unfortunately feeling very sentimental lately, so I am writing a romance/mystery story, but oh well, it's an idea.
