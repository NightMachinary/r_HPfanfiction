Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar, If Looks could Kill) Voldemort's immortality came from the Dark Mark, so every Death Eater had to die to ensure Voldemort would never return. In the former, he killed all of them but Snape (Who had his arm cut off) by using the blood connection created by Riddle's resurrection to hack the network and then fry it with all the fury of a Thunderbird, and in the latter, he had his army of Basilisk's kill all but Peter and Voldemort, after Harry got all the relevant information from their minds, and had Pettigrew thrown through the Veil, and killed Voldemort himself with a Killing Curse to the forehead.
