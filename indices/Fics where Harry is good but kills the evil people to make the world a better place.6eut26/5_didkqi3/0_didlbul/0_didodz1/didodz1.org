Yeah. Harry going from "We're back in time! Let's prevent the holocaust and the end of the world by killing the nazi leaders" into "I shouldn't have killed Goebbels! Now his child is sad" simply was too damn stupid. Especially after he lived through said holocaust.

It might have worked if the two actually had gone overboard - but killing marked Death Eaters, after all they have gone through in the future? That was a very proportionate response.
