Hardly, if they were truly decent there wouldn't be so much bashing.

Anyway, there was no trace of those pairings until the last book or two, and even the author said that they weren't good choices.. She obviously put Ron with Hermione because that way all main characters were together. Or are you going to tell me that those two pairings weren't completely forced and out of nowhere?? Harry had less words with Ginny that he had with Pig the owl.. and less not talk of Hermione and Ron..
