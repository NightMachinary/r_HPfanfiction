Yule Ball?? Where Ron did not even though she was a girl until the very end?? Yeah once she was fixed up both guys stared at her, and Ron got angry and jelous like its normal for him. It never indicated that Hermione would tolerate Ron as anything more than a somewhat friend. Their personalities clash so violently that it would be a shouting match every day, not exactly a loving environment.

Harry and Ginny's scenes were completely forced and out of fucking nowhere, if she at least had spend some time with them in the rest of the books...

Also, the author said the same thing in an interview. She forced it and regretted it.
