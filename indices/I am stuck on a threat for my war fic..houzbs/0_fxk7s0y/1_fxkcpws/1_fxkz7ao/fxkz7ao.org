I don't think it's possible for a group of humans to hate all other humans. Maybe they're super unethical, experimenting on children, creating science based mind controlled slaves/weapons, and they do it to both muggles and magicals, which sends the Death Eaters into a frenzy.

But also, aliens. Sure it's been done before, but that's because it works.
