May I suggest the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society][Thule Society]] as it ticks the required boxes.\\
It's got a (mild) link to the Nazis (and thus possibly Grindlewald), has been /officially/ disbanded since 1925 (who knows what they got up to after going underground...) and are /public domain/ bad guys, so are available to use.
