The Wizengamot is, contrary to common fanon, a court, not the wizard equivalent of the House of Lords.

I assume that separation of powers exists to some degree in the magical world, so I guess there's a parliament too, separate from the wizengamot. (maybe call it a senate because that sounds more ancient).
