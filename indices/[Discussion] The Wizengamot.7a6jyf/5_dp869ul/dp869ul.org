think of it like this.

a bunch of savages get together in the wild and figure out how to farm

they stay in a group and split off into a bunch of families

they discover a need to work as a group for common projects like a road to the lake and electing a sheriff to stop jimmy from pissing in the pig trough again

so how do you go about making this group? easy, the people that are generally considered to have power over others are part of it. so basically the dad in every house in the small town.

eventually this gets half-assed because nonsense laws are decided on the fly like no jumping off the tree outside the pub when margeries dogs are nearby.

once this ad-hoc stuff gets big enough they need to formalize a bit. everyone whose already part of the house circle gets grandfathered into the new council which is now a bit more legitimate since they decided to write things down finally. so now instead of meeting at the pub every saturday they have an building with a meeting room and a person to write down their decisions. it's also a bit more difficult to become part of the new council because with formalization comes exclusivity.

also magic exists so the halfassed jackassery that was magically built into their laws was also grandfathered in as well and continues to be added.

everything evolves from there.

half-assed ideas that made it into formalized law and magic when combined with exclusivity over generations results in a sort of Nobility and ruling body for the region who have a better internal understanding of the laws than anyone else. they've come a long way from asking sheriff joe to kick jimmy in the dick again.
