About the Wizengamot, there are some key facts that must be remembered

- It is not hereditary
- It is not exclusive to pure-bloods
- It is largely redundant

Firstly, Lucius was NOT a member of the Wizengamot, even despite how close he was to Fudge and despite the Malfoys being an ancient pure-blood wizarding family. This should speak volumes to the fact that simply being a rich pure-blood family is not going to get someone into the Wizengamot, even if that rich pure-blood has close ties to the Minister.

Secondly, both Dumbledore and Umbridge were apart of the Wizengamot despite neither being pure-blood and neither coming from wealthy backgrounds. Even if you ignored Pottermore, its basically spelled out in Deathly Hallows that Umbridge isn't a pure-blood by the way she lies about the Slytherin locket, claiming it to be a Selwyn family locket and also claiming she descended from the Selwyn family.

Third, as others have noted, Arthur Weasley was able to get the Muggle Protection Act passed despite his low position. If the Wizengamot was a legislative body, then its made redundant by the fact that seemingly every Ministry official can write up legislation and get it passed. Even if that Ministry official is a low-ranked employee from a family of known blood traitors.

Finally, the Wizengamot is weak. This one is my opinion rather than a canonical fact like the rest. Yes, it can remove the Ministry for Magic under certain conditions, but Muggle Britain has the 'vote of no confidence'. If a Minister for Magic was deemed incompetent and/or a threat to the Statute of Secrecy, then the Wizengamot could have the Minister removed. There is a reason that Tom Riddle's professors (except Dumbledore) thought it was likely that Riddle would end up the Minister for Magic, not the head of the Wizengamot. Since being the Minister for Magic is ultimately a far superior position than being a mere Wizengamot member. Being head of the Auror Office, let alone the Department of Magical Law Enforcement would be a higher position than being a mere Wizengamot member. I'd even argue that being either a headmaster, deputy head, or head of house at Hogwarts would each be more prestigious than being a member of the Wizengamot.

Remember that the wizarding world is a democracy, despite how often fanon forgets this fact. Most notably in DH, Lee Jordan said he would vote for Kingsley, so the wizarding world being a democracy was always canon. Wizards decide the Minister by voting, with the implication being that there are no political parties in the wizarding world since every candidate runs independently from each other. Coupled with the Ministry being made up of employees who gained their position on merit, along with an elected Minister for Magic, its easy to see why the Ministry seems like it never changes. It would be like if David Cameron's 2010 cabinet was made up of the same people as Gordon Brown's cabinet. The Minister of Magic must get democratically elected by the electorate and, like Muggle Britain's prime ministers, the Minister for Magic can be removed by a vote of no confidence. Fudge's actions in OotP in regards to Voldemort would basically be the wizarding equivalent of Chamberlain's failed appeasement of Hitler. The main difference being is that Chamberlain's appeasement gave Britain more time to prepare for the coming war; Fudge's appeasement of Voldemort had no positive outcome for the wizarding world. Hence why Fudge was immediately removed following his failure. I suppose a more fair example would comparing Fudge's forced removal to James Callaghan's removal following the Winter of Discontent in 1979.
