I assumed that in cannon the Wizengamot was a general governing and court system filled with hereditary members. As the requirements were hereditary this also led me to automatically assume that the majority of the members don't know the majority of the laws. I feel that making it "Lordless" would logically make it more law-abiding and would pretty much instantly derail almost all plot points concerning the Ministry of Magic.

I mean really, one of the first things I realized when thinking about the rules and laws of the British Wizarding World is that they seem to have mostly decent laws, but no one follows them, even Dumbledore constantly breaks what seem to be existing laws at his leisure.
