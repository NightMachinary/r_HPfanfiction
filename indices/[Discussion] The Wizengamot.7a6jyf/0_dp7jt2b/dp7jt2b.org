From the original Books, I get the impression that the Wizengamot only served as a judicial body, but did not have legislative powers. For example, Arthur Weasley, who ranked relatively low on Ministry hierarchy and was not a member of Wizengamot, was able to jam through the controversial Muggle Protection Act. Later, Fudge was able to appoint a High Inquisitor without Wizengamot input, although two members resigned in protest. He was able to further pass many educational decrees at will. Throughout the Books, there wasn't any instance of Wizengamot debating and passing laws.
