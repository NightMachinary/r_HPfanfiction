I'm not sure that wizarding Britain has such a strong idea of separation of powers that the Wizengamot can be defined as a judicial or legislative body. I doubt that wizarding Britain has anything like a codified constitution and as such I suspect that the Wizengamot is a body with loosely defined powers and purpose largely based on convention - essentially a council of influential people whose power, like earlier British Parliaments, likely rises and falls with the calibre of its members as well as the relative strength of executive leadership.

The etymology of the name, from the Anglo-Saxon "Witenagemot", is suggestive - an informal, ad hoc precursor to Parliament with an undefined membership consisting of whoever happened to have influence at the time, with loose powers.

Further there *are* clues here and there that the Wizengamot's power extends beyond what we Muggles would consider judicial, such as the power to remove the Minister for Magic (or force them to resign, as the Muggle British Parliament does). We know from Pottermore that the Wizengamot has this power, but even if Pottermore hadn't made it clear, there's still the issue of Fudge at the end of OotP. There is clearly some institution/process which has the power to force the Minister for Magic out of power without a fresh election. Further, from HBP, there is clearly a process whereby a new Minister can be /appointed/ without fresh elections. The Wizenagemot is the only body that we know of that would fit the bill, even without Pottermore.

But it is also clear that the executive has broad powers.

In relation to some of your specific comments:

  For example, Arthur Weasley, who ranked relatively low on Ministry hierarchy and was not a member of Wizengamot, was able to jam through the controversial Muggle Protection Act.

Firstly it is interesting to note that the Muggle Protection Act was named as such, compared to later legislation which is always referred to as a Decree. "Act" is typically associated with legislation passed by a legislature whereas "Decree" is typically associated with secondary legislation (i.e. legislation passed directly into law by the executive). Indeed, the fact that the Muggle Protection Act was difficult to pass suggests some kind of legislative debate, whereas an executive order of some kind would presumably be within Arthur's power to pass directly.

Regardless, the executive having power to write legislation does not exclude the possibility of a legislature. The Muggle British executive passes far more legislation in the form of Statutory Instruments than Parliament does in the form of Acts.

  Later, Fudge was able to appoint a High Inquisitor without Wizengamot input, although two members resigned in protest. He was able to further pass many educational decrees at will.

It's worth mentioning again that the Muggle British government has complete discretion to use its executive power to rearrange the provision of education in terms of its structure, the individuals charged with running various services, etc. Again, this does not mean that there is no legislature.
