While Lords do fit with the universe, should be pretty easy to come up with some alternative systems to play with. What we know about governance in the wizarding world':

- It is either a low power institution or can be easily deadlocked/sidelined. The executive branch seems to hold some power, and while they show concern about public opinion in the books, they do not really worry about other parts of the government.
- It does a poor job: Multiple wars with pathetic government response would suggest it has a loose hand at governing. Likely without a strong incorporating document / nationalist inspiring institutions.
- It is old
- It evolved from a previous form of government. (Not revolutionary)
- Excludes sentient magical creatured

I would start with your "British wizarding council" and give them some interesting rules. Then imagine how those would evolve into the modern government.

Some ideas on how the old, pre ministry system could have worked:

- Fixed number of government members, membership passing on assassination
- Fixed Number of government members, membership going to whoever holds some magical trinket
- Fixed Government Members, when one dies some feat of magic is held to pick successor.
- Open membership, limited to those who can prove themselves somehow.
- Some sort of geographical system

Now take that and imagine it evolving to a tamer ministry system. If your council of wizards used assassination to pick successors, maybe the ministry uses a symbolic ritual, where the new member symbolically 'kills' the previous abdicating member when he is retiring.

Have fun with it!
