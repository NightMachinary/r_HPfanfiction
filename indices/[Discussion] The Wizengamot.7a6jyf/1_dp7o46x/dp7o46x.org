As mentioned above in response to InquisitorCOC, the Wizengamot's name is based on the Anglo-Saxon "Witenagemot", an informal, ad hoc precursor to Parliament with an undefined membership consisting of whoever happened to have influence at the time. I would suggest that this is a good direction to take for Wizengamot membership - it is attended by the influential. One possibility that I feel suits the conservative nature of the world as well as the relative informality of wizarding political process is that members would be appointed by the current membership by consensus (not the same thing as unanimity, as you don't vote in consensus. It's more discussion-based. Success doesn't mean convincing everyone you're right, it just means convincing those opposed to withdraw their objections).

As for when they meet, it depends on what you mean by "they". I think it's clear from Dumbledore's comments in OotP that Wizengamot meetings have different levels of attendance and that full meetings are relatively rare. But probably sub-committees of the Wizengamot with specific functions (e.g. the more limited, low-key hearing that Harry /should/ have got for his underage magic) meet on a more regular basis.

As for Lords, no, there's no evidence in canon that a wizarding nobility exists. But it's worth mentioning (as always) that this does not exclude the possibility of wizards happening to hold Muggle noble titles. From what we know about how the Malfoy family came to England and their later activities within the country, it is highly likely that the Malfoys hold a Muggle noble title (i.e. of the rank of Baron or above. Likely above given their proximity to royalty).
