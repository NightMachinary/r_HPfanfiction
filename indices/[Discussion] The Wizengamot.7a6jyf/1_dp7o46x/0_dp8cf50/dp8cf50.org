I'm not sure you could call the Witengamot's membership 'undefined' really. There may have been a lot of fluctuation in attendance at the individual witan's based on member's availability and popularity with the King, but anyone who held a position as Thegn, Ealdorman or higher level Clergy (Bishops, Abbots, Abbesses and Arch-Bishops) could attend. As a note, being a Thegn was inheritable, but also a position you could be advanced to, while the Ealdorman were technically appointed on merit from the Thegns.

How I update the Witan system is for the Minister (taking the position of a combination of the King and the modern British cabinet) to have his own small group of advisors in his office to generate his legislation, which can be passed by executive decree.

The Wizengamot is then made up of the Minister and his direct underlings (how Umbridge got in), the major department heads and then a series of local representatives (taking the place of the Thegns), and a fixed number of people appointed by the rest of the Wizengamot due to achievement (so, when one leaves someone new is invited in). Any office head is allowed to draft and submit laws to the Wizengamot to be screened, and then debated to be passed by vote.

This does make it a predominantly legislative body (though this is set up for post-canon when more separation-of-powers has been done). But as you say, there would certainly be sub-committees working on things, and one of them would be for enforcing the laws they've made (perhaps Wizards see enforcement of laws as an aspect of creating them, and thus have to be dealt with by the same people?).

If you want to largely get rid of the judicial part though, even in canon, it could be argued that Wizards subscribe to the jury being drawn from the victim's peers, so crimes against the law must be tried by the lawmakers. This would add the subtext of Fudge trying Harry for treason in OotP
