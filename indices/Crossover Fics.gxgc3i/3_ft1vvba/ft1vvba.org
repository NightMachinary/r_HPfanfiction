My favourite is Conectionary Chronicles - it's a crossover with Supernatural, it should also be perfectly fine if you don't know the series. Hermione is the main character, she begins praying to Loki when she is little (first story in the series is pre-Hogwarts, the second is her first year, it's still in progress and amazing) - and Loki/Gabriel is the one from Supernatural. It's so brilliantly done.
