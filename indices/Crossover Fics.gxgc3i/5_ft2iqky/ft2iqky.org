Let's see...

- /Harry Potter, Squatter/ - a crossover between /Harry Potter/ and the /Percy Jackson and the Olympians/ series. The story pulls characters mostly from the Percy Jackson series, but so far as I can tell, has not yet crossed into canon territory(though admittedly, I've not read the Percy Jackson sister series featuring the Roman counterparts). It's incomplete, but still being updated, the latest update being just a couple days ago. It's mostly lighter and softer than /The Olympians/ series, so it might annoy you if you're looking for something with more edge to it.

- /Brown Coat, Green Eyes/ - a crossover between /Harry Potter/ and /Firefly/Serenity/, taking place in the distant future, after both series(Doesn't follow DH epilogue). I enjoyed it despite not having actually watched /Firefly/Serenity/.

- /Ah, Screw It/, /What's a Gungan?/, and /Harry Potter: Geth/ - crossovers between /Stargate SG1/Atlantis/, /Star Wars/, and /Mass Effect/ respectively. All three of them are by mjimeyg, and all three of them basically involve Super!Harry basically falling into the role of King/Emperor almost by accident. Aside from sharing similar themes, they're not actually connected with eachother. Of the three, /Harry Potter: Geth/ is my favorite.

- /Steve and the Barkeep/ - Low key. Just a couple of guys, who happen to be superheroes, having a drink.

- /Lightning Dragon's Roar/ - A rather massive crossover. It starts out in Harry Potter universe, with Harry being inspired by the manga /Fairy Tail/, to try to learn magic by eating lightning. It starts bringing in elements from other universes, like /Devil May Cry/; /Stargate SG1/; /Smallville/(and other DC universe elements); /Dresden Files/; and, most recently, /Ranma 1/2/.

Let me know if you want any more recommendations.
