In the firebird trilogy were the cores ever fleshed out more? I only got to the 2nd one before I quit. I may have forgotten, but what I remember was that users had magical cores that went towards a certain type of magic and some were more powerful than others. The second part is essentially in every story even if it's not explicitly said.
