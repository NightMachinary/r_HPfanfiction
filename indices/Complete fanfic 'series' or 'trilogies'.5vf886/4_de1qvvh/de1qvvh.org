linkffn(Firebird's Son;Firebird's Song;Firebird's Fury) - Probably the only fic with well done magical cores. Overlong introduction, very good middle, and end arc that fails to deliver on earlier build-up but still manages to be pretty good.

linkffn(The Ring of Gold;The Amulet of Stone;The Jewel of Darkness) - Haven't read it yet, but I've heard mainly positive opinions (though that really doesn't mean much).
