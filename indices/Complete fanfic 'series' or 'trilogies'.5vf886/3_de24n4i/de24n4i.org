[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=474910&i=][Ignite]] and its sequels are all really good next-gen stories, collectively called the Stygian Triology.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

It's actually preceded by the Anguis series, which is also a really good series, set in between the books. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]. You don't have to read it first.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

Side Note: I noticed you stated an interest in a non-mediocre main character. Both Stygian and Anguis have varying casts of characters, several of whom are probably above average in the Wizarding World in terms of magical prowess-but maybe not Dumbledores/Voldemorts.
