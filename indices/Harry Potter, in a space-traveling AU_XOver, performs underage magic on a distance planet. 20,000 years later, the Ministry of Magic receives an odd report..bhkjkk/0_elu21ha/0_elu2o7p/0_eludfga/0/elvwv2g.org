Not going to lie, there are some cool ideas in HPMoR but the execution is shaky. Concepts like the Interdict of Merlin and temporary Transfiguration would be interesting concepts, if they were consistently adhered to.

Since HPMoR has spawned fanfics of its own, it's possible to see just how interesting those concepts are in the hands of alternate authors.
