I like the HPMOR/Yudowsky approach. (And I know that fanfiction isn't universally loved, but I thought this was clever for a Sci-Fi crossover.)

Magic is the way the universe actually works, and all things being equal everyone would be wizards. The laws of physics is how the universe or past life forms have prevented the universe from being destroyed from every living thing essentially having the "Wish" spell from DnD.

So there isn't a gene that makes you a wizard, instead it's a really common Gene that makes you a muggle and over the generations it has a chance to break down and create a muggle-born wizard.
