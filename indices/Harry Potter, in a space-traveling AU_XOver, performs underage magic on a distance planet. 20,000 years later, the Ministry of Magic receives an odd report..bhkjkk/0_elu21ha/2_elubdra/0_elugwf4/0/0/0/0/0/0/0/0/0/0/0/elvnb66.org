1) in fourth year, Dumbledore definitely conjures a tea tray. That's the canon word, conjured.

2) using a wand at all implies magic. If it were just a gesture driven command given to an elf, why bother drawing your wand at all? That was my point.

3) the conjuring food if you know enough about it chemically thing is an interesting thought experiment, but would probably cost more energy to cast than what you would get eating the Apple, so also impractical.

I don't think she conjured it, though Dumbledore clearly did elsewhere, but summoning fits better here imo than house elf. When Dumbledore starts a feast, he gestures with his hands, not his wand. Which prompts the elves.
