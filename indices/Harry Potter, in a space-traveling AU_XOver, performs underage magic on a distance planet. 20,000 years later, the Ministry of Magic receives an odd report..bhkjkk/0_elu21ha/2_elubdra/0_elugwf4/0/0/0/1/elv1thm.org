I always thought she conjured them instead of summoned them, but that was before we knew about gamp's law. I doubt Rowling thought it through, but we could imagine that instead of summoning them Accio-style, she magically moved them from somewhere else to the office - much like the food moves from the kitchens to the great hall. Summoning is different as it requires the object to move through space, whereas in this case it is more like apparition of an object.
