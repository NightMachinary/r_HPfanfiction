Snape got to them first. Then he went to get McGonagall. Then she walked to his office from wherever she was. So she could have directed an elf to "put food on Snape's desk when I point at it". And the "problem" with magic operating at light speed is that in this case, the summoning spell doesn't work at light speed. It pulls whatever you summon from where it is as though on a leash, which is why Umbridge could chain up brooms. And conjuring food, in this universe is impossible. Not hard, not super complex, flat out impossible. Therefore the simplest explanation for how McGonagall "conjured" a plate of sandwiches and cups of juice is that she told an elf to put food at a certain place either on a cue or at a certain time.
