That's a pretty convoluted explanation actually. And an odd instruction.

I think "deliver tea and snacks" would be something a house elf might be told, but "deliver tea and snacks but not until I completely unnecessarily wave my wand around first" is not.

Further, Harry's beginner summoning spell they learn in forth year (accio) might pull things through normal space with a leash, but there are probably a lot more advanced spells a witch of McGonagalls caliber can use to pull objects through subspace or some similar media at speeds that seem in n-space to be FTL.

Edit: my headcanon on Gamps Law's is that they are mostly due to ignorance or propaganda.

Wizards know nothing about biochemistry or nutrition on a chemical level. I posit that a wizard or witch of sufficient power to be capable of permanent transfiguration who also has a PhD in biochemistry could definitely conjure food. Wizards are lazy though, and discount muggle things.

Further, money? Please, maybe not wizarding money because 1) gold - that's alchemy, and 2) goblin cast coins. But muggle money? No problem. Absolutely no reason why I can transfigure a bit of linen to look like money. Really specific color charms if nothing else.
