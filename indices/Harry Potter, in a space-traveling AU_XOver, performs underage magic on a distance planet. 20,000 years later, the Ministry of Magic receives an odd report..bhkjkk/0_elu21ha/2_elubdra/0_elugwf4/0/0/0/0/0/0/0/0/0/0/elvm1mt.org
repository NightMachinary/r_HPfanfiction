How is "do x on cue" at all convoluted. She pointed. Not waved, not Drew mystic symbols for 20 minutes. Pointed. Exactly like a person would do to a servant. She pointed her wand and, pop, food and juice appeared.

Think of what that conjuring spell would entail. She would have to concentrate on the exact ingredients of the sandwiches and any condiments on the sandwich, as well as the juice. Then she would have to put a replenishment spell for that specific sandwich on the plate. Same for the juice and cup.

The summoning might be a bit easier, but would still be more complex than needed for the situation. You'd have to know exactly what and where you're summoning it from, else you risk stealing some other kids food.

What makes more sense in this context? Would you, an assistant principal of a school waste energy on an assuredly advanced, complicated and possibly dangerous spell to summon/create never-ending food, or would you have one of the hundreds of super discreet servants do it for you? That's my point. Not simply whether she could do it, but what is most likely given the scene of, she pointed, and food and drink appeared then kept appearing after she left.
