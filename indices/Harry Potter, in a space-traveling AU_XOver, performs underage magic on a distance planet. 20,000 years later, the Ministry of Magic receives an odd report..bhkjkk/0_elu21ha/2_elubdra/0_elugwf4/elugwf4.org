If summoning things works at the speed of light (299 792 458 m / s, 300,000 km/s, 186,000 mi/s), people would literally die from a) not moving fast enough, and b) the air heating up so much around the object/area, people would vaporize (see [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][Relative Baseball]] ).

Now if objects are summoned at the speed of sound (343 m / s, 1,234.8 km/h; 1,125 ft/s), I'd be more willing to believe. The speed of sound is still insanely fast though, and can very easily kill someone.
