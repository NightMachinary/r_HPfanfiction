Its the way a petulant child responds. Rising up to the bait like that is exactly what instigators /want/. For all his other problems, Snape had one piece of advice that Harry should have taken to heart.

OOTP:

  "Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord! ... Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily --- weak people, in other words --- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!‚Äù

What the OP is asking for is not strength. In fact, they are asking for what Harry /actually is in canon/: a reactionary teenager. Remember the scene in OOTP after the quidditch match where he threw himself at Malfoy for insulting his mother once? Or in HBP where Harry, instead of just reveling in blocking Snape in his first lesson and knocking him on his arse, decided to throw in a one-liner that only made it worse?

Thats not strength. Its a sign of how juvenile someone truly is.
