!linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus)

Post canon EWE fic. Tonks was never interested in Lupin and didn't die in the Battle of Hogwarts. Heavy on the smut.

!linkffn(To Date a Metamorph)

Pre-OotP fic. Tonks wants to date people her parents don't approve of. They trick her into pursuing Harry Potter. In its early days, but very fun so far.
