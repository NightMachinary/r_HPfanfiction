Hey! Yes that would count as AU as it's a change from canon - more specifically it's a canon divergence fic of everything leading up to that point is the same!

Don't worry about existing ideas - it's fanfic, people are bound to overlap. This is your idea, it doesn't matter if people came up with something similar. Just don't deliberately plagiarise and you will be fine.

Good luck!
