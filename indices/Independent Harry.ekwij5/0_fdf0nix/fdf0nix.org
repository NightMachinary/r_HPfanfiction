I mostly agree with you. Despite being a trope with such interesting potential, Indy!Harry is really, really easy to do badly. Shopping scene, Goblins, Lord Stompy McBigStaff of all teh things inheritance, verbal smackdown the lifelong politicians and manipulators, etc. It's not absolutely an indicator of poor quality, but there's enough correlation there to make a link.

I'm with Rowan on the dialogue though. Frankly, Harry being locked in a cupboard for eleven years and intermittently being chased by hoodlums and frying-pan wielding housewives is probably the only reason every book in canon wasn't as whiny as book five was. Plus, sometimes the crappy dialogue in Indy!Harry fics is kinda funny - Cadmean Victory's ever-quotable 'I do not forgive. I do not forget.' is a perfect example of emo-turned-comedy. I'll give you that him not doing anything about it in an Indy!Fic is irritating, but otherwise I'd say that he's probably got a right to at least a little whiny bitchery. For dealing with Snape's bullshit, if nothing else. I've certainly whiny-bitched over my teachers being unpleasant bastards before, as have friends and acquaintances.
