Totes. I really want to see a deconstruction of those tropes where the Goblins try to help and violate a contract and cause way more problems, the Inheritance pile-up comes with some ridiculous clauses like having to lead local Morris Dancing rituals on High Holidays and every cow on the manor having to be a particular colour, and anyone who's played D&D or seen Critical Role knows how fucked up a shopping spree can get. On top of all that, Harry has to take My Fair Lady-esque lessons on how to behave as a Lord (Lessons given by Hermione desperately reading from books and Ron laughing uproariously throughout) so he doesn't lose his magic or let all the property go to Malfoy instead or something.
