No, because Harry's life was fairly difficult?

Dead parents, his Defense Teachers all tried to kill him at least once (ironically with Snape as the exception) on top of Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the shadows and dealing with a fair bit of bullying and drama at school.

On top of integrating into a completely different world/culture and learning a variety of new skills that his life often depended on. Harry's life was not easy, he kinda had a right to complain.

Though I've not come across many where it crosses the line into whining. And I like the idea of him using Lord [WHATEVER THE STORY GIVES HIM] as a way of getting back at people who should have been there for him but weren't.

Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
