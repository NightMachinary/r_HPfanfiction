Anaba Addington: She's tall, skinny, and muscular, with short gray hair and brown eyes. She's a pureblood in Hufflepuff, with a wandmaker father who wanders the world looking for unique parts to test for wands, and an herbalist mother who runs the potion supply shop in Hogsmeade, Addington Aromatics.

She's what could easily be called a model student, with good grades, a prodigy in Charms, she helps to tutor other students with their Charms classwork. She's also quite the athlete, a beater for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and a member of the dueling club.

(Edit: forgot that her worst subject is potions, which she just can't get a grasp on, despite her mother being a gifted herbalist.)

She's always got a smile on her face and a nice word to say to anyone she meets.

Her biggest quirk is her hair - due to a contaminated polyjuice potion from her mother's youth, her mother has had a few traits of a chinchilla her entire life, which got passed onto Anaba - her hair is incredibly dense and soft, and she has to wash it with dust rather than water.
