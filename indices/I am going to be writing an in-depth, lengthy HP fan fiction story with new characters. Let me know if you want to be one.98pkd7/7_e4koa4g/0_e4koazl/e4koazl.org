*Students*

*Name*: Roi Citrinatus

*Gender*: M

*Age*: (Up to the author)

*Appearance*: Honey-brunette hair kept in a trendy fauxhawk, light hazel eyes and a square jaw. Slightly higher than average height, broad-shouldered, tends to dress nicely.

*BG*: A half-blood born to a well-to-do wealthy family (both halves of his heritage are considerably well off), Roi is a young man who is going to "go places," as most of his professors agree. His mother, a Hufflepuff alumni witch, is reportedly trying to discover the components of the prima materia to create her own version of a Philosopher's stone, a Panacea which can reverse any spell effect and cure magical diseases such as lycanthropy. As for Roi himself, he's amiable enough, sure, but he has his own internal balancing act of keeping too many irons in the fire. A well-placed word here, a whisper of a rumor there, it's curious that although no-one would ever say Roi was a gossip he always does tend to know the who/what/when/why of what happens in Hogwarts. And it's so hard to distrust his easy smile...

*Quirks*: He's a preppy Prefect type, fussy over details although not enough to be bossy. Keeps out of trouble, as far as the Professors are concerned. A difficult person to actually be close friends with although he does seem to go out of his way to know just about everybody. Excels in Herbology and Potions.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: A rumor mill and resource character if there ever was one. Depending on the composition of characters he provides an easy "rival" (hey, I heard you started this rumor? and then trying to pin it on him, which presents its own set of difficulties), an information well for gossip, or for small loans and such to get things inside the castle. In other words the easiest ways to develop him are to give him a comeuppance or to get him on the "good" characters' side.

*Name*: Gale Ollivander

*Gender*: F

*Age*: (Up to the author)

*Appearance*: Extremely fluffy neck-length platinum blonde hair, like a dandelion. Short, dark brown-eyed, with a round face, full cheeks, and is missing one of her canine teeth (which may be regrown as the plot demands).

*BG*: A canon character descendent, for once. Born to Garrick Ollivander's son (who is unnamed according to the wiki, but I'll call Garrison), Gale wants to take over the family business but in her own way. She wants to do something different, which in her mind, equates to moving away from the tried and true wand woods and cores that Ollivander's traditionally offers. Dried flobberworm core? Sphinx hair or Werewolf fur? Oh, what about Mandarake wood and Acronite stem? Her own teeth? (* It's a rumor of, ahem, unknown origin that she was mad enough to try it. Although other sources claim her tooth was lost from one of her experimental core-wand matchups blowing up, literally, in her face.) She's not nearly old enough to really know what she's doing, but that isn't stopping her from experimenting in the least.

*Quirks*: Mischievious and playful, she'll do anything once just to try it. A force of chaotic good. Always looking for new experiences and obsessively hoards odds-and-ends.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Can drag other characters in to trouble, such as going on excursions to the Forbidden forest to collect things. Can be a frequent face in detentions or tip the scales of House points to skew negatively. Maybe a character might actually trust her and want a unique wand, though the success of that is of course left up to you to imagine.
