I made a few NPCs for a Harry Potter game I wanted to run a while back but never did anything with them. If you feel like adopting any or all of them go right ahead lol.

*Lore Character*

*Name*: Eglė

*Gender*: F

*Age*: Deceased

*Appearance*: Currently, a tree.

*BG*: In the distant past a non-magical girl named Eglė was born, said to have gained the love and trust of one of the only known continental Parseltongues, a wizard Lord known as Žilvinas the Serpent. Eglė's beauty captivated him and despite their differing backgrounds he went to procure her hand in marriage the traditional way, through asking her family. His attempts failed and at least he took her and apparated her to his warded residence where she may never leave. Many years, sons, and a daughter later, he, at last, gave her permission to return to see her family who were as jubilant to see her as they were furious. Her family decides to use her life as a bargaining chip to lure the Lord in, putting a knife to her throat and telling her to call her husband using a magical instrument she had given him, and when he appeared they ambushed him, striking a mortal blow and in the fray she and her children were also struck and lay bleeding. It is said in his grief that the last of his body turned into magic itself, spelling Eglė and her children into trees. The exact details of the story are difficult to follow and the account is regarded as a children's story with the moral being to distrust muggles. However some keen minds may note the similarities between the tale's end and the rumored passing of Merlin, self-transfiguration into a tree surely doesn't seem to be an isolated incident in wizarding culture..?\\
Is it also mere coincidence that, among Wandmakers, there is a rumor of a certain wood that endows wands with a curious property, the gift of Parseltongue passed down not through blood but through craftsmanship?

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Taken largely from an existing folktale. Finding the details of the folktale and how it corresponded to actual wizarding history could make a subplot in and of itself. Or trying to find that tree and dealing with magical creatures who may be protecting it could be a fun little adventure. The end goal I envisioned of gaining a wand that allows a character to have Parseltongue when it's being wielded is also a neat, albeit not particularly useful, power up for a character.

*Adult Characters*

*Name*: Carrie Vixenvys

*Gender*: F

*Age*: 41

*Appearance*: Strawberry blonde hair cut in a messy bob and downturned gray eyes, a pinched and heart-shaped face, a lanky figure. Wears athletic robes even when it's not strictly appropriate.

*BG*: A muggleborn who originally attended Ilvermorny and later immigrated to Wizarding London. As a schoolgirl she could only have been described as a tomboy and assuredly was an avid broom racer. With her love of flying and a proficiency at charms, this witch went on to innovate shortly after graduation intending to bridge the gap between the wizarding world and the muggle world by enchanting cars, motorcycles, scooters, skateboards - anything with wheels, she's had a go at trying to make it faster to great sucess. With the success of her business, named Vix-a-Vis Moto, she intends to further innovate by making a magical superhighway codenamed The Foxhole between Britain and reaching through the entirety mainland Europe, so think of a magical chunnel and U.S. Route 50.

*Quirks*: American accent (in as much as it can be represented in writing, ha), and an adrenaline junkie no matter her age. Very stubborn and can be ruthless about getting her way. To her credit though she doesn't deign to be condescending.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Depending on the content of the story I see her introducing a few conflicts or tools for the characters. Want a new wizarding sport? She could sponsor a tournament for it, or gift the school trial versions of another way to transport that isn't just a broom. Or even something mundane like wizarding driving ed. She could also raise questions about the statute of Secrecy in the plot and there could be a schism about whether to throw support behind it or prove that it shouldn't go through in classic students-besting-the-adults HP fashion.

*Name*: Cher T. Windyfield

*Gender*: F

*Age*: 26

*Appearance*: Auburn hair plaited from her face into a messy bun. An oval face with delicate features, bright blue eyes, and full lips. Tends to wear dragonhide accessories as in, a wand holster, satchels, boots, and gloves, beneath her professor's robes.

*BG*: Hogwarts attended. A pureblood who went on to become an auror, much to the chagrin of her former classmates (and her own family) who pegged her to become a career housewife to some wealthy pureblood because of her good looks. As an auror she proved she was more than just a pretty face and her talents wielding her aspen & dragon heartstring wand ended up making more than a few enemies from using, ahem, excessive force... Which would prove to be her downfall. She was called to disrupt a particularly nasty incident of mugglebaiting by a pair of brothers, and handily defeated them. They were sent St. Mungo's for months because of the spell she used to defeat them, and then off to Azkaban. Seeking revenge, the mother of the brothers and one of their wives devised a Dark Arts ritual to curse Cher, baiting her when she wasn't clocked into the job (amazing what an Imperio on an innocent young wizard can accomplish) and her sense of personal justice ensured she followed alone. While the incident was recorded for the DMLE, the exact details of the confrontation are unknown, though it ended with two witches missing, one ancestral property torched to the ground, and one Miss Windyfield out of commission with a deadly transfiguration curse which turns flesh into wood spreading from her left calf to the rest of her body. Each year it spreads just a little more, her feet already stiffened, and her resignation from being an auror was "encouraged." Now, she finds herself as a Hogwarts Professor (DADA? Transfiguration?), a favorite of the students for her experience and the cause of many a schoolboy crush. In spite of everything that's happened Cher tries to be optimistic and always encourages her students to reach their full potential. Still, between classes, she does try to find a cure...

*Quirks*: One of those people who answers a question with another question, a person could have started a conversation with her starting with "How was your day?" and end up themself revealing all the insecurities eating away at them. Seems to have eyes on the back of her head (it's really just Auror training) and is quick to catch out lies and misdirections.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Depends on the direction you want to take. If presented in a positive light, she could be a role model for witches to live up to their talents, and there could be a minor plot to try and assist her in finding a way to beat the curse. She could also be used as something of a timer, if there's a plot going on involving the Dark Arts perhaps an antagonist figure is trying to speed up the rate of the curse to remove her from the post etc, or play up the trauma to make her a tragic figure or source of angst. I could also see her working with some tweaks as an antagonist, just make her a little more desperate, a little more focused on Pureblood students who might have something in their family heirlooms that could provide the answer she seeks. It's also deliberate that the family who cursed her is nameless, for even more drama you could have the descendants of that family attending Hogwarts as either students or faculty.
