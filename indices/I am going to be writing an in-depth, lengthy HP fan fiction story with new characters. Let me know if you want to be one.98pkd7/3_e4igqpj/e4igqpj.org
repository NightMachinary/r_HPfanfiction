Name: Shelby Larson

Appearance: Short with boyish figure, pale, black hair usually in ponytail, blue eyes

Personality: Rather shy. Intelligent. Very sarcastic, but only with people she likes. Tends to go with the flow, avoids arguments but when she can't, she easily wins them.

Likes: Loves puzzles and riddles. Every now and then sends one to the Quibbler. Favourite subjects are non wanded ones, especially Herbology, Potions and Care of Magical Creatures. She spoils the hell out of the cat, Dahlia.

Dislikes: Stupid people, Transfiguration and to every one's everlasting horror, tea. She is rather sick of people mentioning that and then acting as if she kicked their puppy.

Note. She is one of the school's bigger suppliers of outside goods. She specialises in salty snacks, seeds and nuts (you're laughing, but she's making a mint off of health freaks and Ravenclaws who can't study without eating), although somebody is beginning to move on her territory and she. is. /pissed./
