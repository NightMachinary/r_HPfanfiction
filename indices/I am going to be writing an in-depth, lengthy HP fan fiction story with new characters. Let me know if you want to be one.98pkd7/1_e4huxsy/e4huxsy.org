Bruce "The Spruce" McFahan. He's a loose guy: long, curly hair, all bleached, he has really tight jeans (crotch super visible) with holes in them, long leather boots, tight sweaters that accentuate his glamorous bod, he's got too many earrings and piercings and he always wears eye liner.

He would have been /the man/ in the 70s, but sadly for him, it's 2018 and the only people who look like that nowadays are over-the-top hip hop artists. He's the laughing stock of hogwarts, but he's an unapologetic lifer for rock 'n roll, and he will never change.
