*Name*: Ulysses Ian Quirke

*Age*: 13

*Gender*: Male

*Appearance*: Short kid with wavy brown hair and squinty dark brown eyes. Very generic clothing. His prized possession is a pair of self-sizing dragonhide hiking boots that he won in an extended 'Risk or Riddle' competition last year.

*Celebrity sim*: Joseph Gordon-Levitt (in his younger days)

*Personality*: He's defensive about his origins and doesn't trust anyone who brings up the magical blood issue. Very focused on his work. Not comfortable with his growing feelings about girls, and embarrassed at how distracting they can be. Defensive about having no money but what his scholarship allows.

Also as a result of his poor background, he's a bit of a pack rat, keeping all sorts of things others might discard as broken or useless, if he can find a value to them. Sometimes, those things end up in his collection before they're actually thrown away by the prior owner.

*Academia*: Ian is good with outdoor stuff, as he treasures the time away from urban Manchester. He has a cheap-ish wand (black walnut and centaur mane), so he doesn't tend to do well with Charms and Transfiguration, preferring to use prepared items, including potions. He's quite excited to be learning Arithmancy and Runes, so that his tinkering can be made more permanent.

*Character/Family History*: Ian (and he'd rather be called that) is the only son of Orla Quirke, a muggleborn witch who was sorted into Ravenclaw the year they hosted the Tri-wizard tournament (canon!). Orla had been a victim in many ways- she was an orphan whose parents were never identified. The orphanage had given her the last name 'Quirke' as a joke.

Orla found herself in the weakest possible position when the war over bloodstatus once again rose to prominence. During her attempts to find a decent situation, she was seduced and knocked up by an unknown wizard. Falling back on what little resources she had, she returned to the orphanage and bore Ian, raising him there for several years before succumbing to the self-destructive depression that her situation had brought on.

Ian was kept by the orphanage matron Mrs. Nettleburn, who knew of the truth about magic through raising Orla. Once accidental magic had manifested, Ian was haphazardly taught to use his growing Talent to help smooth the operation of the orphanage. This began a few years before his letter for Hogwarts arrived, so he has a few wandless tricks up his sleeve.

*Parents*: Mother - Orla Quirke, deceased; Father - "that slimy bastard" (otherwise unnamed) is probably still alive, but who knows?
