Cameo character:

Princeton "Caterpillar" Pimbleton is a well renown (in his field... so not very renown at all) 50y/o near squib Magi-Entomologist who specializes in the study of south-American magical insects. Due to his lackluster magical prowess, he took the habit of traveling the muggle way, and even took part in some muggle scientific expeditions, discretely collecting magical bugs and making sure the muggles would stay safe from dangerous magical species.

He is killed by the death eaters sometime during the second war. No one really cared (jeez I've managed to depress myself in 4 words xD but they make the story more powerful, if the heroes stumble upon it by accident).
