I don't usually peg my own stuff, but I haven't read a lot of epilogue compliant stuff. This is my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7605733/1/Spectra-of-Grey][Spectra of Grey]]. It's a non-romantic interaction between Harry and Draco. Not my best work, but I saw you weren't getting many suggestions.
