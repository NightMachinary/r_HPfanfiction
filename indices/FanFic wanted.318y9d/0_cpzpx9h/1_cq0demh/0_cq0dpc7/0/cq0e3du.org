It was the story about Albus' birth. (I can't remember the name of it exactly and I'm too lazy to go look.) But basically Harry got all worked up over some person he'd failed to catch, caused some super unnecessary drama, and everyone else made a big deal over this person too, and then it turned out to be...Rita Skeeter. It was a great drama/mystery, and otherwise well written but the ending made the rest of the story feel absolutely stupid.
