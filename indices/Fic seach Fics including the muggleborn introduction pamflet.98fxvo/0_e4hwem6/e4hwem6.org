I can't remember any off of the top of my head but I feel like I've read one or two where that was a very minor plot point.

Despite that you've given me the most wonderful idea. I enjoy writing in universe literature both short and medium in length, (history essays, newspaper articles etc) and I think an introduction pamphlet would be a great write, especially if I pepper it with wizarding misconceptions about what muggles are actually like and what they believe.
