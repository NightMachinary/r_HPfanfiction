Sounds fun! Please give a link if you decide to write and post it.

I remember one fic where Hermione refers to the muggleborn introduction pamflet she got, and if questions if Harry didnt read his. Harry of cause havent gotten one, and they venture to find out why. Pretty sure it was a weasley and dumbledore bash fic.
