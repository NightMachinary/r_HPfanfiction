The issues with OC's is one I have everywhere. No matter the fandom. OC's can be good. But 90% of the time they are more of a Deux Ex Machina in a person. A Character that is introduced primarily to change the story at a fundamental level even though the same thing could be achieved by utilising characters that already exists. Take a Naruto fic I read a year back, an OC made Academy Naruto into a top tier Genin. So I'm guessing nobody from canon could do that? None whatsoever.

The same thing happens a lot with the few Harry Potter fics I've read that are OC heavy or utilise an OC character to get something to happen. The same thing could quite often be achieved by a canon character. And as I said in my other post. OC's are rarely given a proper explanation for why or how they manage to change things up as much as they do. It is often a small paragraph instead of at least a chapter.Now disregarding characters that would change the story at a fundamental level.

We'll still end up with a character that will have their characterisation/character traits told to us a lot instead of simply letting them be shown. Put quite simply more often than not OC's are used by lazier/unexperienced writers. Does that mean that all OC's are inherently bad? No. If it's and AU I don't have any issues with a Large Potter family or Black Family. Etc. etc. But it's What is the purpose of the character? Did you make a new character simply to make a new character? If so, why is it there. I've personally made an OC for HP but I've not utilised it simply because it's too OP. Family was Cursed to be a Dog animagus that fits their personality. Family tradition of using two wands etc .etc.

So. To conclude, an OC needs a purpose in the story, preferably one that can't be done by another. I'm not saying that if Harry ends up living with somebody else it needs to be a character that already exists. But the reason for living with that specific family should be more than: "He gonna bone their daughter." And yes, parent OC's get much more of a pass because we weren't introduced to a lot/any of the characters parents except the Weasley's.
