I think the large cast of characters in the books is the main reason I dislike OCs so much in this fandom. (Also true in NCIS, which is the fandom most of my fics are in.) There are so many minor characters who can be developed while still staying in the canon sandbox, why go outside that? When I want to write my own characters, I write original fic.
