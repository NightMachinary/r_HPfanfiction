There are quite a few named Hogwarts students, but even that isn't the whole school complement. Are the only teachers the ones who are named in canon? What about Aurors, Death Eaters, Ministry officials, giants, werewolves, centaurs, Muggles . . . ? I think you are making Rowling's world smaller than it needs to be.
