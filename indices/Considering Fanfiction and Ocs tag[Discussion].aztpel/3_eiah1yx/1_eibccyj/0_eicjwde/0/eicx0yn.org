There are actually a lot of those who make an appearance or are mentioned by name at least once during the series. Well, maybe not giants or werewolves. But in general, there are a lot of names or references to people that can be used.

Also, to clarify, I'm not saying no OCs ever. But if there's a character who plays any sort of significant role in the fanfic, I want them to either be somebody who already existed in canon or there to be a really good reason we haven't met them before.

For example, if you're setting a story at Charlie's dragon sanctuary, yes, you will have OCs because we've never met any of those people. But if you're looking to have Harry interacting with a student in his class at Hogwarts, pick one that was named at some point, even if it was just by the Sorting Hat in Book 1 and never again. Especially if that classmate plays a big role in the story.
