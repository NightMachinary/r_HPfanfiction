I know it exists but I don't understand the logic behind the resistance to OCs. There are seven books in the original canon. Each one of them introduces new characters and expands on the universe introduced in the previous books. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that fanfiction would do the same. If every book in canon used only the characters introduced in the first book, I could understand it: but it doesn't, so . . . the fandom has always been a mystery to me and I can't see that changing.
