OC's are generally disregarded because they and SI's will be used to change things without really explaining why, just accept it god damned it. This is also why I generally dislike any sort of forgotten Potter/Black family member comes to Harry's rescue. They will avoid at all costs any sort of explanation as to why Harry ends up with them or if they do end up doing it it'll be a small titbit added to a chapter instead of being a chapter in itself.

As far as Pairing characters. That comes down a lot more to as [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]]: Expectations. Which I feel I've said some about already. There are just so many bad connotation people have with them that it's generally difficult to have them be used and for me if I read trough 5 chapters of pre-Hogwarts Fanfiction and all I hear is how amazing these OC's are. I'm likely to drop it. It'll be OC focused and OC-heavy and I don't care for that.
