I generally avoid stories where OC's take centre stage, but I have read a few that are very well done. It's just hard to make a good, believable OC that fits well into canon, doesn't exhibit SI-level awareness of the plot (unless they are an SI) and does not act as a Mary Sue. For settings that have a lot of cultural differences from the modern west (i.e. GoT) then the OC also shouldn't carry around the author's morals and ethics.
