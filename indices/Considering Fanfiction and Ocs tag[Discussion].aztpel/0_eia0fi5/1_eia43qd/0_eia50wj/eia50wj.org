Because Daphne and Astoria are pureblood, their /families/ care about blood. I didn't say that /they/ were supremacists themselves. If their recent ancestors cared nothing about blood status, Daphne and Astoria would be halfbloods and their family name wouldn't appear on the Sacred 28 pureblood list.

Arthur and Molly aren't purists, but their family members were. Ignatius Prewett, Molly's uncle, married Lucretia Black, whose name wasn't cut out of the family tapestry. It seems pretty logical to assume that purebloods in the modern era are still pure because someone up the line made sure to marry the right person.
