Functionally, Daphne, Astoria, and Tracey are OC's. They have barely anything but a name, baked-in house designation, and certain expectations built around that, based on their being Slytherins who must value ambition and pragmatism, and in Daphne and Astoria's case, purebloods whose families care somewhat about blood status, if they haven't mixed with Muggles/half-bloods in generations. What it really comes down to is the fact that they are canon, if you take Pottermore and JKR's post-HP commentary as canon, which many people do.

On the other hand, the reason why OC's get very little love is because there are zero expectations around them. It's a full-on mystery bag, and that's not what fanfiction readers want to read. They want fanfiction, which is seeing familiar characters and familiar settings. If they wanted original stuff, they'd be reading original fiction.

Something worth considering is how the reputation and image of OC's has been tainted in fandom culture since the beginning, from young teens starting out writing by churning out fics featuring Mary Sue/Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasies. Ebony Darkn'ness from My Immortal, or all the Sonic and Pony recolours on DeviantArt are prominent examples (the craziness of the Sonic OC fandom is where the "Nothing Personnel" meme came from). With so much fanfiction around, readers would rather pick a familiar name than risk wasting their time on a coinflip.
