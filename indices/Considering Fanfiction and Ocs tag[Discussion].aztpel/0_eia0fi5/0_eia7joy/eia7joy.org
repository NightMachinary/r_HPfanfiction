Interesting. So it depends on what you want from Fanfiction when it comes down to Oc's? Because for me, if it has either some characters that I like or the unique Magic that comes with HP, I will atleast consider reading it. And now that I think of it, that can all be found in original fiction. Maybe I should start reading original Fiction more. Thanks for you view
