My usual take on Magical USA is: There is no magical USA. The various wizarding enclaves founded on the East Coast in the 17th and 18th century never banded together since they were founded by extremists of all sorts - the kind of people who roll with "if you don't like it here, go and found your own country" - and they have been warring each other since more than they have fought the Native tribes, which were pushed out of the East Coast area. So, they're not exactly part of Britain or colonies, but they're small fry compared to Britain - doubly so a Britain with Dumbledore, who is pretty much a walking WMD in my stories with regards to political influence.
