On AO3, there is the Ninja Wizard series, which is complete, and starting in the third or fourth story, it becomes about Harry spending a year in the Avatar world - it's long and covers the whole show. The rest of the series is then him convincing the magical world to move to the avatar world and become the fifth nation. It's really good, characterization is great, and Harry is more than just an extra, he actually influences the story without taking anything away from the other characters.
