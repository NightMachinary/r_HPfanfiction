The closes one that I read and you may like is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12232814/1/The-Mysterious-Traveler][The Mysterious Traveler]] by TJ Jordan. Basically teenage Severus Snape got sent to the Avatar world and everyone think he gifted with â€˜spirit powers' similar to the Avatars. It is really well written too, so I would highly recommend it. Though it is around 109,459 words and ongoing.

Also, the problem with your request is the fact there are not that many you can choose from that are long, good, and completed under that crossover. I actually tried looking for this crossover awhile ago as well so I kind of understand how difficult it is.
