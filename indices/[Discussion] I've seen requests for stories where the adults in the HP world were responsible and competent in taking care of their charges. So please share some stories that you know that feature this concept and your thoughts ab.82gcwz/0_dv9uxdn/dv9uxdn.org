linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) is often recommended.

Overall, while it can make for a fun feel-good story like the above, I don't find myself particularly drawn to the concept. Being devoid of common sense is part and parcel of the Wizarding World, and if you start taking away Snape, you might as well take away the Ministry, and the Dark Lord, and the Goblins bankers keeping literal piles of gold behind literal dragons, and at some point it's just not /Harry Potter/ anymore, nor fun.
