Well the Basilisks are said to have long lives anyway. But for any of this to make sense I suppose Nagini would have to have a longer lifespan than the average snake, lol.

I always thought it'd be cool if Voldemort made the Stone a Horcrux and put it back where it was. Considering having him do just that in my HP fanfic (undecided). Despite what Dumbledore said, it felt odd the Flamel would be agree to destroy his Stone because they had a chat. Well, maybe he was feeling especially noble that day. Wouldn't be surprised if there was an FF was Dumbledore Confunded Flamel into agreeing or something, lol.
