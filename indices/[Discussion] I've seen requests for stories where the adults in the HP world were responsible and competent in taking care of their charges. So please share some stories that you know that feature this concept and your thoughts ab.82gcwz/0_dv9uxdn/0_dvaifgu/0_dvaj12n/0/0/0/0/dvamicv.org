  What never made sense to me was making Nagini a Horcrux. Just how long would a snake live, magical or not?

Could be pretty damn long, actually, going by the Basilisk, if she is indeed magical. But either way, my headcanon was always that Voldemort intended to devote some time to making a Philosopher's Stone of his own once his power was secure, which he would use for Nagini, himself, and also possibly some select followers (Bellatrix, Delphini, Snape if he hadn't turned traitor). After all, the Horcruxes prevent his /soul/ from passing on, but his body would still age, and it would just be troublesome to go through the "Bone-Blood-Flesh" ritual every century (not to mention he'd eventually run out of father's bone).
