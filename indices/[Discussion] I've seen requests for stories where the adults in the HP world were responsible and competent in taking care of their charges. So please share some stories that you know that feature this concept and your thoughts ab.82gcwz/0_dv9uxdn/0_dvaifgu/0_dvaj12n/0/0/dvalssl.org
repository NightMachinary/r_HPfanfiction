True, but while raised in the Muggle world Voldemort was never really a part of it; really, all he ever saw of the Muggle world was the orphan, when you get right down to it. And there, from a very young age, he saw himself as someone special with inexplicable powers that made him superior to his bullies --- such an upbringing doesn't sound conductive to rational thought.

Whatever the case may be, it's clear that Voldemort thinks in those warped wizard terms. See: the protections on his Horcruxes and his fixation on making them from 'significant' items; his utterly ridiculous Goblet of Fire scheme; his general "raw power doesn't work? Answer: /apply more raw power/" philsophy when it came to fighting Harry.

And in /Cursed Child/, even Hermione (who started out pretty damn rational) has seemingly been contaminated by wizards' peculiar inability to process the idea that /if you want something protected, you protect it with protections, not with riddles/. So it would appear spending too long in the magical world can corrupt even the best.
