I don't believe it as /literally/ as walking into a fire because they forget fire burns (unless they're Xenophilius Lovegood). However, the way I look at is that wizards don't think /straight/. They tend to have a sort of warped view of things that will accept just about anything as sensical if it is so presented, because magic itself is so strange and arbitrary at times that it's just how they see the world.

It starts with "little" things that are needed if the wizarding world is to function: "sure, the magical singing hat will decide our kids' future! Why not? It works!" But with that sort of thinking, pretty soon, you start to get things like, "how do you solve a scheduling problem? /Time-Travel!/ That's the obvious solution!" Such things, well, yes, they /work/, but are really overkill and much more convoluted than was ever needed.

And from that point, it's just a tiny step away from "let's make our tournament to encourage international friendship a rivalry-based contest with possibly lethal consequences!", or even Voldemort's "say, Dumbledore's protections on the Stone look like a First-Year could beat them, could there possibly be something fishy about thOH DAMN".
