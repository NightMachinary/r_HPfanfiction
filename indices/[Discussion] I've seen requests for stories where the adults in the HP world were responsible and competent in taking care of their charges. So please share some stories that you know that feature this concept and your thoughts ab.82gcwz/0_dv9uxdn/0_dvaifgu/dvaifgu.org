Eh, I was never a fan of the takeaway that wizards lack common sense. Most instances where the series seems to suggest this really seem to show they lack experience with non-magical things, since magic lets you shortcut a lot of issues. They don't do things like walk into fire (Floo excluded!) because they can't get that fire burns, or any number of other things you might associate with lacking common sense.

I mean, even the whole "Wizards can't logic" bit from PS was a bit silly since I wager most of the readers didn't solve Snape's riddle. Riddles are just hard by nature, wizard or not. And seeing as education itself presumes you can reason to some extent, it would nix the idea of a magic school or a magic curriculum if we took Hermione's words literally.
