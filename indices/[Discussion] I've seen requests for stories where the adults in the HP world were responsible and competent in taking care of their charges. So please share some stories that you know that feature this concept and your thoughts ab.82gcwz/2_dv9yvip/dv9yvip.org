[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: The Ministry is not incompetent, but large numbers of Ministry people actively supports Riddle, and Dumbledore's gang is facing numerical disadvantages. On the other hand, Hogwarts students are significantly more scary in this story than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Adults are definitely not incompetent here, especially not the Ministry and the bad guys. Dumbledore is just outmaneuvered by the two sides who are far more cunning and ruthless than him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Adults are not incompetent here, neither are Purebloods ignorant of Muggle matters, as Death Eater Nott's rant against Muggle environmental destruction shows. They got Sirius out and exonerated early, but Voldemort and Barty Jr have decent plans too. Dumbledore kicks ass in East Africa, and both Malfoys are plotting and thinking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Time traveling Hermione just tells Dumbledore all the info, he gets down to work, and cleans up things real good together with the Ministry.
