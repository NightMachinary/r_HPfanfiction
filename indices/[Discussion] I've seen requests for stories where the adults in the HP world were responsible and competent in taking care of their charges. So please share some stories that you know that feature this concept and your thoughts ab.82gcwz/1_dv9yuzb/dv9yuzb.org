I am writing a story where Harry ends up adopted by the Tonks family after Sirius fails to clear his name. And instead of letting Sirius mend his trauma with cocktails and women on a Caribean Island, he is sent to a Mind Healer by his cousin. While most of the Hogwarts adults remain incompetent, I have Penelope Clearwater teach Muggle Studies (which Harry is taking after ditching Divination) and as a Muggleborn herself she knows her subject. Also, Voldemort is not completely braindead so the whole "let's wait a year for Harry to complete the tournament while I do nothing" thing is a no-go in that story. The Death Eaters also are slightly more competent, actually managing to kill civilians when there is a huge, panicking crowd right in front of their wands. The Ministry, with the exception of Bagman, is also competent, although they are still the very definition of corruption and nepotism. Lastly, Dumbledore is a competent, Machiavellian politician who does not get outwitted by an angry boy but generally stays in the background (as he does in canon).
