I always thought that was for Ginny's benefit. My mom always asked me stuff like "Where did I park that car" and I always felt awesome when I knew the answer. Now that I'm older I know she always knew where the car (or whatever the answer was) was but it was little things like that that would make me feel good, like I wasn't a kid.
