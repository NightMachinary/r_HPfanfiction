- Ron and Draco are the 2 prime examples of /bigotry/. They /decided/ (as in paid, not necessarily the same person) to sway Harry Potter

- Neville is raised emotionally abused. Dumbledore knows this but didn't intervene, aiming to keep him as a "spare" Boy-who-live

- Molly is paid to attract Harry's intention and get his key vault for stealing

- Griphook (the goblin) did not tell Harry about his family's vault and his parent's will
