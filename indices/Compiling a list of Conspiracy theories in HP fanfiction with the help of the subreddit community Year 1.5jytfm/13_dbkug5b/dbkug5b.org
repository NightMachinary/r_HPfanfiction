- Dumbledore arranged for Harry and Quirrelmort to collide in the mirror room to force the prophecy into completion and try to minimize collateral damage;

  - the rooms guarding the stone are designed to generate a ritualised story telling narrative /(imagine that, right?)/, to focus the magic's reality warping properties and make the prophecy more likely to come true;

- Dumbledore edited the prophecy's true statement before releasing it to VD\Potters\Ministry;
- Dumbledore sealed Potters' will to prevent their trusted friends (Sirius, Lupin, Augusta, etc) from gaining guardianship over Harry;
- Dumbledore was rewarding Harry for reckless behaviour (and making his life miserable otherwise) to make him get used to the idea of self-sacrifice;
- Dumbledore arranged for Hagrid be the one to introduce Harry to the wizarding world so that Hagrid will influence him with his biased opinions on Dumbledore, Slytherins, purebloods, wizarding politics, etc;
- (for WBWL stories) Dumbledore knew that Harry was the BWL, and arranged for him to be living with Durslays precisely because of that;
- Dumbledore convinced the Potters to liquidate their ancestral possessions in order to support the war effort, which is why Harry's now poor;

  - Dumbledore decided to get rid of the Potters when they started arguing with him, and stole their money through a secret deal with goblins;

- Dumbledore feared that Harry's stated ability to fight on equal terms with VD meant that Harry was likely to become another dark lord, so he tried to make sure that Harry would die after killing VD;
- +Dumbledore is an OPed idiot who somehow manages to survive on a daily basis+
- Each time something traumatic happened to Harry during his stay with Dursleys, he hurt them back with some accidental magic, and then obliviators showed up to make both him and the Dursleys forget about the incident and be returned to square one;
- Fawkes is a wizard (Merlin, actually) who transfigured themselves into a phoenix and couldn't reverse back to human form;
- Flamels faked their deaths;
- Philosopher's stone has some hidden negative side effect, similar to unicorn's blood (featured in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][/Reverse,/]] to some degree);
- Prophecies in general have probability manipulating and free-will negating properties (e.g. Sacrifices arc, used as a plot device whenever a character or group of characters needs to act OoC);
- Lily was the one who obliterated VD's body;
- Lily was a dark witch, dark lady, ruthless person, evil person, etc;
- Lily and James faked their deaths and were currently happily living somewhere safe and hidden away with all their /other/ children while the prophecy was still in motion.
