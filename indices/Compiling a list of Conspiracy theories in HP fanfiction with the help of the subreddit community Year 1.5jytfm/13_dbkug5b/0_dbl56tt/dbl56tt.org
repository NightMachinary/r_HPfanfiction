That one makes sense to me, just to get away from Dumbledore's incessant 'the next great adventure' nagging. I mean, 600 years gives you a lot of time to get good at manipulating people, and with Dumbledore basically giving you the button to manipulate him with, it wouldn't be very difficult.

  Lily was a dark witch, dark lady, ruthless person, evil person, etc;

I like this one too; James was an asshole for a while in canon, but Lily was apparently flawless. It adds a nice element or aspect to her character, that Lily could actually be ruthless or have a temper like a dragon. In regards to the dark arts, I don't think Lily was ever noted for being against Snape's pursuit of the darker arts, just against the blood purity bullshit. It's not unthinkable that Lily let the pressure of the war make her turn to darker arts in desperation to keep her family safe.
