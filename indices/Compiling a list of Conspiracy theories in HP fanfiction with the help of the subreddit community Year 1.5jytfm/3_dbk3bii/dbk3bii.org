The Philosophers Stone was given to Dumbledore as a final gift of the Flamels. Think about it - why would the Flamels give their stone away to someone else when they've kept it safe on their own for over 600 years if their intent wasn't to give it away? Dumbledore kept it for about a year because he was fighting his temptation to use it.
