Here are some of my Dumbledore related conspiracy theories:

- Dumbledore made up the whole prophecy thing, setup Snape on a guilt trip (I find it hard to believe that Dumbledore would interview Trelawney and a well known death eater in a pub on the same day; I find it incredible that Dumbledore didn't know to put privacy wards during such an important event; I find it even harder to believe that Snape was not intentionally interrupted exactly at the right moment), and tricked V into blowing himself up.

- Dumbledore confunded Sirius in suggesting Wormtail as the secret keeper, fully knowing that Wormtail was the spy. He knew Lily would do everything to protect Harry, and might have even suggested the blood protection ritual to her.

- Dumbledore intentionally gave Harry a lousy childhood so he could show up as Harry's savior and guide Harry to self sacrifice.

- Dumbledore knew of Sirius' innocence, but instead let him rot in Azkaban so that he couldn't interfere with Dumbledore's plan for Harry.

- Dumbledore instructed Snape to treat other houses poorly, in order to unify them against Slytherins.
