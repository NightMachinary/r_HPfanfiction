I really like a series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] and Harry there is very interesting. He is not the main character though (it is Holly, a magical daughter of Dudley Dursley), but although Harry in the background, he is a very nice combination of paranoia, gentleness, and experience.
