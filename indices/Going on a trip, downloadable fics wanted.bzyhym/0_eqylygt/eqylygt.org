The Lie I've Lived linkffn(3384712) by jbern is interesting and very unique in my opinion. I also like Bungle in the Jungle linkffn(2889350) and also it's sequel to an extent linkffn(3759007) by the same author.

The Aurors linkffn(11815544) is also a very good fic in my opinion. The Mind Arts linkffn(12740667) and Realignment linkffn(12331839) are very unique and enjoyable as well.

If you go onto darklordpotter, there are a lot of good fics in their Library.

Sorry about only giving you FFN fics and not AO3, but I don't really read that much on there.

Edit: I can't link fics to save my life
