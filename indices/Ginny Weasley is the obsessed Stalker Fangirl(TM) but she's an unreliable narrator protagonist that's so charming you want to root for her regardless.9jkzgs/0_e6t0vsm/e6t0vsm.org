"Seventh Horcrux" from Ginny's POV would work:

- She's little deranged from Diary's influence
- She's obsessed about Harrymort
- She does possess significant powers
- She does not resort to nefarious means to win Harrymort
- She does contribute to Harrymort's cause in a meaningful way
- She won Harrymort in the end
