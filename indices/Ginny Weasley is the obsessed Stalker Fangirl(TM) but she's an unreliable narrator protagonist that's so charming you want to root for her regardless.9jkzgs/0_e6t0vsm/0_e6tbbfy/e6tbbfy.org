I've already read Seventh Horcrux unfortunately. And it's still not quite the idea I'm going for, the main difference being this version of Ginny would use 'nefarious' means (to a point) to win Harry because in her head it would be completely justified and approached with a child-like enthusiasm. Also I'm not particularly phased on whether she succeeds or not, depending on the context I think you could do either as long as the core elements are preserved. Hell she could even have a character arc involving her being less stalkery over-time (even if it's begrudgingly) or even have her double down on the crazy. I'm not super picky on where you take the characterization as long as it's funny.
