Yeah, to be fair, I have gotten a little over excited because I don't even think this type of character is commonly well-written in fiction in general, never mind just fan-fiction. The only other example I can think of is from James Gunn's Super, a movie about a guy who has a seizure induced vision from God featuring a hentai tentacle monster performing brain surgery on him (It's sounds less insane in context) and decides to become a 'Super-hero' and he meets this girl who seems to have some form of Borderline Personality Disorder who becomes his side-kick and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwNn-3Esb8][she revels in violence with a child-like glee]].

Yes, this is a real movie. It's fucking awesome.
