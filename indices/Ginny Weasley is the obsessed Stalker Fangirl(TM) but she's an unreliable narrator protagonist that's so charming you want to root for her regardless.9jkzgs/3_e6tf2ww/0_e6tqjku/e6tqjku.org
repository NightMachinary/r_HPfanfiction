There are many, many fanfiction stories that this already applies to. Well written fanfiction is something that confuses me-- because there's a surprisingly large amount of novel-length fanfiction that's actually good, and the author would be better off just writing their own books since usually they diverged completely from canon anyways.

This especially applies to AUs, where literally the only hint of the characters being who they are are the names and personalities, with maybe some minor references.

Yet, good fanfiction clearly exists, otherwise people wouldn't bother to come to communities like this one, or even read fanfiction in the first place once they get past a certain age and develop standards for quality writing.

I do agree though, this takes the sort of skill that even most authors that are good enough to publish probably don't possess. It's really, really hard to write a character like that as likable yet still follow the obsessed stalker route.
