â€‹

This is a retrospective review on Ed Wood that actually kind of lays out the type of story I'm imagining in my head but rather than Film Maker Hack Ed Wood tries to make it in Hollywood (And kind of does after his death for none of the reasons he was hoping for) you have Obsessive Stalker Ginny who tries to woo Harry Potter (And kind of does but for none of the reasons she's imagining in her head)
