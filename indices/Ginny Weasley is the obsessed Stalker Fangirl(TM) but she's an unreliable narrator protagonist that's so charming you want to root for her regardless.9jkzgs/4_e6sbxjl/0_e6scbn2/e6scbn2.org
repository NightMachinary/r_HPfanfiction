Well, firstly the thing I'm imagining is more being played for laughs and isn't supposed to be serious. The reason I bring up the Ed Wood comparison (Specifically the movie) is more along the lines of writing a character that is perfectly sincere in her love (as I can even imagine a literal stalker being) but taking that to a comedic extreme due to lack of self-awareness and being a bit mad, but as in the movie Ed Wood, occasionally you get peaks at the darker reality.

I was kind of thinking of the ending of Ed Wood where they're all watching Plan 9 in the theatre and he's like "THIS IS THE MOVIE I WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR" and he proposes to his lady friend and drive away in the rain and then the title card pops up with "HE DIED ALONE AND AS A PENNILESS ALCOHOLIC". Hence the unreliable narrator bit. The story would be told from her perspective of complete lack of self-aware sincerity and because you're in her head you get the rosy view of everything that's happening because despite her pathological behavior she approaches it with a sunny optimism.
