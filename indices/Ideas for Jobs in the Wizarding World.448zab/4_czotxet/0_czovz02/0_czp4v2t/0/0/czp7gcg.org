  And you have proof that it can handle split seams, hems, issues with circulation, cracks in the walls, or many of the other issues that fall under these categories?

Yes, I have proof. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mending_Charm][This page]] contains a list of instances where Reparo was used in the books. Obviously it has its limitations, but it seems to repair superficial damage most of the time.

Also, I don't have a problem. You asked a question and I answered it. I don't get why you're so mad about it.
