You can't truly transfigure food. It's an elemental law. I'd assume that you can't merely use a duplication charm on it, as well, if the general consensus seems to be that magic-made food is not the same as normal food nutrition-wise.

Can wizards repair their own clothes and houses? Obviously Harry didn't do seventh year, but there's nothing in canon that process or disproves that the average wizard would be capable of doing those things with a standard education. I'm educated - and the most I can do is sew on a button, put together furniture and do other minor things around my apartment. That's why I think it's possible for there to be something like a magical engineer to s design buildings - because there's nothing that suggests whether or not the average graduate could do something like that without special training.

Post-scarcity? I highly doubt the Weasleys chose to be poor. Not to mention that I'd question any utopian place that has rampant and obvious racism but that might just be me.
