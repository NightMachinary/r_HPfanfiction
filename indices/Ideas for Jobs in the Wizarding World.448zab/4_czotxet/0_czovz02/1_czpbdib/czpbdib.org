OK, firstly, you need to be clear about what poverty is. The UN defines poverty as “a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means a lack of lack of a basic capacity to participate effectively in society.”\\
In rich countries, the 'poor' tend not to starve to death but they do go hungry. They might have access to clean water, basic education and health care; but they're often homeless, badly educated and likely to die much younger than their fellow citizens. One marker of poor children is stable access to fresh food and two pairs of shoes that fitted. Some of the wealthiest countries (pdf link)[[[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc10_eng.pdf][www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc10_eng.pdf]]] in the world did very badly on these markers. America came second from last, only above Romania. So poverty is /hunger/. Poverty is /lack of shelter/. Poverty is /being sick/ and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to /education/ and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not being able to afford recreational expenses. Poverty is living one day at a time.

The Weasley's are basically the poorest people (we see, and implied) in the magical universe, but they still aren't really 'poor' compared to muggle poor. They have no fear where the next meal is coming from (and can afford to feed extra people when they visit), they are all educated to a professional degree, they can afford medical care, they can all get great jobs, Ron and the twins can participate in Quiddict and go to Hogsmeade. Their robes may be patched, but it is never shown that they lack robes at all. Not being able to buy new wands /may/ be considered poverty in a magical community (especially seeing as it is clear wands are super cheap for what they are), but a single poverty marker is not enough to class someone as poor. And they did eventually buy a new one when it was needed.

SO even if the the Weasley's are magical poor, that is not really poverty.
