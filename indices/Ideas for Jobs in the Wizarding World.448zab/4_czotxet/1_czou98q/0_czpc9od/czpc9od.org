Government jobs are a pretty recent invention. The ISS is in the 17th century, and therefore before centralized government as we know it. Yes, the Ministry exists, and appears to deal with breaks in the ISS, but we never see them doing the other governmental things like social services, planning, allocation of money for health, education etc /until it's being run by Voldermort/ with the registration of muggleborns and the control of Hogwarts. We know St Mungo's accepts large donations from people like the Malfoy's, and therefore might not actually receive money from the government to run. Hogwarts has it's own board of governors, which regulates course structure etc, the job normally of the governmental education department.

There is no magical military. During the war, it is up to individuals to protect themselves, and while Aurors are around, they don't seems to actually do much for the wider community, even before the reveal of Voldermort.

Arthur is highly ranked (even if his department isn't) and yet is paid very very little. In the movies, there are a lot of people in the Ministry atrium going to work, but in the books, fewer people appear to work there. So I would argue the current government cost very little to run, and does very little. If there wasn't an ISS, would they be needed at all? I'm not saying that a government isn't needed, just that the Ministry we see the books isn't.
