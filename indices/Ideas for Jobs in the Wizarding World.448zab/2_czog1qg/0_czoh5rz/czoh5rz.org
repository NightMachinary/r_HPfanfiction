I'd assume there are childcare workers/tutors. Even if it's relatively informal, like the neighbor teaching all of the kids on the block. Personally, if I was magical, I would be wary of putting my kid in a Muggle school due to accidental magic, especially at a very young age.

Similarly, is assume there are designers/architects/engineers working specifically on magical structures, whether hiding them from Muggles to enchanting them to be larger inside than outside.

I think the question of independence is one we really don't talk about enough. Obviously this isn't really the case during the 90s when the books are set, but in today's world, for muggleborns to attend school until 11 or whatever and then just disappear would not fly. There would have to be some level of information sharing. And this is just for muggleborns. What happens if a person raised in the wizarding world has contact, especially bad contact, with muggles? Especially since the prevailing fanon theory is that wizards are completely self-contained, and wouldn't even be known to Muggle governments and services. I think it's really interesting, especially since canon gives the impression that information sharing only happens when there's something on the level of a mass murderer running around.
