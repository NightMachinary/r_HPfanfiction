Canon hints that many ministry employees have the job of basically keeping muggles ignorant of magic. Hiding dragons and magical creatures, hiding structures, undoing accidental magic, regulating objects, modifying muggle memories, etc.

But I wonder about things like do wizards hook up to city water and sewer? The Weasleys seem to live way out in the country but we know some wizards live close to muggles, like the blacks in London or potters in godrics hollow. I wonder how integrated they are in the muggle world. Especially since They seem to have a separate culture.
