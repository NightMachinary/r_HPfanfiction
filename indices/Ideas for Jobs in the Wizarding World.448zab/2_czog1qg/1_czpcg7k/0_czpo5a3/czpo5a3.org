You mean Filtch? I imagine that he was the one who told the House Elves what to do, and made sure they did it right. In a house, you'd tell the house elf what to do and check it. But in a large place like Hogwarts or St. Mungos, I imagine there's probably someone who tells them what to do, and makes sure they do everything the was it's supposed to be done. Filch does this inside. Some people have brought up in previous threads that the house elves would do what Hagrid does, and I say that it's the same. They take care of mowing the grass and keeping the windows clean, but Hagrid is the one who tells them to do it and how he wants it to be done.
