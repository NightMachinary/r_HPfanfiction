I think they'd basically have the same jobs we have, with the exception of the jobs that appear because of magic. As some people have mentioned, there would be:

*Curse breakers

*Doctors and nurses specialized in Magically-induced injuries

- People who raise, care for, or regulate magical creatures

- People who grow and cultivate magical plants

- People who create wands, brooms, and other magical items (like the Monster Book of Monsters)

- Moving portrait artists

- Tailors for clothing

I think that the challenge would be figuring out how they do the everyday jobs we do with the twist of magic. For example, what would be the "magical" process of building an instrument?
