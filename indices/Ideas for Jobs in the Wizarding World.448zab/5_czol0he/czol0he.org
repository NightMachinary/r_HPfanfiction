In "Patron", I assume that most wizards work in "Spellcasting and Spell maintenance", they take care of the countless charms and other spells on every piece of clothing, tool and houses that the wizards rely on - very few can cast all those spells themselves with sufficient skill and experience, and even less could have the time to do it themselves, so most speciliaze on a few such Services.
