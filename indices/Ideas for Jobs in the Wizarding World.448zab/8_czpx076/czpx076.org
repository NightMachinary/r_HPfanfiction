I think a magicak architect is interesting. Thats what draco is in A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy, but i think the job was imagined a bit wrong there. I'm a architecture student, and lots of the things we have to worry about would certainly not be problems in the wizarding world. Do wizards need to abide by laws of gravity? The burrow seems like it doesn't. They can expand space, that is frequently done with ministry cars etc. If there would be a magical architect, I think they wouldn't in a traditional way draw and calculate what the building can withstand, but more be specialized in certain spells like undetectable space expandment, security wards, muggle repellants and transfigureration of very large objects like walls or whole houses. And keep in mind that the whole british wizard population is only about 3000, so I don't think they would build new buildings, only modify existing ones.
