#+begin_quote
  Harry has almost accepted that he won't be going back to his own time, and he's working in a small apothecary in Diagon Alley to make ends meet. Then someone tries to blow up his employer's shop, and that brings him face-to-face with Tom Riddle, who he successfully avoided during his time at Hogwarts.

  Harry, stuck in the past and asked by Dumbledore to infiltrate the ranks of Riddle's proto-Death Eaters, is also being courted by Riddle himself, and by the Aurors, and by a couple of people who might not have anything to do with them. Harry struggles to hold onto his sense of himself and reality in the midst of all this. Sequel to “Earning His Notice.”

  Harry is struggling between his desire for love and his desire to fulfill his duty, to find a way to stay and a way to return to his own time. Tom Riddle's attempts to seduce him permanently are not helping.
