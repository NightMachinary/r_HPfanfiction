These have Tom soft for Harry or have him fall for Harry first:

Linkao3(Sand In My Shoes by purplewitch156)

Linkao3(Entwined by purplewitch156)

Linkao3(Precious by wynnebat)

Linkao3(Voldemort's Assassin Hotline by duplicity)

Linkffn(Green Eyes, Guns, and Dangerous Things by VanillaGhost)

Linkffn(The Burning Taste of Fire Whiskey by The Carnivorous Muffin)

Linkffn(Powerful Men by Lomonaaeren)

Linkffn(Kept Man by Lomonaaeren)

Linkffn(Love: On Air by Watermelonsmellinfellon)

I'm also writing a fic where Tom will fall for Harry first (because Tom is alive sooner and gets primed to fall for Harry), but it's still several chapters away before Harry even shows up. Both Tom and Harry are immortal in mine - Tom via a horcrux and Harry as the Master of Death. The primary focus of my fic is in changing Tom Riddle's backstory and reframing the context of the canon though.
