  Just because things happened in one time-line, doesn't mean they have to happen in this one. At least, that's Jane Kirk's determined opinion upon being told she and Spock were married in that other reality. The universe, however, has other ideas - and the spirit of her dead counterpart stuck inside her head isn't helping matters. This story was originally published over at FanFic.Net on: October 26th 2013.

  There was definitely something going on between those two. Even though I had been confined to the flabby meat sack known as Lester Papadopoulos. I could tell when people had history. But I wasn't sure if it was good or bad. I never would've guessed it though. OR: "You look good considering the last time I saw you we were fighting a giant primordial Goddess along side a brother I didn't know I had."

  It is said that a universe is created the moment a possibility is perceived, making a tree of infinite branches, each representing a life that could have been. So maybe it's not so impossible to believe that there was a time and place where we lived happily. Lived without burdens, guilt, without war. In a life where we only had to exist for ourselves.

  The Vanguard thought Crota had been banished from their realm for good after the successful strike, unaware that the Traveler had different plans and saved Crota's soul before it could be lost again to darkness. Crota wakes on Earth, except not as a Hive Prince but as a human male. He's lost his memories but the Speaker is there to guide him. He has no trouble fighting the Cabal, Fallen, and the Vex, but the slight hesitation he has when in the face of the Hive and Taken do not go unnoticed by his teammates.The Hive haven't forgotten their Prince and neither has the Taken King, who unknowingly is fighting a war against his own son. But Crota has bigger things to fear like how Eris Morn is watching his every move and the reappearance of the Guardian who killed him the first time around.
