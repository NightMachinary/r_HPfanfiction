It's “The Master of Death” by Quine on AO3. I'm unsure if I should link bc rule 8 (even though he's mentally 20-something?)

Interesting premise, and the story has promise, but I just /wish/ the author would get an editor. The non-English quotation marks throw me off too. Boggart reaction is chapter 16
