Linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) is a favorite, although sadly incomplete (as so many are).

Linkffn(Wind Shear) is also brilliant, and actually /is/ complete.

Linkffn(Delenda Est) can be a bit controversial, because it starts with time travel to the past, and then travels back to the now altered "present".
