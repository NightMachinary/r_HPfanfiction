It's things like use; a biting teapot can't really be excused as a harmless eccentricity since it is very clearly designed to try and injure someone, not as a defense mechanism, but as an end goal. Additionally the obvious target would be muggles, who can't defend themselves.

But compare that to the necklace Draco uses in 6th year; it is obviously dangerous, but was on display in BnB's. It's possible the enchantments on it could be categorized as 'anti-theft' (even if they were nothing of the sort) so owning/selling it would be perhaps a little bit of a grey area, or even just flatly legal provided the owner was taking 'reasonable precautions' to ensure it didn't hurt anyone accidentally.
