That's about in line with my thinking as well; there's dark magic, and then there's *Dark Magic*, and the former is frowned upon, but not illegal, while the latter is much more likely to be persecuted.

Enchanted item laws likely have a bunch of loopholes put in by old pureblood families; you can /own/ a neckalce that will kill anyone who touches it, but you can't /make/ one, for instance. So 'antiques' would be fine, but some jumped up mudblood won't be able to make a hunter-killer missile 'just as an enchanting exercise'.
