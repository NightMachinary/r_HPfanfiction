every curse, hex and jinx is part of the dark art( rowling said so on her website) that includes the Anti-Disapparition Jinx and the Anti-intruder jinx. we see all the main characters use the dark arts to a certain degree and often quite early , like Hermiones Full Body-Bind Curse she used on Neville in first year, or Rons Slug-vomiting Curse in second year. we also know that some of the darker spells are taught in defense against the dark arts. Honestly I am pretty sure that dark magic and knowledge of it isn't actually illegal but rather crimes that are committed for or because of dark magic. For example learning the killing curse isnt illegal, but rather using it to murder somebody. we know that certain dark objects are illegal, but to be fair its also illegal to enchant a carpet( so we dont really know all the criteria)

I think Dumbledore removing certain books means, that they are legal but that he personally doesn't want his students to read them.
