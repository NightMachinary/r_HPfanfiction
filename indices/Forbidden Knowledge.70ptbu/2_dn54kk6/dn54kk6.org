I think curses, hexes, and jinxes are classified dark because they negatively affect the subject. Anti apparating jinx vs an anti apparating charm would likely differ in the way it went about preventing the act, with the former being harmful in some way.

Imho, the tiers of dark magic would be (from low to high): jinxes, hexes, curses, unforgivable/deadly magic. I changed the highest because I believe that fiendfyre should be labeled as a top tier dark spell, but it is a conjuring and not a curse. There could also be varying levels within the tiers, some which break the guidelines.

Also, note that you could technically use non-dark magic to perform dark things. Transfiguring someone's mouth and nose shut, for example. But that's akin to a muggle killing someone with a pillow, or stabbing with a spoon, ie using something not meant for that job.
