/Diffendo/, the cutting charm. Usually used for cutting inanimate objects, like paper or fabric, totally capable of killing someone if cast in the right way.

Now, i dont really know if this is canon or fanon, because i cant remember anymore, but i remember reading /somewhere/ that the difference between a non-dark and dark spell that do the, essentially, same thing, is the idea of a "counter spell." for instance, wounds caused by /Diffendo/ can be fixed with a simple healing charm, where as /Sectumsempra/ requires a specific counter-curse healing spell, designed by Snape as a foil to the curse in case it was ever used against him or his allies. A non-specific healing charm wouldnt have any effect. Normal magic is single part, it has an effect. Dark magic is dual part, it has an effect, and actively resists attempts to undo the effect.
