I don't think the Hat would help their condition. It was made asses not change mind, it's probably not as powerful that it could nudge their mental state in better direction. And besides it has seen their minds as a 11yr old children not adults they were when the trauma happened.

So sadly any healing-by-Hat-powers fics out there would be just wishful thinking
