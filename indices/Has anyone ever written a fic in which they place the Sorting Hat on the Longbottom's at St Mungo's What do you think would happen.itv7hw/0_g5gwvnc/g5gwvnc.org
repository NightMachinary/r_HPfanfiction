The hat would take a look around, and very softly go

“Oh. Oh dear. I remember you very well, but not at all like this...”

I have a sneaking suspicion the hat has a very good memory. As in, able to remember the mental shape of damn near every student who's ever tried it on. The moment of recognition would be there even for Frank or Alice, but recognising shattered pieces as belonging to something you've seen before doesn't mean the pieces can be put back together again.
