  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living. It's not all bad though. At least he gets another chance to live life his way and on his terms. Warning: Mentions of attempted suicide and other stuff to come.
