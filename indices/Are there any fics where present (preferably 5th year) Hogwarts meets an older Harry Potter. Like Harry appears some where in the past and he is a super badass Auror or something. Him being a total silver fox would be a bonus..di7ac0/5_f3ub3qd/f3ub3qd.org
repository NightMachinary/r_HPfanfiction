Book three in the Dark Prince Trilogy, Deepest Reflections, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1034541/Kurinoone][Kurinoone]] fits this request pretty well. linkffn(3959072)

It is the third book though, and the other two don't fit this theme at all. That said, this trilogy is one of my all time favorites so I think it'd be worth it to read all of them. xD
