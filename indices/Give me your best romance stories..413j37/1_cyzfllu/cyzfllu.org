None of the stories below incorporates concepts such as soul bonds, marriage contracts, or other forms of magical compulsions:

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is a very well written book 6 from Ginny's POV. Fully canon compliant.

*A Set Up Gone Wrong*, linkffn(7630045), is Harry-never-went-to-Hogwarts, post-war romance.

*Ginny Duty*, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465]], is also pretty good.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), is probably the best Harry/Hermione romance fic I've read.

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), could have been a great Harry/Hermione romance story, but the author just stopped short shipping them.
