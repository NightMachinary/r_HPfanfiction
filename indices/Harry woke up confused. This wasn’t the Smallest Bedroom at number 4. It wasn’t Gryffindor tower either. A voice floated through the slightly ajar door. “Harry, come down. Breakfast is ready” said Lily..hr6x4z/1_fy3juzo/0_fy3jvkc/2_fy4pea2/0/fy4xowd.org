I just can't seem to write self-contained stories, from the first lines that universe already started forming, to the point I already imagined all the main differences, whose personality changed and how this universe's Harry was/is different from the OG one.

If this gets enough traction, I may expand(until after the date) and post this on my ffnet account, I am already writing 3 other stories, so I may store this one on the 'write later' category.

I imagined Sirius' daughter as kind of Tonk-ish in that she doesn't conform to standards and likes to cause some mayhem in school, while being chastised by her extended family(many of the Blacks are still alive)

I am unbelievably thankful for these kinds of Prompts that stimulate my imagination and allow me to improve the quality of my writing.
