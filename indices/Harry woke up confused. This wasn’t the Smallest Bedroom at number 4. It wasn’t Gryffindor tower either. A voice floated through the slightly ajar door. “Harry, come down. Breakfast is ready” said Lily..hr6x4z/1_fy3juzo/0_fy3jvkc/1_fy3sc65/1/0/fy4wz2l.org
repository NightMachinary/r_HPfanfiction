  I did read that people that read a lot don't contract while speaking,

I can't say if that's true or not, but I do know that there's a difference between casual conversations (usually those between friends and family members) and formal conversations (job interviews, court appearances, and the like) with the casual ones being much more relaxed, and therefore more prone to the use of contractions and slang than the latter. On the few instances where contractions aren't used in a casual setting, it's either the person speaking using it as a way to give themselves time to think up a responce, or as a way to create emphasis on what they're saying.
