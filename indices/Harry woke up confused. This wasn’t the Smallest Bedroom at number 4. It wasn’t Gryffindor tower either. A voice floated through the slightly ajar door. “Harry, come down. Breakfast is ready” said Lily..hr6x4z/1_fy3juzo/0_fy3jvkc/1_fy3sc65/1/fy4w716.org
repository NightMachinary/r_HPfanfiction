Thanks for the heads up. I think I fixed most of it.

I will try to adapt for that, I did read that people that read a lot don't contract while speaking, so I try to avoid that with Lily.(or Dumbledore, Snape and Hermione).

Any other instances of that?(I actually have that problem in real life, my English speaking friends say I speak 'University' English or something like that.
