Pretty good, though I did feel the somewhat overly formal dialogue detracted a bit from it, mostly the use of "I am" instead of "I'm" and similar instances where it'd feel more natural for contracted words to be used. Apart from that it's a nicely written intro for a story I'd be interested in seeing more of.
