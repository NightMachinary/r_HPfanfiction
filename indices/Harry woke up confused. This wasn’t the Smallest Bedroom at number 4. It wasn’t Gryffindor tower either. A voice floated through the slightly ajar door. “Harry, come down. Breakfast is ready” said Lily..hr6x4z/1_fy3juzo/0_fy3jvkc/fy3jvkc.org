The person raised an eyebrow, "Nice reflexes." they replied in a distinctly feminine voice, and Harry took their appearance him. Her appearance. A woman, with pale porcelain skin, beautiful facial features and long hair that looked blacker than his own.

She was wearing muggle clothing, black pants, and a sleeveless shirt, but what called his attention was her necklace, it had the Egyptian symbol for Life, an Ankh if he remembered...something...right.

"Pleasure meeting you, Harry." she smiled at him and Harry felt an odd sense of comfort, "Do you like this place?" she gestured lightly at their surroundings, "I thought you would." her smiled widened at the suspicious expression on his face, "It's real, all of it, a different universe, I guess you already noticed some of the differences." she pointed at the picture.

"Who-"

"An Old Friend." And somehow, Harry believed her.

Harry took a deep breath, having a very hard time believing this, but hoping against hope.

"Oh, don't worry, you will struggle a bit with the differences, but tomorrow morning. For today I've...helped you calm yourself a little, just so you wouldn't scare your mother."

Harry looked at her, she too was familiar, but in a strange, more primal way.

Unbothered by his scrutiny, the woman smiled, "Don't worry Harry, you won't see me again in a long, long time." she gestured again around them, "this is my gift to you, a universe where you won't have to worry, you will have your family, friends and even find love."

Harry thought this was too good to be true, "How long will this last?"

"For me, just a moment. For you, more than a lifetime."

"I don't understand."

"You will return to your other life when this one is finished, and after doing what you must, you may go wherever your heart desires."

Harry frowned, "You said I won't have to worry. What about Voldemort?"

She grinned, "He's still skulking around, but he's not your problem, have you checked your forehead?"

Harry did so with his hand, and almost in a daze, looked at the picture of himself, seeing the utter lack of a scar.

"H-How?" he asked in a whisper.

"Without Pettigrew here, a lot of things changed, you were born a year earlier and Tom Riddle never attacked your family on that fateful Halloween night."

Harry nodded, for some reason he believed the woman, but still..."Then who?"

She gave him a sad smile, "Young Neville Longbottom had to grow up without his parents, with a scar on his forehead and a burden on his shoulders, he's supposed to be Riddle's foil here."

Harry's knees wobbled "Neville?" he said faintly, remembering the quiet, loyal boy from the D.A., who followed him into the Ministry, he couldn't imagine another having the burden of the prophecy, but if what his "Old Friend" was saying was the truth then...

"I see you've already figured it out, you are free from the prophecy here, Harry Potter. This is the year of the Tri-Wizard tournament, where many fates intertwine and change, but yours is freer than most." she gestured with her hand and many tendrils of silvery light formed, dancing in the air.

"Here you will have the choice of staying out of it, of having a normal life, even with your father's profession, you can choose if you will involve yourself or not, unlike in your other life, the choice is yours."

"But, Voldemort..."

She shrugged, "Not your problem, unless you make him."

Harry was floored, he had to support himself on the wall to not fall. An entirely different world, and he wasn't the Boy-Who-Lived, he had a family.

"Makes you think, huh? Now for today, you have a date with the lovely Cassiopeia Andromeda Black, Sirius's daughter, be on your best behavior, don't worry, she likes you and you will gradually regain your memories from here." she looked at him in mirth, "I think you will find them most fun."

A /date/, she had just told him all those things and now she was talking about /dates/?

"You have to sort out your priorities, Harry." Harry looked back at her just in time to see her smile widely.

"I think this is where we part ways, some final tips then: Some people here are /very/ different from the ones you know, for good or bad. My Cloak will be most useful for you, ask your father for it, he will deem you old enough to use it now, and last but not least." she waved at him, "Do try to have fun before playing hero, and the photo to your left will explain a few things."

The woman then vanished, not with an apparition, or a portkey, she was just there one moment and then she wasn't.

Harry looked at the picture she indicated and promptly dropped it back on the table. In it, he was raising the Quidditch Cup, he looked thirteen and very proud and happy.

And his uniform was green and silver.

Just a simple thing I wrote for fun, don't read too much into it, I am almost sleeping on the chair.
