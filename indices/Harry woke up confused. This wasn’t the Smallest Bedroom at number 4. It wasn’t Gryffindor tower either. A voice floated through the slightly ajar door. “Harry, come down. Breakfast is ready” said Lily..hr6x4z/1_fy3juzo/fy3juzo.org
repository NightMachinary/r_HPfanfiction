Harry hesitantly descended the stairs, his strange, pale wand in hand.

"Harry, it's going to get cold!" the voice said again, and Harry's heart skipped a bit.

That sounded like his mother, the same voice he heard at the graveyard, but it was different, alive, happy, and...a tad impatient.

He navigated the unknown but strangely familiar house, it was big, bigger than Privet Drive, and more spacious than the Burrow, but it was cozy and had a homely feel to it he hadn't found anywhere else.

Was this a dream? An illusion? A trick from Voldemort? But it didn't feel like it, it felt real, and Harry felt completely at home.

He followed the voice(and the delicious smell) through a large corridor until he reached the kitchen, it was...lovely, soft colors, homely appliances, but all that was forgotten when he saw his mother, his alive mother.

Beautiful red hair and green eyes just as his, and oh so alive that Harry felt his eyes tearing up.

Lily looked at her son for a moment, noticing the wand "You ok, sweetie? Why the wand?" she frowned "Did Sirius did something? I told him no spells on your room, next time I'm gonna-Oof!" she was interrupted when Harry barrelled into her and embraced her, feeling her touch and smelling her hair, it was a familiar smell, one he hadn't felt in thirteen years, he couldn't stop his tears from coming out.

Lily hugged her son back, surprised, Harry had stopped being so touchy after going into his teens, especially after going to Hogwarts, and only hugged her when distressed, or very happy.

"Sweetie? Harry? Are you alright?" she lightly pushed him back and framed his face with her hands, eyes widening at seeing the tears and quickly brushing them off. "What's wrong Harry? Why are you crying?"

Harry had always been good at thinking quick, even when under pressure, so at that moment, he decided, illusion or no, he was going to jump headfirst into this.

"It was just a...nightmare mum, a bad dream." he hugged her again "But I'm better now, especially with you here."

Lily squeezed her boy a bit harder, filing this under hormones, apparently, Harry was a bit more sensitive than she thought, which made her happy; she had always thought he needed to hug people more!

"That's good to hear, Harry. I will /always/ be here for you." she kissed his cheeks and caressed his hair, unknowingly making him happier than almost any other time he remembered.

She directed him to breakfast, porridge, sausages, and eggs, which were delicious, he kept stealing glances at her, as if to see if she was still there.

Lily laughed, a musical sound Harry wanted to hear more, "What's all this Harry? Nervous about your /date/?"

Harry flushed, why was he blushing? He didn't even know with whom it was! Or if his mother(!) was just teasing him.

He decided to wing it, "About that? Nah, I'm going to..." he remembered something he once heard Seamus saying in the dorms "rock her world." he smiled.

Lily looked surprised, before chuckling, "Well, don't let Sirius hear that, or he will probably jinx you for real!"

Sirius? What Sirius had to to with this?

His line of questioning was interrupted by a chime from the fireplace(that he just noticed was in the fairly big kitchen) and with green flash, James Potter came out of the Floo.

Harry gaped at his father, he was wearing the red robes of an Auror and he had that same grin of the photos in his Album, only with mischievousness instead of arrogance, his eyes lit up at seeing his wife and child.

"Ah, Good Morning, everyone! Or Good Night for me." he proceeded to ruffle Harry's hair and kiss Lily in the lips, before waving his wand and making his robes fly to a nearby hanger.

"Good shift, James?"

"Eh, the usual, Mundungus was at it again, some drunks playing with muggles, nothing me and Tonks couldn't deal with."

Harry smiled at his father, so he was an Auror? He liked that.

James looked at his son, finding him a little bit pale. "You okay there, Harry? Looking a bit peaked."

Harry smiled and decided to go with his story, "Nightmares...Dad." he was very proud of himself for not choking at the word.

James raised an eyebrow, "Nightmares? You haven't bought into that crap Pads were telling you, right? I think you are the only boy he will let near Cassie without cursing them, well..." he placed a hand on his chin, as if in thought, "depends on how near, you do know the right charms, don't you?"

Harry flushed as red as his mother's hair, just as she thundered "James Fleamont Potter!"

Now, Harry wasn't known for his deductive mind, but combining what he heard about Sirius, and this girl, Cassie(Cassandra?) he had a good guess of just who this date was with.

He had no idea how to feel about that, so he decided to continue riding this wave of what was probably shock he was having now.

Lily was continuing though, "Harry is a gentleman unlike /you/, at his age." she looked at her son again, as if to gauge his intentions, "And this is just them knowing each other, perfectly normal for their age."

James just snorted before ruffling his son's hair again and giving Lily another peck on the lips, "I'm going to catch a nap, honey, I ate before leaving the Department, Amelia gave us the day off tomorrow, so we'll do something fun." he stopped at the entrance and grinned at Harry, "or visit Harry at St. Mungus." he left before the stinging hex could hit him.

Lily huffed good-naturedly, reminding Harry of Hermione, he wondered where she was, "Don't pay attention to him, Harry, just be yourself," she winced "perhaps with a little less Quidditch."

Far too soon, his mother left to go to Diagon Alley, apparently to buy ingredients for something, refusing Harry's help by saying he looked like he could use more sleep.

Left by himself, Harry decided to explore the house, his house, where he lived, with /his parents,/ it was probably a dream, but Harry just went with it and decided to enjoy it to the fullest.

The house was big, and lived in, and Harry smiled and teared up at every piece of a true family life he saw in it, photos of a much younger him with his parents, flying a broom, on a zoo, with two people he guessed were his grandparents, he stopped at a photo with a bigger group of people.

He recognized them, but they were looking so much better, first was Sirius, healthy, hale, and smiling, his eyes alight in a way Harry had never seen them, he had a beautiful woman with brown hair by his side that Harry didn't recognize, and his hands on the shoulders of a smiling girl with hair as black as his, and eyes a silver-blue. Harry guessed this was Cassie.

On his side where Harry and his parents, in similar positions to the other couple, on their side, was Remus, looking much healthier and happier than Harry had ever seen him.

He noticed the distinct lack of Peter Pettigrew, what had happened with him?

"There were only three Marauders here."

Harry quickly turned back, and pointed his wand in the direction of the voice while stepping to the side.
