Oh man that got me right in my dead parents feels good lord. I love happy family fics but the ones where Harry grows up with them being dead and then hops into a different timeline where they are alive has me happy-sad sobbing every time I read one because I have these mundane dreams where my loved ones are alive and just nagging me about law school and it gets me going after I wake up and remember that nope not in my reality.

The fics where he replaces a version of himself also open up a whole can of worms because could you fuck over a version of yourself to have the better version of your life knowing full well what you've gone through...like even if the happier timeline Harry is a dick he still has to deal with the loss of his friends and timeline and like everything familiar all at once AND the death of his parents.
