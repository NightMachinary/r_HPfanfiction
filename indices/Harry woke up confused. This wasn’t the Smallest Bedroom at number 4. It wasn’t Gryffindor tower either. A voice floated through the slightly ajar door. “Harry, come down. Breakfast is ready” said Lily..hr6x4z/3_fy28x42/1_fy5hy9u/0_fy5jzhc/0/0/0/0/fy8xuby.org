Harry woke up confused. This wasn't the Smallest Bedroom at number 4. It wasn't Gryffindor tower either. A voice floated through the slightly ajar door. “Harry, come down. Breakfast is ready!” said Lily.

Was that his mother??

"Your Daddy, Severus is waiting to take you Diagon Alley, to buy that cauldron you wanted so much."

What.

"After that you can go meet your boyfriend Draco. Have I mentioned how cute you are together?"

/What???/

"You can't stay in there forever, sleepyhead! Your uncle Gilderoy and the Riddles are coming over. Don't you want to look good for aunt Petunia and her husband Tom?"

Harry jumped out the window.

He ran to the nearest street he could find and held out his wand hand. With a bang, the Knight Bus appeared.

"Where to, Harry?" said Sirius, from the driver seat.

"M-M-Ministry of Magic," stammered Harry.

Harry didn't know how he did it, but he got to the Ministry of Magic, made his way to the Department of Mysteries, and jumped into The Veil again.

Harry woke up confused. This wasn't the Smallest Bedroom at number 4. It wasn't Gryffindor tower either. A voice floated through the slightly ajar door. “Harry, come down. Breakfast is ready!” said James.

"D-d-dad?" said Harry.

"Your Daddy, Severus is waiting to take you Diagon Alley, to buy that cauldron you wanted so much."

Harry screamed.
