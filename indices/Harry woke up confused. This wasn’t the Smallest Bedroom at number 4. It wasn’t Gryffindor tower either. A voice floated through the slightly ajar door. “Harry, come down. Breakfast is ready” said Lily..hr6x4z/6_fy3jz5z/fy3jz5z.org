I loved one where he was a Summoned hero to help against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. A more cynical hardened Harry maybe 3 years from the war who lead a group that also included a female vampire that fought for harry in his timeline. More of a wartime hard choices timeline he came from. But he was brought in inadvertantly to help, they just didnt expect another harry, i think the reality 2 harry was also a anytbing non-human is evil Asshole version. Hufflepuff little sister, too uptight light members, became a little complicated towards the end with him setting up a company for money, his timeline vampire coming over, reality 2 harry being alive. Sadly abandoned though. Was a great read and really enjoyed most of it
