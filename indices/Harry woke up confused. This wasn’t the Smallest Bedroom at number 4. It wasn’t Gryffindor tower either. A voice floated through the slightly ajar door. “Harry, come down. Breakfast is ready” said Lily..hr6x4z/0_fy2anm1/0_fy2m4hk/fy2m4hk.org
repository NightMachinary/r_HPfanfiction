There are at least two that have Harry replacing/joining his AU self with a loving family like that, but in both cases the family was estranged from Harry. (In one, they try to capture him when he shows up. In another, I think he gets sent to Azkaban, as Voldemort's chief enforcer).

Both had the cute "Sister believes lost brother" thing going on
