You shouldn't be considered picky, and you aren't to me. However, you are when looking at the % of fics that are and are not what you describe, I think (but I'm not sure). No offense, but if fics about ACTUAL Canon are scarce and people who like them picky in the fanfiction world then I wonder how many people in it are a fan of the Harry Potter series and how much people are fan of the alternate universum series 'Harry Potter And Draco Malfoy/Snape and their leather pants' or 'Harry Potter and Hermione Granger' (sorry I was confused when you said Ron/Hermione I was thinking about Harry/Hermione) (although I have to admit JK Rowling fueled the love for the second with her casual remarks and encouraged doubts about her own canon). However, this is ooold news already so I'm sorry for ranting. I highly recommend the stories of StarFeather, one of my favorite authors who stays true to the story/world from the books and actually expands it with his own creative ideas, inspired by mythology. He writes a lot of Harry/Ginny, and his portrayal of their relationship is romantic.
