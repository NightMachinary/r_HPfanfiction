I see nothing wrong here, in fact you have all of my dislikes there, plus a few. However, I've never been a huge fan of Hinny, maybe if Ginny had been given more character development before this point, I would have enjoyed it, but canonically, I like almost every other pairing.

I'm with you though on not reading M-preg (why?!), Slash, Next Gen, OC stories, Severitus, or WBWL (Because James and Lily were characterized as shallow, petty, abusive, assholes right? /s).

I do find a few of the things in your list fun to read, Harry in America is alright, I like the ideas people come up with for the American Wizarding World, and any Ron, Ginny, Molly, and Dumbledore bashing is my guilty pleasure, but yeah, we mostly agree here.

So yes, you are picky, but who says that's a bad thing? It just means you don't read the vast majority of the fics on FFN or Ao3, which is fine, as almost every single fic on there is complete and utter crap.
