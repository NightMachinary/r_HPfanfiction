Your bulleted list isn't so bad, but the paragraph below it definitely limits your choices. There's not much else to say other than either write what you like to read, expand your horizons into crossovers, or become less picky.

Also, it would be helpful if you listed some things that you /like/ in a story (besides Harry/Ginny). It would help with recommendations.
