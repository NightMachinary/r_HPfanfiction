I completely agree with your post and I wanted to just comment on this part.

This piece of advice here is one of the best for very picky readers or readers who can not just find exactly what they want to read. As enormous as the HP fandom is, there are still some subject/pairing gaps in its fics. The only way, really, to fill in that gap for you is the just write what you want to read. You don't even have to publish it. Just have your fic as something for you to enjoy.

I have written several fics because of the lack of published options and when I get in the mood to read 'xyz' then it's nice because I know this fic has exactly what I want to read. Besides, I think it's a lot of fun writing and you really get a much better appreciation for fic authors who publish their works as well.
