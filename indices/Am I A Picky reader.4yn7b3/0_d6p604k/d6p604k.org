I'm certainly a picky reader but my criteria is writing quality first and foremost. Yes, there are a handful of pairings and subjects I actively avoid and there are very few of the subjects I really want to see. I wish more writers would try for a 'Rowling-esque' voice. But (unless I'm reading for a review request) I decide within the first few paragraphs if I'm going to read on, and if a writer appears not to know how to use dialogue tags, paragraphs, punctuation, etc, or uses Americanisms like 'gotten' I'll usually give up.
