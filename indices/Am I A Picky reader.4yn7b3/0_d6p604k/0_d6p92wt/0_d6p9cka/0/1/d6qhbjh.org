That may be technically true. You can find it in Shakespeare and Chaucer etc, because it is archaic usage in this country. The graph is not much help because it doesn't, as far as I can see, show where or in what context the word is used and it likely has started to creep into popular usage. But nowadays it /is/ read as an Americanism and it's disingenuous to say it's not; when I see it written I always assume that the writer is American (or nowadays possibly a Young Person who has absorbed a lot of American culture). I would be very interested to know where it appears in British literature post 1800 or so. I'm pretty sure Rowling doesn't use it and it's not a word I have ever used myself.
