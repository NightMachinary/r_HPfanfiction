Yes, arguably it is an "Americanism" (inverted commas because there are more dialects than just British and American English) but it's still not super unusual in British English (apologies I can't link directly to the results, but you can do the search yourself). Looking at the [[http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/][British National Corpus]], it seems to be a lot more common in speech than in writing, perhaps because it seems to be proscribed and people avoid proscribed forms while writing.
