This is an oft-repeated claim, but is straight-up apocryphal nonsense. /Gotten/ is just the the past participle form of /got/. The /-en/ suffix is the old way of making participles which is still common in many words (/eaten/, /woven/, etc.) but has been falling out of use across English dialects (e.g. most people these days wouldn't say "he had /bidden/ at the auction"). It just so happens that the older, original, /gotten/ is still common in American English but is less common in British English. It's hardly an "Americanism" since the UK never actually stopped using it. It's just perceived as American because Americans tend to use it more than Brits.

*edit:* [[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gotten&year_start=1600&year_end=2000&corpus=18&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgotten%3B%2Cc0][Proof]] that /gotten/ is old and the UK never stopped using it. You can see that its use decreased in the mid 1600s, soon after the US was settled, but that it never fully went away in the UK.
