Right ... I will counter what you wrote by saying that I never wrote that it is an Americanism, just replied to a message that took it as one. What I wrote is that its equivalent in British English is “got” as one is more popular in USA and the other is more popular in GB (considered archaic over there, because why not), and that one started as a slang (a long time ago, because slang is not a thing that only happens nowadays, though I did not specify when it had happened) which is why both are acceptable.

So while I do appreciate the attempt at providing info, I will note that you sound quite rude here with that starting sentence of yours. It might be that I could have written my previous comment better and that I failed to make something as clear as it should be which would put at least some of the blame on me, but please do try to actually make sure that you get what is being said before you publically dismiss what someone else wrote as nonsense.
