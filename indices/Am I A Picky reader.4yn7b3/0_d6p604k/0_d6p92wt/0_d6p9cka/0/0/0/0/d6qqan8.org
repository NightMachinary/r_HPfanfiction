Thanks, it makes it a lot better that it was not intended to be that way (I have the same problem occasionally, to be honest). And you make a really good point about “gotten” possibly feeling more authentic when used by wizards, I'd forgotten about that one but now that you said it I can see them using that form a lot; I'll go and edit the first message in the whole chain to make it a bit more visible for those who don't want to dig deeply in the comments.
