Apologies if I came off as brusque. I didn't read your comment carefully because I had to run and assumed you were saying 'gotten' started as slang, but you weren't specific. Nevertheless, just as both forms can be used in the US but one is more common, the same applies in the UK. The [[http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/][British National Corpus]] has many examples of /gotten/ in spoken English though it seems rare in texts. Wizards being quite archaic for the most part, it might even come off as /more/ authentic if you use /gotten/ in dialogue of old-fashioned pure blood wizards, especially since the statute of secrecy came into effect when /gotten/ was very common.
