“Got” is the British equivalent. It's also acceptable in American English, due to one starting off as slang and then simply becoming popular enough that both can be used.

Edit:

Though, as [[/u/l33t_sas][u/l33t_sas]] mentions a bit down this chain of comments, as the reason why “gotten” started being used much less often in Great Britain is the perception of it as archaic, wizards might very well prefer that form over “got” and thus use it much more often than you'd expect (on average, because everyone speaks however they want anyway) from someone living in GB.
