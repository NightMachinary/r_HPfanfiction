I haven't found a good fic in the wild in months, if not years. And the amount of new stories that I actually finish is under 10% probably. There's just so many bland and boring stories that it's hard to get attached. Like, I can not go on FFN for 3 months, and then I'll go and check out Harry/Daphne, and see the same nonsense repacked in different stories, so nothing is actually new. Same thing from pretty much every other section as well, and it's disheartening. So then I go write my own stuff.
