I'm with you on a lot of this. I've done searches specifically for Harry/Ginny post war, canon-compliant fics over 60k words and have only really come up with about 30 that I would recommen, and even then I had to broaden my criteria to slight AU.

It's interesting you said you can't stand Ginny with someone else because I completely agree, though I know it often means the story isn't totally realistic (i.e. when they break up for 3 years but Ginny never dated anyone else). It's not like I would think Ginny promiscuous for dating anyone else aside from Harry, but when I read it, I have a negative gut reaction. I think it's because we grew up reading a story from Harry's POV so we put ourselves in his shoes. So if we read that Ginny is dating someone else, its almost like reading the details of an ex of our own dating someone else.
