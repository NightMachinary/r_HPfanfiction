I see no problem here.

Your preferences sound an awful lot like mine, except that I'll read most het pairings with Harry. I've read hundreds of stories, but I've only favorited 55, and I like it that way. I keep my standards high.

I can't recommend many specific fics, but my strategy is to check the list of stories over 100k words that have updated in the past 24 hours on FFN each day--and that have more than 200 favorites. I find that even the few of those that interest me keep me in as much new material as I can handle.
