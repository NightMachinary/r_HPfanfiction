There's one where it reveals Bellatrix had a daughter with Voldemort. It seems so stupid though. It gives no valid reason on why Voldemort would have a child. Plus there's also Time travel trope shit that is also stupid, involving Draco's and Harry's sons. I think the fic was called Cursed Child? Or something, idk.
