Linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) and sequels.

Linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is always a fantastic read.

Linkffn(12830596) by an author I've recently discovered, and absolutely love.

Linkffn(Pygmalion by Colubrina) It has its flaws, but Colubrina's writing is undoubtedly polished and it'll be smooth reading from beginning to end. You might be interested in her other works as well.

Linkffn(Antithesis by Water Mage) is another good one, though it contains bashing. It doesn't feel like bashing though, more like a different interpretation of a character. I.e., it's believable bashing.

Linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB)

Linkffn(Dear Order by SilverWolf7007) is something a bit more different. It's much lighter in tone than the ones I've recommended, and is really just a fun, cracky fic.

Linkffn(Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part I by dunuelos)

Linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hyliian) is a fantastic read too, though unfortunately, possibly abandoned. I'm not sure. The author made a great revival relatively recently, but has since been inactive again.
