Actually HPMOR was the first fanfic I tried, and I dropped it while laughing at the author when that ridiculous dementors/patronus thing happened. The story is legitimately full of lots of dumb shit. People also get incredulous that the story has a "rational" tag when it has many irrational things like taking the over-competent 11 year olds trope to such an extreme.
