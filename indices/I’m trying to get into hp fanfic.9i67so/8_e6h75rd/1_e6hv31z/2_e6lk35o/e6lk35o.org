The thing about HPMOR is that the author tries really hard to make everything "rational", to the point where they stop actually telling a story.

From what I read, the author was just trying to shove in things they thought were cool without putting any thought into an overarching plot. Ultimately, the story functions great as a way to "rationalize" Harry Potter, which is fine, but it doesn't function very well as an actual story.

Also, saying people dislike it because it didn't come from our community is a pretty shitty thing to say, and not going to get you very far here. There are plenty of popular fics recommended here despite the author not being a member of the community.

Additionally:

  It's also partially just typical anti-intellectualism; most people are average and they react negatively when above-average people don't hide their higher level of competence.

You just insulted the intelligence of everybody that doesn't like the fic, which is pretty shitty. To put modesty aside for a moment, I have an above average intelligence and go to a very good school, and I still dislike the story for the reasons I mentioned above - to repeat myself, it doesn't function very well as a story.

My point is, the story appeals to a very specific group of people. Even the author acknowledges this. Insulting everybody that doesn't belong to that group is a pretty bad thing to do.
