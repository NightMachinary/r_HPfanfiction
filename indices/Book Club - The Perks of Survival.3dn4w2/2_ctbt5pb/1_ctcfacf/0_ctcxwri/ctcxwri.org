Note also that self-inserts have a bit of a bad name because so many authors (particularly young ones) just use them as a more explicit mary-sue/peggy-sue power trip- "the author pops in to the start of book 1 as an 11-year-old (or as the DADA teacher) with knowledge of how everything went down in the books and makes friends with everyone and fixes everything!"

When done well they're a peggy-sue story without the angst.

(mary-sue- unrealistically perfect main character.)

(peggy-sue- character pops up with knowledge of the future, tries to fix things; usually time travel is involved)
