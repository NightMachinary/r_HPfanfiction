I read something somewhere (real specific, right?) where when a person is water boraded, they VERY quickly crack, as it is less pain (as in "classical" torture and the Crutacious curse) and more the body's natural instinct of survival at all costs. In the exaple I read, the victim will usually ask for it to stop within 10~15 seconds. Victims can also develop a phobia of water, to the point of be terrified of a shower. Hope that helps.
