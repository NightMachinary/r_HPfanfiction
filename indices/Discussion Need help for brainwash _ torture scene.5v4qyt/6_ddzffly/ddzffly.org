Is the tortured-to-be (tortee?) responsible? Does it feel great sympathy for others? If so, have the torturer parade in young children and then use sectumsempra on one. "The rest and more will die. Slowly. Painfully. Unless you do as I order." Have the tortee so cowed and fearful for the children it does as told and tells no one else to save the children.

Edit: you should also read up on MICE---money-ideology-conscience-ego---for why people turn traitor and the various cia manuals and the torture papers by karen greenberg.
