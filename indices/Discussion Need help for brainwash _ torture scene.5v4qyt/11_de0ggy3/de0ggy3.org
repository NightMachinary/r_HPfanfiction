Hmm...just a thought, based on something very twisted I saw...what if you had your bad guy present the torture happening as the 'merciful' option?

Take your victim, do some testing or preliminary torture, then tell them they'll be executed. Then subject them to crucifixion, bury them alive, let a dementor get near them, etc...but then 'change your mind' and let one of your minions spare their life, on the assumption that the victim might still be useful.

From there, you have your victim convinced that their continued life/soul is a privilege, and that they /will/ lose it if they disobey or fall behind in training.

Just to be sure, you have absolutely no intention of treating brainwashing and torture as morally correct, right? It's definitely evil?
