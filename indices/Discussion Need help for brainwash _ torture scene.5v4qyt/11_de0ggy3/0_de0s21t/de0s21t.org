Definitely evil. I don't know how to treat it as "morally incorrect" in the sense that I'm alread featuring it in my fic, but I have no intention of glorifying it, or making it into a twisted BDSM play where the character will end up in awe/adoration/love/respect/willing subservience of her captor.

The character will be changed, there will be emotional, physical and psychological permanent consequences on her psyche. The torture is there as a plot-device, not because of a fantasm.
