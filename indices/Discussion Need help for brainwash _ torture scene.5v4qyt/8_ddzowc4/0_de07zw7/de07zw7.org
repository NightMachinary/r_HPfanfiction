Of course you can ask! My story is a dark and tragic Tokyo Ghoul/ Harry Potter crossover.

Title: On a Twig, Looking Up The Sky.\\
Summary:\\
Survivor of the 24th ward, Akane Watanabe decides to flee japan in haste, right before its lockdown. Her destination? Britain.\\
Little does she know that she left her previous cage for a much smaller one. Although shackled and willfully ignorant of the world she stepped in, Akane will stop at nothing for her freedom, even if she has to eat everyone along the way, including herself.

Both title and summaries are for the work-in-progress I currently have. First Draft summary, too, so it's rough.\\
They will probably change, as not all story is currently planned out. I also won't post it until it's fully finished, so it's not hosted anywhere but on my drive.

It does not have a good/happy ending.
