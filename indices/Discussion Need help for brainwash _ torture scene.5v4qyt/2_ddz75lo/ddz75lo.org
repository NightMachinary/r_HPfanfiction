I wouldn't avoid the curcio, its overdone because its canon. Its the best torture spell there is. All I'd suggest is that people, gryffindors or Hufflepuffs especially can probably endue a lot more themselves than they'd be willing to accept done on their friends and family. If you're after a reluctant submission you have an easy way out with family and friends. It also avoids a lot of the potential creepyness and gore that could arise in a detailed torture scene which would make me feel uneasy and I'm sure plenty of others too. There is a fine line between realism and sickening. Torture isn't nice, its never good and should never be glorified. Make sure you aren't sounding sick and twisted yourself. Remember someone with nothing to lose doesn't care what happens to them. You have to provide motivation, something they care enough they would ignore their sense of right and wrong. Something they would be willing to sacrifice their soul over.
