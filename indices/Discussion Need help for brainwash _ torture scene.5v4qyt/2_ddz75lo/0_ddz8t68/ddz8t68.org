I fully agree that torture is not nice, I do not plan on glorifying it, but I need it for my plot device. Someone suggested to make the torture off-screen, and I'm actually tempted to go with that.

It's also why I don't want stockolm-syndrom or any form of positive worshipping from my character.

You make very good points, and gave me a new way to see my fic I had no thought what with friends/family. thank you!
