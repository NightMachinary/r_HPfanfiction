Yeah, don't over the top. I tend to write about the before and aftermaths of the torture, both physical and sexual. I explore the fear, anticipation of pain and then the issues after like injuries and PTSD and the anger aspect and even feelings of betrayal.

Go for the the fade to black method. It really lets us imagine what could have happened, instead of showing it to us, otherwise it's too gratuitous and the fic ends up existing for shock value and that's something I try to avoid.

Also google medieval torture methods and even modern stuff to give you ideas. Some stuff people invented is absolutely horrifying.
