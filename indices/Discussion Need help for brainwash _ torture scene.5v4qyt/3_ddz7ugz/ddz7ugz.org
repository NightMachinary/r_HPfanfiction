I've found a combination of dementors and the imerious curse works well. In one of my stories Harry is conditioned to stab Ron and Hermione as he associates murdering his friends with the dementors direct absense. This is also on top of both Voldemort and the Horcrux within Harry possessing him so Harry's flicks between consciousness and their own, so Harry can't follow his own actions.

Not sure which character you're using, but I hope this gives you some inspiration :)
