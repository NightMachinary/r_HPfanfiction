You'll also need to be more thorough. A lot of torture can be psychological, as if a person gets a finger cut off, they know that that finger is never coming back for the rest of their life. I'd crack very very quickly if a torturer started permanently maiming me.

With magic and illusions, you could shake it up even more. Is that pain real, or is it an illusion? Did I really cut your wand hand off this time, or is it another illusion? Did your best friend really just get killed in front of you?

Great, now I want a sadistic illusion master fic.
