I would also like to add that with Magic, you can heal almost anything. So you have instant gratification stick and carrot. Put the character in a /lot/ of pain, and ask them for a small simple thing, and you can make the pain go away immediately. But they know the pain can be back as quickly as it went away. But Theon is a brilliant example to work with.
