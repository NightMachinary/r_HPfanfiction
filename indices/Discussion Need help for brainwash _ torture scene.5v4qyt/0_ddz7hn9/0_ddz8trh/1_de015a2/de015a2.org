I wouldn't mind helping to edit what you end up writing! I am an editor, mostly for professional items like cover letters and resumes, but I'm also pretty good at fiction. I can highlight areas that sound awkward or clunky and suggest better wording. And of course spelling and grammar! Also I generally like well-done dark fiction so I would probably enjoy the hell out of it too.
