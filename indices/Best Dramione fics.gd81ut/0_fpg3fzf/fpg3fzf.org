It's not a pairing I like, but Manacled is amazing - I particularly like how it explores the internal politics of a resistance group. I usually don't see how Draco and Hermione could possibly have anything uncommon, but this fic makes it believable. Trigger warnings though - this is a Handmaid's Tale crossover. linkao3(14454174)
