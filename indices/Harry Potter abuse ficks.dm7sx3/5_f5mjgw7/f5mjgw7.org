Canon does that too, seriously the abuse is canon! Yes, the Dursleys didn't beat him daily (at least Vernon and Petunia didn't, Duddley abused Harry every day - Harry-Hunting for example!), but they were violent (trying to hit a kid with a frying pan is quite violent IMHO!), they also were mentally abusive (telling him about his "useless drunk parents" - a lie of course etc.) and neglectful!

Why so many in the fandom ignore this or try to downplay it I will never understand! The Dursleys to me are subhuman beings who should be sent to Azkaban (with Dementors!)
