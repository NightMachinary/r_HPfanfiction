Depends on what you mean by "better". Also, it's a 20-something year old Narcissa and baby Draco that grows up with Harry, so it's not such a stretch of the imagination. Draco obviously isn't raised a blood purest, and we don't know canon Narcissa enough to say that if she had split from Lucius at a young age that she wouldn't be different.
