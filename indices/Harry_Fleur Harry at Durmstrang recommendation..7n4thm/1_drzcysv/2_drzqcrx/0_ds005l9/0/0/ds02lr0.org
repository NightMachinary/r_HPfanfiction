That's true, although I don't really consider this Harry to be "super harry". Victor Krum ended up on Bulgaria's team at the age of 17, and he was obviously quite well known before that point even, so the author is trying to explain that in some way.

I don't even pay attention to the other tropes, I was just pleased to find something that went sorta in-depth about Durmstrang.
