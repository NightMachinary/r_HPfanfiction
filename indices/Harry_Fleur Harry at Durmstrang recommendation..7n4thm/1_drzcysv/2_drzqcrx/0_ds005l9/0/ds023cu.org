It's not trash but it's certainly not good. It has some stale tropes like super!Harry that plays national team quidditch, or manipulative, evil Dumbledore.I read this very early on, and it hasn't aged well.

It's a poor man's version of linkffn(Knowledge is Power by nkari217). Whike KiP has it's share of cons, there's something to be said for how amusing an asshole Harry is.
