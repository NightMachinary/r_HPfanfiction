This kind of fic request doesn't usually work here. You could try [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/20283.html][Omphale]] which is Harry centric and more around fluidity or [[https://eldritcher-hp-fics.dreamwidth.org/19343.html][Epic of the forgotten]] which is Viktor Krum centric and more around dysphoria. Both are well written and really strong fics. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/997569][Standing on the shoreline]] is a bit of both and Snape centric.
