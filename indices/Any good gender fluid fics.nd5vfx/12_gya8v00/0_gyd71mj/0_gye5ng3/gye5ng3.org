Go for it, it's the most apt way to surmise the experience of fanfiction from epic to punt-it-into-Mount-Doom. I spent 18 hours consuming Son of Potter, Daughter of Black right up near 4 am my time just embedded in the damn thing and I'm now pretty smurfing ticked off that I don't have a resolution to the end of chapter 34. I'm a fricking bibliophile who rages at a brilliant story that stops abruptly. Every damn time I lasso the coked up rabbit for a ride I go in knowing it might end like that, but damn it this was a first time I wanted to waterboard that rabbit in a fragrant poop pit.
