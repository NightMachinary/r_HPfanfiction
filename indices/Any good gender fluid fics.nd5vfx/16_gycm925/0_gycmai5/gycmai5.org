Fortunately, Ginny arrives to shake things up. Truths get told. Identities recalibrated. â€˜Cos if you try sometimes, you get what you need.

  "Stop moving, Potter," Malfoy mumbled from where his head was buried under a pillow. "You're disturbing my hangover. Also, why are you still here?""This is my hotel room," Harry told him.
