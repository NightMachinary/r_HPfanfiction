  In which a person has read the books, has seen the movies, has scoured the Wikia and Pottermore, and consumed and written sooo much fanfiction, but imagining what it would be like in a story is so much different than how they themselves would make of things. Thank god they're already a pro at living mostly in their head. They supposed they would have to do their best. Or not --- they could just kill themselves. . . . Hmm, but that wouldn't really be childrens'-book friendly. They suspected quite a bit of their take on this wouldn't be.
