Nobody tried to kill Snape. They didn't forcibly lock him inside a room with a werewolf. Remember that Lupin was always accompanied by Pomfrey so Snape had no reason to believe that the staff didn't know about him. He went there all on his lonesome probably because he wanted to kill Lupin and thus discredit Dumbledore and win himself points with his DE friends, and /James saved him./ And Snape never missed an opportunity to curse James even after that.
