  *NB: The werewolf incident happened before Snape's Worst Memory, even though many fans think it happened afterwards (due to Snape saying that Sirius was capable of 'murder' at age sixteen).

Which is freaking /insane./ The Marauders nearly /killed/ Snape but even after that and not receiving any (to my knowledge) punishment, they went out of their way to attack him. That's probably why many stories changed the timeline of that because if you don't, it makes the Marauders look like a group of psychopaths lacking empathy.
