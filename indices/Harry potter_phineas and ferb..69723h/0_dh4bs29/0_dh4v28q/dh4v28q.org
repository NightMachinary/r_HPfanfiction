Yeah, but sadly most P&F/HP crossovers are either too short on not quite good, not bad, but not good either.

Hence my prompt idea. If i can get talented writers writing complete crossovers of the aforementioned it might produce a whole new interesting genre. Plus toon force vs. magic is always fun to watch.
