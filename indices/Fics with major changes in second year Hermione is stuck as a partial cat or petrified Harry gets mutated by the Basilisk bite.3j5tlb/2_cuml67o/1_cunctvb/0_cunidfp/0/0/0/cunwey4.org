Not really immortal or serpent things - they are recreating a hybrid bloodline, of sorts, that was used in Romania in the medieval ages before it died out. The accidental recreation is nicely set up, with biology sciency-babble to explain it, and a few "Chekov's guns". Not really crazy as fuck. And it's not really that powerful either. The Story also lacks the "adults are useless" trope, and the characters learn that they are not the biggest players around.

Also, it's 4th year, not second. The reason for the changes starts in 2nd year, but the story starts in 4th.

All in all a solid "Powerful Harry" story without going all-powerful.
