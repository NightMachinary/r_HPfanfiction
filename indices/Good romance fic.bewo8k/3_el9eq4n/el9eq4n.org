I'm kind of addicted to the works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] right now, particularly the Harry/Hermione relationship depicted. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Lady Thief]] in particular, with the long period of will-they won't-they, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], with the obsessive loyalty, made me happy. I'm still working my way through the rest of it though.
