Start the story here: "'I know I shouldn't do this, but...' "LUMOS!"" Everything else before that is filler, and reads like filler. I can't bring myself to slog through it, and just keep skimming it, even though I tried to read it properly a few times.

When you're explaining things, you tend to use WAY more words than are necessary:

"It was a large property hidden deep in the woods, with a *sole* dirt path to *access* it." If you're saying that it's /a/ dirt path, we're pretty aware that there's only the one. The word "to" implies that one accesses the property via the path. The problem is not so much the superfluous words, but that the words interrupt the natural rhythm of the sentence. Nobody speaks like it, and reading it in your head sounds unnatural and stilted.

"The entrance *portal* was a forged one, with spikes on the top." The word portal specifically refers to an imposing entrance. However, in this context, portal sounds unnatural. Just call it the entrance.

"It looked old, though. And the fence joining it was a simple one, wooden and easily climbable." There's a scene in the opening of The Scarlet Letter, where Nathaniel Hawthorne describes the door to Hester's home. He spends about a page in doing so. By the time you've gotten to the end of the description of the door, you're trying desperately to figure out why the hell it matters. You realise it doesn't. Don't do that to your reader. Get to the point quickly, or you're going to lose them quickly.

"There was a golden bell with a string hanging from it, which he rang three times, hoping it would be enough to wake the young couple up. He opened the portal with a loud creaking sound, and walked up the door on a narrow pathway, and waited in front of it for someone to open up. When it finally did, he told the phrase he had been rehearsing in his head all day." Please stop calling it a portal. It just sounds affected by this point. Honestly, you could have cut out everything up to this point, and lost nothing in the story telling. All the in between moments feel forced.

"Two hours later, he left the small cosy house, a weight lifted off his shoulders as he knew the first part of his promise was fulfilled. Marie was safe, and she would grow up loved and cared for. " After this sentence, cut out the rest of the paragraph. While you're there, cut out the paragraph following that one too. It's dragging down the pacing.

(o) Marie Argante (o) "Hello, am I speaking to the admission department of the University of Paris 12?" "Yes you are. How can I help you?"

PERFECT. The pacing is quick, you get to the point without a lot of exposition, and the reader can figure out (mostly) what's going on in a few short lines.
