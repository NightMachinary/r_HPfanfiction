Wow! Thanks. That sure was helpful. I now realise using "portal" might have seemed weird, but I think that the fact that the word we use in french for that is a "portail" which has close to no magical connotation. I'll try rewriting the whole thing to give it a more "fast pace" feel. Thanks for taking the time to help me!
