The point is to borrow Harry Potter's world to tell a new story. I love this part of the fandom, the one that seeks to expand JK's world rather than endlessy retelling the same story with another twist to it. And I don't think I'm the only one who thinks like that, considering people often reccomend the Alexandra Quick's series.
