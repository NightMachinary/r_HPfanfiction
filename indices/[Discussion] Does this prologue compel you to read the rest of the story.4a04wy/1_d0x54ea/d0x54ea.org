It personally doesn't strike me as compelling, but I think that has more to do with my story preferences that your writing. As [[/u/dsarma]] said, drop the first paragraph. It's flowery and unnecessary.

The dialogue seems stilted as a whole to me.

This is one of those statements that you want to sound deep and cool and meaningful, but it just comes off as pretentious.

The conversation between the university and Yves Montellier is fine technically. However, bearing in mind my frame of reference is university/college education system in the US, that seems very much unlike how I would expect a conversation to an admissions counselor to go. If it's different in France, then that's just my ignorance. Moreover, is this conversation in person, a flashback, over the phone, through the floo? Also, we don't know Yves Montellier from Adam, so some context before dropping in dialogue would be nice, but that's possibly more of a style choice than anything "wrong". Also also, check the use of idioms with the area in which your story takes place. The phrase "a walk in the park" stuck out to me, because I recognized it and idioms usually don't translate well. It could just be my ignorance again.

Who is Marie Argente and why is her name used as the spacer? The bold caught my eye and I was more focused on that than the story the first time I read through it.

I'm also confused why you're putting this under fanfiction. You will be using no characters and one (?) shared location--Beauxbatons--which we know little to nothing about anyways. Since there is so little about "how magic works", society/culture, etc. in the HP novels, you'll be using nothing from JKR except name(s) and inspiration, or at least that is what it sounds like.
