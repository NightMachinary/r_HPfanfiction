Hi, author here.

Being totally honest, the first 3/4-ish chapters aren't great, and I'm a little embarrassed to go back and read them because of the enormous discrepancy in quality between the earlier and later chapters. It's the first piece of fiction I've ever wrote and it shows in the earlier parts.

As the story goes on, the prose is far less stilted and the dialogue sounds better.
