Are you going to update soon? I love the way you write the Northern Magics! It really helps with imagining the scene and I'm starting to get emotional based on what happens to Harry. I really loved the idea of Eikthyrnir as well! (Yes I know that you didn't make it up and it's an old Norse myth but I love the way you integrated it in)
