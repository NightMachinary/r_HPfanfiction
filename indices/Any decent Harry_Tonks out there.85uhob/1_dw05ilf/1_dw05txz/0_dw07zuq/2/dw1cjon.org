Oh hey, your story is the one I've been following most closely. I wouldn't call the first chapters bad, but the writing in your later ones is just really good to be honest. I'm loving the story and check every day for an update!

Also I'd like to say I love the direction you've gone in when it comes to relationships in your story. It feels real and mature and pretty relatable. And I'm quite excited to see where the Northern Magic pans out too!
