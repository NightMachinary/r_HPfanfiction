Grains of Sand in the hourglass is awesome. Tonks gets sent back in time, infiltrates Hogwarts linkffn(12188150)

I recall liking Old Friends, New Friends, but I haven't read it in a while so it is hard to say much about it. linkffn(8295633)

Disorder of the Phoenix is... different. Think this is a love it or hate it one. In this one, Future!Resigned!Father Harry gets sent back in time to the Hogwarts Era linkffn(12813755)

As for ongoing fics, I'm liking how Dark Hearted Auror is going but WARNING: Author is doing the stupid "I won't post the next chapter till x reviews' ugh. linkffn(12857609)

Edit: went back and looked at Old Friends, it is a pretty rough read. Then again I think I have developed a distaste for deaged!Tonks since first reading it.
