  As for ongoing fics, I'm liking how Dark Hearted Auror is going but WARNING: Author is doing the stupid "I won't post the next chapter till x reviews' ugh.

It's worse than that- this is a plagiarist reposting [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4308508/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Black-Hearted-Auror][the same story originally written by Darth Cious]].

Everything they've posted is someone else's work.
