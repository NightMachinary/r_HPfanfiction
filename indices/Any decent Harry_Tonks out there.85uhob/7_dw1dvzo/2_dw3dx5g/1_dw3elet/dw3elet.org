It certainly felt like the author had developed the character backstory and intro a lot more than the plot his character was living. This was even before the random two chapter backstory entry, felt it was meandering a bit too much about when he got arrested.

My rec is certainly grains of sand first as the awesome alpha material, and these others that are good beta material
