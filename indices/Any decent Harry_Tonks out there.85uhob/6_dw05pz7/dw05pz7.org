So, I have not yet read grains of sand yet, but I have heard some good things about it.

Summer of change is old as hell and read rough even when I first found is some years ago. However, it was also what interested me in this pairing. Just be aware that it has not aged super well, and I shall leave the rest up to your judgement.

A little death between friends is of Kathryn518's writing and is pretty much like her other fics, long, and infrequent updates. There is currently seventy some thousand words available to read if you so wish it. They are both adults in this and I do believe there is some smut in parts of it.

Jamie Evans and fates fool is probably one of my favourites, definitely give it a go if you think you can handle the premise.

The Merging is also one of my better liked fics, mostly due to the characterisation of the characters. Or at least that is what i remember liking about it. Not completely Harry/Tonks, but a relationship does develop near the middle i think.

I feel like had it been completed, Ectomancer would have been headed into that general direction, sadly it is dead. However, the interactions between Harry and Tonks are enjoyable enough to read. Just be aware that the story is hardly centric on the pairing.

Perhaps to the greatest shame known to the world, Chelseyb deleted all of her fics. She was one of the more prolific Harry/Tonks writers in that particular niche. Her stories may not have been of the highest caliber, but they were enjoyable enough to me. Some good news though, many people have saved them and I am sure with enough prodding you could find them floating around too.

There are probably quite a few decent one that I have forgot to mention, but this should be a good start. Good luck in your search.
