I'd throw in my own "Dawn of Darkness", which is a Harry/Tonks story beginning at Slughorn's Christmas party and then disregarding the HBP plot entirely in favour of an original one while avoiding as many tropes as possible. I have to admit that the early chapters are a little heavy on the fluff, but the later ones are more plot-driven, something that will continue in the future.
