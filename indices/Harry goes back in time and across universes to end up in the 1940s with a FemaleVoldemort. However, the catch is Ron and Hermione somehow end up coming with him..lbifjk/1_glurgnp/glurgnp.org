i imagine if its post 5th year Riddle, and she opened the chamber, Ron is all for offing her before she was able to create more Horocruxes.

What other diffrences are there between the universes, can Ron call himself a Weasley or Prewett, can Harry call himself Potter without being put in a rough position.
