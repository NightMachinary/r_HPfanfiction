its not like Albus had a weakness for the Hallows 50+ years later right.

It's a complicated mess, i would assume he's far more likely to be more aggressive in regards to the stone here than in canon, which is the reason he died lol.

Albus would also not be able to "babysit" Harry 24/7 + he sucks at protecting his own mind, Gellert has master mind readers under his command
