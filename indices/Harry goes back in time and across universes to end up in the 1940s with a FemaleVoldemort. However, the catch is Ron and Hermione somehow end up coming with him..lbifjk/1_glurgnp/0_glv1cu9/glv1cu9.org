I was thinking something along the lines of a test at Gringotts giving Harry the Peverell surname, because it does not conflict with the Potter family.

Hermione just presents herself as the muggleborn that she is, and Ron would have to create some kind of fake identity for himself, since there are existing Weasleys and Prewetts out there.

And then the conflict between the three would start because the Hat would put Harry in Slytherin or something...

And it goes from there.
