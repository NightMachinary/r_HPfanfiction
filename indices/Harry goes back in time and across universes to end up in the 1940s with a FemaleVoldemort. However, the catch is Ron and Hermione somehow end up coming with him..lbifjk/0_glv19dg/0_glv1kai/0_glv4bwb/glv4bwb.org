I don't know who would take the news worst. Sure, Ron has some solid reason to hate her : "/Hello, tried to kill my sister, and my father, and probably every other members of my family both of us included/". But Hermione has the "/She lead a movement that wanted me dead just because of my parents, and probably called me a Mudblood 15 times already/".

In the end, I don't think ever of them would truly abandon Harry (though they would probably draw the line at Myrtle murder of Hagrid expulsion). They are all very close and loyal, and being stuck together in an alternate time/ dimension would make them even closer.

I see more something along the lines of "/Well it's your decision mate. I can't stop you from seeing her, or try to reform her, but I'll be there to collect your body after she murders you, and probably try to avenge you too/".
