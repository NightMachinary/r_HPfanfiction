Voldemort could also be the sort of asshole to do "magical experiments" producing children and dumping the "failures" with a random family, since Voldemort doesn't think they have magic and knows the pain of being a baby in an orphanage. A few memory alterations, and that family gets a new kid they totally gave birth to!
