  't you know you've got the best of me by raquins is a series rewrite if Hermione met Fred and George first, it is so well done and doesn't feel overly re-hashed, realistic too imo

I /loathe/ that story and stories like it, because it does something worse than just rehashing canon: it tempts us with brief visions of how things might have been different, how the story and the characters might have moved in interesting directions, only to invariably pull back and shove everything back onto the canon rails.

It tempts one to keep reading, hoping against hope that perhaps /next/ chapter, the writer might display just a little bit of courage and imagination and actually think about how two characters in question might actually influence each other in ways that matter.

Really, I should've dropped it when the author chose to rehash the Troll Incident even though nearly all of its prerequisites were either missing or outright contradicted by their own changes. I really should have learned by now.
