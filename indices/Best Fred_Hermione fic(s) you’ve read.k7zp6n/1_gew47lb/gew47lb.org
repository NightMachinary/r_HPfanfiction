Ooooh, I love a good fremione series!

don't you know you've got the best of me by raquins is a series rewrite if Hermione met Fred and George first, it is so well done and doesn't feel overly re-hashed, realistic too imo

Even in the Darkest of Times by MischiefProlonged is a take on Fred surviving the battle of hogwarts but the wizarding world is still fraught with troubles. I haven't read much of it yet but I've liked it so far, just an fyi I think it may have more adult content in it, just a heads up
