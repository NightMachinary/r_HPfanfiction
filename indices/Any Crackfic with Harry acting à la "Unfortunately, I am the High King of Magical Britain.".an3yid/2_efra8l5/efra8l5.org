For some reason I'm reminded of a Skyrim mod I saw once, one where you could be the 'High King of Skyrim' or something like that, and have anybody you didn't like executed, or sent to the gladiatorial arena, or have strong people you do like serve as your bodyguard.

It'd be really funny to have a High King Harry who could affect the plot just by ordering people to do things.\\
"You, Voldemort! As the High King of Magical Britain, I order you to stop being evil!"\\
"I...what? You know what, fine, but just to spite you, /Your Majesty/, I'm going to about-face and sponsor a movement for egalitarian democracy! So there!"
