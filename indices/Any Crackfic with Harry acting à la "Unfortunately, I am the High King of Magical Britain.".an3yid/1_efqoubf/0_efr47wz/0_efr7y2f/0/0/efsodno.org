In later chapters the Weasleys kidnap his children and keep them hostage, his wife loses a child because of the stress and they are abused by Molly during their captivity while Hermione was all for the plan, which she plotted with Percy and the original Order. Also Dumbledore was paying Ron and Hermione to report about Harry's activity (they refused the money after a few years because they were genuinely his friends at that point if I remember) and more besides.
