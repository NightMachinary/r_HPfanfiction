Giants are stupid. Everybody knows this. It's why witches and wizards are justified in governing them, keeping them away from wands or any other useful magical objects, herding them into resource-scarce regions no-one else wants, and culling those that are rebellious. They're too stupid to be treated as people.\\
 \\
As it happens, giants are in fact very intelligent; creatures their size, when confined to barren regions, quickly starve unless they utilise a great deal of cunning. It takes even more brains to manufacture even stone-age tools and clothing under such conditions.\\
And a half-giant, half-human? Loses none of that cunning, whilst gaining a better understanding of how humans and many other creatures tick.\\
 \\
Rubeus Hagrid. With his improbable size, wild hair and difficult-to-decipher accent, it was easy to write him off as an oversized dullard when he was at school. The school's purebloods, obsessed with family lineages, knew all about Fridwulfa, and took extra care to mock Hagrid's inherited 'stupidity'.\\
Of course, they couldn't be more wrong; Hagrid was no model student in class, but the secrets of magic easily revealed themselves to him. When he was caught smuggling creatures into school, everyone assumed the half-giant was a brute more comfortable with beast than man, never looking deeper to see the reasons he brought beasts into the castle, never seeing his intensive research and investigation into the natures of such creatures.\\
 \\
When Tom Riddle decided Hagrid would make a good scapegoat for his own crimes, the half-giant stopped his detailed investigations into biology and started looking at the world around him instead.\\
What he saw, displeased him. Pureblood supremacism, corrupt government, and in time, the boy who framed him on such a flimsy pretense leading a terrorist cell.\\
Hagrid joined the Order of the Phoenix, of course, when the Death Eaters came calling. He survived where many did not, his in-depth knowledge of magic serving him well when his half-giant toughness failed.\\
 \\
Dumbledore noticed, of course; how Hagrid didn't celebrate the end of the war like so many others. How he continued to stockpile resources and research darker and darker spells.\\
When approached, Hagrid was all too willing to share his thoughts; where everyone else saw the defeat of Voldemort, he saw the Ministry welcoming Death Eaters into their ranks with open arms. Where everyone saw the end of the persecution of muggleborns, Hagrid only saw the ongoing subjugation of elves, centaurs, giants, and all their kin. And his thoughts slowly turned to darker and darker places, to believing that the destruction of the old establishment and extermination of pureblood supremacists were the only way Britain was going to improve.\\
 \\
Dumbledore couldn't bring himself to publicly expose or take up arms against Hagrid. Not when he couldn't even say the half-giant was wrong.\\
Instead, the aged headmaster tried to steer Hagrid away from dark magic and dreams of violent retribution and conquest; he opened up Hogwarts to as many house-elves as he could, helped centaurs establish themselves in the Forbidden Forest, supported goblin and muggleborn and many other creature rights in the Wizengamot, and tried to organise better land for giants.\\
It worked, for a time. Over the next decade and a half, Hagrid's heart slowly softened as Hogwarts stood fast against DADA curses and disasters, becoming a place of peace and enlightened learning, creatures of all kinds flocking to the school and its grounds as a sanctuary (even if far too many of the students never noticed them). He even became a Care of Magical Creatures teacher, doing what he could to pass down his gathered knowledge of the many magical beasts and beings that inhabited the world.\\
 \\
And then it all went to hell. Dumbledore murdered in the Astronomy Tower. Hogwarts seized by Death Eaters in less than a year. Children being indoctrinated to hate everything different from themselves. The house-elven sanctuary turned into a slave camp.\\
All of Hagrid's old anger came back, renewed with a vengeance. He had given peace a chance, pushed for love and kindness and reconciliation alongside Dumbledore, and all of it meant nothing once the supremacists had the means to take what they want.\\
 \\
Whilst Harry and co. traipsed around looking for Horcruxes, Hagrid disappeared into the wild in order to begin organising an army of his own.\\
When the Battle of Hogwarts came, his influence drove the house-elves and centaurs to fight, with knives and bows where friendly witches could see them and with dark magic where they couldn't.\\
And then, when the battle was won, with Voldemort utterly destroyed and his forces decimated...Hagrid refused to rest, refused to let pureblood supremacism grow quiescent as it had 17 years ago.\\
He concealed himself in the shadows of the wizarding world, with a small cadre of like-minded humans, elves, goblins and other creatures, and together, they began to seek to exterminate the remnants of the pureblood cause. And those who supported an all-human Wizengamot and the ban on wand use. And those who mistreated their house-elves, those who shunned other creatures as inferior, those that refused to make room for giant-kind...\\
 \\
When the only tool you use is a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail. Slowly, but surely, though Hagrid started with noble ambitions, he and his followers' use of dark magic and murder to achieve their ends twisted their minds, turning their quest to purge Britain of its unwanted elements into a war to conquer Britain outright, slaughtering all who stood in their way...
