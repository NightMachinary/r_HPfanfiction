I don't think Hagrid's intelligent enough to become a Dark Lord. Not only is he super prejudiced against anything Dark, but he only has like five years of magical education from over sixty years ago and no wand. Sure, he could probably do some damage due to the relationships he's formed with various beasts, but Aragog's colony won't listen to Hagrid now that Aragog's dead, and the centaurs have no intention and getting involved with wizards, which Hagrid is, no matter that half of him is part giant. He wouldn't convince the unicorns to help him because they're "pure" (conjecture, of course), leaving the only known helpers as his brother Grawp and the thestrals. Grawp would immediately be taken out, which would probably make Hagrid stop his reign out of grief, or it would make him furious but he'd still get nowhere. There is also the fact that Hagrid, for the life of him, can't keep a secret, nor does he realize things that /eleven-year-olds/ do, such was the case with him slipping how to tame Fluffy in the first book.

That would be an interesting one-shot, though.
