True about the fanfiction part, but canon Harry is pretty powerful and intelligent. He mastered a fully corporeal patronus when he was thirteen when most adults aren't capable of that. He also got pretty good grades in all of the subjects that really mattered and failed the one OWL because of his vision.

I could see people making Hagrid have a ton of different friends, too. I mainly meant that he wasn't really book smart, but considering how much time he spends in the forest and in pubs talking to varying people with various backgrounds, then he can be considered pretty damn intelligent. He may not have the best common sense, nor can he really keep a secret, but he has other skills that makes up for that.

You could make him a beast tamer, lol.
