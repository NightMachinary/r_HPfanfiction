True. I was thinking more about the fallout side of it, which vibed a bit like /Divided and Entwined/ and /The Marriage Law Revolution/, but you do tend to smash blood-purist dogma.

EDIT: My intent, possibly not conveyed effectively, was that Hermione was the one to discovered the method. Perhaps she was even inspired by her experiences to make the blood-purists' worst nightmares real - "You've been claiming this for years, why aren't you happy that I'm proving you right?".

I'm not sure I'd agree that it's validating the idea that magic makes you worth more, though. At least in Hermione's head in this prompt, she's thinking "Magic is an incredible gift, one you've abused terribly and don't deserve, so I'm giving it to my sister instead." Of course, the blood-purists /would/ take it as validation, but the thing about bigots and conspiracists is that everything is either taken as validation or denied/ignored.
