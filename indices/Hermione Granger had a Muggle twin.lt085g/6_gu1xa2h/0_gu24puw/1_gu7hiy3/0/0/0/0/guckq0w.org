The first two feel different to me because they use actual real life groups with historical connotations. I suppose the fact that you liken this to writing a story where pureblood propaganda is true is the difference between us that had me asking the question in the first place.

For the second part, yes, yes I am. For example, the idea of a story where Hermione works dark magic on people like Voldemort and Bellatrix to take their magic away and give it to someone else interests me.
