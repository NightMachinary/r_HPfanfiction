For the first part, it would validate pureblood propaganda, but doesn't really change the fact that killing innocent muggleborns is wrong, right? Considering purebloods don't tend to be completely stomped in you fics, why would you not write this?

For the second part, why wouldn't a muggleborn witch want their muggle sibling to have magic if they like them? It's still a cool thing to have. It doesn't mean they are worth more after having magic, simply that magic is something valuable to have. Why would you avoid writing this?
