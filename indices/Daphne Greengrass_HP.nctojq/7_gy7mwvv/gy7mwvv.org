The writing is a bit rough, but if you can get past that

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi]])

Is a fun read.

If you like creature fics I would also strongly recommend

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/6307611/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Siren-s-Song]])

I don't think anyone else mentioned

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener]])

If your looking for a more cracky fic

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/12714427/1/Up-Yours-Dumbles]])

Is a fun short read

I'm about to reread

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/5599903/1/To-Be-Loved]])

Because I don't remember the details

They end up having a child together in

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/Beltane-Child]])

Interesting psudo time travel fix

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/13445758/1/Daphne-s-Letter-from-the-Future]])

Standard year four fics

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/13066499/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Ice-Queen]])

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope]])

OP Harry, long fic with them married before the end of the fic

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/Saviour-of-Magic]])

The aftermath by the same author is a much shorter fun read, but the ship doesn't come in at all until the last quarter of the fic
