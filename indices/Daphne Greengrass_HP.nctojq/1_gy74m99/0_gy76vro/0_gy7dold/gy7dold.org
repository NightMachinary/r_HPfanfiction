Here we go again... (OP won't understand what I meant with this but commodore will üòÅ, I just did what commodore did albeit without edit)

[[/u/CommodorNorrington][u/CommodorNorrington]] speaks boldly and fondly... I second his recs. I would like to add a few of mine too.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13275504/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Vanishing-Princess]]

One of my personal fav with muggle Daphne.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12150047/1/A-Fateful-Walk]]

An after hogwarts-battle encounter that links them. I like his writing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12927652/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Dogfather]]

Unexpected series, nice friendship blooming around.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13408959/1/Don-t-Look-Back-in-Anger]]

My absolute favourite of enemies (not mortal, just school rivalry. Head boy and head girl) to lover Haphne.

Beside these I'll suggest you read all works of Dorothea Greengrass and James spookie.

Edit - And how could I ever forget this in recommendations... I apologise but here it is now recommended

Another nice but a bit darker story (time travel a bit dark Harry but lovely Haphne)(came back for Daphne). Original author deleted their work, it's a copy.

Also, you can find a doc in one of the posts at [[/r/Haphne][r/Haphne]] which contains a list of well written Haphnes. Cheerio
