Oh boy there are some good ones here.

Letters is technically harry fleur, but it has some harry daphne in it and thhere is an alternate ending where harry ends up with daphne instead of fleur [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]]

There's a fic I'm not remembering where harry dates tonks for a while before dating fleur. I can't remember the title though. There is a CHANCE it is cadmean victory, but I don't think that it is. I'll try to find it.

/Start edit: found it, it's called for the love of magic/ pretty fun read!
