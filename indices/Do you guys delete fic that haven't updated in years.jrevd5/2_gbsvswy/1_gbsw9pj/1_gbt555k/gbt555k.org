Stories don't take up all that much hard drive space, so I haven't felt the need to delete any, assuming I downloaded it based on the idea of reading it. There's tons not on my HDD that I didn't download in the first place. I have some regrets about not snarfing more entire fic archives for safekeeping when I was more into fic, since some have gone offline by now. But the total I've saved is maybe a few gigabytes, a crazy amount to actually read (I've read a few percent of it) and yet not much in terms of computer storage these days.
