I tend to download all fics that i'm interested in. Then I place them in specific folders. First folder is called download and all fics initially go there. Then once I get done reading a fic from the download folder it gets moved.

If the fic is a completed story it gets moved to the complete folder. If it is a WIP it gets placed into 1 of 2 folders. If the story has been updated within 2 years it goes into the updateable folder. If it hasn't been updated within two years the story goes into the abandoned folder.

Then every three months I go through the updateable folder and check to see which stories have been updated and download the newer versions. I do the same thing with the abandoned stories once a year.

During Covid-19 I had over half a dozen of the abandoned stories be updated. One of them the last update was more than 5 years ago.

To help me keep track of the WIPs my filename convention adds the number of chapters and the date of the last update to the stories filename making it easier to know to move a file from updateable to abandoned. Complete stories don't include the number of chapters or date.

While I'm disappointed that quite a few stories are abandoned I have no problem going back and reading them again. In fact, I've just started to go through my complete folder and am reading the stories again.
