Hello, ceplma. Just a quick heads up!

It seems that you have attempted to use triple backticks (```) for your codeblock/monospace text block.

*This isn't universally supported on reddit*, for some users your comment will look not as intended.

You can avoid this by *indenting every line with 4 spaces instead*.

There are also other methods that offer a bit better compatability like [[https://stalas.alm.lt/files/new-reddit-codeblock.png][the "codeblock" format feature on new Reddit]].

Have a good day, ceplma.
