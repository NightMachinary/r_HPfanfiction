Headmaster: Flitwick would interesting

Transfiguration: Andromeda Tonks? Maybe she wants something to do now that Teddy's grown up.

Astronomy: Sinistra, if not, maybe some interesting OC for some extra intrigue. A Lestrange, or Dolohov, or someone. Or a minor character, like Gemma Farley (Slytherin)

Care: Rolf Scamander

Divination: Lavender Brown/Parvati Patil (I think Lavender would be more interesting in this case since she's been mutilated by a werewolf)

History of Magic: Sanguini (vampire would know a lot, having lived through it. also +1 for magical being)

Arithmancy: If not Vector, Bill Weasley maybe? He's kinda old now, maybe he doesn't want to live such a 'glamorous' life as a curse-breaker.
