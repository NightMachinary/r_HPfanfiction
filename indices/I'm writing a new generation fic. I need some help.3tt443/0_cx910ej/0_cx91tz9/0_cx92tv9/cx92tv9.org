That's fair about Hooch, at least with how old she looks in the movies (I don't recall her canon character description).

Original character headmaster could certainly be a fun way to do it. Why not take a look through a list of Potter surnames and choose an older sibling/cousin/aunt for one or two of the professor spots? That's kinda what Rowling did with Amelia/Susan Bones. Could pull in some older era names, like McKinnon, MacDonald, Cresswell.
