Why are Sinistra, Hooch, and Vector gone/replaced? Did Binns move on (otherwise he'd still be teaching)?

Also, depending on if you're doing new gen or /next/ generation, Minerva was headmistress until at least 2008 according to the Wiki. The new headmaster is likely to be someone who had extensive teaching experience, so not someone younger than 50 most likely.
