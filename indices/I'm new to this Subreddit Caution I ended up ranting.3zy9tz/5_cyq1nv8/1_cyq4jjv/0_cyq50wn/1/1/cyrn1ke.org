I hate you for showing me this. I finally had time to read it and I honestly think this might be in my Top 5 favorite fanfics. The humor and writing and the dialouge is so well done that it didn't even make me cringe. Although i could have done without the POV constantly jumping around, but other than that. Holy Shit this is amazing.
