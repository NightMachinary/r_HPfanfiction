Join the DLP forum, post five times and post your story snippet in the Work by Author section. People will tell you honestly what you fucked up and how you can improve your story without relying on tired boring tropes. Be aware, the DLP forum is not a hugbox. If you suck, people will tell you so in a very direct way. It's the best kind of feedback if you want to improve.
