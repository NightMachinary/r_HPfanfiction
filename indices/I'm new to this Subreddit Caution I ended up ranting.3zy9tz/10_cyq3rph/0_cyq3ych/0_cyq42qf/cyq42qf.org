Work by Author is meant to be a place where authors can get feedback on their work, not an alternative to ff.net for reading stories. Presumably, if a new member can't be bothered to make five meaningful posts in the forums, than it's probable they won't be able to contribute meaningful criticism on WBA.

Also, something about some asshole plagiarizing a ton of WBA stories.
