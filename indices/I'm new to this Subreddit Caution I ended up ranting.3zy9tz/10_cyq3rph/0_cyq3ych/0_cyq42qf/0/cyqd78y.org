  Also, something about some asshole plagiarizing a ton of WBA stories.
#+end_quote

I'm up to 6 reports in a ~45 days for people plagiarizing, especially DLP 5* authors and stories. I don't know if it's a bot or a really dedicated troll, or perhaps even someone with a severe mental disorder and a desperate need for validation, but regardless it's gotten really, really bad recently. I'm not sure if the backend is capable of a more thorough banning, but ffnet is in desperate need of it for this person.

Edit: and I'm not talking just one or two things, their account is literally 200+ stories that every last one of which are in the top 5k reviewed stories. All have been banned but occasionally another one pops up having slipped through the radar.
