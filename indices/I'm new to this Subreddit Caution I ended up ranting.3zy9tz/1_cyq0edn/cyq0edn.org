Congratulations! You've now seen everything there is to see in the HPFanfiction community. Might as well stop now, goodbye!

But seriously, that while I consider this subreddit a hell of a lot more intelligent than most Fanfic readers, in terms of opinions, this subreddit is a damn divided bunch of people. You'll probably form a bit of a love/hate relationship with us if you stick around.
