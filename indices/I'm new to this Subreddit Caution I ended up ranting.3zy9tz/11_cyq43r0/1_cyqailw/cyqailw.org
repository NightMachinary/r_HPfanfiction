Not true at all. There are plenty of good fics with any one of those characters in prominent roles. Per "Sturgeon's Law" most of what is on ff.net is crap. I don't read slash but still won't filter out Draco/Snape/Lucius because every now and then I will stumble across something worth reading involving those characters.
