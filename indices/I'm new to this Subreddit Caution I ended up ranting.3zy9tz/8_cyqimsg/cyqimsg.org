Just posted this in another thread, but I might as well repeat it here. DLP is one place for HP fanfic discussion, though they have their biases and atmosphere... I think [[http://forums.spacebattles.com][Space Battles]] is more welcoming, and it has [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/][an active HP fanfic discussion thread]].
