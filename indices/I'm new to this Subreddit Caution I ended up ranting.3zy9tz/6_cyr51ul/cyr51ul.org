Sounds like you've run the gauntlet of bad fanfiction. [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] is great finding stories that are worthwhile to read. *TIP* always search the subreddit for before posting a [Fic Request]. You'll likely find that someone has already answered your question. A lot of requests get repeated unnecessarily.
