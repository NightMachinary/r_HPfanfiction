A. There are other beverages to try aside from Red Bull. Herbal tea might be worth a shot.

B. Story ideas are welcome, so long as you are willing to have people tell you what they think. They may even tell you what they think about your ideas, but it is equally likely that they'll start discussing Centaurs... with tentacles. It's a theme lately.

C. If you choose to write, get the help of a beta-reader.

D. 'I've' is short for 'I have' and is not spelled 'Iv'- that might be roman for '4' or a medical term for an intravenous feed, but it is not a subject and verb contraction.

E. Welcome.
