Shit you just described my life four years ago when in two years I feel like I read EVERYTHING worthwhile there is. Except dramione and harry-voldermort, I just can't bring myself to read those. And to think my first stories two stories were ginny-hermione fluff and a doctor who crossover.

Now I can only read things that are far away from canon like wand and shield linkffn(8177168), growing up kneazle linkffn(6690487), marauder or next gen stories. I also have the problem that I can't read anything without getting the urge to write my own. I have actually written about 70000 messy words with enough storylines to make a million and abandoned it.

Make a post with your idea to at least have a sounding board. It's frustrating to be excited for something and not having someone to talk about it.
