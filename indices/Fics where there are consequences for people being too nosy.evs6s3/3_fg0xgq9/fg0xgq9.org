I see this ALL THE TIME in Harry Potter crossover fics. Which ever character(s) go(es) to Hogwarts end up as DADA professor or transfer student. Because the trio doesn't know them and they act differently(even though it's usually stated they're from outside the country) there is instant suspicion. Cue stalking, eavesdropping, B&E and the character ends up spilling their life's story along with all the info as to why they're there. It's annoying. The only exception I've seen is a FMA/HP crossover with fem Ed where after the trio gets caught in her office she rips them a new one. After Harry says he deserves to know everything, she goes on a tirade, kicks them out, and the trio gets ZERO info. It was supremely satisfying.
