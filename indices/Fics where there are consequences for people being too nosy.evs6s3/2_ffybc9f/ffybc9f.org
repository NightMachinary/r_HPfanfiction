It sounds like the sort of stories young people who are learning how to navigate social relationships might write. I see a lot of these kinds of negotiations going on in the Middle School where I work. Learning how to be a good friend and respect a person's need for privacy takes a long time and usually involves many missteps. I cringe thinking about my own stumbling around that I did at that age.
