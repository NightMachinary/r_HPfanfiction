I mean you can get down to 0.72 with an TAS, but it's real Finnicky, it's possible to get 0.8, but it's requiring near inhuman luck, they only managed that in optimal conditions, (going into bionics, and investing into the nudist perk for about .35 second saved. Beating 1.1 could be plausible, however getting anywhere below .9 for an unmoded humanoid seems like a stretch.
