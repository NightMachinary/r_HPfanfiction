All [[https://FF.Net][FF.Net]] needs to do is make sure they aren't hosting anything in Europe and geo-block the EEA. I hope that when enough of the internet is unavailable to the EU (they bitch on [[/r/worldnews][r/worldnews]] about media sites being unavailable to them due to the GDPR) they get their shit together. I appreciate what the EU has done on a myriad of things, especially the Environment...but this is not one of their strong points. I hope the Pirate Party starts getting more attention.
