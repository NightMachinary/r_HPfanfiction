They are not. They are directly elected by the people in European Union nations in the European Parliament elections. The next are being held starting May 23rd.

Even if they were actually elected by the European Council, it would still be democratic...as the European Council is comprised of the member Prime Ministers or their chosen representatives (all elected directly or indirectly through party control). The group you are thinking of being elected by the European Council is the European Commission.

Remember...

European Parliament = US House of Representatives / UK House of Commons

European Council = US Senate / UK House of Lords

European Commission = US Government (Cabinet) / HM Government (Cabinet)

Except a fair group of the powers are flopped or more closely resemble their historical counterparts.
