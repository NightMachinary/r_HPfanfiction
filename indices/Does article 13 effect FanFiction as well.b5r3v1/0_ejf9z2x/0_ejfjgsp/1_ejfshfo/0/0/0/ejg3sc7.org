The President of the United States is selected by the Electoral College (which have a massively complicated explanation behind it but basically they aren't elected and don't have to do what we vote for, and that was decided on purpose because our founders thought direct democracy was stupid).

Every senior government official (Executive AND Judicial) is nominated by the President who was selected in that undemocratic method and given an up or down vote by the Senate which (while democratically elected now) is very lopsided on how it represents our population (because it was supposed to represent the sovereignty of the individual states, thus why it used to be up to the state legislatures or governors to select them and still is when there is a vacancy).

All other members of the Government, like your post man, is a civil employee and is not elected.
