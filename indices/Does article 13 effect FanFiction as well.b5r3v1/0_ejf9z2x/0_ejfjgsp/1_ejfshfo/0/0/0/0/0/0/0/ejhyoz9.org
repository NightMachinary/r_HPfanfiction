The guy you're responding to is....well calling him clueless is as disingenuous as his argument. As you said he's not technically wrong. But...it's all wrong in practice.

It's based on things that could, in theory, happen. But wont. And if they did the system would immediately change. It's sorta like how the Queen has the authority to Declare war for Canada. If she said today, "Canada you are now at war with Chad! Invade!" Canada would decide that the queen no longer had the authority to declare war for Canada.

There's also the fact that he presents the 'United States' as one entity, ignoring what happens on a state level. Like, say, the fact that the Justices of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin are all elected officials.

The Election of Hayes didn't have a faithless elector, but does remain the only that could have really had one change the outcome. But it didn't, and the election process has evolved away from that.

The bit about the Founding Fathers shows a lack of understanding of...well..the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers would detest the American Government today. The amount of 'Federal' power would seem shocking to almost all of them. They were smart enough to anticipate that individual states would have individual needs and that Tyranny of the Majority should be avoided. An immediate concession to the majority does not foster debate or improve ideas.

But as you said, the things he said are possible, but hyperbole. Yes, they could happen. Also the world could end tomorrow. But then the whole iamverysmart Did you know the US Isn't a democracy! Yes? It's common knowledge? But then goes on to ignore virtually everything that makes the government work and the entire concept of the States. One of the biggest debates in US Politics is the individualized power of the states vs Federal power.

And ignores the fact that State decisions effect the every day life of the majority of Americans far more than Federal ones.
