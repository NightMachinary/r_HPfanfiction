I knew faithless electors were possible, but I'll admit I didn't realize they happened as often as they apparently do. Of course, at least according to Wikipedia, "Ultimately, faithless electors have only impacted the outcome of an election once, during the 1796 election." So maybe that's what I was thinking of when I thought that even though they technically could do what they wanted, it didn't matter.

Does "government" really mean "executive" in the rest of the world? That seems very strange. How are lawmakers and judges not part of the government? I guess it makes some sense to focus specifically on government officials.

The election of Hayes was over 100 years ago, so while it could technically happen again, I'm not as concerned with it. As for Ford's appointment, I didn't claim that the American government was completely democratic. That obviously wasn't democratic at all. I just said you left some stuff out.
