The house has nothing to do with the selection of government officials (government means executive to most of the world). Also the individual votes don't decide what the electors choose. Some states have laws saying that the electors are supposed to uphold the popular vote but it's all behind the scenes and is unenforceable. See faithless electors. Additionally see the election of Hayes and the appointment of Ford for more weirdness. In short, you don't know what you are talking about.
