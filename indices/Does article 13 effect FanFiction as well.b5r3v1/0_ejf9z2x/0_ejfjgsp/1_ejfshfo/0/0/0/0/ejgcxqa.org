I feel like you're giving a slightly misleading impression of how undemocratic the American government is. Nothing you said is technically wrong, but you left out the democratic parts.

The electoral college isn't strictly democratic, but it's approximately so, since it just means votes are by state instead of by individual. But the individual votes do go into selecting the state votes. (I'm sure you know this, so this point is for people who might not.) You do say the Senate is democratically elected, and that's just as correct as saying the Electoral College members are democratically chosen.

Also, you left out the House of Representatives, which is a lot more democratic than the Senate and an equal partner in the legislative branch.
