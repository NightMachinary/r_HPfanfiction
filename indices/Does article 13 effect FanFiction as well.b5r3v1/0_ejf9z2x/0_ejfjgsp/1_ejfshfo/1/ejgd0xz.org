No they are not. The path of EU legislation is started at the Council of Ministers. This is when all the EU member state government ministers of a similar portfolio gather to discuss the direction of EU wide legislation.

Then the Commissioner ( every 5 years each member state parliament nominates a parliamentarian who is sent to EU to supervise a portfolio. They mutually divide up the portfolios among themselves, allowing country's to administer their own pet sectors ) carries out the directed objective listening to input from the council, the parliament, groups lobbying and from member states parliaments.

Finally it is passed or amended at a parliament stage through straight up majority voting. The EU parliament is elected via proportional representation from every EU state with smaller countries getting a larger number of representatives per person.

At this point it becomes EU wide law unless it needs further passing in local assemblies due to constitutional reasons.

At all stages of this legislation, an official at a member state or EU level has guided and shaped this legislation. The EU as pooled national sovereignty is highly reactive to the public, I have lobbied them in previous periods on matters of agriculture and have only found well-informed and well-meaning individuals.
