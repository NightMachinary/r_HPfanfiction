  The EU as pooled national sovereignty is highly reactive [...] I have lobbied them in previous periods

Well, that's not exactly surprising, is it? As a lobbyist, or part of a lobbying effort, you would have been much closer to and certainly have a lot more influential over EU politicians than the vast majority of EU citizens will ever have in their life. Case in point the copyright reform here.

Fair disclaimer: I left out the "to the public" part of your quote, because I don't agree with it as it was stated and because it feels misleading, considering the content of your next sentence.

But then again, that is merely my impression and experience. While I never lobbied for or against anything with that particular group, I've been in contact with a couple dozen EU politicians from my country over the past two decades and my experience hasn't been any better or worse than with any other politician on a national level.

I can understand why you'd have a different experience, because many matters of agriculture would have an immediate impact on a certain region or even the whole country and thus the national economy. It's not exactly far-fetched that they'd go the extra mile for their constituents. On matters of policy however I am convinced the EU would look /very/ different if the population had a greater, or at least a more direct influence on EU politics.
