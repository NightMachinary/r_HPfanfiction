Site owners aren't powerful enough to be able to afford showing respect, as you call it. If the bureaucrats decide that fanfiction violates their new law, they can destroy the website rather easily. One possible solution to avoid this would be to migrate the website to darknet, but that would cost money and lose visitors anyway, because for most users navigating to the new location would be inconvenient enough to make them gradually lose interest.

The hosting websites and the community don't have much control over the developments for the question of respectfulness to even apply to them. It's like getting cross with Alice because she's being disrespectful and not greeting you after Bob has hit her on the head with a pipe and sent her into a coma.
