Yeah, ik. Think I intended to reply to the comment one up.

I didn't mean on behalf of the sites, it's just a bit of a kick from the community to be a bit gung ho about it. There would be no Harry Potter fanfiction in the first place were it not for an author in Europe, so 'screw you I got mine' feels a bit harsh. Guess its interesting to see how HP has diversified out as a brand and property.
