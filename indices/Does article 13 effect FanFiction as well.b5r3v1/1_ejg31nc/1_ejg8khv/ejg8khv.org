The issue is that the host (ex: FF.net) is profiting off of the service they're providing (Ie hosing the stories) and thus by extension are profiting off of copyrighted materials. As technically ff.net is profitting from the usage of a copyrighted product almost certainly without the consent of the copyright holder.

There's some distinctions that I think are important, but my opinion is irrelevant in the debate in that there's big difference from say, Youtube where snippets from movies and tv and other things can be used, uncited, and done with no permission.

There's sort of a dubious consent with fanfiction. And you don't usually get copyright strikes against Fanfiction because there's sort of the intrinsic understanding that it's not original work.

I honestly don't think this will have any affect on fanfiction as a whole.
