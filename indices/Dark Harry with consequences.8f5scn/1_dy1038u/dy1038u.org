I honestly can't believe I'm recommending this. This is not excellent by any means, but the way the author has written Adrian (Harry) is honestly nothing short of incredible. The last 3 or 4 chapters have been just flat out on point in terms of character depth and tying up loose ends. The first 100k words are a bit rough and the summary doesn't make it sound all that great, but trust me its worth it. Adrian struggles with his path, struggles with the acts he does. He struggles to choose between Remus as a father figure or Voldemort.

Harry is "Dark" but not edgy, and has a conscience that is always on his heels. Murder is most certainly not normalized, as there have been maybe 3 of them so far? The best part is I honestly don't know what is going to happen, so much is up in the air. Give it a try.

One last thing about Adrian's Character: /I don't like him as a person/. Can I sympathize? Yes. But I don't necessarily enjoy the way he does things. That alone sets this fic apart.
