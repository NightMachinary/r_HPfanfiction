Lesser Evils was pretty good, but the sequel is looking pretty bleh. Sirius is suddenly a megalomaniac, which would've been ok and not at all surprising, if it had been built up to. Instead he's 3/4 of the way to conquering britain in all but name, and the way he chews Harry out for not /furthering the cause/ is very jarring.
