iirc [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] is what you're looking for if you can take a bit of bashing, angst and iffy writing. tl;dr Harry's sister dies young and he does some /seriously/ fucked up things trying to resurrect her. It's been a while since I've read it, but I don't remember any other characters patting him on the back for it. Don't recall any political assassinations unfortunately though.

Edit: Added a sentence and made another sound better.
