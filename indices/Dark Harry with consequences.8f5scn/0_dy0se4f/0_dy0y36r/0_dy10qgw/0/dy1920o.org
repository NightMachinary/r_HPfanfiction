  maybe "let her die" is technically correct, but to me it felt like murder, possibly because of his motives

It absolutely felt like murder, but could he have been charged (for that instance anyway)? There was a huge amount of debate online when that episode aired, which I guess proves how good it was. I'm very curious as to how a judge would have ruled, had such a case gone to court - I know some states have bystander laws in effect (i.e you're obligated to help), not sure if New Mexico is one of them.

  There's this hard to describe vibe that I get, where the narrative actually seems to approve of the protagonist's actions, or worse, takes some sort of perverse pleasure out of them.

Ah, that's just author fiat, i.e bad storytelling. I see it pretty much as the equivalent of thousands of Draco/Hermione or Draco/Snape fics, where they abuse her or treat her like dirt but she perseveres in the relationship because "he's a good man inside" or some such nonsense.
