  Plenty of people cheered for Walter White, even at his worst (I did too, up to where he let Jane die).

That's what makes it brilliant! You go along for the ride until a point when you have to seriously look into the abyss of yourself and ask yourself "Why did I cheer for this douche?". Incidentally for me that turning point also was him murdering Jane (maybe "let her die" is technically correct, but to me it felt like murder, possibly because of his motives).

  There were actual campaigns lobbying Vince Gilligan to have Walter win.

I can believe that, but I feel sorry for these people and sort of pity them if they still felt that way after he poisoned a kid. They miss out on, for me, one of the most profound experiences in fiction: Nodding along with the descent until at one point you're horrified and can't really tell when a line has been crossed ("but we are already killing innocent people *right now*, so the actual line was probably crossed long ago"). I was really impressed that they were actually going this route, with consequences and everything.

  The generations after that don't like their stories that way. Perhaps mirroring the way the world moved - in the late 80's/early 90's there was a brief lull, a period of illusion where everyone felt that things would keep getting better. Later events shattered that illusion.

  So yeah, we like our heroes dirty. With a murkier morality, more realistic, more cynical. Some even like them nearly indistinguishable from villains - not my cup of tea, but I understand where they're coming from.

Not sure about the generational thing, but you're right that murky characters have become more widely popularised. I'm also a sucker for them. But those are very different from Walter White or most of the Dark!Harrys. At least Breaking Bad is self aware, but for some reason the Dark!Harrys still wear their hats proudly: There's this hard to describe vibe that I get, where the narrative actually seems to approve of the protagonist's actions, or worse, takes some sort of perverse pleasure out of them. It creeps me out! On the other end of the spectrum you have Breaking Bad which narrates almost with a cold neutrality (until arguably the very end when it becomes more obvious in judging Walter White: Look at how much misery and death this man created. It certainly never cheers him on, it tricks the audience into doing that instead, because of expectations).
