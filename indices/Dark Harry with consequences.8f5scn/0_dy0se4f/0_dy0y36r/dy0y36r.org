Plenty of people cheered for Walter White, even at his worst (I did too, up to where he let Jane die). There were actual campaigns lobbying Vince Gilligan to have Walter win.

My personal estimate is that it's a generational thing. Baby-boomers liked their stories clean-cut: This is the villain, this is the good guy, these are the obstacles he has to overcome, happy ending.

The generations after that don't like their stories that way. Perhaps mirroring the way the world moved - in the late 80's/early 90's there was a brief lull, a period of illusion where everyone felt that things would keep getting better. Later events shattered that illusion.

So yeah, we like our heroes dirty. With a murkier morality, more realistic, more cynical. Some even like them nearly indistinguishable from villains - not my cup of tea, but I understand where they're coming from.
