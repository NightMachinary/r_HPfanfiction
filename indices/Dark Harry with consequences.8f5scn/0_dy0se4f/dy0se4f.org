Problem is Dark!Harry authors don't have the balls to write a story like Breaking Bad where it turns out that the guy you rooted for is the bad guy and an irredeemable arsehole who deserves to die. They want to write their edgy little power fantasy, where they get to have slaves and crucio everyone who disagrees, but without the consequences.

I'd be surprised if there's even a single story that fits your request. Sorry that I don't have any, just needed to get this off my chest.
