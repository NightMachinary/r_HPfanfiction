See, I have a totally different problem with Dark!Harry stories - the authors rarely accurately depict the state of mind a man has to be in, in order to take the lives of murders and rapists, without completely breaking down himself. Taking a life weighs on you, and while you may not feel it initially, or even immediately after, once you have some time to come down from the event and the aftermath, it is there. Waiting for you. You remind yourself that it was justified, necessary even, in defense of your life and the lives of others, but the weight is still there. But you put your pants on in the morning and keep going. If it happens again, you keep on going. Some people don't have the mentality to keep it together, and they break down. Some people are able to put the weight down in the morning, go about their day and pick it back up at night. A rare few are able let the weight go completely - and I freely confess to being a little unnerved around them.

Too many authors miss this.

(Notable exceptions are those who actually address the abuse suffered by Harry, or even take it further, not that it is needed - in canon Harry should have already been a socially stunted dysfunctional eleven year old, or for plots sake, a budding sociopath. Either is more likely than the selfless nonsense canon presented)
