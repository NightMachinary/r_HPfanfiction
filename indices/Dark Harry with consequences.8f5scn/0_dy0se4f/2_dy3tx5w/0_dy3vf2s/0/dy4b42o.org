I won't disagree with you on the potential scenarios, but rather expand my dysfunctional categorization to include the issues you listed above.

As far as becoming selfless, in my experience, between the dysfunctionality and the history of abuse, even once freed from it, they often become incredibly ~selfish~, having perhaps over-learned the lesson that no one will help them, except themselves. Only once their needs are met, and their resources secured have I seen them become generous.
