I do not agree with your last tidbit at all.

Millions of people suffer abuse much worse than Harry Potter and do not become budding sociopaths or have stunted growth. Some might, while others become bullies, some nervous and shy wreaks, some motivated to study and escape and more. It's not unbelievable that someone suffering abuse clings to the friends they made and will be willing to do /anything/ for them. In fact, it's probably the most likely scenario. Wouldn't you do anything for the first people to show you affection? People who are desperate for love tend to be incredibly selfless, which leads them to all sorts of problems.
