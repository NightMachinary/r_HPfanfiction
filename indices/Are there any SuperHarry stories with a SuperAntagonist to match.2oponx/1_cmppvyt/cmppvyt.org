Perhaps the classic story like this is Bobmin's million-plus-word [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise/Sunset Over Britain]], a story I could never force myself to finish. It is very angsty and hasn't aged well yet fits the OP's description to a tee. In this story, Harry and Voldemort are so far above normal wizards in the power stakes as to be laughable.

Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] is another that comes to mind. Though Harry's plussed-up to the gills, Voldemort is, if anything, far more so. The level of desperation among the protagonists is so high that by the end it's hard to find hope of a favorable ending.

Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird]] trilogy is another with an amped-up Harry and very buff Voldemort.
