I loved wastelands, but the hero trilogy just wasn't that good. Even the beginnings of wastelands was a little rough, like it was trying too hard to be epic. That was one of the cool things about reading wastelands, you could actually see the author getting better as the story went on. It started off trying too hard and then turned into something that really was amazing.
