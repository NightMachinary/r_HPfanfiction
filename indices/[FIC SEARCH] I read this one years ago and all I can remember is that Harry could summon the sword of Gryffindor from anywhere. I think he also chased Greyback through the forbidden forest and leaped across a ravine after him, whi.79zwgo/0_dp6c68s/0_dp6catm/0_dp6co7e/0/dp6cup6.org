Yep, this is the one. But I don't think it's the guys hand, i think his chest gets impaled. Some random OC waving it around spouting ownership or something. Then Harry realised that when he unsummoned it, it didn't go back to the box that is it's usual storage place, so he had to resummon it and keep it on his person till he could give it to his house elf to be stored again.
