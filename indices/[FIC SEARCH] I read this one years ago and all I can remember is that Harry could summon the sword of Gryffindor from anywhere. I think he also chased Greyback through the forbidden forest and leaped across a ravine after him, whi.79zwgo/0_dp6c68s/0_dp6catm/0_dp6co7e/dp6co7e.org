Random question for you.

I've been looking for a fic for a bit, and I'm wondering if this one is it.

At some point Harry leaves the Sword of Gryffindor somewhere and Lucius Malfoy and some Death Eaters come across it. Harry summons the sword and so it disappears right in front of the Death Eaters.

One of them like, waves his hand through where the sword is or something. Coincidentally at that exact moment Harry /un/summons the sword, and it appears stabbed through the guy's hand. He dies from the Basilisk venom, I think.

Is this the fic, do you know?
