It seems like every grey!Harry fic has a scene where he explains how two of the three unforgivables are actually not so bad, and you can kill someone with any spell if you try hard enough anyway, so it's okay for him to use those unforgivables as much as he wants.

But somehow, they all disagree on which unforgivable is the "bad" one. And they all completely miss the point anyway.
