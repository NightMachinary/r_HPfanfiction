I thought that each of the Unforgivable curses required genuine emotion to cast them. Crucio requires a hatred and want to causes someone pain, Imperio requires the will to dominate and Arvada Kadavra needs hate and intent to murder. Not kill, murder. This part is fanon: I think that's why those 3 specifically are Unforgivable, because there's no way you could not mean to cast them. You can't cast AK in self-defense and you can't cause it to put an elderly relative out of their misery. That's why it's a life sentence.
