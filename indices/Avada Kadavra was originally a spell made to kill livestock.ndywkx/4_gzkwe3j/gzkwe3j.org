First I've heard of this take. I remember a fanfic or two (don't remember their names at the moment) where the Unforgivables were originally either medical spells or corrupted versions of medical spells. There was also one that said that Avada Kedavra was technically only half of a spell, though whether the intended counter was never written down before testing or if it was simply incomplete is something I don't remember off the top of my head.
