I've tried writing a zombie story before in the HP universe and found one problem with it. Zombies are absolutely fucking useless against magic. Zombies work when people have limited ressources like bullets, water and food. None of this is limited for wizards. Wizards could shoot zombies day in and out and even if its just one, a nicely placed fiendfyre does the job.

Also, Harry could just bait the walkers and lure them into traps as a day-job.

As much as I like the general idea, I think it won't work without brute forcing the story to do what you want it to do.
