I remember reading a (now abandoned) Last of Us crossover where Harry, in his escape from a ravaged London, lost his wand. The story picks up some months after that; a starving, emaciated Harry foraging for food in a shopping mall, unable to use magic to any real extent and forced to use muggle methods to survive.

Also, he's fourteen in this fic, so he'd only had 3 years of hogwarts training.

Gimme a sec, I'll find the fic

I think this fic fixes the problems you brought up.
