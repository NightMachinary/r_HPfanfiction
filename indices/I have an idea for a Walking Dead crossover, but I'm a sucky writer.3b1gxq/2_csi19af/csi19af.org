Perhaps it would ramp up the issue if Harry has no idea of any powers he has over the dead, and he's stuck in Walking Deadland without a wand, broom or any other magic items he normally would use to handle the situation. /Maybe/ he has some notion of the wandless tricks he might attempt, but the real problem is that he keeps running and they keep following and he has to sleep sometime.

It would only be after a few story arcs worth of tension between him and other survivors that the situation would come to a head. Harry, trapped and desperate, stands forth and commands them to stop with all the faith he has in himself as a wizard.

That's when they all stop and kneel before him. Everyone else turns to gawk at him, wondering how many need not have died if Harry had simply realized this sooner.

Of course, the real challenge is to decide 'what happens next?'
