If you want Walking Dead style zombies, and magic, you can't use the Harry Potter style magic. A zombie apocalypse is just a nuisance if you have infinite access to magical offensive spell that dwarfs most muggle firepower, and you can teleport, multiply amount of food, conjure water, repair walls or barricades with a flick of your wrist.. You either need to up the zombies to such a level they aren't zombies, because you can't counter magic without intelligence, or you need to take away the magic. And if you do, why have wizards at all?

It's a complex situation that's very hard to solve.
