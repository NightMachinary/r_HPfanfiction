It sounds like this such a pivotal part of your plot! What are YOUR reasons for her to obsess? I'm not trying to be snarky at all (it keeps coming out a bit, but I mean this seriously) but if you can't work that out, I'm not sure you're ready to write the character this way. Search for Luna's reasonings, her motivations, then you can follow them to her actions, and then to the plot and her further feelings and reactions. There are any number of reasons why someone might obsess over a person - you need to explore the character's reasons yourself.
