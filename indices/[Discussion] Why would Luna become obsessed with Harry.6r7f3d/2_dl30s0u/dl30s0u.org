She wouldn't. You can't force a character to behave in a way contrary to their character, and maintain that character. Also you've got things backwards. You should let your characters drive the plot, not force the characters to fit into an idea. This isn't easy, but is the key to writing good fanfiction. Characters are everything. If a character doesn't fit, use someone else, or twist the story until things work.
