My personal headcanon about magic is not that magicals came after, my headcanon is that everyone was once magical, but the power hungry ones wanted to enslave earths magical powers for themselves in a ritual, but they failed completely and mother nature/magic/whateveryouwanttocallit took away their magic, in a some tens of generations they started fearing/hating magic wielders due to them having something they had records of having but lost due to stupidity, this started the witch hunts, I believe that magic made the universe and we have no fkin idea how old magic is, but older than the current universe.

This headcanon is a combination of a very very /very/ large amount of fanfics, but the main parts are from the ones with amazing worldbuilding, that I remember but cant find
