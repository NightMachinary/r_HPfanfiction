I think natural magic has been around since the big bang and there's random bursts sometimes which on earth allowed some species to mutate magical abilities, like some dinosaurs becoming dragons and some humans gaining some magical abilities. Humans would have been doing very simple magic since the caveman days but with relatively little success and a high rate of mages killing themselves with a misstep in the rain dance. Eventually when civilization developed and education started to become a thing magic was obviously also taught and developed to be more capable, potions and things like that were developed but much weaker than modern day. I don't think battle magic was really a practical thing until the wand was invented by chance somewhere in ancient Greece or Rome (probably the Greek invented it and the Romans copied and improved it). Then with their primitive wands and attack spells the Romans had a huge advantage and conquered all of Europe, at least until some barbarian druids managed to reverse engineer wands and fight back, which caused the expansion of the Roman empire to stall and eventually collapse. Things slowed down in Europe with only a few rich magical families having access to ancient Roman knowledge until Hogwarts was founded and progress started to gain steam again. By the Renaissance there were plenty of explorers traveling the world, bringing back knowledge of foreign magic (the Chinese wizards made some progress too after all) but Europeans still had the best wands and the best combat magic, which meant the native American wizards had no chance. Around the same time muggles made progress in gunnery and wizards started to conceal themselves even more than they had done previously, since now an armed muggle soldier could actually have a good chance of defeating a wizard (guns are useless against a simple shield charm but pulling a trigger takes less time than casting Protego). After all the (European) wizards agreed to keep magic secret, they made sure to enforce that everywhere else too, so the Australian wizards got captured and forced to let the European muggles conquer their country without being able to use magic against them. I'm very sure that the traditional Aboriginal shamans in the Outback and the wizards of European descent who live in Sydney really don't get along with each other even today, so I doubt that Voldemort would risk sending a team of Death Eaters into the Outback where they might get attacked by completely unknown magic (the shamans have wands now too) just to kill two muggles, even if they are the parents of Potter's friend.
