I think when you contemplate the HP universe for too long, you arrive at the conclusion that it's probably an anthropocentric universe.

Stuff like the human-relative idea of "food" being part of the rules of Transfiguration, the fact that we know that souls are real and an afterlife exists, the fact that moral qualities such as "goodness" are not opinions but rather matters of magical fact (per JKR that Voldemort taking Harry's blood into him put goodness in his blood such that he could have redeemed himself, had he wanted to do so), the Messianic nature of Harry's role in the story in combination with the fact that JKR is a Christian. All of this leads you to the conclusion that the very nature of the universe is built around humans, presumably by "God".

This is the bit of the HP universe I dislike the most and I try to make things less anthropocentric in my worldbuilding. For example, in VP I had Draco specifically note that while souls exist, wizards don't know what happens to them on death, and it's entirely possible the soul just disappears with no afterlife.
