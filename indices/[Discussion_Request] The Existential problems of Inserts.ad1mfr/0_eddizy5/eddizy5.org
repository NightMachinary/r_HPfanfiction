There's a fourth situation, though, isn't it? Which seems to be what most SI fanfictions are running on. Namely, the /Harry Potter/ universe is as real as theirs, and simply /happens/ to resemble the book series from their home world; the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum physics is correct and they've somehow traveled through dimensions to another universe. That it would resemble /Harry Potter/ doesn't need any particular justification: if there's an infinity of universes, it's only likely that some of them would resemble famous fictions from other universes more or less closely.
