Interesting post. I can't really comment on SI fics as they exist now, as I haven't read any in full, but I agree that existential dread is a good and sensible topic for them to broach.

The few I have looked at seem to all have the insert thrilled to be ripped from their mundane lives. I'd like to see a more nuanced one where they're torn between a new life of magic or trying to get back home to their loved ones, or, better, they want desperately to leave, and the plot is them figuring it out, possibly making friends along the way who are sad to see them go.
