It is a lot more common in fandoms where you can't imagine that 'its really happening in the background of the real world'. ASOIAF is full of them. And quite a few "Harry Potter & Co get Inserted into ASOIAF". Some of them are even good. (And some of them are horrible. There was one where the insert declared he wasn't a psychopath and proceeds to murder everyone he sees because it is ASOIAF. That author has... interesting tastes :|).

(There are a few ASOIAF inserts into HP, but so far every one of those I've read has been bad :( )
