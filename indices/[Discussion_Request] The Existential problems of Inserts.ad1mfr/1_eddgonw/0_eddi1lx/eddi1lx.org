  What?! I'm just going to ignore that...

From the constraints I put on it, they are. Not because of lack of interest, but because there are other outlets to use. HPverse has quite a bit of "character discovers hp world is real", sometimes having that character come from a world without the hp books, other times having them exist but be distorted. Since there is another viable way to introduce modern (and relatable) characters to the setting, you are less likely to be a "Alien Space Bat transported me to a fictional world" that you see all over some IPs...

  All Christians and Muslims and most other religious people believe something like this. This doesn't appear to be as fundamental of a problem to their existence in this world as you make it out to be.

Abrahamic religions (which are a far cry from 'most other religions people btw) were what I was referring to by "very very problematic". They rely on the notion of an absolute god, and don't generally smile on the notion of some other entity taking its place. Alternatively, believing the god of their new reality is the same as their old one brings up theological questions relating to a more "activist" god in one universe vs another...

  I agree that those are probably good questions to ask by the protagonist, but I don't think they are "big" problems. He can just answer "yes" and "yes" and move on from that.

Those were the follow on questions. I was thinking the interesting part would be the struggle to figure out the constraints of their knoweldge (simplified: what kind of insert they are in)...

  Just my 2 cents: If you find yourself in a world that's supposed to be "fictional", yet everything behaves and acts the same as if it were the "real" world, the words "real" and "fictional" clearly don't have the meaning that you thought they had and should stop thinking in those terms until you redefine them.

Kinda the entire point is that they do not act the same. The real world is messy, and rarely involved concise stories or plot armor or convienent plot twists...
