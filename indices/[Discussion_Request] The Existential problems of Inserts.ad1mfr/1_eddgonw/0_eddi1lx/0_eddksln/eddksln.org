  Kinda the entire point is that they do not act the same. The real world is messy, and rarely involved concise stories or plot armor or convienent plot twists...

So, the characters in the fictional world should be able to figure out that it is fiction because it is so 'unreal'?

What if there's an even messier world outside of ours, shouldn't you be able to notice how fake this one is? Also why do you equate messiness to reality? Maybe in reality everything is supposed to be nice and orderly and the messiness is what's fake?

If I imagine a person from the real world that's nice and orderly, that person might be shocked how everyone believes this one to be real, no? "That's not how things are supposed to be in reality!" she might complain.
