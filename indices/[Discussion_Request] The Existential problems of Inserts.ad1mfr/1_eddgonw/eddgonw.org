  I'll start out by noting that Inserts are relatively rare in HP Fanfiction

What?! I'm just going to ignore that...

  you have the added drama that the traveler finds themselves in a constructed world.
#+end_quote

All Christians and Muslims and most other religious people believe something like this. This doesn't appear to be as fundamental of a problem to their existence in this world as you make it out to be.

  Plus you have the whole "do i have a right to change things" and "Am I even 'real' anymore?".
#+end_quote

(Cue: "It's all part of God's plan" or something like that)

I agree that those are probably good questions to ask by the protagonist, but I don't think they are "big" problems for someone involved in the action: He/She can just answer "yes" and "yes" and move on from that.

  This is particularly true by the second and third type, although you do see this sometimes addressed ("This world was created when you were inserted, but now they are as real as you are" or something)
#+end_quote

This is a great idea for a crack fic where the SI, instead of following the plot and main characters, becomes a total recluse and investigates philosophy and metaphysic because he wants to discover the /nature/ of this new world and how it came to be and what that means for (his) reality.

  tl:dr; Thoughts on an inserted character dealing with the fact they are living a world of fiction, and some of the hidden horrors that might imply?
#+end_quote

Just my 2 cents: If you find yourself in a world that's supposed to be "fictional", yet everything behaves and acts the same as if it were the "real" world, the words "real" and "fictional" clearly don't have the meaning that you thought they had and should stop thinking in those terms until you redefine them.

How do you know that anything you experienced before this even was even "real" (still using words that appear to be meaningless now)?

Epistemology is hard. I'm not sure it's the appropriate subject for a HP fanfic.
