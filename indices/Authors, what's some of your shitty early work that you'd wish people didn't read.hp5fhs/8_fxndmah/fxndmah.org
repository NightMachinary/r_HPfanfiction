I put in the whole Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Black-Slytherin-Turnip-Tabletop-Salmon trope, when it had very little to do with the story. I have gone back and taken some parts out of my older stories, but honestly, I just can't be bothered for this one. I referenced it in a lot of other chapters and crawling through a few hundred thousand words to try and change conversations and scenes I wrote years ago just does not seem worth it. Eh, I don't think anyone cared anyway.
