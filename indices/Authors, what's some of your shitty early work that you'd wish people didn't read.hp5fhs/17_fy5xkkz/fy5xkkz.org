Not even going to link them from shame, sorry. But I wrote a classic 'reading the books' when I was like 14, and I think when I was around 13 I wrote a first person story about the daughter of a death eater. Yes, it was as awful as you could possibly imagine.

I'm glad I wrote them though, they were popular at the time and really boosted my confidence and gave me just general writing experience.
