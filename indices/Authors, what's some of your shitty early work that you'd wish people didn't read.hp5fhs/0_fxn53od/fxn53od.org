Seems folks are chickening out here. Well, I'm game.

I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/][Steelbadger]], I started writing in ~2013. I have some fairly well-regarded works under my belt these days, but back then I was just some idiot who'd trawled through an ocean of fanfiction and who thought they could do it better. Many people have the excuse of 'I started writing fanfiction when I was 8' or other such completely understandable reasons for sucking. I wasn't 8. I was 25, and was /supposed/ to be completing my dissertation at Uni.

I posted the first few bits of my first beautiful story to DLP in January of 2014: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/peradventure.25433/][Peradventure]].(That's in DarkLordPotter's Work by Author section which requires sign-in to see. So, for the sake of transparency, here's the working doc of the whole thing in it's unedited glory: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PbxXxuzNvlDPrX_ftHyq_zuV95JgGZg5LxDxFqdcblg/edit?usp=sharing][GDocs Version]]).

Given the quality, DLP went remarkably easy on me, which meant I went away and decided to try again with something different, which ended up being, quite possibly, worse: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/seconds-different.25774/][Seconds Different]] (Again, that's DLP WbA, so here's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSiJpOsn1XznIvMUY-s0bVUVN1uHxsVNuFejbO3iYu8/edit?usp=sharing][GDocs Prologue]] and [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RRQOj38RH-Rd2Lm8q1BeamW9Nzqb3TNsQ2jloc4KOSo/edit?usp=sharing][GDocs Chapter 1]]).

This also did not survive long, despite many nice things being said of it.

I then decided to forgo DLP, and started writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10659456/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Queen][Harry Potter and the Sun Queen]] directly to FFN. It is an improvement over my previous attempts and has a small following even to this day, but still obviously hamfisted.

Then it was time for my 'popular debut': [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power he Knows Not]] was still pretty clumsy, but it ended up being fairly popular for what it was (basically, canon fixit + Harry + small twist ending).

After that was complete, I started [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] which saw a level of popularity I could never have expected. I still consider it flawed, but when I compare what I was writing in 2015 to what I was able to muster in 2014, it's not hard to see the progression.

Hopefully that has laid down the gauntlet. All ye writers out there reading this. Show me your moves.
