I have two unfinished stories each a couple of chapters long on ffn. Also a story called "69 Ways to Kill Ron Weasley" (I was an edgy teen who really got into Ron bashing) that I never finished. Luckily nobody reads my shit lol. I have a few started on a google drive that I abandoned as well. I have some ideas of stories I'd like to write but I just haven't gotten around to it.
