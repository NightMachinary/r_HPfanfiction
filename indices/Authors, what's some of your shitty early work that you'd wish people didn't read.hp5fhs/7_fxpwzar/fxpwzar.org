Mine was a fem harry fanfiction on wattpad that i deleted out of shame when i rediscovered it for the first time. What I remember about it is that her name was Ivy, she looked just like lily and she was the biggest fucking mary sue. I was 13 so i'm sure the grammer and writing was awful. She also wasn't friends with ron but ginny instead. All three were big fucking mary sues actually. I basically re-hashed the whole series but changing some things here in there. I think she got togethor with neville in the end. I remember around the 6th book i started rushing the ending and crammed some of the elements of the 7th book in and she killed voldemort with her awsome powers. It was very bad and when i reread it i wanted to die on the spot.

Edit: I also just remembered that I fucking advertised it on this very sub and when some of y'all told me it was bad i told them to fuck off. If this was anybody reading this i'm so sorry lmao
