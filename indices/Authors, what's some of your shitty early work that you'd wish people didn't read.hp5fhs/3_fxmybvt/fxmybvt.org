I would be so grateful if any authors shared an older work that highlights their development!

I'm only just trying my hand at writing in the last few months. To be honest, when I started I realised a huge discrepancy between the quality of fics I would consume and the quality I can produce. It's painful, and I accept that this is part of growth when developing a new skill, but I'd love to see how other authors have grown over time! I'm most curious about time management and writing at this point. Anything worth reading that I produce right now takes hours of consideration and revision. I'm in awe of some people's output of high quality writing.

Do you have any old work you wish people didn't read OP?
