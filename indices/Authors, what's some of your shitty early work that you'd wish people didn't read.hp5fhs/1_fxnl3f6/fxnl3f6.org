Back pre 2003 before Order if the Phoenix was released. Me being less than 14 years old. I wrote a book 5 fic called Harry Potter and the Battle of Dundonnell Forest. I cant remember much about it but I do remember that Harry went out with Cho, Voldemort had an Army and was attacking Hogwarts. Neville died and then Dumbledore said something about Harry being a descendant of Godric Gryffindor.

I dont have the fic anywhere anymore. But I did find some old ones on the old Mugglenet Forums I wrote years and years ago.

EDIT: Found them...

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=127655][My Beautiful Girl]]- An old Lupin/Tonk fic... and I wasn't even that much of a Lupin/Tonks shipper back then.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=130286][Harry Potter and the Shard of Solace]]- Not sure what I was trying to do with this one. Not complete but... cool title I guess?

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=124790][A Day in the Life of Voldemort]]- Because these were kind of cool at one point? Weren't they?

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=102677][Harry Potter and the Shattered Soul]]- I like shattering things I guess. This one was a book 7 fic I wrote before DH was released. I remember I set myself a challenge of writing a bunch of Chapter Titles and then trying to come up with a fic to match it. I remember I did actually write one of the chapters much later on in this fic where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna arrived back at Hogsmeade station to see Fred and George and told them that Nevil had died... I think it was supposed to be Chapter 25 'The Platform.'

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=122223][Harry Potter and the Shattered Window]]- Now this I do remember. This was a remake of a fic that I wrote a long time ago. Before HBP came out but after OotP. This was a fic where apparently there was a window that opened up into the realm of the dead. But the realm of the dead was just a place where everyone who had ever died was literally just locked up in a jail cell and there were Dementors flying around. I remember HRH spent most of the year trying to figure out where it was going to appear and only Harry could go through for reasons I can't remember. But I do remember that when he returned to Hogwarts, Wormtail was there on a Hippogriff and had Kidnapped Hermione and Ron. The sequel to this fic started with Harry rescuing Ron and Hermione and then finding a Magical Gauntlet that did some crazy stuff I can't even remember. The end of the book would have ended (I didn't finish it and probably thank God I didn't with what I wrote) with Voldemort dying because a cabinet fell on top of him. I shit you not. No idea what I was smoking back then. I kinda wish, and don't wish oh my God no, that I had the original fic to show you.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=115183][Start Again]]- This is kind of a primer to a fic I'm going to show later. But HRH back in Hogwarts after defeating Voldemort. I had some plans with Draco here which I remember liking, even if I can't remember what I wanted to do with it.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=105853][The art of Supremacy]]- Another fic that was set up to be something amazing but with only one chapter written... even calling it a chapter is a bit generous tbh.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=96007][Ernous Elia]]- Another book 7 fic. This one has a few chapters under it's belt. I remember this was when I was going through a 'Malfoy is going to be a badass next book' phase, despite all evidence to the contrary. I probably had an idea what Ernous Elia was at the time of writing but god knows if I remember it now.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=108335][The Serpent Master]]- The Serpent Master was a fic I started to write about three days after after DH was released. This is probably my favourite fic I've ever written, favourite terrible fic anyway or the one I had most fun writing. It was planned to be a huge seven book series based on three unknown OC's set a couple of years after the epilogue. I had plans for each book, I had detailed character plans. I knew what the characters were going to do when they finished at Hogwarts. I knew that Neville would eventually become headmaster, I knew what O.W.L and N.E.W.T grades each character would get.I had a hell of a lot of detail. And this is actually a fic I finished writing. Aside from The Shattered Window above, probably one of my few finished fics. I had made good progress on it's sequel as well, (linked below) before I left it and moved on. A few years later I started to rewrite it, I had the basis of the original story but expanded a bit, names were changed around and just generally rewritten. But I didn't finish it, in fact I barely scratched the surface. Sometimes I'd like to go back and finish it off but I'm much more interested in writing my own work than fanfiction these days.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11811142/1/The-Serpent-Master][Serpent Master rewrite]]- Rewrite

So thanks for the blast from the past...I did just notice that it does say popular writers... that's not me... I'd even hesitate to call myself well written these days but whatever I've spent too much time reading through this.

I do see my own writing skills improving, but it comes with constant and never ending practice. Keep at it people, you can do whatever you want!
