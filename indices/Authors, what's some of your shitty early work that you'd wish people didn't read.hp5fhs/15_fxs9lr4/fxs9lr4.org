I recently found a fic I wrote while digging around on the wayback machine. I'm torn between absolutely enthralled and horrified. The funniest thing to me is that I'm in the midst of rewriting it 15 years later (wanted to give it an honest go with some experience under my belt---I had BIG ideas as a kid but not enough skill to pull them off) so rereading it and seeing what tropes stuck with me is an interesting view of myself I don't think many writers get the opportunity toward.
