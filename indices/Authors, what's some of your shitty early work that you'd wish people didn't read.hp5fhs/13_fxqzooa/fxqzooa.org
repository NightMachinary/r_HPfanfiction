I'm happy to share a link to my first fics, but mostly because they're in Czech and I'm banking on the fact no one here will be able to read them: [[http://arjon-silme.xf.cz/fan.php]]

I started writing when I was 12. And because I'm unable to let projects go, instead of deleting the first attempt, I carried on writing that story in the following 7 years. People still read it now, which boggles my mind. The last chapters I'm quite happy with, but I can't believe people are willing to pay the price and suffer through the beginning. It is kind of nice to see, but there's also no erasing of my earliest attempts at writing and they're still out there in plain sight, haunting me.
