I posted a 200 hundred word work where Hermione transfigures a hairbrush into a handgun and kills herself to escape a marriage law, over 20 years ago when I was a pre-teen. It's bad, so bad. It could almost be a troll fic, but no my little melodramatic kid self was in full form. It may still be posted, but I don't actually remember the user name. Sheisinsane maybe? Not on the account afterwards which was my main from 2000-2012ish, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/10907/NikkiNeedsHelp][Nikkineedshelp]] has some clonkers though, check it out.
