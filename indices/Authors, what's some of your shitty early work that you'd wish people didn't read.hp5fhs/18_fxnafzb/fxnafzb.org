It is though.

As long as you speak German, my very first work is still up today, and I like it as much as I did 13 years ago. It's a mood piece, where I tried my hand at creating atmosphere, and I was very pleased with how it came out.

Also, I dunno that it always gets better, the older you get or the longer you write. When I read some of my oldest longer stories, e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4236163/1/By-That-Last-Candle-s-Light][BtLCL]], I always have the depressing feeling that I couldn't write like that even if I wanted to today. I've eclipsed myself.

That said, in terms of stuff that's shit, everyone has this. But if you're self-aware enough, that doesn't even make it past the plotting stage. I have folders full of crap. Ridiculous ideas, dumb characterisations, boring plots ... I'd share, but it's all in notes, because I never even bothered to write it. There was this one time I thought it might be cool if Harry could walk through walls (it's not), to write a parody of DH with lots of camping before it came out (turns out the actual DH /did/ involve lots of camping), some Indy!Harry shit (I had just read RossWrock) ... I think the only time I genuinely did write crap was back when OotP came out, back in 2003, and I had been shipping Harry/Cho hard since PoA (that's where he notices Cho for the first time). Their romance was, of course, a mess, and I wrote a thoroughly sappy fix-it scene as anger management. Never published it, though, as it wasn't even a full story, and it vanished into the digital nirvana when my first computer died.
