I entered the Harry Potter fanfiction Community as a smut writer and to this day I still only write smut. Sure my plots are more convoluted these days but there is always sexy sex somewhere in the castle.

I've always felt like the standard for smut was lower so I don't really feel ashamed of any of my earlier stuff. It's simply not judged in the same way that mainstream fanfiction for the community is judged. I mean, I hope my readers find it titillating and hit that like button, but it's whatever.

Sadly most of my stories are unlinkable here.
