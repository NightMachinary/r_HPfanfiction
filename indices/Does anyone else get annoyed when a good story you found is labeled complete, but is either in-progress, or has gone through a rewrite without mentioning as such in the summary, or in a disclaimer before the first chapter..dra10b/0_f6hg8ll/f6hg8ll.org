I DUCKING HATE WHEN AUTHORS REWRITE FICS! I have yet to see a rewritten story that's actually complete.

Even worse, a lot of new stories have a nice start, reach less than chapter 10, the author decides to rewrite it 'cause people liked it but ends up abandoning the story with even less chapters than the original >:C
