Yeah, I completely understand that, and wholly agree with you. The only thing I dislike are stories either getting rewritten, or are in progress, but labeled as complete, and not giving a heads-up to the reader in the summary, or in the authors note at the beginning of the first chapter.

I'd be fine with even just an update to the summary saying to read the last chapter first if they dedicated a chapter to explaining it being rewritten, or whatever else. Like I said, it's the polite thing to do. I know plenty of people who have even abandoned whole authore, because of this happening. So not doing it hurts both the writter, and the reader. So I don't even understand why not to do it. Sorry for venting at you.
