I´m an author of a Fic myself which I´m now struggling to stop right in the middle. I told my readers why and that I would make a cut at the end of a certain story arc which creates an ending but also the possibilty for a continuation.\\
I get told to keep on writing, but I´m at a point where I´m unsatisfied with my writing, and I announced that if I keep going I´m about to rewrite some parts and shorten a good amount of the story to fix some logical mistakes and to keep my story simpler (it´s very complicated with a lot of confusing plot-lines which are just revelead step by step etc).

I understand that readers get annoyed and disappointed to find a story they´ve been reading and following for several months get abandoned, and I agree that an author should at least point that out in the summary.\\
But, you know, sometimes they´re forgetting there might be problems in real life, and that the authors just don´t have the time to care for a project, which, as you said, is for free and they don´t get anything in return for the time spent with writing and plotting.

In general, though, I agree with you.
