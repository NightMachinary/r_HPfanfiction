My issue (and op's also) is when it is marked complete when it is not. A story should only be marked complete when it is... /complete/.

Story in the middle of a rewrite? not complete. Life is hard, so you abandon it with an epilogue to wrap things up? Not complete. Flames get you down, so you wrap up the story before it isn't even started? Not complete. Continued in a sequel that hasn't been updated since 2009? Not complete.

We understand why a story could be abandoned, but marking am incomplete story as complete is problematic on multiple levels. (And I do count stories that don't have a good ending and are just continued in a currently being written sequel as incomplete.)

You expect a resolution for a complete story, while you can give a pass to an incomplete one. It's all about expectations. If I get to the end of a incomplete story knowing that it is incomplete, then I get a bit sad but I am ready for it. If I get to the end and there is NO end? It feels absolutely HORRIBLE. I feel betrayed, I feel unfulfilled, and I feel disappointed. If I knew it was incomplete beforehand I would have been prepared, but I wasn't.

Never mark a story complete if it isn't.
