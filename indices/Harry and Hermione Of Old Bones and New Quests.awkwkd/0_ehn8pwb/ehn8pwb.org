Hey there! Been following this story of yours for a while, would absolutely love to see some new chapters. The Timefall chapter was absolutely amazing!!

There is so much I can relate to the depiction of Harry and Hermione in their old age and for that, this has become one of my favorite stories because we never really see "old" versions of these characters!

Please do update as quickly as you can, good sir!
