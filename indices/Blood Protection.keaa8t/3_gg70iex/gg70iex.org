My understanding is that Dumbledore couldn't explain properly or else the unknowing sacrifice wouldn't work, so he goes with the 'tethered to life' explanation. The link means that Harry is not Voldemort but Voldemort (in a way) is Harry. The AK kills a person, but not an object - my thought is that the sacrifice enables him to exchange his death with Voldemort's linked shard. Otherwise he'd have gone down with it, like Nagini.

Alternatively, there's no meaning whatsoever and Dumbledore was putting in a failsafe; if the plan didn't work, it would protect those left behind.
