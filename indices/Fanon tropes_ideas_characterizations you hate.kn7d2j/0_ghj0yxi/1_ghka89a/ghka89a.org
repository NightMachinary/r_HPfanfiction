I agree with all your points, well said.

We only have so little canon to go off to write Lily and James' personality, so I really enjoy fics that branch out and make the characters their own and unique, while still fitting into what we get from the 7 books about them.

Also I feel like thats why James (and Sirius) get a bad rap, we have a lot of what Snape thought about James and Sirius and the memories of them bullying Snape, so I suppose it's easier to paint James in a bad light who is pushy with Lily and just a dumb mean jock. But I dont believe he is, because gotta keep in mind that Snape also "gave as good as he got" so it wasn't one sided bullying, plus Snape was a horrible racist so it stands to reason why James would keep up the rivalry and insult him. And then we know he grew out of it, got his head on straight and became a much better person. So I like fics where it has that growth in his character

also yes Peter was a trusted member of the group, hate when fics dont treat him as such. I still have yet to find the fic that characterizes Peter perfectly, though I've seen some alright ones
