Been reading a lot of Marauder era fics lately.

- James is a pushy insistent creep that keeps asking Lily out.

- Pettigrew being treated like shit. Dude was trusted over Lupin to be the Potter's secret keeper.

- Lily is a mirror of Hermione/Ginny. Some fics even go so far as to describe Lily having bushy hair.

- Lily has or had any romantic or sexual attraction towards Snape.

- Every Order member is somehow in the same year as the Marauders.

- Lily bashing for not saving Snape from falling in with the Death Eaters. If anything, I think canon Lily is a bit of a doormat for hanging around Snape even though she knows he calls other muggleborns "mudblood".

- James and Sirius being dumb jocks who only get anything done because of Lupin.

- Portraying Snape as a better person than the Marauders.
