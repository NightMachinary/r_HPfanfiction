i 100% agree with everything you said. Personally, I don't really care for Peters protrayal because I hate him so much but I agree that it doesn't make sense for the Marauders to treat him like shit. Im writing a Marauders era fic, and the hardest character for me to write is Peter because I know I have to be nice and equal and i just hate him so much haha
