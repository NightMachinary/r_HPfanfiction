I honestly don't mind James being depicted as overly pushy, because he was by 2020 standards (I think people forget how drastically things have changed in terms of behavior even over the past ten years and was was considered acceptable). My annoyance is when James is portrayed that way but Severus's behavior is "normalized."

Agree on Lily. She was basically the equivalent of a minority being bffs and ignoring a guy using slurs because they weren't directed at her. Maybe as a WOC I relate too much to the allegorical similarities, but I can't imagine being friends with someone who used racial slurs. There was a good fan fic from ages ago, wish I recall the name, where a muggleborn character calls her out for being bffs with a guy who uses the word mudblood and who was pals with people who use the word mudblood.

Same with Peter. I don't get the "Peter was treated like crap" bit. I think it's possible canon Sirius overlooked him based on what little we've seen, but James and Lily obviously trusted him a lot as did Remus.
