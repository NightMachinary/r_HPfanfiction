Huh im not downvoted on my end.

I love this story tbh, but I dont think that people can appreciate it if they dont know a lot of other fanfics, or rather not as much. It beautifully subverts tropes in really creative ways and the actual eponymous title, prince of slytherin, is beautifully done in a very much slytherin way.
