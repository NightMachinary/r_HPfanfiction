In /HP& The Prince of Slytherin/, the justification for splitting the twins up is that they thought Harry was a squib. So 1) they thought his twin had drained Harry's magic to defeat the killing curse and were worried that the twin might accidentally drain his life as well, 2) they were afraid Death Eaters would attack and Harry would be a defenseless, easily slaughtered squib, 3) Lily thought Harry would be happier living a "normal" life than to grow up as she and Petunia had done, one sibling having magic and the other resenting them for it.

The big spoiler is why Petunia didn't tell them Harry wasn't a squib, and why did the Dursleys abuse him when they'd been happy to adopt him?
