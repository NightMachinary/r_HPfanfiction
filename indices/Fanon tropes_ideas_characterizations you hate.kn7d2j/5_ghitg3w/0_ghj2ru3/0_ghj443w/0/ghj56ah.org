I never understood downvoting I always thought if you had an issue you reply and state what your disagreement is not just do a drive by down vote. But oh well to each their own.

As far as the author goes I find I have an very large tolerance for various writing quality levels. Eg it has to be really horrendous for me to stop reading. Plus I know most fanfiction is written by folks who are just starting to write so mistakes etc don't bother me as much.

But I actually thought the author did a good job and I liked Honour Thy Blood. Well hopefully you'll find a story you enjoy.
