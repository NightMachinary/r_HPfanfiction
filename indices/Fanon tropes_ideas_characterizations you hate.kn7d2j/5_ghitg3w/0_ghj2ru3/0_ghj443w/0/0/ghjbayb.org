It's not about the quality of writing, far from it. It was the story itself. The first chapter introduced so many new ideas that I couldn't wait to explore further, but then the second chapter is a giant info dump about the relationship between Harry's grandparents and how they fell in love. It's great and all, but I think there were more pressing issues to cover at the time, such as the death of Cedric, surviving the killing curse for the second time, destruction of his wand?, suddenly meeting a new family member, seeing Voldemort's resurrection, and probably dozen other things that I already forgot about. It's too early into the story for me to care about it.
