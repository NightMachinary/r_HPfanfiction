Ok I can understand that. That kind of stuff didn't bother me as I grew up juggling multiple threads at once. Nothing was more fun than to have a buddy or girlfriend show up at a family gathering usually at my parents house to see about half a dozen conversations going on and then see everyone jump in and out of all the different conversations without missing a beat. Any non-family member was always how the hell do you all follow that?

So that great big data dump had me rubbing my hands together going "look at all the story threads I get to track".

But without a doubt I can understand how someone would be going Wait a second I was following these threads/story ideas and you just dumped a ton more. Which is more of I was just getting into this story arc and you now just completely changed direction on me. Why in the world did you do that. And to do it in the first couple of chapters makes it worse as you are still trying to decide if the story is one you want to follow.
