Try The Green in the Grey by TheBlack'sResurgence it has Harry stepping in front of the killing curse to protect his younger brother. The result is that Harry's scar leaks dark magic and his brother's magic is damaged. They separate the boys because the dark magic could further harm the younger brother. James and Lily initially go with it but then change their mind. In steps manipulative dumbledore. It's a pretty good read so far.
