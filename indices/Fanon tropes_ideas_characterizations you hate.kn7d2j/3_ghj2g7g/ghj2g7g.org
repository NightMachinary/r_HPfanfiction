-Twinspeak. If it's a major part of a story I'll abandon it, even though the twins are currently my favorite characters.

-A story starting with two characters crashing into each other and something like 'Watch where you're going, _____" It's been done. Many many many times.

-Don't like one of the young girl characters involved with one of the older men, ex: Ginny/Lucius.

-The nickname 'Mione. Why? WHYYYYY????

-Hermione is all of a sudden the most beautiful girl on the planet, or she gets dressed up for a dance and then becomes the most beautiful girl.
