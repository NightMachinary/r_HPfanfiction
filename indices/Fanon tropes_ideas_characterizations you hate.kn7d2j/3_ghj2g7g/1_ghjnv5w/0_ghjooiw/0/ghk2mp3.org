The whole thing squicks me out, but I think what makes Snape particularly bad is he's in a position of authority over the students so the age gap is particularly nasty and a crime IRL. I get it's a "fetish" for some people, which whatever, but unless the student is in 7th year..and even then it's squicky...it makes me seriously side eye the writer. Lucius, too, hates muggleborns so pairing him with a muggleborn is bizarre.
