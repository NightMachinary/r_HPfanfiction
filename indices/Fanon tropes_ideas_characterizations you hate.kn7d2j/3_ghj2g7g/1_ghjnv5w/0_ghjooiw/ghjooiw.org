  Yeah, the young girl/Lucius pairing makes me nauseous. Still think HG/Snape pairing is creepy. But, and this may be hypocritical, I can kind of tolerate Sirius and Hermione...I read one marriage of convenience one where he is 37 and she is 17 (I know, gross) but I like Sirius and liked the story...didn't mean that I wasn't creeped out.
