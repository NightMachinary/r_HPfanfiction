Definitely agree with you on Twinspeak, squicky age gap romances (always makes me suspect the author is working out some issues), and Hermione suddenly becoming gorgeous. She's canonically not beautiful, because she's truly not bothered about it. Emma Watson is partially to blame for this one.

In fairness though, in canon she is described as being pretty (and even characters who don't like her think so) during the Yule Ball, so it seems that she can make the effort to look "beautiful" but has more important things to do most of the time.
