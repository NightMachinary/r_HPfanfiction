Snape magically being a good guy just because like my dude was involved with the wizard equivalent of the NaziKKK and not even the love of his life being their hated race made him quit.

Writing Draco/Ron (it's always these two) as the son of Satan revived who is totally evil and rapes and murders people for fun and or he's a totally idiot who fails at everything, can't tie his shoe and just overall pathetic.

All the Weasleys being bad except for the twins, maybe it's cause I don't like them the same way everyone else does but it always bothers me that the twins are somehow different like sure bud.

Daphne I don't get the hype, she's prob just as bad as everyone else in Slytherin but for some reason people love writing as a good Slytherin like no fam she probably called people mudbloods the same way Parkinson's and Malfoy did.

Lucius being completely incompetent. Like I don't like him but he's good at being a slimy bastard.

Hermione being wonderful at everything to the point of being a deus ex machina
