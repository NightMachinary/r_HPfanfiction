Well, Daphne is a pureblood, so she can be used in most pureblood politics type of fics. Besides Millicent has shown to be an asshole, Tracey was not even mentioned in canon, so that leaves Daphne who is atleast mentioned by name. But yeah, it would be nice if authors used other characters as examples of good slytherins in Harry's year
