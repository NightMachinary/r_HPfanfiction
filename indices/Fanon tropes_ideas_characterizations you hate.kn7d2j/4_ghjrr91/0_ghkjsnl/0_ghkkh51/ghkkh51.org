He didn't notice Blaise till sixth year and he was just as racist and predjuiced as the rest of them so it's not far off to assume Daphne was too.

Like I just don't get the obsession fanfic authors have with her.

I get wanting a â€˜canon' good Slytherin but what makes Daphne so special. Tracey Davis, Millicent (aside from second year I don't remember her doing much) technically Sally Ann Perks all exist.

Also Rowling wrote Pansy had a gang with her I'm gonna assume Daphne was in it, just Millicent is not a gang lol

Sorry not to nitpick I just don't get what others like about Daphne. This is coming from someone who used to read a lot of Daphne/Harry
