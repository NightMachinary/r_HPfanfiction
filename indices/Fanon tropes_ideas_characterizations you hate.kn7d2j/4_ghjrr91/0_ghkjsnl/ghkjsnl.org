well as a counterpoint to Daphne, we literally know nothing about her except for her name that was dropped and that she was in Slytherin. So she can basically be however the author views her a clean slate 'canon' character that can be used as a good Slytherin, which people want since we dont have any peers of Harry in canon that hes friendly with in Slytherin (but he had one from other houses, Cedric in Hufflepuff, Luna Ravenclaw)

also she might not be as bad as the other Slytherins, because if she was then Harry would have been more likely to notice that in canon and point her out.
