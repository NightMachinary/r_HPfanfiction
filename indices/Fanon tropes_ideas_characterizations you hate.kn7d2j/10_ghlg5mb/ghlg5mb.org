I have another one!

Every character using "oh, Merlin!" as an exclamation.

I assume it's a substitute for a real person saying "oh, God" or "Jesus Christ", but it just comes off as so cringey to me.

There's no reason why magical characters wouldn't say God. Christianity is a thing in the magical world. They celebrate Christmas and Easter.

Draco Malfoy, the most bigoted bigot who ever bigoted, even says "God" in canon.

Canon occasionally has "Merlin's beard!" as an exclamation or mild profanity, but only from older characters, never Merlin on its own and especially never "oh, Merlin and Morgana!"

I have no idea why this has become so widespread.
