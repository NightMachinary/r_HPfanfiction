Pretty much nothing. I'll read anything interesting, so long as the story takes the time to establish internal logic supporting it. If characters are suddenly arseholes, or Christian, or bigots, or Purebloods, or whatever else without any warning or support, then that's what usually throws me off. If a fic takes the time to establish a world in which a ridiculous Head-People apartment-duplex thing is logical and backed-up, then I'll buy in to it. If it doesn't, then I probably won't.
