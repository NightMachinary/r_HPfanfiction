It's the suddenly and without warning or support that throws me off, not the Christianity. Heart and Soul by Sillimaure is a perfect example. Without warning, the story suddenly has Fleur's family all being secret Christians. There's no particular reason to have it in the story, there's no particular reason not to, but it just happens out of nowhere and that's what I dislike.

I honestly couldn't care less if someone wanted to write a story that's basically Christian Apologetics, or one where Harry was a full-on Witch-burning Stereotype Puritan - so long as it was established and plotted and fit the internal logic, I'd be fine with it. But if he just suddenly turns around in the middle of DADA after twenty chapters and starts talking about how all Magicals are sinners before the Lord and must burn in the fires of Hell or whatever, that's the thing that throws me off a story.
