It's a fantasy world with powerful magic. Realism is pretty relative. You can get away with pretty much anything by just shrugging and saying "A wizard did it." After that point, you just gotta work out why that wizard did it, and people motivations are usually pretty easy. :D

Each to their own, at the end of the day. Every audience wants something different, nothing wrong with that. I'll definitely agree that my mellow way is easier though - but while I do get more to read, a portion of that extra amount is technically terrible. :)
