To be fair, there's household spells for everything under the sun. We see Molly casting a lot of them.

I wouldn't be surprised if there was insta-clean-your-hair and insta-dry-your-hair and insta-braid-your-hair spells.

I know a friend of mine just likes the idea of having long hair, so she loves that sort of thing. :) (Personally, I like having long hair myself, but not far past my shoulders. ;P)
