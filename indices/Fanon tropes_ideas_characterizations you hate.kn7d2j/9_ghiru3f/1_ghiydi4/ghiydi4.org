please don't tell me someone wrote the Dursley's eating Hedwig for dinner

I agree with the Slytherin thing! I have nothing against Slytherins, but the ones that we read about were awful people. I've seen Dramione fics where just because Draco is suddenly nice to Hermione then Pansy, Daphne and Millicent suddenly become her best friends! Draco liking Hermione is already a lot to work on but to have the girls who hated her guts suddenly see her as their best friend, and who Hermione ditches all her friends for to hang out with all the time? A reach.

100% agree with the Ginny being a slut thing, it's really weird. Just because she had more boyfriends doesn't mean dating is all she cares about. Similarly, I hate it when they make Hermione seem like the biggest prude because she likes books, I mean this girl dated the hottest guy at their school in fourth year I think she got over being shy. And that she has no sense of humour or hates jokes just because she's bossy about schoolwork.
