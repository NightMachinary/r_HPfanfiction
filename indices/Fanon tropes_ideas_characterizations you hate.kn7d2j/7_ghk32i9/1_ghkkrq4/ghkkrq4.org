That's wild. I know fanfiction gives people freedom to write what the want but when they get really OOC with characters I draw the line. I don't like evil Ron either, I just don't see the point in making HIM a bad person when there's already so many bad people in the books, why do we have to portray a comfort character as bad?

Also agree with the Tom/Harry thing, it makes no sense
