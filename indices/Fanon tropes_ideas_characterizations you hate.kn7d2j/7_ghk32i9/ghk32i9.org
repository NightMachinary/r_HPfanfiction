Voldemort/Harry or Tom Riddle/Harry pairing are so weird to me. Like the only, only way I can see the latter is if some sort of time travel was involved and he never killed harry's parents in the first place, but even then it's a stretch.

Evil/crazy/rapey Ron. I get some people don't like him, fine, but people make him cartoonishly evil.

Lily/James being abusive and awful. I mean, these are two people who sacrificed their life for their kid. I understand writing them in a critical way even, but when people have them acting all Dursley-ish it's insane. Sometimes I think people work out their real life issues with the "popular" kids on fictional "popular" kids.
