I'm pretty sure I only laughed twice while reading the whole thing but the experience was worth it because at those points it had me rolling. Harry trying to get into the triwizard tournament and how the house elves came into that scene just had me dying. I generally enjoy that kind of power fantasy stuff though so the fic had a bit more to offer than just the laughs. Give it a few chapters and if you're still not feeling it, move onto another fic imo. There's some really great ones out there so wasting time on a fic you're not enjoying would be a real tragedy
