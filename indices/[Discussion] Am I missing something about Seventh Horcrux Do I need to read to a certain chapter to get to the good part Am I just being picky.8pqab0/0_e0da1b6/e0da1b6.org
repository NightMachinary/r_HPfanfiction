I think that it's all about the mindset when reading it. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, should be taken seriously. At best, Seventh Horcrux is a crack-fic that should be read late at night when you're so exhausted that your sense of humor is warped to Hell. This is coming from someone who has it on their favorites list.
