  I had to force myself through what little I read before giving up. The characters are all irritating, and the humor isn't funny.

Finally someone who feels the same. I needed about 10 attempts before I was able to finish this fic. But I really wanted to get through it and be able to say that I read it, because it gets recommended so much.

It doesn't do anything for me. I didn't think the main joke was very funny in the first place, but the fact that every chapter is basically a play on the same joke ("haha, he's Voldemort and acting crazy, yet no one realizes and he has minions") really killed it for me.

Usually I don't have a problem with silly and juvenile humor, but that fic didn't even make me chuckle.

  Does it "get good" at a certain point?

No.
