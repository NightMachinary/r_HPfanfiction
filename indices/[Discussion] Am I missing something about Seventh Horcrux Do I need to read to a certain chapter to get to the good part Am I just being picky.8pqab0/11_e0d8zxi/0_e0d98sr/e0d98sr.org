I guess what just confuses me is I've read plenty of french fry fics in my years reading fanfic, ranging from bashing of epic proportions to holier than tho indy harry, to giving my immortal the old college try, to just plain trash, and been able to stomach more than 5 chapters of most all of them, except seventh horcrux, and yet seventh horcrux is the only french fry fic I've ever seen be recced as often as it is. It's an odd situation.
