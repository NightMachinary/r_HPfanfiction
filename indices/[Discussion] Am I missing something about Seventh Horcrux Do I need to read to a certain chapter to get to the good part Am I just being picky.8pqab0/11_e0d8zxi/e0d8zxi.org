The seventh horcrux is like mcdonald's French fries. It's crap and we know it is but it feels good going down.

It hits a lot of cliches, doesn't diverge, and is a Harry instant power up.

But it's grammatically fine has some â€˜satisfying' *bashing without going over the top.

Not one of my favorites but its worth mentioning.

*bashing isn't my thing but it was light enough to ignore.
