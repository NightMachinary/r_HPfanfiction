Ok, it sounds like you might be missing an important part of the story. Almost all the humor of Seventh Horcrux is based on Harry being an unreliable narrator. He makes bad reads or misunderstands things, but is massively overconfident about his own misunderstandings, and then when it seems like he might be wrong he refuses to see it, no matter what it takes.

Lockhart is not legit, Harry is totally wrong and then twists himself up trying to keep himself and everyone else from seeing it.

This might not be your cup of tea. I found it literally laugh out loud hilarious at points, but it's not for everyone.
