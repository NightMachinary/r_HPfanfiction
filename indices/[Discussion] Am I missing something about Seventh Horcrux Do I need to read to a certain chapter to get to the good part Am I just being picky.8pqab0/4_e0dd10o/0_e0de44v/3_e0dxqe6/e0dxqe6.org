One hilarious part of this fic lies exactly in that Harrymort is often completely wrong, even if his reasoning sounds about right. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.
#+end_quote

Furthermore, that conclusion is likely what canon Voldemort would have drawn.

He would often spread false rumors, only to believe in them later himself. But because he had Voldemort's skills, he would accomplish amazing feat and make people believe in him.
