I got to chapter three. My breaking point was the part about Harry deciding Lockhart was legit, which, if we take his statement of "a small amount of research" to be true, means the Lockhart was not actually a fraud in Seventh Horcrux, which is a grave offense to me. The only time I've ever accepted a Lockhart who's not a fraud is in Unspeakable Things, where it is a major plot point, and also an au where the background of many adult characters was changed. To have Lockhart be not a fraud for literally no given reason would be like having Hermione be declared a pure blood in her introduction to Harry/the reader, or changing Molly's name to Monica. To be fair, the logic is dependant upon actually believing Harry did good research, and isn't just being fooled like everyone else.

Granted, I wasn't enjoying the story at all up to that point, so that was just the straw on the camels back.
