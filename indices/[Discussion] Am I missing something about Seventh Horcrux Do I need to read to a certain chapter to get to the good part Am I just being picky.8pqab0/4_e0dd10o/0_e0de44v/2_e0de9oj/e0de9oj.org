He definitetly was still a fraud in Seventh Horcrux. The joke is that Harrymort doesn't know everything and often comes to very wrong conclusions (this is a running theme of the story actually, Voldemort is the same), in fact I'm pretty sure his so called research is reading Lockhart's books.

But for me I was really enjoying it by about half way through Chapter 2, so it probably is just something that doesn't sit with your sense of humour perhaps? I don't particularly like all of the often linked funny stories.
