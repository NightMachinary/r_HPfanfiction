It's not really a good fic. I categorize it with the same sort of stories as Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches and For Love of Magic, meaning, that most of the individual components in the story are really bad, but when combined together it somehow creates a conglomeration that a lot of people seem to like for some reason.
