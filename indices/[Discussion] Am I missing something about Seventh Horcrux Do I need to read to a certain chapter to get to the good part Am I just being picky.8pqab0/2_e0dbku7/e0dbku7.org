Plain and simple, it's juvenile, silly, and stupid. Some people find that funny, others don't. Just because someone recommends a fic, doesn't mean that you will like it. And that's perfectly OK. It's the same with Black Comedy, I'll go back and re-read them when I want something light and easy to read that will make me chuckle a few times. The problem that I see most often on here is that they're so popular and so hyped up that people expect a comedic masterpiece when those stories are pretty much just potty humor.
