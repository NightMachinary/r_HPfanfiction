DLP was never big into romance, even in its heyday. And of the romance fics they liked, they were usually from members of the forum itself. Jbern (Harry/Susan; Harry/Fleur) and Perspicacity (Dagger and Rose, I think it was called, which is a Harry/Fleur) are two authors that got a lot of acclaim with stories that featured a romantic component. Ruskbyte was another. I would just go through the "Library" thread and see what interest you under Romance. It's been a longtime since I was an active member there but they were usually pretty good at maintaining at least a threshold level of quality.

Jeconais was the standard for Harry Potter romance back during the fandom's heyday. Even DLP begrudgingly agreed despite their aversion to fluff. A word of warning, his stories are well-written technically, but not entirely original (seriously, he's written several novel length stories and almost all of them feature similar plot elements and characterizations). If you're looking for something super fluffy and saccharine he's the one to go to though. This Means War!, White Knight, Grey Queen, and Hope are all classics, imo.
