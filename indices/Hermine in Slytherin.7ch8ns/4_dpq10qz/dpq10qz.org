  I read a Hermione/Fred fanfiction a couple weeks ago in which Hermione was sorted into Slytherin (which I can't find anymore, so if someone knows it?)

There's linkffn(11568740) *Edit: Fixed link.*, which 'ships her with both Fred and George. It has some interesting ideas (like having her start Hogwarts a year early due to a bluff by her parents and her almost being of the right age). On the other hand, it has some issues. Here's a criticism of it I posted on a different forum:

  In a nutshell, it's not as inane and poorly thought-out as /Green Girl/, for example, but I still get the sense that the author doesn't really want think about the non-romance aspects of the fic, and spends as little time thinking them through as possible, focusing instead on just banging out drama. For example, it doesn't look like the author can keep characters' relative skill levels straight, and often muddles the social dynamics that would result from Hermione matriculating a full year before Harry and Draco. Also, it does Stations of Canon when they not only don't make sense but don't have any point to them. For example, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up confronting the Troll; but because of the changes, Harry and Ron no longer had any motivation to leave to search for anyone to run into the Troll, and Hermione just follows them along; and there are no consequences whatsoever to the encounter that last past the end of the next chapter. Combat scenes tend to be awkward and feel essentially turn-based.

  I increasingly think that slow-burn romance fic writers who want to incorporate a nontrivial plot and action should get a beta reader who has little interest in romance but can nitpick non-romatic aspects of characterizaiton and the action/adventure parts, including keeping track of who can beat whom up. They don't get veto power, but at least they'd point out the issues.
