For Hermione in Slytherin recs, l've written two linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) and linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

For other ones, there's linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) -- warning, it's quite dark. linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) is amazing, as well as linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere).
