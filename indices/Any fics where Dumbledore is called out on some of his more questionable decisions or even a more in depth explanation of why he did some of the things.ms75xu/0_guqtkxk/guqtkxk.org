I think he wasn't able to act against Draco because Snape's unbreakable vow would kill him and disrupt Dumbledore's final plan if he didn't take action to protect him. Remember, he swore to aid Draco in his task as much as possible. I think the plan was for Snape to “help” Draco and gain an insight into his plans to prevent collateral damage, but that plan didn't come to fruition because of Draco's distrust of Snape.
