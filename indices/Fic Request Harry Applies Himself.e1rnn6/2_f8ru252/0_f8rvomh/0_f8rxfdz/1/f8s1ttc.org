Eh, the premise is interesting, but the characters could be a lot better written imo. I only managed to get as far as Snape when I noped out of it.

In no universe does Snape use the word "son" like that without a traumatic brain injury and a complete personality transplant, and absolutely no attempt was made to explain such an incongruity.
