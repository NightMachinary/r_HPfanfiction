Why wouldn't skinny teenagers need diet and exercise? Skinny doesn't mean healthy. Diets are not just for weight loss, but weight gain too. And what exactly is wrong with "skinny teenagers" working out to get physically stronger?

My only problem with these kind of fics are that they try to go into too much details regarding traning. And not even good ones at that. They always go on about Harry doing 100s of pushups and stuff. That isn't the way to make yourself stronger.
