  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

  Sequel to Souls Touch, and the Future Changes, authored by now-deleted account sunmoonandstars, which used to be me. Harry continues to struggle with adapting to and understanding the wizarding world, which increasingly seems to have backed itself into a corner by allowing rampant anti-Muggle belief to coexist with rampant ignorance of the Muggle world. Of course, there is also the problem of being a "Light" icon in Slytherin, not to mention the fact that someone seems determined to hamstring Harry's independence.
