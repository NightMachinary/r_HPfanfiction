There was this fic, i dont remember the name. Harry made contact with his horcrux before going to Hogwarts, he was sorted into Slytherin and the horcrux would give him terrible headaches when he didnt do what voldemort wanted. And then Harry was forced to try to take the Philosopher stone. He absorbed the horcrux in QuirrelI and then I think Dumbledore recognized Harry was a horcrux, killed and buried him in the Forbidden forest. But Harry didnt die. He woke up and was planning on leaving Hogwarts.
