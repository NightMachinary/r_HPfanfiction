You can't offer what you don't have. I'm pretty sure nobody is going to offer me therapy if I saved the president's life in a crazy jungle or something. That's simply isn't a thing over here. It would be a fan on idea that the trio would need therapy. Fuck it, their wizards, not normal humans, stop applying our shit to them. It would make sense if Ginny needed some kind of mind healing, that's probably what Neville's parents and that dumbass professor needed. But they simply might not have that.
