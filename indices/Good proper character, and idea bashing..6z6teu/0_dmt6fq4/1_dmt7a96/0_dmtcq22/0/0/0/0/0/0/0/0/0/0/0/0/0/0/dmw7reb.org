Cool. Even though the movie version was approved by JKR, and she had the power to deny scenes, but let's forget all that, and still point out that they needed music to get past the cerebrus, and it was ready to attack earlier in the book. Also it's there as a guard dog. All of this says fluffy would attack them. Show me any paragraph where fluffy wasn't growling, barking, biting etc.., then I may consider him not being dangerous to children.
