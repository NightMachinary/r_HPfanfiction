You didn't really answer any of the points especially when 'Trump in office' is two of you answers.

Even if the cerebrus isn't bugging anyone a school teacher telling the kids not to go somewhere will encourage them to go there. It's in the nature of kids to be curious, and not care for the consequences.

Now if he conjured a wall in front of said door or tranfigured the door into a wall, and reguraly redid it so it doesn't fade(while obviously undoing, and redoing it to feed said cerebrus), and didn't tell the kids not to go there(therefore they won't feel that urge that all kids feel to explore a dangerous area while feeling like they are in a safe environment hence why they go there in the first place(child psycology 101)), and have the house elves moniter the area reguraly, only after all that could I consider having the cerebrus there in any way 'safe'.
