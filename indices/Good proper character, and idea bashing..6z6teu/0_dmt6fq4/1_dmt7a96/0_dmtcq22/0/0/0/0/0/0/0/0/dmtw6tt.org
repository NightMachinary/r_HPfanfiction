3. Soul sucking demons that eat happy emotions around school
4. Still keeping them after they attacked multiple times
5. Gladiatorial survival games designed for children
6. Literally everybody letting themselves get killed without any resistance
7. Using stunners and nonlethat spells in a war
8. Letting people that have been "officially compromised" on the ruling body

And so much more.
