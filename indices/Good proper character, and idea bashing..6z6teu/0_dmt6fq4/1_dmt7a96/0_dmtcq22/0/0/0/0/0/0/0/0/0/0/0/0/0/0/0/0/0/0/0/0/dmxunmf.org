And how does that stop the grangers from finding a therapist for their daughter. Also the wizarding world does have healers so it's not much of a stretch that they have a wizard/witch equivelant of a therapist. Also their still human, just because they can do magic doesn't change that. If anything it's their own fault for not trying to to help them. Dumbledore at the least has a duty of care to his students, and has spent some time in the muggle world, and is pro muggles so he should at least have basic knowledge of a therapist. Also why wouldn't they need therapy. Give me one good reason apart from 'their wizards'. Just because their wizards doesn't change the fact that harry, and hermione at the least had a muggle up bringing so they have a muggle mind set, and with such a mind set will require some therapy.

I could see the argument that Ron with a witches up bringing could be more desensetized to such things except, oh yeah his crippling fear of spiders, and just surviving an attack from literally hundreds of at least human sized, and larger spiders. Even ron after that will require therapy.

Lastly even if they don't have therapists doesn't mean they don't need them. Going by your analogy if you broke your leg in a crazy jungle surrounded by a nomadic tribe who don't have a doctor so they usually cut things like broken arms, and legs off means you should get it cut off. Doesn't matter if a doctor is only a few kilometres away you don't know such a thing exists.

Do you now see the stupidity in such actions. Just because they don't know they need it doesn't mean they don't need it.

Also it's not like their in the middle of a jungle/desert/area far from civilisation, the muggle world is leterally right next to the largest shopping area in britain, ministry of magic accessed by a telephone booth. They have knowledge of the muggle world it's their fault if they don't try to take advantage of that. It wouldn't be difficult. Ten minute walk to a library, and some studying, and they have a greater understanding of the muggle world, and how it can help them.
