Yes, but that doesn't mean that it is a sensible idea. The point i'm trying to make is that it's a lack of common sense that leads to these horrible, and frankly psychologically scarring sitiuations. I mean think of harrys first two years cerebrus, killing a teacher, troll encounter, basilisk encounter, and all sorts of other things that i'm too lazy to remember right now. This was when he was 11/12 years old. No one thought to offer him, ron, hermione, ginny etc... therapy or mind healers if that is canon, and not fanon i'm thinking of.
