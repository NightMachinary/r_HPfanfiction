Yes, because placing a giant three headed cerebrus to protect a stone of immortality, and riches from the most powerful wizard of their time doesn't bite kids. It's a guard dog. They don't differentiate between adult, and kids. Also didn't fluffy actually try to attack the trio. In the movie that JKR approved anyway, and helped write. So going by movie version at least it attacked, and considering they needed to play the flute to get past it safetly I would put my money on yes that it would attack them.
