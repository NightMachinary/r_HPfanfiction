I hate those fics that say everyone in the wizarding world is stupid af. Did it ever occur to the authors that wizards have a different view of what danger is and how it should be treated. I have no doubt that there are tribes that once had their youths fight lions with a spear as a coming of age ceremony. Are we going to go down there and tell them that they are stupid? The wizarding world has a lot of danger. If have no doubt that just about every adult wizard is capable of recognising a dangerous situation. Perhaps going into the forbidden forest with the games keeper is simply not considered dangerous.
