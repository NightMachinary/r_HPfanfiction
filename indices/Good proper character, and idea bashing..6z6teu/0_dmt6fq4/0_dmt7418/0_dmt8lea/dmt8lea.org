A reasonable bashing fic is a bit of a tall order. Although your comment on the Forbidden Forest did remind me of one fic that might actually meet your requirements! McGonagall explains it away as a mix up, and that it was supposed to be 7th years in the Forbidden Forest, but she still gets shit for the negligence. Linkffn(12324284)

I'm not sure if this fic fits what you want though. Like I said, the trope wears on my a little, so I didn't finish reading this. Either way, I'm pretty sure in terms of reasonable bashing fics, this is all I've got.
