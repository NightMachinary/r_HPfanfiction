Yes. I know there are a lot of bash fics out there, but they are usually unrealistic. The first thing I want is deserved bashing. A lot of the stories that bash out there do it on perceived slights, and problems, but I want basically a bash/common sense fic that doesn't have to make crap up since there is no reason for it like for example the Mcgonnagal setting a detention for kids in the forbidden forest scene should be bashed. I mean in what world is it right to send kids into an incredibly dangerous forest, but Harry at the Dursleys isn't really a reason to bash. Dumbledore truly couldn't understand a family being cruel to each other. While he made a mistake there it was an honest mistake that people with common sense would make, but once again the forbidden forest scene had a distinct lack of common sense in it.
