You've clearly not been reading HP fanfiction for very long. Or if you have, you've clearly been looking in the wrong place (somehow). Because these fics are /everywhere/.

Just sift through the bashing fics communities. You'll find all you want eventually, especially if you go for Dumbledore bashing and Light bashing. Or go for the Indy!Harry fics. Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Peverell fics. Those really progressive Muggle fics that bash everything and anything about the Wizarding World and insist that the Muggle World is 5234897482781 times better. You'll probably find one of these the Wizarding-World-is-dumb-af rants in every five fics. Unfortunately, that's all I can point you towards. I usually make it a point to avoid these rants because they really do annoy me, and if they do appear, I skim. There's probably a few on my favourites list, but I don't remember which ones have this trope, as they tend to blur together after a while.
