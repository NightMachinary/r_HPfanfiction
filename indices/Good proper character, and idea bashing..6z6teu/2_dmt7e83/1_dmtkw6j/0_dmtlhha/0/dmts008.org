Once again that is not the point. If it was a fully trained wizard/witch I would be more leniant, but the fact of the matter is Mcgonnagal issued a detention between three 11/12 year olds under a Hagrid who can barely do any magic in a forest at night when there was a f****** unknown threat killing unicorns. Muggle wisdom or not that is pure stupidity. Also the wizarding world is a government that has close relations with it's muggle counterpart, and has a regular influx of muggleborns/halfbloods so apart from the whole electricity thing they seem to mostly follow a muggle based system with magic. They have a court of law. They have a form of schooling that you must attend. A 'policing' force. A parliment. Also I don't see anything dangerous happening to other kids with the adult/parent in charge not caring. If you want to argue about not putting in any muggle wisdom maybe they shouldn't be so closely intertwined with the muggle world
