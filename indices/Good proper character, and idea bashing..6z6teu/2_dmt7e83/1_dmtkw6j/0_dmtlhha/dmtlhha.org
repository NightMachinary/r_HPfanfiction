Again, nobody knows the forest and it's his inhabitants as well as Hagrid. Nobody can survive in there longer than he can. He's very familiar with the place. I think Hagrid is the safest bet for all the gs forest related. But the main point is; if wizarding culture does not consider this dangerous, then it is presumptuous of you to assume that your muggle wisdom is superior. And wizards are wrong about what is dangerous in thier world.
