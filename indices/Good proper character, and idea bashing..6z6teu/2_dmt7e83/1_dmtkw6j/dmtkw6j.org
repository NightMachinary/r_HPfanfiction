You mean the forest filled with centaurs who tolerate Hagrid at best or the spiders who will attack anyone, but Hagrid or how about a creature they don't have a clue about attacking, and killing unicorns. While I may be able to ignore the whole centaur/spider deal I can't in good conscience see how it is safe bringing kids on a detention at night when there is an unknown, dangerous being in the forest, especially when Hagrid thought it was a bright idea to split up putting rivals Draco, and Harry together.

So to sum up, there was a dangerous unknown in the Forbidden Forest killing unicorns with a grounds keeper who was bad at magic who thinks it's a good idea to stick rival students together, and then split up. Yes I can think of at least two people who they would be safer with Mcgonnagal, and Filius Flitwick. Also the point of this is that the very situation was stupid to begin with.
