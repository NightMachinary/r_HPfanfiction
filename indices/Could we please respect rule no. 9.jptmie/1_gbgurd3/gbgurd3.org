I HATE the good!Draco trope but I still upvote those threads and sometimes direct people to Drarry/Dramione subs if there are no recs and it's appropriate.

We should be good. I like your angle on nicer sub -> bigger population -> more chances someone can find your fic or give you a great rec too, but just try to be good to each other.
