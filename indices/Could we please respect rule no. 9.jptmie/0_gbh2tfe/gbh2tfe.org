I don't think the downvotes fall under Rule 9 per se, but I agree they add basically nothing.

All you're doing by downvoting a request thread is making it more unlikely that that thread gets replies - which in turn means other people looking for the same thing won't find anything in that thread either. That, in turn, just leads to /more/ requests of the same kind - so if anything, downvoting is counterproductive.

Unless a request actually violates Da Rules or a recommendation doesn't fit the request at all, don't downvote it.
