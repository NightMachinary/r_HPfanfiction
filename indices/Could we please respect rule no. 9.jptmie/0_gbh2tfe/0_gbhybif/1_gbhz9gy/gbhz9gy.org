In my experience it just comes and goes in waves. People give up for a while when their threads get nowhere, then it starts back up again when new people get interested in the same stuff and ask all over again.

All mass-downvoting is really doing is shoving the problem away for a little while, not solving it.

Just let the threads live to gather new fics, and if there get to be a lot of requests for the same stuff, just reply with other threads where the same thing is asked and answered. Same idea, better conveyance of "This is being asked too many times, we've answered it already".
