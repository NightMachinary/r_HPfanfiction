  That, in turn, just leads to more requests of the same kind - so if anything, downvoting is counterproductive.

I disagree. I've lurked on this sub for years and I've seen a marked decrease in requests/recommendations for slash involving Malfoys or Snape, and it correlates with mass downvoting of such posts.

I posit that a strong percentage of this sub does not want this kind of content (as encouragement or non-action leads to proliferation).

The system is working as intended.
