I think we can all agree to do our duty and downvote old, tired, and uninspired 'prompt' posts. Honestly, I don't even understand why the 'prompt' tag exists, especially since it doesn't inspire many fics as far as I can tell. Why can't we just bundle all of these posts into a single stickied thread?
