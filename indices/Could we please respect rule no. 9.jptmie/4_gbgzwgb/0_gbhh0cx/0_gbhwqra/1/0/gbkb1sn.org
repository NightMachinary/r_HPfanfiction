While I never really paid any active attention to the anime culture in any way (including the idea of "waifus" and such), the impression I got of it as an outsider when lurking communities which had some people that were into this, was that the kind of anime girls people claimed were their 'waifus' typically looked like young adults/(very) late teens, and not the ones that looked like they were like 12.

My personal look on it was that it was an unhealthy view on relationships, but not outright /perverse/.
