Yeah, fair enough.

I still stand by my point though. Like you said, the idea of an adult being romantically or sexually involved with a teen or younger (even if they're fictional) isn't the most healthy of relationships, for obvious reasons. In the same vein, I don't think it's right for the fandom to glorify or promote relationships like Harry or Hermione with Snape, Voldemort, or even Tonks the same way that Haphne or Flowerpot or other more innocent pairings are.

I genuinely don't see why this is such a hot take.
