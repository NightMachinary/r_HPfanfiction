If the people writing it are adults it's even worse. Most of the time it's teenagers writing a fic with an OC like themselves falling in love with a charming adult character (Sirius, Remus, etc.) but if it's an adult inserting themselves into the story with the intention of having a relationship with an underage character?

I mean, nobody's stopping you from reading or writing that kind of thing... but it's still gross. How is it different from lolicon neckbeards who fantasize about being in relationships with fictional characters that appear prepubescent or are /actually/ prepubescent?
