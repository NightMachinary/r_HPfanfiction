Your flair also implies that you're looking at it from the perspective of someone interested in Snape rather than vice versa.

I think most people's problems with the ship (in this particular sense -- there are other issues, but they're more canoncial in nature) is the image of someone from the other side, e.g. someone picturing themselves as Snape (or other adults) being interested in young girls/boys.
