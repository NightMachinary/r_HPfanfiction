I know most do use it that way, and as you can tell I consider that a problem, but I can't do much about it as a whole. However I have a significantly larger problem with people who say that that's /what it's for/. The buttons purposes are as outlined in the reddiquette, and people who use the, for agree/disagree purposes are misusing them, and saying they're designed to be used that way only encourages people to continue to do so.

Also the full line at the top is:

#+begin_quote
  Reddiquette is an informal expression of the values of many redditors, as written by redditors themselves. /Please abide by it the best you can./
#+end_quote

It is indeed informal and non enforceable, but we should all strive to abide by them for a better reddit experience for everyone, as outlined in my other comment(s).

Thanks for your criticism (unlike the other person who was just obtuse about it), it certainly contributed to my understanding of the situation so have an upvote.
