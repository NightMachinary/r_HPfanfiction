#+begin_quote
  reddiquette
#+end_quote

Ah, but reddiquette is optional. See,

#+begin_quote
  Reddiquette is an informal expression of the values of many redditors
#+end_quote

The values of many redditors are not binding to the rest of the users. The fact of the matter is, the majority of the users of Reddit use the up/down-vote button as an agree/disagree one. But even so, lets look a bit further on the reddiquette,

#+begin_quote
  If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it.
#+end_quote

This is the crux of the matter. Most users have a problem with the specific content, therefore they downvote it. That's all there is to it.
