“Contributes to a conversation” and “I like it” do not mean the same thing at all. You've also only read a part of the page and missed the bit where it explicitly says “Please don't: Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.” which is the exact opposite of what you're saying it's for.
