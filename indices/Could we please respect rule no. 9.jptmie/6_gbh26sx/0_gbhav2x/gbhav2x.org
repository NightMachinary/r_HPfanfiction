  Downvoting is a normal part of reddit and literally intended to be used in the way you describe (if you don't like something you downvote. If you like something you upvote)
#+end_quote

This is factually incorrect and it pisses me off how few people actually read the reddiquette before assuming they know what they're doing. See the â€œplease don't section [[https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439][here]]. In short, downvotes are for posts and comments which don't contribute anything meaningful to a subreddit or discussion, and as such there isn't any reason for /anyone/ to see them.

Downvoting something you disagree with makes it less likely for other people (who might be interested) to see it, which is a dick move because why should your opinion take away their opportunity to see those things?
