Rule 9 has nothing to do with downvoting. So its pointless to mention that. Rule 9 is specifically about verbal bashing. Downvoting is a normal part of reddit and is going to be used in the way you describe (often along the lines of.. if you dont like something you downvote. If you like something you upvote) whether thats right or wrong. /(Edited to be more clear on how folks use Reddit vrs reddiquette)/

A part of me agrees that there is no real need to downvote threads themselves here though. Folks can just ignore what they are not interested in and upvote what they are interested in. But downvoting is still needed inside the threads because sometimes you will get people spamming or giving recommendations that dont even make sense, and so on and so forth.
