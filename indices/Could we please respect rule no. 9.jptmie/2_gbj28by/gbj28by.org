:: eats popcorn and watches the comments ::

This sub has very specific tastes and rules of what is and is not proper; like any collection of people, eventually culture develops of the correct way of doing things.

To each their own.

I respect this sub's opinion, and absolutely support people setting limits and things that they do not want to read or talk about, or characters that they find abhorrent, or types of stories or tropes that they find problematic.

A subreddit /is/ its users, and clearly (by the poll mentioned above) this subreddit has certain pairings that are discouraged often enough that most of the folk looking for that content have self selected out of interacting with the sub, which is how the system is supposed to work. The culture of this sub says this is not acceptable, and it gets downvoted (or not upvoted) and the person finds a different group that is a better fit. After a while, the people who stay are the ones who agree and the culture is reinforced.

Which usually means those requests come from people new to the culture of the sub itself.

The main issue I see with the downvoting and comments is that it alienates a potential new member, but, again, see above; those are the people the sub's culture has already decided that they would rather not see, so it's sort of... doing what it was designed to do.

There are other subreddits, discords, fic rec lists and such for requests that are more open to pairings.

Rule 9 should be changed to reflect the culture, because there will not be a time when an unacceptable'request will remain unchallenged in some way. It's the culture of this sub.

However, I gotta say, I rarely see anybody discussing downvoting stories where people are being gorily murdered, or tortured, or emotionally manipulated until mindbreak, because we can all agree that this is fiction.

Just because you enjoy Stephen King, it doesn't mean you're secretly wishing you could disembowel someone with your creepy monster fingers you've been hiding in your clown suit. Nobody would ever say that the little old lady who binges heist stories is potentially a cat burglar, or that the guy reading sci-fi war stories would jump into a spaceship shoot aliens if you gave him the chance.

*It's fiction.* Murder isn't legal, but, we've all agreed that reading about fictional character being murdered does not make you culpable for a nutjob shooting someone in the face.

​

.... And anyway, this is all FANFICTION. We're all playing with JKR's Barbie dolls, making our little stories to tell each other. People are going to like things you don't, that's the way the world is.

There's HEAPS of things in fanfic I don't want to read, and you know what?

I just... Keep scrolling.
