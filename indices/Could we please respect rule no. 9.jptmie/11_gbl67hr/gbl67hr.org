Yeah it definitely annoyed me when I posted asking for a good girl x bad boy rec and the only comment I got was that "this trope is awful". Just because the majority of stories with that sort of thing in it are poorly written and executed doesn't mean that all stories with it are bad. I've seen even porn requests be upvoted, unless the subject matter is actually morally questionable we should be upvoting these posts
