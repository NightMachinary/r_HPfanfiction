I'm very confused by this sub, I've seen every single slash pairing post downvoted to death but the top 3 ships under Harry Potter (Ao3) are slash. And moreover, fanfiction has countless slash and other unconventional pairings. And I understand if you don't like the pairing, that's completely fair but if it's not violating a rule, then downvoting it seems unfair.
