See, I dropped out of fandom for a decade or so, after being very involved for many years. When I left, Snarry was the most popular ship, and voldie/harry wasn't a thing I saw almost ever. (let alone romantic tommary). The vast majority of the fandom was female, and/or queer.

I still read fic, but stopped posting it, but I didn't interact much with fandom as a whole.

And then the nerd revolution happened, it's no longer a social death sentence to like fanfiction, and being a superfan is AOK with a huge group of people who would have never been caught dead liking fic flooded into all the fandoms.

Everything grew, changed.

I decide to get back into the social side of fic, and, being a redditor, I check here first.

I find this sub, and I'm like... wait, what? Tastes have changed soooo much! I visited the discord and it was like I was a boggart of slash past. Occasionally they @ me as part of their new user hazing ritual, threatening to make them read my fic.

At least it was memorable, eh?

I'm good natured, and it's only /fanfic/, so whatever. You like what you like. I never expected my slash to be popular anyway (because at the time I wrote it, fandom was so much smaller, so 'wide cic-het acceptance' was hardly my goal), so it didn't particularly bother me. (I find much weirder that they recognize my username, TBH).

I bop along, learning a lot about New Fandom, and reading new stuff, and accepted that the community I had found back in the slash hayday of Livejournal and inkstainedfingers and archiveAtTheEndofTheUniverse were gone, and that, while I was welcome to participate in fandom, I should expect to be judged for my fictional tastes.

Alright. It's only fanfiction. The very act of creating it is usually illegal, 'morally questionable' and all. I'm an older queer, I'm used to it.

And then I found other fandom discords, and realized that THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY.

In fact, the more I looked, the more this sub and the discord are a fandom anomaly. HUGE, of course! (it's reddit! it grows and grows), and, while their views are also out in wider fandom, they aren't the THIS IS THE WAY that it feels like by reading only this sub.

I found several amazing discords, and now only glance at this one. As I said above, the culture of this particular sub doesn't really want me, or people who like what I like around.

Fandom is as welcoming and bright and wholesome in its acceptance as it ever was... just not here.
