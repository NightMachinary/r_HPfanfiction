I completely agree with everything you said. I got into fanfiction ~7 years ago when Tumblr was the biggest place for fanfiction and ships in general. I was exposed to every pairing you can name and while I didn't like all of them I accepted the fact that there are others who love them. People were still shamed for liking some pairings but it definitely wasn't like the culture of this sub and slash fics definitely weren't seen as terrible and "not proper."

At this point, I feel that the mods should add a slash fic ban if the response is going to be unhelpful and negative every time. They should make a poll asking if the users want slash fics and change the rules accordingly. We already have a separate subreddit for all the HP slash fics and it kinda sucks having two separate ones but it is what it is.

But I am curious about the makeup of this sub just to see why the culture is what it is.
