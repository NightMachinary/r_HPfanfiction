Link to those discords? Or are they non-hp-related?

For the record, the hpff Discord I lurk (I think it's the "main" one) isn't nearly as hostile to other people's preferences as this subreddit is. Usually whenever I mention my preferences here, I'm downvoted most of the time, or at least land in the inbetween with a "controversial" flag (but it used to be even worse, at one point I was downvoted for it 100% of the time). On the Discord, the response is far more neutral -- I get the occasional "it's an ok ship, I've read a fic or two" and the worst people give is "eh I don't like that ship, but you do you" or similar. Granted, my OTP isn't quite as out there as some others, but it's very much a minority ship, and a somewhat controversial one. The ship in question is Snily, for reference.

However, I've seen some HP fanfic Discords with a focus on a particular ship be /very/ hostile to other options, to the point of kicks/bans. But this is very rare.
