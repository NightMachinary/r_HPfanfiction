Everyone likes different fics and different pairings. I don't like Draco/Hermione or Harry/Fleur for an example, but I respect those who do.

I like slash fics, but I'm afraid to ask for slash on here, because of the hate it tends to get on this reddit. I understand there's a slash reddit for Harry Potter, but a lot of people don't know that. Or would like to ask for recs here, since a lot of people visit this thread, more then the slash reddit thread.
