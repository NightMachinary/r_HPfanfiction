Let's say, I ask for a very specific request. That person gives me a story that fits the request, but it has a pairing like Draco/Hermione or Harry/Fleur or something, that I don't like. I'm not going to say I hate that pairing, and I'm not downvoting that person, I'm going to say thank you for the rec.

It's wrong to downvote someone, just because they recommend a story that might fit everything you asked but, but turns out you hated the pairing.

It's not about hurt feelings, because yeah I agree. You need thicker skin on the internet and in general. But, it's courtesy not to downvote.
