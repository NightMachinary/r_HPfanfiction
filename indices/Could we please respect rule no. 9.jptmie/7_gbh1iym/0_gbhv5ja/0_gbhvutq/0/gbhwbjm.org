I'd like to think that the community could respect people's opinions on ships, even if they disagree, as long as requests and discussions follow the general rules (regarding underage fics for example). This includes not downvoting request threads just because you don't like the ship.

Not doing this ultimately leads to the community becoming an echo chamber, and essentially closed from any new influences. This would eventually kill it.
