No. I don't care for Tomarry, Snarry (in fact, I avoid those ships) or Snamione (which I'm slightly less averse to, but still typically avoid since I avoid anything teacher/student). But I don't downvote request threads for those -- in fact, sometimes I upvote them, specifically to counter the rampant downvoting of things people don't like. Because all downvotes do is drive people away, splitting the HP fanfiction community into a bunch of smaller ones each with their own preferences. Why do you think [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] exists in first place, for instance? It's likely a result of this very thing, at least in part. I've seen people recommend the sub to those with preferences that induce downvotes (and whose preferences are slash in nature).

It's true that I'm sometimes downvoted for my own preferences, but I don't care about that nearly as much as for request threads, since those ultimately only affect myself, while request threads usually apply to a group of people.
