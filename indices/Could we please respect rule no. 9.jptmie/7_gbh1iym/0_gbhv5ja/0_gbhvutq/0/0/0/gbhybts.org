I personally think this is a somewhat narrow-minded view of a ship, any ship, except for ones where people are /specifically/ asking for this. I mentioned this elsewhere with Voldemort/Harry and SSHG/SSHP: just because you /can/ make a fic like you describe, doesn't mean that's what people look for when they ask for that ship. Some examples that are contrary to this view (note that these are random plot examples and not specific fics I've read, personally I avoid all Tomarry for instance).

Tomarry: Diary!Tom gets a body, redeems himself somehow. 5 years later, he ends up developing a relationship with Harry.

Snarry: Postwar after a couple of years where everything has died down, Harry reaches out to an alive Snape asking what's up. Things go from there.

Snamione: Hermione somehow trips back to the Marauder-era by time turner shenanigans and stumbles upon and eventually romances a young Snape (this is a remarkably common SSHG plot).
