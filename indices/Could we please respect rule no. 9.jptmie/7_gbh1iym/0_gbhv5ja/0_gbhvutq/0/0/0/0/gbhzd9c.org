The Diary!mort one i agree is not as problematic. The other two, major yikes.

Severus Snape spends more time with Hermione than her parents do from the age of 11-18. This isn't a situation where someone meets their 4th grade teach 15 years later and hits it off. He was a constant authority presence in her pubescent and adolescent years (and Harry's, and every other student). Unless it is completely AU, where Snape never interacted with the characters until they were able to make adult decisions, it is grooming or the Stockholm syndrome version of it.

I sincerely hope that it is teens requesting writing these fics, because it is just so grim to think of adults making justifications and excuses for this type of fantasy.
