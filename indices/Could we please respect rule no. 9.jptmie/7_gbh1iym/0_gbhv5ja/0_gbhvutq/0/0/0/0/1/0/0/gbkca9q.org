I find this really confusing, because while I don't know the full details regarding Macron, I think it's pretty much the exact same thing? Female teachers seducing young boys is no better than the reverse (i.e. teacher/student Snamione), despite the double standard applied to it in media.

Are you saying it's different because Hermione and Snape lives in the same building? That's... not really a valid argument to me, because while it's technically true, there is a very clear seperation of dormitories and teachers' quarters (or whatever place the teachers use for sleep). It'd be no different than them living closeby in a village.
