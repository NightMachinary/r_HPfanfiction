Yeah, that's not happening. This sub doesn't have a vague, ethereal number of users; there are ~57k subscribers and the majority have specific tastes. The sub IS its users, it's not a utopian bastion of expression.

If you check out the 2019 [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek--_OJ_WjhGMeITBd685CJxsE9QEG3tROWWa7FVCVPcK5AQ/viewanalytics][survey]] you'll see that although 50% of users admit to reading slash, in the favorite slash pairing for Harry graph, SS receives 4% while TM/Voldemort receives 12%. That means only a very small minority of the sub (2%/6% respectively if you count half the users not reading slash at all) approves of these pairings, therefore they are downvoted to oblivion.
