While I understand your argument towards the Snarry example (I don't really read Snarry so it's hard for me to judge the kinds of stuff going on in those fics), what you say doesn't really apply for the Snamione one. Or am I misunderstanding you? At that point, he might as well be a completely different person; generally those fics are set before he becomes a Death Eater and the person he ultimately became as an adult.
