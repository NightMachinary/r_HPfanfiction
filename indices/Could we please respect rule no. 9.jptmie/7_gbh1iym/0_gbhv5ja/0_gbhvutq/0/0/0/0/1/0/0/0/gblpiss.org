Again - you cannot compare a real life schoolteacher, who spends only one year in charge of a student who lives at home with their family, to Hogwarts, where the students have the same teachers for most of a decade, live in the same building, and are removed from their familial authority figures.

I taught at a university level - my students were all adults - and I can tell you there are clear power dynamics at play. Change that to teaching children, the /same/ children for 7 years straight who are isolated from their parents, and those power dynamics become complete domination.

I've said above, this is extremely disturbing for any adult to fantasize about. Kids are immature, so they don't understand how twisted it is for an adult to manipulate a child like that, but every adult should know how... /gross/ it is to imagine an adult see a child grow up and then as soon as they're legal try to get in their pants. Blech!

To go back to the original point, yes I will downvote stories like this. It is grim AF and a downvote is a very kind way of expressing disapproval.
