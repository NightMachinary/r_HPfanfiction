I'm not sure if I agree, but at the same time, it's not exactly a situation I've been in myself, so it's hard to say.

But my personal view on that kind of fic was always that, at that point (this is typically set around 1996->1976), Snape is a very different person than what he is as a teacher. This combined with the fact that she doesn't really /know/ him as an adult besides as a position of a teacher, and that she'd be forced to interact with him more as a student the same year as him, ultimately makes the situation far more sensible than a teacher/student thing.

Sure, he might still be a crappy person -- he did become a Death Eater after all in canon. But I never saw /this/ in particular as a problem.

EDIT: Figured I'd add another thing wrt the Snarry example: I haven't had the teachers I had as a kid for over a decade, despite having some of them for almost 10 years. While none of the teachers I had was particularly young (so unlikely to ever get my interest in that sense even if I did meet them today), even if that was the case, I wouldn't really see any harm in it personally at this point.
