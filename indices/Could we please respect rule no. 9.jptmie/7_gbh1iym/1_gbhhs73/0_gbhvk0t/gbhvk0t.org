Do note however that not everyone asking for, say, Snarry or Snamione, are asking for teacher/student fics. There's plenty of postwar fics, or Marauder-era fics, with the characters, that are harmless in that sense. While I personally stay away from most Snamione and essentially all Snarry with little to no exception, it has more to do with the typical fics severely violating my preferences rather than the ships themselves.

A similar argument can be made for Voldemort/Harry, even if I've never read any of those myself: consider the concept of a Tomarry fic where Tom is the teenager from the Diary. Still somewhat suspect age-wise, but only in the beginning. 5 years later, and there wouldn't be anything significantly wrong with the ship from the point of age. Of course, the relationship would have serious other issues, but yeah.
