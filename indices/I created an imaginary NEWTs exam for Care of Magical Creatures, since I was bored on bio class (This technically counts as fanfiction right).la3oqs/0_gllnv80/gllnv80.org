If you're a fan of that... there used to be a website called hogwartsishere.com (seems like it's still around). It actually has Hogwarts classes and it had practical part for OWLs that involved some little flash games that would test your knowledge. You should check it out. Not my thing since I'm more here for the crackish stories but it might be something that appeals to some fans.
