Ah, A-Level Biology nostalgia.

The paper has been done nicely. I feel like a lot of the shorter questions are a bit on the easy side for something equivalent to A-Level - they're more like GCSE type questions - but some of the essay questions feel appropriate.

Essay questions 1, 2 and 6 in particular feel "right". They have that additional level of having scope for discussion that goes beyond mere statement of fact: evaluation, compare and contrast different opinions with justification, etc.
