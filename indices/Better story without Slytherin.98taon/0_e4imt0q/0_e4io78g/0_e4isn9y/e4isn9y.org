Cunning is applied cleverness. It's not just a subset, the application actually makes it different. Cleverness is the ability to work out a puzzle, solve a riddle. Cunning is the ability to manipulate people (which isn't always a bad thing), so actually take the the abstract and use it in real life. For instance, in poker: Cleverness would allow a person to work out the possible hands they might get based off what they have and the likelihood of each, and whether or not they'll have to bluff. Cunning would allow a person to use just the right movements and tone of voice that they can manipulate their opponent into folding or increasing the pot or whatever they need.

I'm a bit confused as how you think cunning and ambition are traits for psychopaths. You may as well say that bravery and nobility are traits of idiots, or that loyalty and hard work are traits of the dull. Yes, the books started making one house evil, but that's not the house's fault. That's on JKR entirely. It doesn't help that the first wizard we meet is biased against Slytherin, the first Slytherin we meet is a snobbish little kid, the Gryffindors who tell us about Slytherin are biased against it, the head of Slytherin is a petty man who can't let go of a grudge. If we're judging a house by the way it's set up at the start, why does Hufflepuff get a pass? They may as well not exist in book 1 and in book 2 they universally hate Harry. Book 3 they're conspicuously absent again, and book 4 they again hate Harry. Yet somehow they're okay?

I'm not going to say that Slytherin is all a bunch of woobies who were mis-characterized and should be loved and cherished. There were some really bad eggs there. But the house itself isn't the problem, and removing it isn't the answer. Curse Rowling for being a mediocre author (which she really is...her worldbuilding is crap and so many characters never get any real characterization) but don't blame Slytherin for existing.
