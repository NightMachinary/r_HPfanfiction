I don't see how you can say that being "ambitious and cunning" is a symptom list for a psychopath. Just like everything else you said in your first post someone can be ambitious in terrible ways, but if someone decided they wanted to cure all forms of cancer that'd be pretty damn ambitious, and a good thing.

I googled "cunning" and it says "having or showing skill in achieving one's ends by deceit or evasion", which is exactly what the post above you is arguing. If you want to say this is just some kind of intelligence applied (which it is), we can basically say that all of the qualities of the 4 houses are either emotional intelligence (Gryfs and Puffs) or rational intelligence applied (Claws vs Snakes), so we should only have 2 houses.
