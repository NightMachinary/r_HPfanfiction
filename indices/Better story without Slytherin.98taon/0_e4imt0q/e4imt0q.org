  It would make things more nuanced for starters. Nobody could just point a finger so easily at a color and group people together. We really would have to look at the characters actions and ideology that they display.

  It actual takes a lot away from the other houses, by outsourcing the 'bad people' in one house. We don't get to see how Hufflepuff's loyalty made them loyal to the wrong kind of people. We don't gt to see a Ravenclaw that in his or her search for knowledge became so ruthless that they didn't care how they got it. We didn't see a Gryffindor fight bravely and recklessly for Voldemort and his ideals (and Peter doesn't count here, because when he is with Voldemort he imbodies everything Gryffindor is not).

These are the same point. There's no reason we need to remove Slytherin to do this. Any house that a Dark Lord comes from will be tainted as long as that Dark Lord is in living memory.

  Slyhterin is missing a primary action attribute compared to the other houses. Ambition and cunning are more secondary attributes. Let me explain, you confront different people with a problem or the wish to succeed. How would the typical Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff go at that? The Gryffindor would start to work on the problem and try to solve it directly. If something isn'T working they are changing it at the go. They are ready to take risks for it and to put themselves in harms way if necessary. Ravenclaws would do their research first. They would try to think up every possible scenario and how to react to it. They don't want to be surprised. Hufflepuff have more of a group thing going for them. They would discuss and then veto how to deal with thins and would do it together, having each others back. They are the meting pot at the school were everybody has the same voice among them, they have to relay on democracy a lot more than the other houses. And Slytherin is missing this kind of first action trait.

Cunning is a primary trait, though. Got a problem? Manipulate someone else into solving it for you. Slytherin Harry goes after the Sorcerer's Stone and tricks Hermione and Ron into solving the puzzles for him. Slytherin Harry gets someone else to interrogate Malfoy and report back. Slytherin Harry doesn't need to go back in time to save Sirius because he played to Snape's vindictive nature and convinced the man that it might be amusing the hear the frenzied ramblings of a madman just before his execution. Cunning is essentially applied cleverness. And trust me, ambition can be a primary trait. I would argue it's Percy Weasley's primary trait through most of the books. The issue with the books isn't that cunning and ambition aren't primary traits. It's that JKR didn't show them at all.

  The prominent Slytherin characters all would from the way they act fit quiet well in other houses. Slughorn is someone that thinks about connecting people and this interpersonal relationships are his thing. That sounds like a Hufflepuff. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle are into this group mentality as well. They seek strength in numbers and having each others back (for most of the series) they are loyal to Voldemort, because their parents were loyal to him as well. Snape is a kid that search for new knowledge as we see with his potion book and his dark curses- that sounds like Ravenclaw. Voldemore himself acts like a Ravenclaw as well. Then you have people like Bellatrix and Crouch Jr. who are very direct and aggressive or brave and reckless in their fight for Voldemort and his ideals, like a Gryffindor.

"You know, I sometimes think we sort too soon!" -- Dumbledore. The traits that put someone in a house are not the only traits we ever see. Hermione is clever, Ron is loyal, Harry is cunning, Percy and the twins are ambitious, Cho is loyal, Draco is hard working, Luna is brave. We could just as easily remove one of the other houses.

Removing Slytherin doesn't automatically make the story better. Humanizing the Slytherins and rounding out their characters would.
