This topic reminds me of some fanfics that examine the idea of removing Slytherin. Logically, if Slytherin is truly the house of psychopaths and bullies as portrayed in canon, then why wouldn't the 'good' people in authority take action against it?

Personally, I never appreciated Slytherin until I started reading fanfiction. Many heroes throughout history have been cunning and/or ambitious. These traits can be a great power for good in the right hands.

A few fics that examine the problem of Slytherin:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/][Anything But Slytherin]] - Only bad people get put in Slytherin? That makes a excelent early warning system so we can stamp out young Dark wizards before they become a problem!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]] - A few characters speculate that Dumbledore made Snape the Head of House for Slytherin deliberately to decrease the house's prestige, to increase its reputation for bullying, and to make the smart and ambitious children not want to be sorted there.

  "Think of Dumbledore becoming increasingly sad over this Hogwarts House that seems the source of so much ill-doing. And then behold, Dumbledore puts in as Head of Slytherin the person of Snape. Snape! Severus Snape! A man who would teach his House neither cunning nor ambition, a man who would impose lax discipline and make its children weak! A man who would offend students of other Houses, who would ruin Slytherin's name among them! A man whose surname was unknown in magical Britain and certainly not noble, who went about half in rags! Do you think Dumbledore ignorant of the consequence? When Dumbledore was the one who brought it about, and had motive to bring it about? I expect Dumbledore told himself that more lives would be saved during the next Wizarding War if Voldemort's future Death Eaters were weakened."

  "Continue the process long enough, and no child would want to go to Slytherin. The House would be retired, and if the Hat kept calling the name, it would become a mark of ignominy among children who would afterward be distributed among the other three Houses. From that day on, Hogwarts would have three upstanding Houses of courage and scholarship and industry, with no House of Bad Children added to the mix; just as if the three Founders of Hogwarts had been wise enough in the beginning to refuse Salazar Slytherin their company. That, I expect, was Dumbledore's intended end-game; a short-term sacrifice for the greater good."
