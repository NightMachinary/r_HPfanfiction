I agree with the basic premise of this post. Slyterhin and how it has been handled is one of the bigger failures of the Series.

I'm not entirely sure that Slytherin has to be removed entirely, but it would have to be transformed so substantially that there'd be merit in saying "You just removed Slytherin and added an entirely different House with the same name". Certainly it wouldn't be allowed to contain all the bad people.

The thoughts about primary/secondary attributes are interesting. I think "ambition" is a pretty bad action trait, because all high-achievers in all houses should have it. But cunning works pretty well I think and is a very different approach to those described to be typical for Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. A different Slytherin (that doesn't revolve around being evil) would be styled around cunning/intelligence&information gathering/stealth. I think that's a markedly different approach than what the other Houses would do.

  You could still have the chamber of secrets and all that, but as a kind of lost house thing. That the other three founders kind of sorted Slytherin's students between them after he left and the house was closed down after that. Imagine in the second book the hunt for that lost house first in the books and actual trying to find clues about what kind of guy Slytherin was, why the he left in the first place and all that. Not just in a little story time, but because the trio worked for that kind of things.

I don't think removing Slytherin should lead to having a plot revolving around rediscovering Slytherin. Sounds like a bad idea.
