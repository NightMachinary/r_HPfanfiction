Don't do this shit. Not only is it incredibly aggravating to read, but it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, because a lot of people (myself included) automatically downvote anything like this. You aren't martyring yourself over internet points.

As for the topic, there's nothing wrong with House Slytherin as a concept (aside from pigeon-holing kids for 7 years because of one trait, but that's the entire house system being garbage). Rowling just pulled it off badly, to the point where it's basically the house of evuuuuls. Executionally flawed, not conceptually. No need to nuke Slytherin from orbit when you can just write it better.
