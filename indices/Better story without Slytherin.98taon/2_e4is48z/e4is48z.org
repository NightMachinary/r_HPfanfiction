The fact that Slytherin isn't executed well doesn't mean we should take them out. If we were going by that rational, we should take away every house, since none of them serve any purpose anyway (besides being way to communicate to a small child what each house is).

Hufflepuff? The loser house. Sure Cedric was from this house, but would his death have been any different if he had just been a random 7th year (since we've taken out houses entirely in this scenario). The fact that he only becomes important in fourth year when the series started to get more YA is important. Can't have someone from the loser house doing cool stuff, that's Gryffindors thing. Hopefully by the time you read this book you realize that not everyone is a cardboard cut out (he isn't even particularly loyal either, Harry straight up tells him that they have to fight Dragons, and Cedric tells Harry "hmmm try taking a bath" instead of telling him to stick the egg in water).

Ravenclaw? The nerd house. There's a reason people thought Hermione should have been a Ravenclaw in the first books, it's pretty easy to just say she's the school nerd. Luna's from this house, I guess, but she doesn't show any particular desire to learn things save for being willing to test/believe anything. Cho is from here as well, but I don't remember her ever having a moment of particular wit or desire for learning. The fact that at no point do Harry and Co. say "we need someone smart, let's get a Ravenclaw" also shows how useless this division is.

Slytherin? The evil/bully house. They only exist to make Harry hate Voldemort (since he was a Slytherin) even more, contrast the two, and to give Harry an "enemy" during the school year. I've already said that the house in concept isn't well executed no one does anything remotely cunning or is even really ambitious in the books. Draco's 6th year plan was cunning I guess, maybe even ambitious (though he really didn't want to do it), but are you honestly going to tell me that you think that Crabbe/Goyle are in any way ambitious OR cunning?

Gryffindor? The cool house. You should like Harry and want to be him even more because he's in the cool house with the lion. That's what Gryffindor is for. If Harry and Ron had just happened to get be roommates, and had a class schedule that overlapped with Hermione's most of the time, the fact that they're Gryffindors could be completely removed and their relationship would probably have developed the same way. No one in Gryffindor is important SOLELY because they are brave (some people like Percy and Peter are important because they aren't, Percy not being able to forgive his family for being right, and Peter for being a coward).

So to finish, I guess the story could be better if you took out Slytherin since it was so poorly done, though all houses were poorly done but it could be even better if you just took away the houses and had all these kids going to a school without houses. Of course that doesn't tell the dumb 7 year old me which kid he has to hate, which is why Slytherin is the bad house, not because the characteristics Slytherin supposedly embodies are evil/not enough to be the primary characteristics of a character.
