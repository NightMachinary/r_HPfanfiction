Not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][that]]. Definitely not that. It might just meet your requirements and it is at the very least a story. A story written by robots, but one where Dumbledore intervenes a very long time before he does in the books.

The books are all about Harry mentored by Dumbledore, but, yeah.
