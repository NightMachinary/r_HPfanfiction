Everyone else has gone over the main points. I'd like to add that Dumbledore had 3 positions of power and did not have the time to dedicate to any of them AND he also took on defeating Voldemort because he was Obviously the only one able to do so.

He was a crappy headmaster, a crappy Mugwump and a crappy Chief Warlock because each of those should have been a 40 hour a week job at the least.

The only conclusion I can come to after reading all of the books, is that he has a superiority complex and all of society seems to enable him. He had a grand plan and he stuck to it no matter what might have worked better and no matter the glaring holes in his plot...

Much like JKR actually
