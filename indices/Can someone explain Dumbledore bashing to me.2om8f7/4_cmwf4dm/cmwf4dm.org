A lot of the responses here explain how stupid dumbels plan was, and relied so heavily on luck. A lot of defenses to that seem to be that "It worked".

It only worked because the light had the power of plot on their side, causing protagonists to have bouts of plot induced luck, and bad guys to have bouts of plot induced stupidity. (If voldie had been trying, he could have easily killed harry in the summer after 4th or 5th year).

To give an example, if a terrorist is fleeing through a crowded area, and I decide the best way to kill him is the liberally spray the general area with automatic fire... Even if by some insane amount of luck, I manage to kill ONLY the terrorist, and nobody else, I will still be fucking insane, and maybe even 'evil' since I apparently don't care about potential collateral damage.

Rally, evil dumbles is the lower end of dumbles bashing anyway. Him wanting to let harry die, and then finish the fight himself for greater glory... no, it works with some fics i guess, but it's about as reasonable as fudge thinking dumbles is after his position. If he really wanted that much power, he could have simply claimed he killed voldie himself to begin with.

Much better for the category, is more along the lines of "Old and maybe senile puppet master". He's been guiding the world for a really long time, and is used to people following his lead, used to having to plan everything himself. He has this plan, that has no chance of working at all unless a higher power (such as the author) forces it to work. But he's absolutely determined that it's the only way, failing to realize it's insane. Whether that's caused by senility, confundus, misplaced trust in divination, or something else... And he fights tooth and nail and will go to extremes to make sure that it is followed out to the letter. And if anyone involved notices how insane the plan is, or takes offense to their role in it... well tough luck.
