I would also suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3214743/1/Trinity][Trinity, by Katling]]. It's mostly the trio planning to fight Voldemort and training, but it portrays Dumbledore very well as someone who has had to make some shit decisions in the hopes things will work out better, even if those decisions end up hurting the people around him.
