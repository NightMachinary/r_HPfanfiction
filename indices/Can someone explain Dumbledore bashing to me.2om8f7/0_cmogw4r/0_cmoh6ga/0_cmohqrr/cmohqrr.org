A Black Comedy, The Lie I've Lived, A Long Journey Home, Harry Potter and the Hero's Path, Dagger and Rose, off the top of my head.

Those are some of my favorites, and they all feature a flawed Dumbledore who butts heads with, or is a minor obstacle to Harry, but who is a helpful, decent person in the end.
