In the broadest sense, when you've read through the novels a few times, you eventually notice the apparent dissonance between Dumbledore's character (clever, powerful, virtuous) and his actions (the absurdly easy defenses guarding the Stone, his failure to recognize Moody as an impostor, his seeming reliance on 'Harry + ancient magic + prophesy = victory' instead of more practical solutions, etc.)

You come out of that in two ways: first, you can give JKR a pass for the first two books because you realize that they were straight-up children's lit, and children's lit has different rules, and then you cast Dumbledore in the rest of the series as a flawed, decent person who made some tough choices and understood the nature of Riddle better than anyone else.

Or, you cast him in a negative light: either a deluded old fool whose naive reliance on storybook tropes are the first signs of creeping dementia, or as a straight-up villain bent on controlling the wizarding world to some (usually vaguely outlined) utopian end, with a master plan so intricate and so involved in Harry's life that he sets up Harry's friends and House allegiances before he even steps through the barrier onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.
