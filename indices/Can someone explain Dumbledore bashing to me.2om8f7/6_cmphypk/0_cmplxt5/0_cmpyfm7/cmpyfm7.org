I certainly wouldn't argue as I really don't know what was going on :P but yeah my thought was that Voldemort only /just/ managed not to kill any/all Minvera, Slughorn, and Shackelbolt(?) because of love protection /and/ because he hadn't mastered the wand AND the same for Harry; so if Voldemort did master it - Game Over Man. I suppose if Dumbledore planned everything else I would think he would want to at least make sure the wand had no chance of falling into Voldemorts hands (ie destroyed or hidden better or set it up so Harry was master...somehow).

Which as your second paragraph says make you wonder.
