  or give the Elder wand to Harry before dying breaking the power or giving Harry the chance to just destroy it?

The whole Elder Wand thing is slightly off, iirc Dumbledore wanted Snape killing him voluntarily because that way the line of the Elfer Wand would break and it would belong to no one at all, thus making it unusable. That Malfoy disarmed him before getting beaten by Harry was pure chance and not at all Dumbledore's plan.

Which of course makes me wonder how Dumbledore had imagined Harry would defeat Voldemort. After all it only worked becuase of Voldemort's own Avada Kedavra... How should Harry have kileld him without that, with Expelliarmus? (Seriously, that boy lacks any kind of offensive spells to kill... Which might have been JKRs point but was still highly stupid when fighting a war... [although of course one can kill with Incendio, Diffindo or Confringo but I guess Voldemort would deflect these spells easily... And Harry might not have thought of that.])
