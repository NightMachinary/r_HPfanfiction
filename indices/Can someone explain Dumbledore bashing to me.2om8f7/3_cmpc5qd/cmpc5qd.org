Look at Albus's final plan:

- Drive Harry to suicide-by-dark-lord.
- Hope that a quirk of magic gives him the option of returning to life.
- Hope that this person who just committed suicide chooses to return to life.
- Hope that he then manages to kill the Dark Lord.

So, to make Harry suicidal, he had him abused as a child, kept him away from any possible loving family and pseudo-family (Remus, Sirius), and repeatedly exposed him to harm -- oh, wait, that's evil Dumbledore. We were saying a /good/, skilful Dumbledore. Sorry, I'm all out of those.

A somewhat different version of the books would have permitted a good Dumbledore much more easily:

- Dumbledore shows Harry the ring horcrux. He tells him that it's unfortunate, but the ring and stone will probably be destroyed when they destroy the horcrux; only a spell from a horcrux's creator can cleanse it without damaging it.
- Harry plans the final battle around his own temporary death. Multiple people carry fake wands. Harry signals them; they swap wands; Harry baits a killing curse out of Voldemort.
- Harry dies.
- Everyone surrenders.
- Harry comes back a few minutes later. He casts a piercing hex at Voldemort's head.
- Everyone on his side with a wand left summons their allies' wands and distributes them while the Death Eaters are distracted by Harry's return.
- Battle resumes. Voldemort is mortal.

For earlier in the series, you can get a good Dumbledore with only a few lapses if (a) you eliminate the child abuse, (b) you assume he was following Harry around during the most dangerous bits using a time turner and invisibility cloak, (c) Alastor Moody wasn't his acquaintance, or at least not his friend, and (d) the Philosopher's Stone was a fake. This still leaves Sirius's lack of trial as the worst offense, with a handful of others.
