The obvious explanation is that a lot of writers are teenagers to whom the idea of angsty rebellion appeals.

More generally, people fail to give due weight to Dumbledore's reasons. E.g. placing Harry with the Dursleys. Yes, Harry was not happy there. But Dumbledore tells us in OotP that it was essentially a choice between Dursleys and death. Dumbledore believed that the blood protection was the only magic that could effectively defend Harry.

Dumbledore bashers choose to simply ignore that explanation with incredulity. I've never felt incredulity to be much of an argument. Dumbledore knows far more about the workings of magic and the 1981 political situation than any reader. If, in his judgement, Harry was likely to die in any other situation, it seems like we must accept that.

It's much the same for all the other accusations people chuck at Dumbledore. Explanations exist, the bashers simply choose to ignore them. As for why they do so? See above: teenage rebellion.
