I think another part of the issue is that, well, the Dursleys do /not/ fit the common picture of an abusive household. They're quite good at hiding it, and Harry is resilient and unwilling to show weakness by nature. As much as angsty teenagers would not like to believe it, there ARE people that slip through the cracks, even when circumstances are conducive to it going the other way. These are people that /need/ someone to blame because they aren't ready to accept that.

On top of that, the issue of Petunia and Harry really could have gone two different ways. Petunia's hatred of magic wasn't what it appeared-- it was /jealousy/. How common is it that parents, unable to live the lives they wanted to live, live vicariously through their children when they find that they have better circumstances and abilities than they had? Especially when Petunia was so obviously doting and spoiling towards her Dudley-- I wouldn't peg a doormat like her as a potential child abuser, especially if I came from a time period where children were seen and not heard.

It might be hard to see, as someone that has read through the books and has seen what she is capable of, but if you put yourself in Dumbledore's position... She really hadn't demonstrated that yet at all. Sure, she hated her sister, but that's (unfortunately) relatively common, and not really a red flag. Hell, had Dumbledore even interacted with or heard from Petunia at /all/ since her letters asking to attend Hogwarts? Lily doesn't seem like the kind of person to badmouth her sister. Maybe to James or Severus in her worse moments, but not Dumbledore.
