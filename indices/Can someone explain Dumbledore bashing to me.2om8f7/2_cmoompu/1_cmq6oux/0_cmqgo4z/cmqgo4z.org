You make a very good argument for why Harry fell through the cracks as a young child, but what about after he came to Hogwarts.

Shouldn't the signs of neglect & abuse been picked up by Pomphrey in one of the times that Harry was in her care? Or by any of the other professors at the school that interact with Harry on at least a weekly basis?

Why doesn't anything come of Fred, George, and Ron telling their parents that they had to pull bars off Harry's window and that his door was locked from the outside? Weren't those same locks still on the door when the Order shows up to take Harry to Grimmauld Place?

There were definitely opportunities for someone to release what was actually going on at Privet Drive. And after OotP, it should have been clear to Harry that he was not really protected there from outside influences unless he was physically in the house.
