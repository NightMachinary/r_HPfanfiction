Someone once posted in a topic like this to point out how old Dumbledore was. Basically they said that when he grew up, the Dursley's treatment of Harry wasn't abuse. I thought that was insightful. Times change and so does child raising.

I also think fanfiction writers inflate the abuse Harry receives. He is abused, I'm not denying that. But he is not beaten, raped, and screamed at every day. The Dursley's neglect him, confine him, give him work a child would have nowadays, hit him with a frying pan once, verbally abusive, etc. FF doesn't think that's bad enough for some reason (!) so they escalate it and then Dumbledore might be a monster for leaving him to it.
