  But Dumbledore tells us in OotP that it was essentially a choice between Dursleys and death. Dumbledore believed that the blood protection was the only magic that could effectively defend Harry.

  Dumbledore bashers choose to simply ignore that explanation with incredulity. I've never felt incredulity to be much of an argument. Dumbledore knows far more about the workings of magic and the 1981 political situation than any reader.

While you have a point, that's still not a justification - Harry Potter was /literally/ a victim of child abuse. If Dumbledore noticed that, he /could/ have done something to make the Dursleys less abusive, without destroying the blood wards. Like sending the Dursleys to therapy.

  It's much the same for all the other accusations people chuck at Dumbledore. Explanations exist, the bashers simply choose to ignore them. As for why they do so? See above: teenage rebellion.

Explanations need to be strongly plausible, otherwise they're just rationalisations.
