Exactly. While Dumbledore probably was very busy, he could easily have checked in every year or two (in the guise of a business associate of Vernon's or a friend of Mrs Figg's if necessary, he must be able to alter his appearance and dress to be more Muggle) on how they were treating Harry. He could come over for a cup of tea, chat to Harry about his schoolwork, use Legilemency to see how Harry's treated. If anything worrying comes up, he has a private word with Petunia etc; the whole affair would take an hour at most and could have prevented a lot of stuff, like Harry's being /locked in a cupboard./ I've always thought Harry was stunningly well-adjusted for being a victim of the stuff described in PS.
