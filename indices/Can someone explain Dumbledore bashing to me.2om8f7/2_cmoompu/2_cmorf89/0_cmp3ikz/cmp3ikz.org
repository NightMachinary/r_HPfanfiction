  he could have done something to make the Dursleys less abusive, without destroying the blood wards. Like sending the Dursleys to therapy.

People who abuse their significant others tend not to respond to therapy well. They might improve temporarily, but it almost never lasts. I don't see why child abuse would be any different. Vernon would likely be sufficiently angered by having to go to a magical therapist, or by any therapist at all, that he would have turned to even more potent abuse.

Dumbledore could alternatively have assigned a house elf to care for and protect Harry, and told it to remain unseen when possible. Prevent the symptoms rather than trying to cure the cause.
