  But Dumbledore tells us in OotP that it was essentially a choice between Dursleys and death. Dumbledore believed that the blood protection was the only magic that could effectively defend Harry.

Given that Dumbledore also believed the prophecy to be true as long as those it affected acted on it, it should have been a choice between Harry being abused by the Dursleys and Harry being abducted and maybe tortured or something if he stayed in the wizarding world. You know, if you consider the whole "either MUST die at the hand of the other" business. If Dumbledore wanted to, he could have raised Harry himself to make sure that nobody did him any harm. I don't like stories that bash Dumbledore, I understand that he presumably wanted Harry to grow up away from fame and among muggles to make sure Harry knew them to be real human beings as well, but if Dumbledore wanted to he could have taken a different approach. I agree with Lane_Anasazi that when it comes to the first few books, or, in my opinion the books in general, we also have to take into consideration that JKR was writing a children's book/adventure book and had to make choices that kept things interesting.
