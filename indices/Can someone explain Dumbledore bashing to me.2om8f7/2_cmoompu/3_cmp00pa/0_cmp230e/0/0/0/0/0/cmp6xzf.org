Sooo, I just did a little research. The books aren't as fresh in my mind as they once were, didn't remember all the details. Given what I found I guess leaving Harry at the Dursleys really was the for the best.

Dumbledore:

  "While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years"

Would have been pretty stupid to give all that up.
