All these arguments about how great the blood wards were... Harry suffered there. He was protected there. Which was the objective and which was a side effect?

The end of fourth year tells us the truth of the matter. Voldemort was resurrected using harry's blood, the very thing that supposedly powered the protection. Where before he had burned on contact, proving that the protection was active, afterwards he could touch him with impunity. Clear proof that the protection was rendered useless. And yet Harry was forced to go back.

Obviously the primary reason for him being there was to suffer and be put down, any protection (If there even was any) was merely a side effect. Else why send him back after it is proven that the so called protections are useless?

And no, the protection's weren't "Still keeping him hidden", after all, Umbridge did manage to get two dementors to attack him in the area, obviously both her and the dementors meant him harm, so it may as well have just been a bunch of death eaters popping in for all the difference it makes. Even if we give dumbles the benefit of the doubt that he didn't realize, he SHOULD have after the summer, and found a better place for him after 5th year.

Assuming he was a good guy trying to do the best to protect harry, and not just make him suicidal. If protection was truly the goal, he should have moved harry somewhere else. Grimmauld place would have been great. Wards, fidelius, Sirius, friends... so much safer and happier then an abusive household with useless wards and a single guard (some of whom aren't even trustworthy.)

Seriously, what was Tonks, Remus, or heaven forbid Dungwhathisname going to do if a couple death eaters dropped in on the front lawn at 1am, and cast fiendfire on the house?
