Fidelius... Though then he wouldn't have had much of a normal childhood, which was I guess one major point of leaving him with the Dursleys. If Voldemort had returned in secret when Harry was 5 his normal life at the Dursleys would have been over too though. Voldemort knew the muggle world, it shouldn't be a problem for him to snatch Harry away from school. Or did the blood protection protect him from that too? (I honestly wonder how it worked. Was it just the house or was it more that Harry was undetectable for Voldemort and his followers as long as he lived there? On one hand no Death Eater ever bothered him at school or when he was out with Petunia, but on the other hand there were wizards who recognized him when he was out shopping with his aunt)
