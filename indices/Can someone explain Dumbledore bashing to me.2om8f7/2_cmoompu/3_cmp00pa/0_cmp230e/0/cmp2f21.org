There is a difference between raising one child and being the headmaster of a few hundred... But anyway, I'm not saying that Dumbledore should have raised him, obviously there were reasons why he didn't, only that the situation wasn't "Dursleys or death" (at least until Voldemort returned) if Dumbledore believed in the prophecy.
