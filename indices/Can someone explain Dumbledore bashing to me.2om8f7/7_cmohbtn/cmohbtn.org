Dumbledore is setting Harry up to fail. First he sends him to the Dursleys, who abuses him for ten years. Yes, they abuse him. Abuse doesn't need to be violent or even physical.

Knowing that Harry /must/ confront Voldemort, Dumbledore then trains up Harry ... no, he doesn't. Harry receives most of his DADA training from a /Death Eater/! Two Death Eaters, actually.

And it all culminates with Harry having to sacrifice himself. It's a Rube Goldberg setup with a million possibilities of going wrong.

I see Dumbledore as an overly optimistic chess master playing with everyone as his pawns.
