Hang on... come back... I had something when I made my comment last week... I just somehow forgot about this debate until just now...

The biggest thing that I think got left to chance was that Harry turned out to be a good person. This isn't even necessarily predicated on his reacting badly to the abuse at home and going off the dark end...

- After all, he was raised by the same people who gave us Dudley... what if Harry turned out just like Dudley, or more likely Dudley's lieutenant in delinquency due to relative size. Snape would happily inform you that the Potter genes make this all too likely.

- Harry's solution to most problems in his early life was to run away from Dudley. Standing up for himself and fighting for whats right was no where in his early childhood curriculum. How/Why Harry went from that to solving mysteries and confronting Dark Lords is anyone's guess. Perhaps it was Gryffindor's reputation rubbing off on him?

- IIRC: Harry /chose/ Gryffindor to avoid Malfoy, I'm not sure we can say that was something Dumbledore had anything to do with that. If Malfoy had simply done nothing... Harry might have been wearing green and the whole ballgame changes. (or not, depending on the author)
