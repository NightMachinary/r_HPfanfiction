  Destroying horcruxes is not the same as buying a lottery ticket and again he was right it worked.

I think the problem with this argument is that Dumbledore's plan was heavily relying on various things happening that very well could have gone wrong. And in that case, everything would have been for naught.

Dumbledore was basically gambling with Harry's life. Yes, it did work as intended, giving Harry a Happy End. But Dumbledore could not have known that, thus he relied heavily on chance. Just like buying a lottery ticket. Of course, if you don't wind the lottery you have only lost a bit money. If Dumbledore's plan had failed, there would have been many deaths and Harry could have died so many times...

I think that's the main problem with the "but it worked" argument. It was a /huge/ risk and no one could have known beforehand that it would work...
