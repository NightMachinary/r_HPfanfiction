  and frankly Harry's life just isn't all that important when weighed against killing Voldemort.

But I think a lot of readers (and thus fanfiction writers?) want to identify with Harry and can't... in this particular aspect anyway. This is a kid who's been raised to die, and goes willingly to his death. Since (we?) don't have that same level of resigned acceptance that Harry does, we tend to lash out at the man who would be willing to put us in this situation. If I ever accidentally SI'd, the first thing I'd do is cross my fingers and check a mirror... hoping that I'm not Harry, but if I was, I'd spend as much time as I could trying to muck the whole bloody deck.

Granted, I'm not entirely convinced the British wizarding world didn't deserve what they would have gotten if Harry walked away...
