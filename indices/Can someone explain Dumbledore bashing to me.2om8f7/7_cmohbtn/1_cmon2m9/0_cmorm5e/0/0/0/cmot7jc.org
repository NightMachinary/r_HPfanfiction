  Dumbledore was basically gambling with Harry's life.
#+end_quote

Yes he was but at the end of the day Harry had to die/"die" to kill Voldemort so it was a necessary gamble.

  It was a huge risk and no one could have known beforehand that it would work...

There was no better option, it did work and frankly Harry's life just isn't all that important when weighed against killing Voldemort.
