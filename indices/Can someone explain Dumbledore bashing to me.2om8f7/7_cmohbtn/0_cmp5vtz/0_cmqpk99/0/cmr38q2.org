  Pretty sure that relying on the prophecy was what screwed over Voldemort in the first place.
#+end_quote

That doesn't sound right. Voldemort could have ignored the prophecy, but he chose to act on it and therefore gave it power over himself. However, he wasn't "relying" on it or "banking" on it in any meaningful way: Harry was just another obstacle that he had learned about and set out to eliminate. It wouldn't be his first, and it wouldn't be his last. Hypothetically, even if the prophecy had been a complete fiction, and if sacrificial protection weren't in effect, it would have caused him to waste an evening, not utterly destroy his plans.

Once the prophecy was in effect, however, /of course/ it was in Dumbledore's and Harry's interest to make Voldemort run up against it again and again and again.

  Surely one would learn from Voldemort's mistakes, and not bank everything on a one-trick pony that might not even exist.

Ah, but the pony exists, and it just trampled the scariest wizard alive like he was nothing. Be nice to the pony.

I've outlined above why I think that giving Harry extra combat training wouldn't have helped him against Voldemort. And, even a modest amount of it would have imposed a sort of a militaristic mindset that would have turned off the proverbial pony, because it would be implicitly accepting Voldemort's rules and moral framework (i.e., "There is no good or evil, only power and those too weak to seek it." [1]).
