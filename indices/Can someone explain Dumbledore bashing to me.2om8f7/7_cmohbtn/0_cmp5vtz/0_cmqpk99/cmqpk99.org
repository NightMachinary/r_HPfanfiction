  However, Harry has the Power That [Voldemort] Knows Not, the power that had protected him the first time around, stopping an unstoppable curse: self-sacrificing love. That's not something that can be "trained up". It can only be cultivated through friendships, relationships, teamwork, play, shared experiences, and all the other things that Harry actually does while at Hogwarts. Intensive training in violence would take away from all these things, so it would, in fact, cripple his capacity to defeat Voldemort.

Pretty sure that relying on the prophecy was what screwed over Voldemort in the first place. Surely one would learn from Voldemort's mistakes, and not bank /everything/ on a one-trick pony that might not even exist.
