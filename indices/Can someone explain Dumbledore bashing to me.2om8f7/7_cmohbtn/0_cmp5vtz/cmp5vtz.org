  Knowing that Harry must confront Voldemort, Dumbledore then trains up Harry ... no, he doesn't.
#+end_quote

What would be the point of that? Harry is not as talented at learning and doing general magic as Tom Riddle [1], nor as ruthless about applying it. Even if he were, Voldemort has several decades' head start. Clearly, Harry is not going to overcome Voldemort with force. A hypothetical Harry raised and trained to be a killing machine would face Voldemort in a pitched battle and lose.

However, Harry has the Power That [Voldemort] Knows Not, the power that had protected him the first time around, stopping an unstoppable curse: self-sacrificing love. That's not something that can be "trained up". It can only be /cultivated/ through friendships, relationships, teamwork, play, shared experiences, and all the other things that Harry actually does while at Hogwarts. Intensive training in violence would take away from all these things, so it would, in fact, /cripple/ his capacity to defeat Voldemort.

Harry's ultimate survival was, indeed, very much a Hail Mary pass. However, and especially with no better options, it's perfectly rational to make Hail Mary passes in a universe which has an actual, empirically verifiable St. Mary who has unambiguously interceded on your behalf in the past. (With apologies to any Catholics reading this.)

[1] Before anyone mentions Dursleys as crippling Harry's potential, remember that Riddle grew up in a British orphanage in the 30s: far from the most stimulating or nurturing of environments.
