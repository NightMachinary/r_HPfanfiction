  Probably could have kept a closer eye on him though.

For me, its this sort of issue that actually takes center stage on my list of reasons I think Dumbledore is... complicated. He's a terrible Headmaster during Harry's time there because his focus is on other things. Important things, but not things that a Headmaster of a school should be doing. I think that people are on Dumbledore's case a lot because we see him primarily in his capacity of the job he kinda lets fall by the way side in his preparations for the coming war.
