Dumbledore is the beacon of "deserves a second chance" for everyone, sparing snape, etc, but didn't once think to look into the matter of Sirius' innocence? At least get him on trial. A few drops of veritaserum or a few minutes of legilimancy and the matters solved.

Hell, if I was him, even if I was convinced Sirius was guilty, I'd at least want to talk to him once to know why he did it.
