Or - don't all Death Eaters in the inner circle know each other? Idea for Dumbledore: a conversation going something like this.

Dumbles: "Hey Snape, it's sort of weird, I never saw Sirius Black as a Death Eater. He ever come to any meetings?"

Snape: "Thankfully, no. I would have hexed him."

Dumbles: "He ever speak to the Dark Lord at all or express any sentiment that he might want to betray his surrogate brother to a borderline demonic terrorist?"

Snape: "I don't believe so. I saw Peter Pettigrew about once or twice though. Don't know why."

Dumbles: "Hmm. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but... I'll go have a word with Sirius next week and see what he has to say. It does seem a bit odd."
