Yeah because obviously Voldemort would risk exposing his Order of Phoenix spy to the other Death Eaters. In my opinion Voldemort was too paranoid for that. I think that Voldemort was aware of the risk spies represented and would keep the identity of his spy to himself. Also: whoever said that Snape was an inner circle member before Voldemort's first fall? He'd been just out of school and was not yet a member of the Order.
