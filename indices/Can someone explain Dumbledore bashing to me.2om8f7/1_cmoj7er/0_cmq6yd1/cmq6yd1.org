  In Order of the Phoenix where he basically ignored Harry
#+end_quote

Without using any knowledge that Dumbledore did not possess at the time, can you honestly think of an alternative?

He believed Voldemort might be legilimizing/possessing/etc Harry. If he said "sorry Harry I gotta ignore you this year but dont worry ily," Voldemort might've heard that too and it would ruin everything.
