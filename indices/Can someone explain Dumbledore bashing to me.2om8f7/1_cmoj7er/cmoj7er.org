His absolute failure to ensure that Sirius got a trial, with a few offhand remarks at a party he could have got the ball rolling. His placement of Harry at the Dursleys where he never once checked up on him, or rather what he said in HBP "I knew I was condemning you...." The whole chamber of secrets fiasco. In Order of the Phoenix where he basically ignored Harry, and allowed his PTSD to worsen (Though wizards are dumb they might not have known), still he never once helped Harry at all. In HPB he did a poor job of preparing Harry. And then in DH when he left them with basically nothing. Also keeping Snape as a teacher.

Now, I dont truly hate him those reasons I listed can be used for bashing him or humanizing him. His mistakes in judgement are often VERY magnified because of the importance that all of Wizarding Britain and the main characters give him, so when he messes up its a big deal. He could be really manipulative. I tend to believe that he is truly dedicated to the cause of the "light", but he is too willing to achieve his own ends, and his attitude tends to overrule others rather than take them into account.
