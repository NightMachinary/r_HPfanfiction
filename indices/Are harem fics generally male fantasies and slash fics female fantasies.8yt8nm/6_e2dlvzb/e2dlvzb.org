Actually, in the case of Harry Potter fanfiction, I prefer well-written harem stories over well-written slash stories. And even if it's slash, the only real pairings I like to read are Seamus/Harry, Theodore Nott/Harry, and the Weasley Twins/Harry. Drarry's okay, but Snarry or Harry with any other adult when he isn't is just revolting.

But I refuse to read harem fics in the PJO fandom and usually read slash there, so go figure.
