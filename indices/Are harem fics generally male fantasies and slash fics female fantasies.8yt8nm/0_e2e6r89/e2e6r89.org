I've rarely come across a harem fic that doesn't have a ton of smut, and while some slash is smut, there's a decent amount that isn't.

Harem fics are usually focused on the dude getting attention from all the female characters the author desires, so yeah, it's a male fantasy. Harem fics also go hand in hand with the male character being overpowered.

Slash (M/M) fics can be female fantasies in the same way romance novels are female fantasies; they're focused on the emotional development of the main characters.
