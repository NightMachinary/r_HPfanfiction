I am a woman and the older I get the less slash I read. I honestly think it's because my rl sex life has improved a lot and I can now imagine that heterosexual sex feels good. But I still like slash.

There was not a moment in time I ever liked threesomes or group sex or harems. It's kind of annoying to me, I do not care too much about smut in general and if there are mire than two people smut quickly loses the obe aspect of it that I like - intimacy. For me it's all about slooooooooow developments and feelings between two people, that change them deeply.
