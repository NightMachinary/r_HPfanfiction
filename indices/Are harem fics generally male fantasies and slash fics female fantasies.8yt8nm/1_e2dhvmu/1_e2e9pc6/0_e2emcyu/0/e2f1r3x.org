Seems like each of us is talking from our own experience without any kind of statistically significant data to back up our opinions.

However, I /would/ note that per the recent survey, people who prefer non-Harry centric fics are just 8.1% of the fandom (whereas slash readers constitute 40.8%), so on that basis you might want to reconsider the idea that you can speak with authority for the "slash community" not caring much about Harry.
