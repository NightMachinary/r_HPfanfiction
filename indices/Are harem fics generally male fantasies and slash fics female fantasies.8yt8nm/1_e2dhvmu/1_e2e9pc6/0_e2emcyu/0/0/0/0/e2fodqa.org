  You seem to be heavily involved in a relatively niche community and interpreting that niche as mainstream, while simultaneously dismissing the majority of the fandom as "minor".

Taure, this statement could equally be applied to you. And since we are specifically talking about slash fandom, your experience is less relevant. 40% of this sub may read slash, but I guarantee you that most of them don't use /this/ sub to find slash recs, since on the whole it /is/ pretty unfriendly to slash.

  If you read my original post, you'll see that I continually qualified my statements to make it clear I wasn't speaking about all women, just a significant trend that I have noticed. Pointing out outliers doesn't really say anything about the trend. I understand that there are fics that buck the trend, but no one was ever claiming a universal truth.

This is disingenuous. You are claiming a generalization, and discounting counter-evidence on the basis that it's obviously just "outliers".  You can use that strategy to justify anything.

I have been involved with slash fandoms (a lot more than just HP) for years now, and I have to say my experience mirrors beta_reader's a lot more than it supports your theory.

The truth is this is a very complex and sensitive issue. There's no reason to assume there's just /one/ major reason why people read slash, other than the fact that it exists.
