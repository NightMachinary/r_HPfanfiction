  What survey is that? I appear to have missed it.

As for the rest - again, this is all just you speaking from experience. There's no real information for either of us to go on.

But as I said above, 40% of this sub read slash fic, so I wouldn't really call it "distinctly anti-slash". I suspect this is the classic response to a diverse community by someone who is used to a homogeneous one: diversity of opinion is interpreted as bias against that person's favoured position. People who are into indy!Harry fics probably also think this sub is anti-indy!Harry, because there are frequently posts deriding that genre. But there are an equal number of posts by people looking for indy!Harry fics.

  And simply by existing, they contradict your verdict that 'this is why female readers like slash.'

If you read my original post, you'll see that I continually qualified my statements to make it clear I wasn't speaking about all women, just a significant trend that I have noticed. Pointing out outliers doesn't really say anything about the trend. I understand that there are fics that buck the trend, but no one was ever claiming a universal truth.

  know a lot of slashers who feel similarly. They don't come here - I only stumbled upon this subreddit a couple of years ago, when I was web-surfing from boredom - and it's a late, minor addition to my fannish pursuits. So my friends and favorite writers are probably, for the most part, off this sub's radar. But I assure you they exist and have created a fairly large body of fanwork that follows different patterns than you see reproduced here.

I think this is telling. This sub, though a late addition to the fandom, is now by far the largest and most active HP fanfiction community in the fandom. You seem to be heavily involved in a relatively niche community and interpreting that niche as mainstream, while simultaneously dismissing the majority of the fandom as "minor".
