What survey is that? I appear to have missed it.

And I don't speak with authority for the slash community, which is far, far larger than the HP portion of it, although many HP fans have since wandered off to slash other canons and characters. I openly referenced my own experience and my own circles from the last 12 years of participating primarily through journal platforms and fic archives, which at least constitute an active experience of slash fandom, as against your theorizing, which seems to be mostly informed by hearsay and casual polling. Neither of us can claim (why would we?) that we're defining slash fandom, but I'm not sure I see where you find the confidence to draw sweeping conclusions on the basis of this subreddit, which is distinctly anti-slash and very Harry-centric.

For the record, I assume that if you lumped het and slash fandom together and took a vote, Harry would still emerge as the most popular character. The thing is, while I love Harry, I have limited and very specific interests when it comes to reading or writing fic about him. There are other characters I'd rather explore more. And as I said, I know a lot of slashers who feel similarly. They don't come here - I only stumbled upon this subreddit a couple of years ago, when I was web-surfing from boredom - and it's a late, minor addition to my fannish pursuits. So my friends and favorite writers are probably, for the most part, off this sub's radar. But I assure you they exist and have created a fairly large body of fanwork that follows different patterns than you see reproduced here. And simply by existing, they contradict your verdict that 'this is why female readers like slash.' (Personally, I don't give a flying fuck why women read and write slash, and in my experience the question is usually accompanied by the attitude that we need to justify our tastes to the questioner. Been there, done that, have zero patience for the assumptions of people who can't stop interrogating women's erotic and creative self-expression.)
