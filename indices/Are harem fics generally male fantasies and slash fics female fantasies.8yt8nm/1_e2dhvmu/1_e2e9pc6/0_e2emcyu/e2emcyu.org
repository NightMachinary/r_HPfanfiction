Actually, you've got a lot of that wrong, as far as my acquaintance with other slashers is concerned. I ship Snape with a dozen other characters; I ship Harry with Snape for the intensity and dysfunctional relationship and don't really care about him otherwise. He's not my favorite. I don't project onto Snape /or/ Harry. And I'm a woman who's more attracted to women than to men in real life. Fanfiction, even smut fic, doesn't necessarily correlate to real-life orientations or desires.

Also, even though I don't read much Harry fic outside of Snape/Harry, I'm well aware of Harry/Draco, and in that instance Harry is hardly ever coded as the more "feminine" (and for the record, I hate using these terms to describe behaviors in men because they imply that graceful, flamboyant, pretty men aren't 'real' men, which is bullshit). In Drarry, Draco is usually the one who gets the slim, fashionable, graceful treatment, and Harry is stolid, strong, and clueless. Neither of which is in-character, to say the least.

In fact, I hang out with a lot of slashers who don't really care about Harry at all. This sub tends to focus almost to excess on Harry, and there's a lot of confessed identification with him, but most of the slash readers and writers I know are a lot more various and versatile. There are plenty of Harry fans, of course, but there are even more fans of - well, you name it. In HP, slash writers ship everyone.

So I don't know what this 'vast majority' is that you describe here. Teenagers on Wattpad? I don't go there, so I wouldn't know. And frankly, the graceful, svelte, slim, etc. stuff gets applied to women in fanfic as well, even though it has nothing to do with their canon selves. Throw in busty, curvaceous, whatever, for the harem fic writers appealing to the male libido. But I think you're better off not trying to speak for the majority of slash fics, especially since you don't write slash and probably don't read much, either.
