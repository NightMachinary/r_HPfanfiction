  EDIT: As a guy, I can understand the appeal of harem (not that I want to have one because of its messy politics), but I'd like to hear from the female side why it's so appealing for them to read about two guys shagging each other.

I think ultimately it isn't about the slash, which is purely incidental.

The situation is this: the straight female reader is projecting onto Harry, the main character, as readers tend to do. This reader is attracted to men, and so they like to read Harry who is attracted to men also, because readers who project onto the main character (rather than merely empathise with them) prefer to read that character paired with someone who they themselves find attractive.

So a lot of female readers like slash for the same reason why a lot of male readers like Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks - they want to read Harry, as the reader's proxy, getting together with the target of the reader's own affections.

You can also see this identification between the female reader and Harry in that the vast majority of slash fics will have Harry behave and be described in a more "feminine" manner, even outside of the romantic relationship. For example: they commonly use adjectives which are generally associated with women to describe Harry: graceful, svelte, slim, etc; they commonly make Harry physically much smaller than his partner; they will have Harry interact with his (male) friends in a more physical, touchy-feely manner. And, quite depressingly, they will generally make Harry emotionally weak, which is an unfortunate thing for people to associate with femininity.
