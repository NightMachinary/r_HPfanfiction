I agree.

I also think that m/m slash is a way for women to avoid all the power dynamics and politics that are inherent to being a woman in the real world. You don't have to worry about how the female character is treated by the narrative if there isn't one involved in the pairing.

Men don't generally have that problem, so we get harem fics and m/f porn instead.
