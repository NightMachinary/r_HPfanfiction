99% of the time, it's related to some degree to internalized misogyny. Female characters that everyone like and who are frighteningly capable are treated like fake Mary Sues. The amount of shame both external and internalized is intense, especially on teen girls and young women.

Writing slash for these female folks is like comfort food. The guys can both be amazing without anyone contesting it and there are already thousands of cool, interesting male characters to choose from. They are seen as people in dynamic and interesting ways because they tend to have both positive and negative characteristics.

So it's easier. And when you're female and spend a lot of time hating your own weird body and feeling awkward about being sexually objectified irl by gross people even when you're still like 12-13 and onward, there is literally no worry of feeling like you have to sidetrack your enjoyment of the characters having romance or sex because you are reminded of your own insecurities.

There are, of course, a lot of people who use M/M slash because they themselves have unresolved gender dysphoria and are just starting to become aware of it.

Men, on the other hand are encouraged to participate in all of their fantasies. Hence the harem story.

Despite being female, I, personally, am not a huge fan of slash. And a lot of the slash that's out there is quite a lot closer to “softly lit romance scenes without explicit sex” than the hardcore stuff most people imagine when the word slash is used. But then again, that's because I just kinda ignore the people who say that my female characters can't be cool and awesome and write what I want anyway.
