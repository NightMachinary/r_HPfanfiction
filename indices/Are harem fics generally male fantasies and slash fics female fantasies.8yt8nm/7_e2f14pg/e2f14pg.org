I am bisexual male but I do neither enjoy Harem nor Slash. I dont enjoy reading romance at all. Sometimes a lemon can be fun, but people go all crazy with soulbonds and eternal one true love. I want to vomit when stuff like that comes up. A quick shag before going to war. Thats nice. The rest sucks.
