Eh, in a lot of fandom circles, f/f fans prefer the term femslash because we don't want to disappear from the conversation and we need to be able to find the fic and the fests and the discussions. M/m and m/f far outstrip f/f in numbers of fanworks, so femslashers need to stake their claim or we'll never find each other.
