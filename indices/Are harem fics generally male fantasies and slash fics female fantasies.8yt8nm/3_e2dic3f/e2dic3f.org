Does slash just mean m/m? Cuz my understanding of the term is that it was just same-sex pairings. In which case, it's significantly less of a female-dominated fantasy. I'm pretty sure it's a generally male thing that girl on girl is hot.

I, being a guy, don't really like harem stuff either, so maybe I'm weird one. Dunno. Even in smut I find it annoying. I can understand the appeal on a basic level(More women good. Caveman like.), but I would prefer fewer characters with more depth over 36 women that are basically just physical descriptions.
