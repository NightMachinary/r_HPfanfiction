Warcraft universe comes to my mind in that regard. Any warlock or death knight could just kill Voldemort and destroy his horcruxes by using soul-sucking magic... Could be fun to see Voldemort striking a deal with an Old God or the Burning Legion tho.

Dark Souls maybe too. What can you do against a warrior who just can't die ? You can murder him a thousand time, he'll just come back to fight again. Voldemort might want to get cursed as well for it does grant true immortality.
