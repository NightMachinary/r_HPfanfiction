I've not read many /Percy Jackson/ crossovers. Of the one I have read, one had Percy thrown through time to the Triwizard Tournament(but Harry was just a normal wizard, not a demigod IIRC, and I haven't gone back to read it since it was updated), and one where he's a demigod, but not the son of the Big 3(Zeus, Hades, Poseidon), but the son of the spoilers:goddess Tyche

These are the ones I've read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter][/Harry Potter, Squatter/ by Enterprise1701-D]](note: this fanfic is exceptionally fluffy and not to be taken seriously).
