"The Champion Reading I" by Azaelia Silmarwen fits the criteria. It was purged from fanfiction.net but can still be read on fictionhunt: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6813765/1]]

Haven't actually read it. Only have it bookmarked from when I was going through a 'Reading the Books' fic phase, so I can't vouch for the quality.
