I mean I undrstand i Sirius is punished by the school in some way and especially his friends.

But all this rubbish about it being murder is just stupid. Sure Snape calls it that, but the facts are different here.

If someone tells you were the keys to the lion cage are andyou steal them and open them. It's your dumb fault. Sure that other person should get in trouble, because he should tell such secrets, but it is reckless endangerment at worst.

Now the funny thing about the situation is, that in a legal way those you get in trouble would, of couse be, Remus (even if it is unfair because he did everything he could to keep people save, but the decks is set against him), and then Snape and ironically James, because they broke knowingly through the savety measurements of a werewolf lair and that sounds like a crime to me, if for no other reason because they could endanger other people aside from themselves.

Of all people on the list Sirius would be the last to facelegal consequences.
