But he did expect Lupin to be a werewolf, a theory he held for so long that his best friend Lily, got annoyed at just mentioning it.

So Snape knew or at least expected that he was walking into a werewolf lair. Now you could argue that he maybe expected some more security measures, but that is it.

Now of course Sirius lawyer had to argue that Snape was aware of the danger his choice to go there would pose and that is where Lily would come in. The question would be if she would be honest enough to say that yes Snape had annoyed her with that theory before or if she was spiteful enough to keep quiet and be part of a misjudgment and could put Sirius behind bars and Remus' life on the line. I think she would hate it but give a truthful account.

So it wouldn't be murder, but reckless endangerment that leaded to death.
