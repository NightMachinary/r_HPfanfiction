That's manslaughter though. Death wasn't the goal but a likely outcome Sirius knew.

Either way, I think due to his minor status, he would at best receive a slap in the wrist, considering there doesn't seem to be a system in place to re-educate criminally-inclined youth. We know three underage cases: Newt, Hagrid and Harry. Harry's was bogus so I'll ignore it. Newt's case was also reckless endangerment, if I remember right, and that only led to expulsion. Hagrid's was manslaughter of Mrytle. His wand was broken and wand rights taken from him, which is serious but neither reformative nor an equivalent of a prison sentence.

So, I think, this all discussion is pointless. But fun.
