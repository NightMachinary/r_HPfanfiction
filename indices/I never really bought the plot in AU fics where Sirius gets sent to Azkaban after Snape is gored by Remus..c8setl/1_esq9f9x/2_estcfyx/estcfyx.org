It doesn't work that way. If Snape died, Sirius would have been guilty of manslaughter. Snape didn't know Lupin was a werewolf. He thought he was sneaking after another school boy. The fact that he was out of bounds and there by choice, does not change the fact that Sirius knowingly set him up there. That charge could, if handled right by the accuser standards, even go up as far as first degree murder if the lawyer convinces the jury a werewolf is a mindless beast and as a human of no apparent mental health issues, Sirius must be hold accountable for the werewolf's actions.

Tldr; Snape was a fool but that doesn't absolve Sirius of his guilt.
