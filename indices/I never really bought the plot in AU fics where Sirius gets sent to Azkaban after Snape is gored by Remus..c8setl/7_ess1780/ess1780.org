I've never seen a single fic where Sirius gets sent to Azkaban over that. He wouldn't, if only because he's a heir to a rich pureblood family, and Snape is a poor halfblood with nobody to stand up for him in the wizarding world. Remus would be screwed, though.

That's said, yes, it's definitely a murder attempt, and I'm appaled that people justify it just because they don't like the victim. Maybe if Sirius was punished for that, he would learn something about consequences and started to think before he acts.
