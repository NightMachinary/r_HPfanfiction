Sirius only told Snape how to get past the Whipping Willow from what I remember, the rest is all on Snape. Had Remus gored Snape, it's Remus who would have been expelled ans sent to Azkaban (if not executed ). As for Sirius, he would have lost all his friends (doubt any would have forgiven him for Killing Remus ), would probably be expelled (if not for this event, Dumbledore would probably have found an excuse like past transgression or any mistake he would do in the futur ). There is also a pretty big chance for him to not be invited (and/or accepted ) in the Order.

But Azkaban is unlikely. No matter the intent, he only told him how to open a Secret passage. The responsability for the rest would fall on Remus for being there, on Snape for going near him and on Dumbledore for letting a werewolf near students.
