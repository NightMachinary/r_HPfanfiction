Nah, real world he would definitely be on the hook for it. The question is simply: as a matter of fact, did Sirius' actions cause Snape's death? And then a second question: as a matter of fact, did Sirius intend to cause Snape serious harm?

The answer to both of these questions would seem to be "yes", and I suspect a prosecutor could establish as much to a jury's satisfaction. You bring evidence of the antagonistic history between Snape and Sirius. You establish that Sirius knew that a werewolf was the other side of the passage. You establish that Sirius knew that Snape was curious about what was the other end of the passage and suspicious of Remus' disappearances. And then you prove that Sirius, on a full moon, told Snape how to get through the passage.

If you show those things, Sirius is definitely going down for something. If not murder, then attempted murder.

As for how you prove them, the same way you prove most things in court: witness evidence. One suspects that Lily's evidence would be key, as she was Snape's BFF at this time.
