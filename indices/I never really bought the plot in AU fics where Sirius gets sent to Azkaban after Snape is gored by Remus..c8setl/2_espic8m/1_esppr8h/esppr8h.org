That always line with a doe patronus that matches James stag patronus, and confirms Snape as gay? Yeah half this fandom tend to forget Snape is a bastard and a bully. I mean, Harry and Co dont know how to destroy horcruxes, and snape puts the sword on the bottom of a frozen over lake. Wtf is wrong with him? Why not just plant it in the dirt? Putting it on the bottom on a frozen lake in the middle of winter when it cant be summoned is just so spiteful..
