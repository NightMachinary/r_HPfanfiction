Lol, imagine magic world politics being as shit as modern politics. Slytherin students playing the victim and claiming Griffindor clothes are triggering and fear-spreading and evil. And also saying it's ok to do dark magic because morality is subjective because Voldemort probably thought he was the good guy at one point. Hufflepuff teaching their kids feelings trump facts while Ravenclaw teaches their kids science is repeating what the established books say, repeating it for brownie points, and insulting those who don't believe what the books say.

I can't think of anything funny for the Griffindor students. Maybe they'd be the guys who get called privileged bullies by Slytherins because projection.
