The best idea for the "Turns out old family wizards are too inbred, they need to shag muggleborn wizards or their kids will have no magic" is to drop the fucking trope.

Drop it. I'm sick of reading fics where authors yap about wizards being inbred. Like seriously, every other fic has to have at least four or five instances of this shit. In canon, we see a grand total of one family that is inbred - just the Gaunts. Nobody else has any problems whatsoever. Don't say Crabbe and Goyle either - being a bit dim is not a sign of being inbred.

Also, insulting a teenager's family is very likely to get you punched in the face. So, if Harry, Hermione, or anyone else starts yapping about "inbred purebloods" where other self-respecting purebloods can hear them, they are likely to get punched in the face.
