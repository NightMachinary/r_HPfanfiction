This is true. It's uncommon in the West, but extremely common in the East and not everyone is mentally or physically challenged. I'd argue that it's very rare cases that turn out that way. Both Narcissa and Andromeda are physically and mentally functioning perfectly too. Bellatrix too is of sound body and mind. Her craziness seems to be an inherited trait rather than a genetic insufficiency.

Incest should mean marrying your own brothers or sisters (from the same parent). That is what is frowned upon. But if you keep marrying exclusively within very close families (like first cousins) it can lead to problems that won't manifest until ONLY centuries later.
