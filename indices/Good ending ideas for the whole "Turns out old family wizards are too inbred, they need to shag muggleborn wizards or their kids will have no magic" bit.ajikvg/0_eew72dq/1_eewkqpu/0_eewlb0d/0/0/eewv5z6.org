I'm not sure on the extremely common part. I'm from India, and there used to be a rather strange inheritance law in my area that had a man's wealth and property be inherited by his nephews. This inheritance law did obviously encouraged marriage between first cousins, although I can't remember the last time it was practiced in my family - my great-grandfathers married outside the family, as did everyone who followed.

I also personally know a few people who were born out of unions between first cousins, again due to the old law.

In any case, none of us are inbred.

  I'd argue that it's very rare cases that turn out that way (Bellatrix, for example)

I just thought Bellatrix was fanatically loyal towards Voldemort. When she's interacting with people who acknowledge his supremacy, she acts more or less normal, like in the first chapter of HBP.
