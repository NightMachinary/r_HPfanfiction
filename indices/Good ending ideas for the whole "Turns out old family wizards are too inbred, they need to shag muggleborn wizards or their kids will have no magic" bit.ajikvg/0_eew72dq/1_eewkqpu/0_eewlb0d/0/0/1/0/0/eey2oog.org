I just saw the family tree for like ten seconds and one thing stood out to me. Philip IV married his wife and also his wife's daughter from another father (who is also his cousin)(!) That was what resulted in the genetic deficiencies in Charles IV. I assume the others in the family, though inbred, are relatively fine (keyword being 'relatively'). But Charles IV is the exceptional case because of too many loops in his lineage.
