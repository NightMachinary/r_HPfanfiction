  I just thought Bellatrix was fanatically loyal towards Voldemort.

Edited my point to word it better. Yes she is fanatically loyal. That's what I mean too. Fanaticism of pureblood supremacy runs in her family after all (Walburga).

And regarding the other point, maybe you misunderstood. I am agreeing that marrying your first-cousin won't lead to inbreeding. Maybe if it's done continuously for generations, it might have some effect.
