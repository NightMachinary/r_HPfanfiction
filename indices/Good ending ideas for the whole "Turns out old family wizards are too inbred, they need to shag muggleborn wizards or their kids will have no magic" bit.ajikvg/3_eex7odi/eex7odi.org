Genetic engineering/homunculus creation/surrogacy programs are put in place by a company.

Basically, sperm or eggs are duplicated, fertilized and implanted into the pureblood wife who then bears the child to term. The child is a blind fertilisation, meaning that no-one but the implanting doctor knows which pureblood parent happens to be the true biological parent. Two children or more would ensure that both parts of the couple are the parents of at least one of the children, who can then be blissfully unaware that they're technically half-bloods.

The muggleborn donating their genetic material are adequately compensated and don't have any contact with or commitment towards the child outside of an emergency. They are free to continue their own lives whilst enjoying the windfall of their participation.

Everyone wins.
