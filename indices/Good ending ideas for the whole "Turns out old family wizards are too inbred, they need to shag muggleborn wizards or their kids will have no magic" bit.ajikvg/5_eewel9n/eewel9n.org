None. If it got so bad to the point where almost all families are related, then absolutely you need new blood into the culture.

It doesn't have to be muggleborns, tho. I'll concede that. Pushing for policies that incentivate for foreigner families to come to the British wizarding world would also be a solution. Plenty of people in European countries aren't entirely opposing to moving to another country since they are so close together.
