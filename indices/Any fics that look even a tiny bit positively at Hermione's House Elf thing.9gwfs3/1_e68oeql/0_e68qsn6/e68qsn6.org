You know what I'd love to see? A fic where Minister Hermione manages to push through a law giving house-elves full citizenship including the right to vote. She proceeds to lose the next election to an ultra-conservative backed by a huge house-elf vote. They adore his promises to abolish holidays, scrap the minimum wage, and re-introduce corporal punishment to Hogwarts.

Lesson of the day: if you grant the vote to a population with vastly different cultural values to your own, your culture is going to change.
