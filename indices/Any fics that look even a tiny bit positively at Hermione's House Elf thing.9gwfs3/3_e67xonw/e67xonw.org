linkffn(Harry Potter and Fifth Element) - They have a bunch of elves learning to read and whatnot.

You'll probably find that most H/Hr are either mugglewanks or closeted animal/creature/beings-rights activists, with a few exceptions.

Not that I find it wrong to treat them right, I just don't care to read about it on a fucking fanfic that won't change a single thing, I'd rather have a plot than all 300000 rules of what you should and shouldn't do with elves and other creatures from Hermione's PoV, considering I do dislike her immensely.
