My /The Parselmouth of Gryffindor/ and Alma Lannister's /The Fight for Rights/ are both about crusades for nonhuman rights in general, though neither is focused on Elves. Might interest you.

White Squirrel is also in favor, and the /Animagus/ series (can't remember if it's already in /Accidental Animagus/ or started in /Animagus at War/) features a delightful free!Dobby.
