Well...in the first war against Voldemort, he and his followers made widespread use of the Imperius curse. Voldemort himself before the war made use of False Memory Charms to frame other people for the murders he committed (Morfin Gaunt and Hokey to name known victims).\\
With that in mind, it'd be very difficult to achieve a safe conviction of any Death Eater, even those caught in the act, simply because it'd be virtually impossible to prove that someone wasn't under the Imperius.\\

Though, in canon, Barty Crouch senior did authorise the Aurors to use Unforgivable Curses against suspects, and he did send Sirius to Azkaban without a trial (and the Lestranges with basically a show trial); in the latter cases, with Voldemort seemingly destroyed, the Imperius defense wouldn't hold much water (after all, who else would cast it?).
