I've wondered about this one myself; given that the Aurors were introduced in that same book, wouldn't it have been more logical for Fudge to use an Auror or similarly trained wizard as his bodyguard rather than a Dementor?\\
For that matter, what obligation did he have to come and see Barty Crouch Jr. for himself, in lieu of sending an Auror representative?\\
 \\
I think, last time I thought about this, I reached the conclusion that Fudge's decision to bring a dementor with him was a continuation of the kiss-on-sight order on Sirius Black; the last time a Death Eater (or alleged Death Eater, that is, Sirius) was apprehended in Hogwarts, despite only being left unattended for a couple of minutes, he escaped before he could be subjected to the Kiss.\\
Thus, acting on the assumption that the captured Death Eater might be Sirius again, Fudge brought a dementor with him so that the Kiss could summarily be issued if it was Black. Of course, it wasn't Black, and the dementor jumped the gun on things.
