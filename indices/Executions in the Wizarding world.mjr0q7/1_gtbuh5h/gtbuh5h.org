Yes. In many places of the world, there is no death penalty. Apparently, the wizarding world is one of them.

Here's what you should have asked, though (or maybe meant, and didn't clarify): Why didn't the Death Eaters get the Dementor's Kiss?

And the answer to that is that it appears the Kiss is limited to escapees from Azkaban, since Azkaban is considered unbreakable, and no one imagined people would ever return from there.
