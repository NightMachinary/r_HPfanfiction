It's a thing they found which they aren't entirely sure what is or how it came to be. A Mystery, as it were.

The Veil wasn't deliberately built as some sort of magical guillotine though, if that's what you're asking. Or if it was, it was long enough ago that nobody remembers. It's believed to be (but not proven to be) a portal to Death, thus the Veil, i.e. between the living and dead. The one part they're mostly sure about is that it's a one-way door to "don't know, but nothing we've sent through has come back, even the really persistently unpleasant stuff."

It's managed by Unspeakables, not Aurors, which I gather is only a bit of researching hidden truths and more of Magical SCP whose main job is to keep shit nobody understands bottled up as securely as possible so that it doesn't destroy reality or spontaneously render the Statute of Secrecy moot.

From context, I'd assume the Veil is used for executions either when the prisoner can demand a more dignified death due to social status than is implied by a ghoul sucking your soul out and slowly digesting it Sarlacc style, or else as a method of dealing with cases which have gone excessively SCP shaped that they have reason to believe "feed it to a dementor" is no longer sufficient to make whatever it is die properly and stay that way.

As far as noble / rich / well-connected prisoners being executed goes, I'd also assume "sentence them to a Dementor's Kiss, then act surprised when it doesn't happen because the prisoner has taken poison / gotten a hold of their wand then eaten it / died quietly of a sudden heart attack no one questions despite it being easy to induce artificially" is a thing that comes up as often in wizard culture as it has historically in non-magical culture.
