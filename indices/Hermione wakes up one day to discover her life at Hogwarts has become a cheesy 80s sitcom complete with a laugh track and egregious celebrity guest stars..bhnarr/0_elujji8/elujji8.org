/Saved by the Spell/

Hermione is very concerned when she wakes up one morning and looks in the mirror to discover she now looks exactly like Jessie Spano. She goes downstairs to discover that Harry looks like Zach Morris, Ron lik AC Slater, Ginny like Kelly Kapowski, and Neville like Screech. No one else notices anything has changed.

There's also a strange, new set of occurrences where everyone will freeze and Harry will start speaking to someone that no one else can see. Nobody notices this except Hermione.

It's also a very special +episode+ day, and everyone is acting like Hermione has been abusing Pepper Up Potions. They then start acting weird when she doesn't follow "The Script."
