Well, not his /own/ government, but he does basically overthrow the Wizengamot in /Long Live the Queen/. As an added bonus, this fanfic includes one of my favorite depictions of Percy Weasley.

Oh, and as an aside, I think the correct kind of flair for this topic is "Request". I'm pretty sure "Recommendation" is for sharing a fanfic you want to recommend.
