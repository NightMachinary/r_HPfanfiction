I reckon she doesn't care what the truth is. Like, she asks Harry where Sirius is hiding. If the Ministery is looking for Sirius because they believe him to be a Death Eater, then why woulld she believe that Harry of all people would know his whereabouts? I reckon she doesn't /really/ believe that Harry is lying, but is going along with that narrative for her own benefit.

While I don't think she'd try to convince herself that Harry was lying, I'm sure she would find a way to convince Fudge that he was, or else just not tell him everything Harry had said under the Veritiserum's influence. After all, what Fudge doesn't know, can't hurt him.
