I read a fic where that happened. When he didn't recant she was like "oh fuck."

There was also some stuff about how the horcux in his head let him subconsciously access the thoughts and memories of voldemort and when he was asked questions under veritaserum he would answer with the truth, regardless of whether he consciously knew it or not - so, you know, direct line to everything voldemort is doing and wants to hide.
