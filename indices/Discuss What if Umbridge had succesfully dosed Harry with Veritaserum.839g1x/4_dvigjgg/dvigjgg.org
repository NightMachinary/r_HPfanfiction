I think it depends on what questions she asks Harry. Also I imagine that is part of the reason the propaganda that called Harry crazy was spread. Since truth is subjective it means that veritaserum is just an aid; if you give truth potion to someone who believes the world is flat, they will still tell you the world is flat. For tho reason I think they wpuld not want people to think Harry was anything but delusional.
