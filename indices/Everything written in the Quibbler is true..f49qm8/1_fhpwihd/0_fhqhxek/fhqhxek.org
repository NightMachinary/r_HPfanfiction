Yes, although they're wrong about the Crumple Horned Snorkack. I mean, it's obviously a magical strain of brontothere, and at that size it's clearly not a an arctic or subarctic species - Bergmann's Rule tells us that the larger species are found in colder climates, and the Crumple Horned Snorcack is /small/ - and frankly it's probably an example of island dwarfism to boot.

They're being misled because the type specimen was found in the First Mate's cabin of a tramp steamer in Malm√∂, so they're hunting all over Scandinavia, but who knows where that vessel had been previously? They'd have better luck hunting on tropical islands, frankly.
