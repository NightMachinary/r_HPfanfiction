Which fic are you talking about? There was one I read not too long ago (no idea which one at this point) where it's pointed out that everything in The Quibbler is basically written in code. So that part about gum disease taking down the ministry from the inside is actually referencing death eaters - because eating Death is probably not good for your oral hygiene. I wish I knew which one it was.

This was really just a bit of a throwaway in the fic, but it there were a couple of examples given and then Hermione asked for a copy of the last few years of The Quibbler so that she could catch up on their style of commentary.
