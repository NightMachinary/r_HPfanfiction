I don't know about nargles. But it's not out of the realm of possibility that there are a lot of animals that haven't been discovered or have been discovered and through time, been forgotten. I mean think about it, on the non-magical world there are species that are considered extinct even though there are reports of their sightings and some scientists even have rediscovered some of them, and that's with non-magicals outnumbering magicals by at least 7 billions of people. So imagine that there are parts of the world that haven't been visited by any magicals and muggles, and there is a high chance that there are numerous species there that are living their lives, going unnoticed by humans. I mean not all magicals can see thestrals so the existence of some creatures that you have to have certain qualities to see them is not unthinkable. What do you think?

Btw the part about a guy finding animals that were thought extinct is about Forrest Galante whom I saw on the Joe Rogan Podcast. I do recommend watching it. It's very interesting.
