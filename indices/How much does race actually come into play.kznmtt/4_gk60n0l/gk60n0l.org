The muggle raised would have racists.

I would love a fic where they all have different prejudices and they're all indignant and call each other barbaric and crazy.

Black pureblood: “you hate me because I'm black? It must be because you're a mudblood”

And etc. They only think the prejudices are wrong when it's directed towards them.
