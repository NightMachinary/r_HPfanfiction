There is nothing much in the canon. JKR is very liberal lady, so the fact that (at least) Angelina Johnson and Dean Thomas are black (not mentioning at least Patils being Indian) doesn't even register in the story. I guess, the author of fanfiction can do anything they like with the race issue. I always thought that Dean Thomas (and Hermione, who is of Jewish ancestry in my headcanon) understood really fast when they are told about the pureblood racism (and it is the reason why Hermione is so devastated by the Draco slander of mudbloods).
