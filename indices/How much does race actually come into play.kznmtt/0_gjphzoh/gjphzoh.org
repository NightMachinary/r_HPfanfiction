I can't remember any racial insults other than one from Pansy Parkinson:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway?' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. ‘Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head?'

  Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, ‘Spread out, then, and let's see what we can do ...'

-HP & the OotP, ch 14.

Then again, Pansy is nothing more than a one-dimensional representation of JKR's bullies at school (the 'anti-Hermione'). So I'm not sure if this can be attributed to the rest of the stuck-up pure-bloods.
