IMO, I think that the British wizarding world is more prejudice against blood status than anything else. It's nitpicking, but I get annoyed when fanfic authors say the purebloods are racist. Racism is based on physical attributes. Granted, words change all the time, but I think “xenophobia” is the closest word (prejudice against foreigners) we have. While muggleborns aren't necesarrily foreigners, they are outsiders entering a new world.

The Patil sisters are listed as pureblood or half blood and the Shafiqs (Arabic etymology) are a sacred 28 family. The Shacklebolts are too, but there's no evidence that they were always black. For all we know Kingsley might be mixed or at least one of his grandparents were white (i.e., his dad is biracial and married a black woman).

That being said, I think there would definitely be a classist view on different cultural magic in wizarding Britain. For example, I really, really doubt that parselmouths would be considered evil across the world. The obvious example is India, but there are even Appalachian churches that worship with snakes (its super interesting, like an old school aspect of Christianity. Look it up). They also speak in tongues when they get really hyped up so that is perfect for a parselmouth character IMO. For you non-Americans, the Appalachian mountains are where you get your typical hillbilly or redneck stereotype. So pretty much as white as you can get. (Except for the food because we season our food around here.)

It's my headcanon that rituals and runic magic were used commonly before wands and Latin-based spells became popular, so some people might look at those types of communities as stagnant or stupid. Except for maybe the purebloods, because (remember this is only my headcanon) they have rituals recorded from their family histories and know how powerful they can be. I mean Voldemort got an entire body out of a ritual. What else can they do?

And look at modern Roma witchcraft. Hermione absolutely hated divination and thought it was silly, but there are famous witches today in Romania that have a huge following. In the HP world, I'm sure that kind of pagan-ish magic they do there today IRL would absolutely influence the magic in canon.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there are many transfer students or immigrants in Hogwarts. Everyone seems to be British so I don't know if these sorts of cultural magical prejudices would really be prominent compared to the bigotry against muggleborns. That being said, I think a character along those lines would be interesting to explore. But then again I'm a sucker for reading about magic in fanfics. One of my favorite things to think about is Tom Riddle's research expedition across the globe. I'm a librarian so the thought of all that hands on research gives me a boner.

If anyone's bored enough, here's a pseudo documentary about a popular Romanian witch family: [[https://youtu.be/X1g3CYbsssw]]
