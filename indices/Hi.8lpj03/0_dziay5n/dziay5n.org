A: This should be tagged as a Request, not a Fic Search. B: /Please/ say what you are looking for in the title, you can say specifics in the text but at least give a general idea of what you're looking for in the title, and preferably specifics if it's a Fic Search. Here's the difference between the two in examples. [Request] Looking for fics where the Ministry is competent [Fic Search] Looking for a fic in which Amelia Bones is Minister, the Ministry is competent, and Sirius is exonerated. Requests are asking for fic suggestions, Fic Search is when you are looking for a /specific/ fic but can't remember the title or all the details. Of course, you would know all this if you read that handy little "HOW TO FLAIR YOUR POST" link on the right side of your screen. : )
