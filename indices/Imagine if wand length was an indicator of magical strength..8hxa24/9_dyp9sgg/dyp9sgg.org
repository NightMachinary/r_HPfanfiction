I had some ideas about that in a story. The minimum length of a wand would've been 8.88 inches and the max 13.13 inches and the longer your wand was, the stronger your abilities were. But the elder wand would have been 7.777777 inches long subverting the rules. Ne er got far enough to really get into the wandlore though.
