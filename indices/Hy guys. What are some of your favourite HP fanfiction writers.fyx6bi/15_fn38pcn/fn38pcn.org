The first one which comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4314892/Colubrina][Colubrina]]. I love the variety of her work and how she plays with different tropes, writing styles, and aspects of the characters. Not all of her ships or plots are directly appealing to me, but I still try just about everything she writes. Plus, The Pretense is one of my all-time favourites.

Other authors who come to mind are: [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/aTasteofCaramell/pseuds/aTasteofCaramell][aTasteofCaramell]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/nasimwrites/pseuds/nasimwrites][nasimwrites]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/24216/Lady-Altair][Lady Altair]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1472545/BirdG][BirdG]].
