[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence][TheBlack'sResurgence]] Hands down, in my opinion, the best one out there. Consistently high quality and the stories he published so far are incredible. I do hope to see more from him though. He also creates a phenomenal opponent. You really don't see much thought put into your common Fanfiction counterpart. His /Stepping Back/ Tom Riddle is a perfect example of that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4788805/The-Sinister-Man][The Sinister Man]] While I only read /The Prince of Slytherin/ I find myself consistently checking my email to see if a new chapter has come out. The ability to create a believable world is extremely underrated and I think he deserves some high praise for his creative adaptions of common Fanfiction tropes and twists on the Harry Potter Canon.

Both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7037477/DarknessEnthroned][DarknessEnthroned]] also come to mind, though I, at this point, have only read /Letters/ by TheEndless7, and /A Cadamean Victory/ by DarknessEnthroned. Latter sadly one had one large complete story, while I, until now, didn't have the chance to read a few of the others from TheEndless7. (Definitely am planing it though.) Similar to TSM they really manage to twist the Harry Potter canon believably, allowing them easily to jump on my list.

Lastly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9153648/][OfMiceAndLice]] probably the least special of the bunch and hardly on the level of TBR, TSM or the other two, but I really enjoyed his latest story. I recommended it a couple of times on this site already. I think in a couple of stories, if he ever finished one, he would be on the level needed to make this list justifiably. I like his world painting though, he manages to create a vivid picture with his descriptions and I actually like some of his OC's and Characters in general.
