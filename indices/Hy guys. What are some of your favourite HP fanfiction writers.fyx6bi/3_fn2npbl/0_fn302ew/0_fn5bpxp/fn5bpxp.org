Hy. Just wanted to thank you for introducing me to Harry Potter fanfiction.

One day i was just browsing the internet thoroughly bored out of my mind and i find a HP fanfiction 'The Aurors', i read it and i fell in love with HP fanfictions. The first fanfiction i read was yours and i really enjoyed it. Till this day i regularly read HP fanfictions. Continue your great work. Have a good day.
