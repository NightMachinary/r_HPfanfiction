I am having such trouble finding this one for some reason, but I read one in the past couple months where dumbledore still drops him on the dursley doorstep, but Petunia takes him to her parents to raise him. She stays involved in his life and Harry actually likes her and Dudley. Remus Lupin is involved later too. It was pretty good - I'll let you know if I end up finding it
