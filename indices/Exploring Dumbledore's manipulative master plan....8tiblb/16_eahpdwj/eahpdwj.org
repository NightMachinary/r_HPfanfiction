This is dreadfully good dude. Fabulous. I recommend you crosspost this on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], on [[/r/HarryPotterBooks][r/HarryPotterBooks]], and [[/r/FanTheories][r/FanTheories]]. I actually think this belongs on these subreddits more so than here; it isn't really fan fiction because it is well within the constraints of canon, as you mention. And it is bloody, bloody brilliant...
