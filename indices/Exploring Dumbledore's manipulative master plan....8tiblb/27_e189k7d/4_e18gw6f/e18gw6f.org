Part 2:

#+begin_quote
  Third year. Soul sucking demons. A responsible administrator would have refused to open the school under those circumstances (that being the stationing of dementors around the school). Certainly after they invaded the train, and then the quidditch pitch.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore hated Dementors. He told Fudge he didn't think this was a good idea, but Fudge overruled him. Also, Dumbledore can't close the school--that's the Board of Directors' job. Once again, you're blaming Dumbledore for things that aren't his fault.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore hired a werewolf.
#+end_quote

So what?

#+begin_quote
  He hired a werewolf without making said werewolf take an unbreakable vow to take his wolfsbane potion every month.
#+end_quote

That's fascism.

#+begin_quote
  He endangered every student in the school, because he failed at his fucking job. To put this in perspective, he hired a convicted sex offender (to be fair, this offender just got drunk and whipped it out and pissed on the school in front of the cops one night), and didn't put any camera's in the classroom, or otherwise limit his exposure to the students.
#+end_quote

How dare you. That is a disgustingly inappropriate comparison. Who the hell do you think you are? Remus Lupin despised himself every minute of every day for something that wasn't his fault. He was bitten as a child by a terrorist. Lycanthorphy is a disease.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore aids and abets a fugitive from being brought to justice, enlisting two children to do so, again using the fucking time machine given to the now fourteen year old girl. At this stage we are just compounding the interest on the man's utter and complete failure.
#+end_quote

Correction--Dumbledore is ensuring that an innocent man not have his soul sucked out of his body. He is helping a man escape from very unjust laws. And Harry and Hermione volunteered--that's a damn big distinction. The Time Turner was a stupid idea, but that's because time travel itself is a stupid idea.

#+begin_quote
  The Triwizard Tournament. Any contest to be held in a secondary school that has a fucking death toll is an insanity best not considered. Not only does Dumbledore allow this nightmare, he once again fails to protect his students when an underage contestant is admitted. One job.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore drew an Age Line so that only students of age, that is, legal adults could cross the line to put their names into the Goblet of Fire. He only wanted adults to be in the Tournament. He also saw the opportunity to mend bridges with the International community--and had things gone as he had envisioned, those bridges would have been.

Crouch's impersonation of Moody threw him for a loop, and why shouldn't it? More to the point, he is not the least bit happy about Harry being entered, but he also knows that he can't just undo everything.

#+begin_quote
  A quick loop back to the bullying issue, fourth year is worse than second, and now we can add Trelwany and Hagrid to the list of teachers who should have noticed. Also, our resident asshole Snape tells a teenage girl, whose teeth are down to her chin due to a curse that he "Sees no difference"? Why hasn't this assclown been dismissed yet? Ah yes, because Dumbledore won't do his fucking job
#+end_quote

Trelawney is an incompetent twit, nobody disputes that. But Hagrid also knows that the minute he tries to stop Malfoy, the little brat will cry to his father, who is no doubt waiting for an opportunity to nail Hagrid due to Buckbeak escaping. Hagrid is stuck between a rock and a hard place, but to condemn him so unilaterally is unfair.

As for Snape--once again, Dumbledore cannot dismiss him. To do so now would be even more suspicious.

#+begin_quote
  Lets ignore the tasks and assume that Dumbledore somehow had safety precautions for ~everything~. When Harry returns from the graveyard, with a dead body, where are the Aurors? Shouldn't Dumbledore call them? Maybe once they get to the infirmary as Harry is clearly injured. Ah, but no, Dumbledore couldn't possibly be assed to do his job. Oh and how about a therapist for the kid who just watched another kid die? Nah.
#+end_quote

Fudge is there. So is Bagman. Possibly other Ministry officials, given that Fudge is able to summon a Dementor.

Harry's physical injuries were healed by Fawkes--possibly at Dumbledore's direction.

And Dumbledore himself says that waiting to talk about it will not help Harry's mental health. But with Fudge's interference, he may not be able to call any sort of therapist, if such a thing even exists in the Wizarding World.

#+begin_quote
  Fifth year, Umbridge. Blood quill. Dumbledore knows and McG's advice is to keep your head down. The man has one job, to run the school and protect the students and he utterly fails once again.
#+end_quote

Once again, I fear I have been hit by a Memory Charm. As I recall, the book, the actual text not the ten thousand shitty fanfics, has Harry actively avoiding going to authority figures about the Blood Quill because he fears retaliation from the Ministry.

More to the point, McGonagall did not tell Harry to keep his head down after hearing about the Blood Quill. She advised him to keep his temper because he had just been sent to her directly from Umbridge.

#+begin_quote
  End of fifth year. It's a boarding school. The dorms ought to be locked up tighter than a snare drum at night, with staff posted. But no, the kids run rampant, and leave the school. Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors. After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.
#+end_quote

Okay, that's it. I'm taking the gloves off.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It was early evening--as in not curfew yet--when Harry and his friends resolved to go to London to rescue Sirius. There was no question of students being out of bed in the climax of the fifth book.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore wasn't even at the school--he had been driven away by Fudge and Umbridge. And by the time he gets word of what happened, it's been hours. He goes immediately to fix the problem himself instead of alerting the Aurors because who knows how long that will take?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Harry was not physically injured enough to need medical attention. The others were and were sent straight to Madam Pomfrey.

Dumbledore tells Harry the truth of the prophecy because he realizes that if he doesn't do it /now,/ he'll lose Harry forever, and that this should have been done long ago.

#+begin_quote
  Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.
#+end_quote

Harry is demanding answers. Dumbledore agrees that he has the right to know.

#+begin_quote
  And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.
#+end_quote

The Dursleys suck, but Dumbledore also acknowledges that what they did to Dudley was worse. Which is also what would have happened had Harry gone anywhere else.

#+begin_quote
  I'll say it again for those who missed it - Dumbledore had one fucking job as Headmaster of a boarding school and he failed at every level. Even worse he ~maliciously~ groomed students to become suicide bombers.
#+end_quote

No, Dumbledore inspired his students to fight for justice. To fight the Dark Arts and those who practice them.

#+begin_quote
  So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.
#+end_quote

In most instances, he did as good a job as he could have, given that he did not have the benefit of hindsight. And he was opposed by the government at every turn, which only goes to prove that even a fictional government destroys everything it touches.
