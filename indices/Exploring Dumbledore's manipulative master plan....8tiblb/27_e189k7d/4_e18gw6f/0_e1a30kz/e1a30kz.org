I love your whole comment, but I do have to comment on this part, unless I somehow missing the context of your response.

  He goes immediately to fix the problem himself instead of alerting the Aurors because who knows how long that will take?

He does, doesn't he? "The Aurors on on their way" is exactly what Dumbledore tells Voldemort, and then obviously moments later they show up.

  “Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge, apparently beside himself with amazement. “You --- here --- I --- I ---”

  He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him, and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, “Seize him!”
#+end_quote

It seems as though Fudge and the Aurors are there as a response to this emergency, and not for their regular work day.

I suppose we could say that Dumbledore himself might not have called the Aurors but that someone else did, but then still it would be one of the Order under Dumbledore's leadership. Or else we could say that there's an automatic security system that called the Aurors and have even less reason to blame Dumbledore, specifically.

He also does not go immediately to the Ministry either, but stays to question Kreacher. While this could appear like the wrong choice, I think it shows that Dumbledore insists on being well-informed so he does not make a mistake. (I also don't imagnie that interogating Kreacher took more than a few minutes anyway).

But I love your entire comment. The original comment is kind of funny, because there's really nothing Dumbledore can do right, is there? Blaming him for telling Harry about the prophecy that night? Did they not read that chapter or something and see that Harry would not fair well if Dumbledore had waited until the morning? Ah well...
