  Why weren't the authorities notified when students were being attacked and petrified? Where were the interviews, the investigation? My recurring theme of Dumbledore having one fucking job and failing persists. The aurors are one floo call away.
#+end_quote

This is another decent point. The reasoning probably had something to do with the Aurors seeming lack of competence in the books, combined with a less reasonable desire to just keep the school open without causing a scandal. Also, there's every possibility there was some of this going on behind the scenes--maybe any investigators were taking Harry's statements second-hand from the teachers he had to explain things to? Again, the Board of Directors was absolutely doing /something/.

  McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is crazy. That said, again the guilt needs to be shared with the Ministry of Magic, which signed off on this too. And there's nothing technically wrong with giving a student a time machine. It may be unreasonably risky for a very small reward, but it's not in any way a bad or evil act. Plus, I expect they would have taken it away immediately if they ever found any evidence of Hermione breaking the strict rules.

  Sirius Black was a member of Dumbledore's super secret vigilante group. Dumbledore knew about the dark mark thanks to Snape turning coat. Dumbledore let an innocent man go to prison because he couldn't be stuffed to roll up his fucking sleeves? As Chief Warlock, he could have pushed for a trial but he failed.
#+end_quote

The second two sentences here are assumptions. Reasonable assumptions, but we don't have any evidence they're true. And even if they are, Sirius Black was, to Dumbledore's knowledge, guilty. It certainly would have been the moral paragon thing to do to push for a trial anyway (despite Crouch and probably a majority of the rest of magical Britain pushing to just throw him in Azkaban), but it's likely this wasn't illegal (however unjust the law obviously must be), and Dumbledore had no particular reason to go out of his way to give Sirius a trial when he had very strong reason to believe he was guilty.

  Third year. Soul sucking demons. A responsible administrator would have refused to open the school under those circumstances (that being the stationing of dementors around the school). Certainly after they invaded the train, and then the quidditch pitch.
#+end_quote

Uh...maybe. I mean, after each incident, Dumbledore must have gotten assurances from the Ministry that it wouldn't happen again. And I think "invading the train" was actually a sanctioned search, if I remember correctly. Plus, don't forget that Dumbledore was just reinstated after 2nd year, and we know from book 5 that the Ministry could probably force Hogwarts to remain open even if Dumbledore declared it shut down. His position really wasn't very good. If he had 100% cooperation from the teachers, he would have had a ton of capital by orchestrating a strike, but it clearly wasn't the hill he wanted to die on. Not when the soul-sucking demons are legally appointed law officers with legitimate authority who supposedly only suck souls when commanded by human law officers, and he got assurances that they weren't to be allowed on school grounds, AND he and multiple other teachers were capable of forcibly ensuring that themselves if it became necessary (as it did in canon.) It reasonably wouldn't seem worth the effort.

  Dumbledore hired a werewolf. He hired a werewolf without making said werewolf take an unbreakable vow to take his wolfsbane potion every month. He endangered every student in the school, because he failed at his fucking job. To put this in perspective, he hired a convicted sex offender (to be fair, this offender just got drunk and whipped it out and pissed on the school in front of the cops one night), and didn't put any camera's in the classroom, or otherwise limit his exposure to the students.
#+end_quote

An unbreakable vow is too harsh; killing someone for making themselves a risk is a little extreme. But that doesn't mean your point is completely wrong--he certainly should have done more to make sure Lupin took the potion. Like, at least order Snape (and probably at least one other person) to watch and make sure Lupin takes it. (He may even have done this with Snape in canon, actually.) That said, Lupin did have a track record of safe transformations at that point--he's essentially an expert at handling a dangerous weapon, and the consequence to himself for any slips is probably death, so it's not unreasonable to trust him to stay safe.Your sex offender analogy weakens your argument in my opinion, if only because the crime is so inane and the response so over-the-top.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore aids and abets a fugitive from being brought to justice, enlisting two children to do so, again using the fucking time machine given to the now fourteen year old girl. At this stage we are just compounding the interest on the man's utter and complete failure.
#+end_quote

Illegal and somewhat unsafe for the children, but not actually the wrong thing to do. And it wasn't even /that/ unsafe, given the Dementors weren't usually actively dangerous, Lupin being a werewolf shouldn't have been an issue given the other precautions he, Snape, and Dumbledore were taking, and (crucially) Dumbledore sent them back from the future, so he already had evidence that they'd be fine.

#+begin_quote
  The Triwizard Tournament. Any contest to be held in a secondary school that has a fucking death toll is an insanity best not considered. Not only does Dumbledore allow this nightmare, he once again fails to protect his students when an underage contestant is admitted. One job.
#+end_quote

A major oversimplification. Football has a death toll. Still happens. As do many other sports. Plus, the contest was supposed to be safer than when people died in the past, Dumbledore (again) doesn't have complete control over the school and may not have been able to stop the Ministry-organized and sanctioned contest even if he wanted to, and it seems that some (stupid) quirk of the magic of the Goblet means Dumbledore couldn't have done anything more for Harry once he was a contestant.

  A quick loop back to the bullying issue, fourth year is worse than second, and now we can add Trelwany and Hagrid to the list of teachers who should have noticed. Also, our resident asshole Snape tells a teenage girl, whose teeth are down to her chin due to a curse that he "Sees no difference"? Why hasn't this assclown been dismissed yet? Ah yes, because Dumbledore won't do his fucking job.
#+end_quote

On bullying, see above. Again, you're not wrong, but it's not quite as big an issue as you're making it out to be. And with Snape, I expect that some of it is an (unfortunately common) tendency for teachers to assume students are exaggerating with complaints against unliked teachers, or just not report at all. Especially since many of their complaints against Snape are actually over-the-top or flat-out incorrect.

#+begin_quote
  Lets ignore the tasks and assume that Dumbledore somehow had safety precautions for ~everything~. When Harry returns from the graveyard, with a dead body, where are the Aurors? Shouldn't Dumbledore call them? Maybe once they get to the infirmary as Harry is clearly injured. Ah, but no, Dumbledore couldn't possibly be assed to do his job. Oh and how about a therapist for the kid who just watched another kid die? Nah.
#+end_quote

The Minister of Magic was also there, right? Or did he just show up later? (Which would have meant somebody called him.) As well as many other Ministry personnel. It's more their job than Dumbledore's. Especially when he was seeing to the safety of his student and running the school amid the uproar. Aurors probably did show up eventually, but we already got the scene of Harry explaining what happened and the scene of the Minister not believing him, so why waste time with a formal police interview that adds nothing to the story? And again, therapists not existing is not Dumbledore's fault.
