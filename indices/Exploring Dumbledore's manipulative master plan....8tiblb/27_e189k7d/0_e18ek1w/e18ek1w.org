#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle is a terrorist who was strongly driven in that direction by Dumbledore, although his actions are his own, and he was clearly insane well before he tried to murder an infant.
#+end_quote

I must have been hit by a Memory Charm, since I don't seem to recall Dumbledore driving Tom Riddle to commit horrible crimes.

In fact, I remember the very opposite--Dumbledore tells eleven-year-old Tom that thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts, that he must speak to his teachers with respect, and that he must return the items that he has stolen to their proper owners and apologize for what he has done.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore placed Harry with his relatives, against the advice of McG, which should have been irrelevant as Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore may well have convinced the authorities that placing Harry with blood relatives would have been the more suitable scenario. In any event, we know very little of how law works in the Wizarding World, so to say that Dumbledore had no right to do so is speculation at best.

#+begin_quote
  He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable.
#+end_quote

The traps were meant not to stop a thief, but delay them. The final trap, the Mirror of Erised, was virtually unstoppable to anyone who had unscrupulous reasons to get the Stone. Dumbledore was trying to lure out Voldemort, so that he could stop him.

#+begin_quote
  There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone.
#+end_quote

I've never been convinced of that. Not one of them would have stopped Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.
#+end_quote

It was never stated that Dumbledore was the one in charge of detentions. That's something to take up with McGonagall, as it appears she was the one who set it.

#+begin_quote
  Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.
#+end_quote

I cannot believe I'm about to play devil's advocate for that slimeball, but I'm too stubborn to quit. There aren't exactly a lot of extremely skilled Potions Masters to go around. Snape is slime, but he also has nowhere else to go. Dumbledore needs him at Hogwarts, and dismissing him to allow a different Potions Master to take his place would risk losing an extraordinarily valuable spy.

And Snape may be a bastard, but his NEWT classes only take the best, and given the sorry state of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, Dumbledore may be willing to risk it, as to get the best possible candidates for Aurors.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the year, after Harry straight up kills a professor, He is sent back to the neglectful, borderline abusive relatives to whom he was delivered without due process in the first place
#+end_quote

Harry didn't kill Quirrell. Quirrell's body was damaged, but it was Voldemort's possession that led to it, and upon his departure, Quirrell's body couldn't stay alive. That's an important difference.

And the Durselys suck, but they're also a classic piece of story-telling. Comically incompetent, mean-spirited guardians have been a crucial part of story telling in English literature for quite literally centuries.

And once again, there's no evidence whatsoever that the Durselys weren't given custody through due process.

#+begin_quote
  Where to even start. First, a professor died. There should be an Inquiry.
#+end_quote

There may well have been, if Umbridge's comments are anything to go by, in her discussion of "age-appropriate material."

#+begin_quote
  Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry.
#+end_quote

Again, no evidence there wasn't.

#+begin_quote
  An eleven year old boy killed someone.
#+end_quote

No, he didn't

#+begin_quote
  Where is the therapist? Finally, Harry is under the school nurses care, who apparently has never been trained to recognize abused children?
#+end_quote

Again, Harry's treatment is akin to the orphans from Charles Dickens, and countless others. And in any event, the Dursleys treat him like scum, but there's no indication that anybody other than Dudley is actively hitting him. Vernon picking Harry up by the collar is not the same thing as beating him.

#+begin_quote
  Once more, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and all of the above actually falls under his purview, but he does nothing.
#+end_quote

And Dumbledore also knows that due to the blood protections that he cannot easily move Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Continuing on our theme of bullies, the unmitigated degree of bullying towards Harry during his second year should see the Dumbledore, McG, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, and Filch all under review for failing to act, if not outright dismissed. And again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, again, that of running the school, and he fails.
#+end_quote

And did Harry ever once go to a teacher and say what was going on? No. It was the 1990s--the studies about the ill effects of bullying weren't completed. Stop acting as if the books were written, and set, in the 2010s.

#+begin_quote
  Why weren't the authorities notified when students were being attacked and petrified? Where were the interviews, the investigation? My recurring theme of Dumbledore having one fucking job and failing persists. The aurors are one floo call away.
#+end_quote

They were. Fudge said himself that after four attacks, the Ministry had to act. But the Ministry went for one suspect, while Dumbledore went to another.

#+begin_quote
  McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.
#+end_quote

And by all indications, Hermione was not the first student who was given a Time Turner. And Hermione mentions that it took a lot of paperwork, and additional information indicates that the Time Turners were charmed to only work for five hours

#+begin_quote
  Sirius Black was a member of Dumbledore's super secret vigilante group. Dumbledore knew about the dark mark thanks to Snape turning coat. Dumbledore let an innocent man go to prison because he couldn't be stuffed to roll up his fucking sleeves? As Chief Warlock, he could have pushed for a trial but he failed.
#+end_quote

Not all who were aligned with Voldemort had the Dark Mark--Greyback doesn't. And what sort of idiot would allow his chief spy to have the branding that identifies him as a member? And more to the point, Sirius was not sent to Azkaban for betraying the Potters. He was sent to Azkaban for blowing up a street and killing a dozen people. Dumbledore may have pushed for a trial--we're never actually told this definitively and for all we know, the Chief Warlock may not have the final say (The title "Chief" may not even mean much--several of *Chief* Justice Roberts's responsibilities are largely ceremonial or very, very specific).
