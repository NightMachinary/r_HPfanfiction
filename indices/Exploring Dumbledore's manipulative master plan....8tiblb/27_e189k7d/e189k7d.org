Those are some lovely theories, but the issue I take, is that Dumbledore overstepped every single time. Tom Riddle is a terrorist who was strongly driven in that direction by Dumbledore, although his actions are his own, and he was clearly insane well before he tried to murder an infant. Dumbledore is a straight up Machiavellian Dark Lord, who attempts to 'guide' the world by molding it's youth, and holding key positions in it's legislature. Why we bash Dumbledore in a few easy to understand bullet points.

- Dumbledore placed Harry with his relatives, against the advice of McG, which should have been irrelevant as Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.

- He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable. There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone.

- He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.

- Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.

- At the end of the year, after Harry straight up kills a professor, He is sent back to the neglectful, borderline abusive relatives to whom he was delivered without due process in the first place. Where to even start. First, a professor died. There should be an Inquiry. Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry. An eleven year old boy killed someone. Where is the therapist? Finally, Harry is under the school nurses care, who apparently has never been trained to recognize abused children? Once more, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and all of the above actually falls under his purview, but he does nothing.

- Continuing on our theme of bullies, the unmitigated degree of bullying towards Harry during his second year should see the Dumbledore, McG, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, and Filch all under review for failing to act, if not outright dismissed. And again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, again, that of running the school, and he fails.

- Why weren't the authorities notified when students were being attacked and petrified? Where were the interviews, the investigation? My recurring theme of Dumbledore having one fucking job and failing persists. The aurors are one floo call away.

- McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.

- Sirius Black was a member of Dumbledore's super secret vigilante group. Dumbledore knew about the dark mark thanks to Snape turning coat. Dumbledore let an innocent man go to prison because he couldn't be stuffed to roll up his fucking sleeves? As Chief Warlock, he could have pushed for a trial but he failed.

- Third year. Soul sucking demons. A responsible administrator would have refused to open the school under those circumstances (that being the stationing of dementors around the school). Certainly after they invaded the train, and then the quidditch pitch.

- Dumbledore hired a werewolf. He hired a werewolf without making said werewolf take an unbreakable vow to take his wolfsbane potion every month. He endangered every student in the school, because he failed at his fucking job. To put this in perspective, he hired a convicted sex offender (to be fair, this offender just got drunk and whipped it out and pissed on the school in front of the cops one night), and didn't put any camera's in the classroom, or otherwise limit his exposure to the students.

- Dumbledore aids and abets a fugitive from being brought to justice, enlisting two children to do so, again using the fucking time machine given to the now fourteen year old girl. At this stage we are just compounding the interest on the man's utter and complete failure.

- The Triwizard Tournament. Any contest to be held in a secondary school that has a fucking death toll is an insanity best not considered. Not only does Dumbledore allow this nightmare, he once again fails to protect his students when an underage contestant is admitted. One job.

- A quick loop back to the bullying issue, fourth year is worse than second, and now we can add Trelwany and Hagrid to the list of teachers who should have noticed. Also, our resident asshole Snape tells a teenage girl, whose teeth are down to her chin due to a curse that he "Sees no difference"? Why hasn't this assclown been dismissed yet? Ah yes, because Dumbledore won't do his fucking job.

- Lets ignore the tasks and assume that Dumbledore somehow had safety precautions for ~everything~. When Harry returns from the graveyard, with a dead body, where are the Aurors? Shouldn't Dumbledore call them? Maybe once they get to the infirmary as Harry is clearly injured. Ah, but no, Dumbledore couldn't possibly be assed to do his job. Oh and how about a therapist for the kid who just watched another kid die? Nah.

- Fifth year, Umbridge. Blood quill. Dumbledore knows and McG's advice is to keep your head down. The man has one job, to run the school and protect the students and he utterly fails once again.

- End of fifth year. It's a boarding school. The dorms ought to be locked up tighter than a snare drum at night, with staff posted. But no, the kids run rampant, and leave the school. Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors. After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.

And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.

I'll say it again for those who missed it - Dumbledore had one fucking job as Headmaster of a boarding school and he failed at every level. Even worse he ~maliciously~ groomed students to become suicide bombers.

So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.
