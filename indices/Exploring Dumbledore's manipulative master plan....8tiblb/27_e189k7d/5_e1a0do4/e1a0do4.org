  McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.

It seems a common practice - Hagrid is mad at Harry, Ron, and Hermione for dropping his class in HBP and then when they are making up, he admits that even with Time Turners, their schedules would be too full, and Hermione says they'd destroyed all of them so they couldn't have used Time Turners to take Care of Magical Creatures anyway.

Anyway, amusing read. I always like seeing assumptions made about the rules of the Wizarding World.
