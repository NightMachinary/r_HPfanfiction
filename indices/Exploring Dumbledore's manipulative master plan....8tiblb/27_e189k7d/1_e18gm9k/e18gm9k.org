*TLDR: You make a lot of good points about flaws Dumbledore has, things he should have done better, and ways in which he was sort of a bad Headmaster, but your conclusions on those points are over-the-top, not fully supported by the evidence, and paint Dumbledore in a far worse light than he deserves.*

*Long Version:*

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.
#+end_quote

This is an assumption unsupported by the text. In fact, given that Dumbledore actually did place Harry with his relatives, it makes much more sense to assume that he had the authority to do so.

#+begin_quote
  He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable. There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone
#+end_quote

This is of course a good point. Even assuming the OP's theory is 100% true, it doesn't change the fact that Dumbledore was baiting Voldemort to attack a school.

#+begin_quote
  He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.
#+end_quote

To be completely fair, anyone with Hagrid in the forest is probably perfectly safe (and far safer than with an actual qualified wizard unless they're really exceptional.) Of course, being left with just Fang, or worse, alone, is really bad, and Hagrid is careless enough to make bad judgment calls like that, so it's still not a great idea.

Also, it's entirely possible that Dumbledore wasn't involved in this decision, which would put the primary blame on Hagrid and Filch's shoulders. (And I think McGonagall knew?) Of course, Dumbledore does maintain /some/ culpability as the headmaster, but not nearly as much as if he were directly overseeing things.

#+begin_quote
  Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.
#+end_quote

This one's pretty bad. Even as much as I buy into the idea of Snape standing up for his own house to counteract anti-Slytherin bias and actually being a good teacher for students he likes, he really is an awful person and probably shouldn't be allowed to remain in charge of kids. To be fair, though, this makes Dumbledore more of a bad headmaster with too much trust in a coworker/friend than a Machiavellian Dark Lord.

#+begin_quote
  Where to even start. First, a professor died. There should be an Inquiry. Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry.
#+end_quote

There probably was an inquiry. I can't imagine the Board of Directors not taking this opportunity to ream Dumbledore as much as they could. He probably tried to protect Harry from it, though, to minimize the trauma of killing someone.

#+begin_quote
  An eleven year old boy killed someone. Where is the therapist? Finally, Harry is under the school nurses care, who apparently has never been trained to recognize abused children?
#+end_quote

These are in fact issues, but likely as much with the times and magical British society than with Dumbledore. Doesn't absolve him of guilt, but it makes him no more fallible than plenty of decent-ish real school administrators. Heck, it seems likely to me that therapists aren't even a thing in magical Britain at the time of the books, and the nurse probably just flat out isn't trained to recognize abused children.

#+begin_quote
  Continuing on our theme of bullies, the unmitigated degree of bullying towards Harry during his second year should see the Dumbledore, McG, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, and Filch all under review for failing to act, if not outright dismissed. And again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, again, that of running the school, and he fails.
#+end_quote

Again, you're not wrong, but you're blowing it out of proportion a bit in that bullying is (unfortunately) not uncommon, especially decades ago. Plus, there's a good chance the teachers (and possibly even Dumbledore) /were/ trying to do something about it, but were just ineffective. (Also, they were probably focused more on safety than bullying during that year.)
