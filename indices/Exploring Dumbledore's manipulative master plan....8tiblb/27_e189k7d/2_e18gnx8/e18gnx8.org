*Part 3:*

#+begin_quote
  Fifth year, Umbridge. Blood quill. Dumbledore knows and McG's advice is to keep your head down. The man has one job, to run the school and protect the students and he utterly fails once again.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore would absolutely agree with you here, but the Ministry had him outmatched.

#+begin_quote
  End of fifth year. It's a boarding school. The dorms ought to be locked up tighter than a snare drum at night, with staff posted. But no, the kids run rampant, and leave the school. Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors. After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.
#+end_quote

Opinions on how tightly-policed boarding schools should be clearly vary. Also, some of the staff (Umbridge) were actually in company of the students until they left. And Dumbledore wasn't even there. As for the Ministry, Dumbledore is in fact far more qualified to protect the kids personally than the entire Auror Corps, as demonstrated when he shows up and immediately defeats all of the Death Eaters before driving off Voldemort in a duel. This is probably your weakest point in this entire argument, actually.I've already talked about therapists, but the medical attention is a good (if minor, as Harry really wasn't injured much, unlike his friends who did get immediate medical attention) point.

#+begin_quote
  And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.
#+end_quote

See the OP. Although I suspect Dumbledore's views on child abuse aren't quite as enlightened and modern as we'd all like them to be (as in he doesn't think it's as bad as we do), so sure, let's criticize him for that.

  put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become a jihadist suicide bomber.
#+end_quote

Just to be picky (and make a reference), every word you just said was wrong. He put him there for his protection, a jihad is a religious crusade, Dumbledore did not want Harry to kill himself (and indeed he didn't), and to be stupidly extra picky, there were no bombs. (But more to the point, Harry wasn't allowing himself to be killed to do damage. He was allowing himself to be killed as a sacrifice to protect people, and Dumbledore set it up to the best of his ability so that Harry would survive anyway. As per the OP.)

#+begin_quote
  maliciously
#+end_quote

I don't think we define this word the same way. Because really, "maliciously" means "intending harm," or something like that, right? Dumbledore obviously did not intend harm, and in fact tried to the absolute best of his ability to (successfully) let Harry survive, defeat Voldemort, and save hundreds of lives.

#+begin_quote
  So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.
#+end_quote

I feel like I should quote Luke Skywalker again here. There's an inherent contradiction between not caring about his intentions and claiming he's evil. Not caring about the greater good is kind of ridiculous when we're talking about whether somebody is good or not. Ignoring a prophecy that is in fact correct is just stupid. And "deliberately failed said children" is as obviously wrong as "maliciously" was above.
