One factor you're consistently missing is the factor of free choice. Harry chose to go after the Philosopher's Stone when he could have stayed safe in the dorms. Harry chose to go into Chamber of Secrets after Ginny when he could have told a non-Lockhart teacher; he chose to go after Sirius in OotP; he chose to walk into the forest to die in DH when he could have run away (and indeed could have run away throughout DH).

Dumbledore consistently gave Harry the choice, and he consistently gave Harry the knowledge that he would need to succeed were he to choose to involve himself. But he did not raise a child soldier - Harry always had a choice. So there's only a limited amount that Dumbledore could be said to have orchestrated everything. Harry could easily have derailed all of Dumbledore's plans at any time he chose.

The only times Harry does not have the power of choice are those situations which Voldemort, not Dumbledore, had the major hand in orchestrating (such as the Triwizard tournament).

Which was the point. This is what Dumbledore means in OotP when he said he cared for Harry too much. People say Dumbledore's actions in the books represent the "greater good" philosophy, but this is not the case. The "greater good" option was to raise Harry as a child soldier and not give him the choice, but rather to force him into the conflict. This is what Dumbledore means when he said he gave Harry a childhood: what Harry had /was/ an innocent childhood, compared to that of child soldiers.

If you want to criticise Dumbledore's approach to care of children, the real criticism is not that he was heavy handed in placing Harry into dangerous sitautions; rather that he was not heavy handed enough, because he allowed Harry to choose to place himself in dangerous situations when he could have prevented it through more direct interference in Harry's life. However, he can't always keep Harry out of danger, as sometimes Voldemort simply outsmarts him. This, I feel, ultimately vindicates Dumbledore's compromise. He has given Harry the choice to simply bury his head in the sand, but has also provided him with the weapons he needs to survive if he does choose to involve himself. Any more preparation would have been preparing a child soldier, any less and it would have been insufficient to keep Harry alive.

In short, Dumbledore is a libertarian, not a utilitarian. His problem is not being too manipulative, but rather being insufficiently manipulative - it is expected, in modern society, that parents/those with child care responsibility will manipulate children to keep them safe. But the wizarding world has a rather different culture with regards to danger. They don't wrap their kids in cotton wool like modern Western societies do.

Had Dumbledore protected Harry as best he could -- in the sense of keeping him safe, keeping him insulated from all danger -- then likely Harry would have died upon becoming an adult, insufficiently prepared for the most powerful wizard of all time hunting him down. Dumbledore's job isn't just to keep Harry alive until age 17, at which point he can wash his hands of responsibility on the basis that Harry is an adult. Rather, Dumbledore sees his responsibility as giving Harry the best chance of coming out of the coming conflict alive and relatively whole, but without violating his free will.

The other aspect I think you are missing is the fact that people often misdirect a problem with the world onto a problem with Dumbledore. For example, Dumbledore's decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys. Dumbledore tells us in OotP that this was the *only* option where Harry's safety was guaranteed. He was convinced that any other path would have resulted in Harry's death.

Now, Dumbledore knows far more than the reader about the post-1981 political landscape of wizarding Britain; he also knows far more about what is and isn't magically possible. This means that the reader doesn't really have a leg to stand on when they say that Dumbledore should have done X instead of putting Harry with the Dursleys: Dumbledore has already thought of X and ruled it out as too dangerous. And if Dumbledore considers it a politically or magically weak protection, then the reader doesn't have any facts they can use to displace Dumbledore's knowledge.

What the reader *can* say is that they think it is stupid that placing Harry with the Dursleys was the only magically possible effective protection. But that's not a problem with Dumbledore, that's the problem with the magical system. Within the magical system that exists in the HP world, Dumbledore took the right choice so long as you agree that an alive Harry with an unhappy home life is superior to a dead Harry with a happy home life.
