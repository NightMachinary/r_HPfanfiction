I think everything you said about Harry's choices is true, and the libertarian/utilitarian is novel and insightful, but I would not consider it a serious /omission/ from the original post, especially since it focuses on the first book. (And I can't help but wonder about all the fanfiction where Harry breaks away from Dumbledore & co. only to go seek out training, sometimes from literal soldiers. Still his choice, though. What if he /did/ just ask Dumbledore?)

Dumbledore could have taken the choice from Harry by asking him to save the stone, or threatening him, or even just telling him how bad things will be if Voldemort gets it first. Even without any of that, I still say he orchestrated a remarkable portion of the events of Harry's first year. The above post seems like a good response to that.

After that year I think the orchestration angle loses still more credibility and the argument of your comment holds more weight.

  Dumbledore's job isn't just to keep Harry alive until age 17, at which point he can wash his hands of responsibility on the basis that Harry is an adult.

This is a great comparison. A lot of fanfiction invents a great deal of procedure and red tape to be retroactively trampled over by Dumbledore. You'd think the tape is supposed to protect Harry from a killing curse. (I don't think even duct tape is /that/ good.) And I guess Dumbledore already told Harry (and us) the real lesson: sometimes just following the usual approach, the /easy/ way, isn't right.
