Great post.

You're absolutely right. Harry chose to go for the Stone on his own accord --- Harry had full autonomy over his decisions, and he has personal responsibility for his actions.

But I think Dumbledore knew Harry would go for the Stone prior to Harry making that decision himself. Dumbledore offered Harry that choice with the prior knowledge of how Harry would act, so Dumbledore incorporated Harry's future decisions into his plans. Dumbledore created the challenges in the Third Floor Corridor under the (correct) assumption that Harry would eventually face them.

Dumbledore never coerced Harry, but he did have sufficient wisdom to predict Harry's choices.

  What the reader can say is that they think it is stupid that placing Harry with the Dursleys was the only magically possible effective protection. But that's not a problem with Dumbledore, that's the problem with the magical system. Within the magical system that exists in the HP world, Dumbledore took the right choice so long as you agree that an alive Harry with an unhappy home life is superior to a dead Harry with a happy home life.

I also agree with this. My rant about the Dursleys was directed at the people who thought Dumbledore didn't care about Harry's suffering. There are many, many people in this fandom who think it was in-character for Dumbledore to willingly leave Harry with abusive guardians, despite there being viable alternatives.

I was doing my best to explain that there weren't any alternatives. Dumbledore was presented with an ultimatum, not a choice.
