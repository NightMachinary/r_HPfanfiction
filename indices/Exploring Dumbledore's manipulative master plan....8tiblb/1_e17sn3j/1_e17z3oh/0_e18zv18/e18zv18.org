We could go deeper and say it's a problem with books - even ones set in our own world are often still poor imitations, not to mention that we don't necessarily know or understand our own world anyway. We can never really know all the options available to the characters, so we have to look at the limited perspective we're given. (I feel like this is a strength of books even if it's also sometimes a problem).
