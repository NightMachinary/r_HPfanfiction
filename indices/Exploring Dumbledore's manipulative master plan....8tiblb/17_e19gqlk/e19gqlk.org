Any time I see a Dumbledore bashing (which is about every day) I was tempted to write up something similar, but I think you did a much better job than I could have done. Thank you! So much!

Dumbledore is such a wonderfully complex and multifaceted character. So many writers have a tendency to reduce him to this one-dimensional caricature of a villain, it's almost criminal. Of course there are multiple instances were I question his modus operandi (leaving cryptic instruction via testament instead of straight out telling them what he knew and handing over the sword when he knew that he was going to die; not providing Harry with a base of operations for the horxcrux hunt; etc.) but this Greater-Good-Persona is a really cheap way to create an antagonist.
