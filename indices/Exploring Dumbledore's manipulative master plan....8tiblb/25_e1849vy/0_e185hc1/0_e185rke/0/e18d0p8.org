I think he probably assumed that Voldemort would immediately hit Harry with the Killing Curse after his resurrection, actually. But yeah, not sure how he thought Harry would get out of there after that. I'm inclined to think he was genuinely planning on not letting Voldemort be resurrected at all until Harry was an adult who could hopefully get himself out of the situation.
