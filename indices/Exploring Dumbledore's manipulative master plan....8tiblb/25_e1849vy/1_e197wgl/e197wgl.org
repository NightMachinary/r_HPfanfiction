Unfortunately people are downvoting you because they disagree with you, I think.

I wouldn't say it failed to make sense, as there are people here who like the later novels and Dumbledores role in them. We are also used to have this kind of level of suspension of disbelief in what is possible to plan in works of fiction and can overlook them up to a (subjective) point. This point is different for everyone, so some may be okay with it and some may not. It is obviously easier to write books for the former group.

Btw. I liked your fiction "Divided and Entwined", and something like this would be the strategy that would be far more likely to work in real life. Dumbledores plan in the original works is far too complicated to work outside of fiction as too much can go wrong (Like the crippling you mentioned. A bit of crucio and he is a vegetable. Good job), except if he were a perfect precog.
