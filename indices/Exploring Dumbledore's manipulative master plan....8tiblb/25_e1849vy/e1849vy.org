The problem with this explanation is: If Dumbledore could pull off such a complicated plan, against all odds, and with such a narrow margin of failure, then why the hell was he such a useless idiot most of the time? A man able to outthink and outplay Voldemort to that degree, stymied by Fudge, Umbridge and the Malfoys? Unable to prove Sirius's innocence? Unable to keep control of the Wizengamot? Unable to protect children? Further, how could he arrange Harry's kidnapping, yet not save Cedric? Or stop Malfoy's murder attempts? If he's unwilling to sacrifice Harry to win the war, why the hell isn't he willing to save the other kids?

No, the best explanation for Dumbledore's manipulation is and remains: JKR wrote a children's book, and used the classic "useless adults" tropes, then, later tried, to make it all make sense for a YA novel. And failed.
