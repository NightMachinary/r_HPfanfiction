Wow. Dumbledore wanted to get thrown out because he wanted to focus on Horcruxes... And he couldn't, well, step down and choose a successor who wouldn't torture kids? And who wasn't a bigot worse than some Death Eaters? And that's why he came back and became Headmaster again? Kids getting tortured is beneficial? And don't give me the shit about "Dumbledore didn't know": If he's teh master planner you portray him as, he knew - he'd never let Umbridge act freely without keeping an eye on at least the best hope, aka Harry - especially after Harry almost got killed by Dementors despite the blood protection! Also, no kidnapping is inevitable.

As to your conclusion: Your Dumbledore is a god for making such a convoluted plan working. That he couldn't shoot down political opponents far more easily doesn't jive. That he couldn't protect kids and fellow order members also doesn't jive with your "he didn't want to sacrifice Harry" idea.
