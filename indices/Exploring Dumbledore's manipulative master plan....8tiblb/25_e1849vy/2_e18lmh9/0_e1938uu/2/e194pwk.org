It's extremely easy to look back into the past and see how you got to where you are as a straight line.

While I roughly agree with OPs "task list" that Dumbledore made for himself, there's no reason to believe that everything went off without a hitch.

What we see are the successes, but it's entirely possible that those successes /are/ the backup plans. Each step along the way may have been a failure, covered up by a new plan created on the spot.

It's easy to appear Godlike if you assume he planned for events 11 years in advance, but I posit that quite a lot of how things went were adaptations of his original plan, while sticking as much as he could to his "to-do list".
