The problem is the plans in canon are shit. That's OK for a book aimed at kids, but anyone with half a brain would laugh at say Voldemort's plan to lure Harry into the DoM in book 5. The whole damn plan hinges on Harry not being able to contact Sirius, Dumbledore, or anyone else from the Order - and being stupid enough to charge ahead to the DoM. The whole damn plan requires everyone, from Dumbledore to Harry, to act like idiots, and relied on dumb luck to foil Harry's attempt to check in Grimmauld Place.

And that was Voldemort's master plan to get the prophecy, on which he bet most of his core followers.

Same for Dumbledore's canon plans - they are far too prone to fail, and mostly worked due to dumb luck and dumber enemies.
