Also, to be perfectly honest, you're totally right. I did make Dumbledore too competent in my original wall of text, and that hyper-competence isn't consistent with the mistakes he made later in the series.

But there is a way to salvage this theory, if we assume that the plan Dumbledore executed in canon wasn't what he initially had in mind. Please see [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8tiblb/exploring_dumbledores_manipulative_master_plan/e19besz/][this post]]. Dumbledore /did/ make mistakes, and Voldemort did outsmart him at times; the plan listed in my original post had been edited and altered in response to those events.

Dumbledore isn't as godly as I initially made him out to be, and the only reason he succeeded was because he changed and compromised his ideal plan to account for events as they unfolded. Dumbledore was flawed --- he couldn't have protected everyone --- but he adapted and improvised to overcome.
