That's rubbish. If you're killing Nazis to save their victims, you are justified. And it doesn't matter if the Nazis feel that they are in the right - they aren't. Moral relativism ends for certain where some people decide that murdering children is OK. And if Draco thinks he's in the right to continue such vile crimes after Lucius was killed, and becomes a Death Eater willing to mass-murder kids, then he's earned death as well (if he can't be stopped by other means).

The world isn't black and white, but that doesn't mean that everyone in a conflict is equally at fault.
