  The thing is, he made too many mistakes to keep such a plan going - and he avoided the most obvious ways to keep the plan going, like guarding Harry better, especially after the assassination attempt by Dementors - after which it was clear that either the blood protection wasn't working, or someone not connected to Voldemort was trying to kill him.

Dumbledore /did/ guard Harry better. He sent Harry to the Order of the Phoenix headquarters as soon as he realized there was a third party who could circumvent the Lily's enchantment. From the dementor attack onward, Harry only got into life threatening situations by running to them himself (like in the Hall of Prophecy), or when Dumbledore was there to personally protect him (like with the Horcrux cave), or after Dumbledore's death.

  Hell, he should have easily dealt with Malfoy and co. long, long before Harry even started at Hogwarts, but at the very least, he should have taken Malfoy out - if needed with assassination - after the scumbag tried to mass-murder children with a basilisk at school. After that, Dumbledore had a choice to make: Kill Death Eaters, or risk innocent children. And no good Dumbledore would chose Malfoy's life over innocents. Hell, he could have easily framed Malfoy for the basilisk, faked the evidence, after killing Malfoy at Hogwarts.

That's is a very fun idea. Most people bash Dumbledore because they think he believes in the Greater Good, but you're criticizing him for /not/ believing in the Greater Good. It's an interesting switcheroo.

I think a lot of this boils down to our individual perspectives. Brace yourself for an incoming Star Trek reference.

Some people are like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADEDLoLY3AY][Picard]], and they believe that the path to victory is equally important as the victory itself. On the other hand, there are people are like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StF9jrhw-pU][Garak]], who believe that the ends justify the means. Garak and Picard are both super cool, even though their personal philosophies are total opposites.

Dumbledore is an odd case, because I think he's torn between those radically different philosophies. Logically, Dumbledore agrees with Garak's mindset --- he can rationalize committing small acts of evil in order to prevent a greater tragedy --- but emotionally, he feels more closely aligned with Picard --- Dumbledore is very empathetic, and he's consumed by guilt for his sisters death.

I highly recommend you check out [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8tiblb/exploring_dumbledores_manipulative_master_plan/e18zfvs/][these posts]] by [[/u/bisonburgers]]. I think she has a far better understanding of Dumbledore's motives than I did when I created this thread.

Dumbledore is indecisive and contradictory throughout the books because his logic and emotions are at odds with each other. This dichotomy is why Dumbledore fucks up. For example, Dumbledore knows that it's strategically beneficial to treat Harry like a child soldier, but emotionally Dumbledore is compelled to let Harry enjoy his school life without the knowledge of the prophecy hanging over his head. It's this sort of compromise that leads to most of Dumbledore's mistakes.

Also, I think it's worth pointing out that having empathy wasn't Dumbledore's weakness; Dumbledore's weakness was that he struggled to reconcile his empathy with his intelligence. If Dumbledore was more like Picard --- if he rejected the Greater Good based on logical and intellectual grounds --- then perhaps he would have been more effective than he was in canon.

If Picard was in Dumbledore's position, he would have invested far more time trying to redeem wizarding society on a fundamental level. Picard would have created a system in which the Blood Purist ideology could not thrive. However, Dumbledore did not value bureaucracy, truth, ethics, rule-of-law or diplomacy in the way that Picard does, and so he never focused on fixing the institutionalized corruption and bigoted culture that allowed Voldemort to rise to power so easily.

On the other hand, if Garak was in Dumbledore's position, then Voldemort probably would have been defeated far sooner. However, in the process of doing so, Garak would have tortured, murdered, and ultimately utilized the very same tactics that made Voldemort so abhorrent. Garak's methods would not create a stable foundation for a new world --- he would have violated all the lofty ideals on which one could base a better society --- and stability would only ever be found through continued violence. If you just assassinate every suspected Death Eater then you've legitimized murder and laid the seeds for future revenge. What then? Do you preemptively kill the Death Eater's children? Or do you just naively hope that your enemies offspring will behave more honorably than /you/ did? There are long term consequences to abandoning due process and empathy. A world populated by the likes of Garak would not be a world worth fighting for.

In the end, I think Dumbledore found a way to square his utilitarian perspective with his conscience. Dumbledore's final plan turned love itself into a weapon. Dumbledore was part-Garak and part-Picard, and when those parts were at odds Dumbledore made mistakes. But when push came to shove, Dumbledore created a plan that both treated Harry as a sacrificial pawn /and/ as a precious person that needed to be protected. Dumbledore managed to defeat Voldemort /and/ save Harry. Dumbledore's greatest triumph and final victory occurred only when both his Garak-side and Picard-side were working in unison.
