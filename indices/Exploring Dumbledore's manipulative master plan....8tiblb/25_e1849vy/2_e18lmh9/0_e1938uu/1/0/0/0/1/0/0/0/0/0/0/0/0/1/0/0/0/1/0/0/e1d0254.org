Their children are already hardcore Death Eaters, as the examples of Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Greg Goyle, Vincent Crabbe, Millicent Bulstrode, and etc showed. Crabbe and Goyle later became willing torturers of the Carrows.

If you think appeasement could change their mind, then I have to say you are a very naive person. These miscreants only understand the language of force, as the blood purists worship power above all. They will interpret any form of kindness and mercy as weakness, and they derive great pleasures from abusing the weak.

If you want to save these extremely misguided teenagers, the most important thing is to neutralize their parents and expose them as true monsters. You need to show them the errors of their ideology and crush their arrogance. If some of them still won't change, use sting operations to nail them. After all, even our laws will sentence would be terrorists to very long prison terms.
