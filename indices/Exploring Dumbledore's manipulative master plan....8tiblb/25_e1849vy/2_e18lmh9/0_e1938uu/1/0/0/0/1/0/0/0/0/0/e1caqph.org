Sheesh, hyperbole much? Yes, people disagree where exactly the line is - but pretty much everyone but some freaks agree that if your life, or someone else's life, are threatened, you can kill the attackers if that's the only way to protect yourself.

Because demanding that people rather die than kill to defend themselves is not something anyone sane advocates, in any culture.
