Malfoy tried to get all muggleborns at Hogwarts killed by Basilisk. He failed thanks to dumb luck. He showed no remorse either. We know this, Dumbledore knows this, Harry knows this. It cannot be proven in court due to Dobby not being able to testify for whatever reason.

But Malfoy presents a clear and present danger to all muggleborns - his actions prove that beyond any doubt. Either Dumbledore deals with him, or the next time, Malfoy might succeed.

And my argument is that killing him is the last resort. If everything else fails, Dumbledore has to kill him rather than let him try to murder more children.
