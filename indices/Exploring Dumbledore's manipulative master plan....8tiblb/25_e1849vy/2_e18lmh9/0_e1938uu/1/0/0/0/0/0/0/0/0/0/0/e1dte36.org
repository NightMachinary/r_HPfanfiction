  What would you do if the only way to save children were to murder each and every Nazi trying to kill them?

I would kill them. However, I think that the range of circumstances in which killing them truly was "the only way" is far more narrow than you believe.

I think our major disagreement is that we don't see eye to eye on what "no other option" means.

If you acknowledge that your philosophy isn't necessary if there exists a benevolent and competent government, then doesn't that mean that the creation such a government is the eternal "other option" that supersedes your philosophy?
