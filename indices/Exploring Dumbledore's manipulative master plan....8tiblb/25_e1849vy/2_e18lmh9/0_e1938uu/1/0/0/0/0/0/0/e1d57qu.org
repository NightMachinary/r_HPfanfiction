Sure, makes sense.

I think our major disagreement is that I thought you implied that it was unethical for Dumbledore to not kill Malfoy. That proposition would only be credible under /very/ specific circumstances. Outside of those circumstance, there are other means of pursuing justice and security, and to abandon those pursuits is truly unethical. To do so would be a surrender to a status quo that lacks integrity, which would have tangible long-term consequences that I didn't think you took into account.
