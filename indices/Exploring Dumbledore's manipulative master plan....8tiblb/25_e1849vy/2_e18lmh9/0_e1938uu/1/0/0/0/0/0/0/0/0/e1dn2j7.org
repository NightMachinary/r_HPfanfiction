  Dumbledore certainly could kill Malfoy without anyone being the wiser - which would prevent all those consequences you fear.

Perhaps.

Dumbledore could also murder Narcissa Malfoy without anyone knowing. And then Walden Macnair. Then Fenrir Greyback. Then Goyle Sr. And then he could conduct a false flag attack against the Ministry to convince them of Voldemort's return. Then he could arrange for Umbridge to have an accident. He could then place the Minister under the Imperius Curse so he control the Ministry in secret. Those are all legitimate solutions to the problems within the wizarding world, right? And as long as he doesn't get caught, there are no downsides!

But eventually Dumbledore will make a mistake. Eventually, he'll be caught. For this strategy to be successful, Dumbledore really would have to be a god --- he'd have to be somebody so incredibly competent that the /never/ fucked up. If Dumbledore was that hyper-competent, then shouldn't he be able to win without using these methods?

Of course, you could claim that "Dumbledore will stop before he get's caught," but is that really true? If it is logical and ethical to murder Malfoy, then it is equally logical and ethical to murder Fenrir Greyback. If Greyback's murder was logically and ethically justified, then so is the murder of other Death Eaters. If Dumbledore killed /only/ Malfoy, then, according to your ideology, wouldn't he be guilty for /not/ murdering Greyback? Wouldn't letting Greyback live be fundamentally unethical, according to your worldview?

The killings would only stop when Dumbledore runs out of people to kill (which won't happen), or he's caught (which would be a disaster) or because he becomes a hypocrite that abandons his philosophy. You can't say that Malfoy is a unique case, because your justifications are equally applicable elsewhere. If you think murdering Malfoy is justified, then you believe that /conducting executions without due process or civil accountability/ is justified. Malfoy's murder would not happen in isolation. There /are/ consequences to your mentality. Even if nobody traces those killings back to Dumbledore, just what kind of society would Dumbledore have created? It would be totalitarian in /function/, even if it lacked the bad press of being totalitarian in the public eye.

What's more, Dumbledore wouldn't have solved the underlying issues that created those Death Eaters in the first place. He would be destroying the symptoms of the problem, but not the cause. Even if every person Dumbledore killed was deserving of their death, would that really end Blood Purity? Not every Blood Purist was a Death Eater; there must have been hundreds of others who harbored feelings for that ideology, even if they didn't want to become Voldemort's minion. Killing the KKK wouldn't have stopped segregation or bigotry in America --- the world just isn't that simple.

Another problem is revealed when you consider what is /required/ for Dumbledore's crimes to remain hidden from the public. Your philosophy in execution cannot function alongside a competent /and/ benevolent government. If the government is benevolent, then they must also be incompetent, because otherwise they would solve and reveal the true nature of those deaths. If the government is competent, then it must also be complicit in concealing Dumbledore's crimes from the greater public. But isn't establishing a competent and benevolent society the ultimate goal of this endeavour? Yet the creation of such a government would retroactively jeopardize your accomplishments. Your methods and end-game are mutually exclusive.

I haven't even gotten into the risk of innocents being caught up in all this. It would certainly be a dark world if even the good guys were lynching people.

In conclusion, I think there are still consequences to your ideology even if it is implemented secretly.

I've kind of strayed away from discussing Harry Potter (which is fun and warm) and started discussing politics in general (which is typically a lot less fun). Forgive me.
