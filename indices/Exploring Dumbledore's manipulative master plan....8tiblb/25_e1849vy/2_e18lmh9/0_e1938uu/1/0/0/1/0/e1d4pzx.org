  I think this is a beautiful thought and I once again love the comparison, but I also have to be the "well, actually" person and say that Dumbledore does seem to have tried to change the idealogy of society as well - although clearly was unsuccessful. Dumbledore's reputation (so long as we assume it's earned) is about reaching out to other magical creatures in friendship and understanding, he's learned many languages in order to effectively communicate with others, he understands without criticism how to work with giants, centaurs, merpeople, and house-elves and is unafraid to disagree with the Minister when he is blaming things on Madame Maxime. While we don't witness all the direct examples of Dumbledore's advocacy for these people and creatures, it is highly implied that they happened because many characters criticize and/or praise Dumbledore for exactly these things - Malfoy, Voldemort, Fudge, Rita Skeeter, Doge, etc. And considering all those people have varying motives for describing Dumbledore and yet all agree that he has done this work, I think it's safe to say that Dumbledore has tried very hard to change the purist ideology.

You're right. Dumbledore was certainly aware of the bigoted side of wizarding culture, and he had the courage and integrity to publicly criticize those evil ideas.

However, what differentiates Dumbledore from Picard is that Dumbledore believed that those evil ideas where the fault of individual people, whereas Picard believed that individuals were the product of the underlying logistics of their environment.

Dumbledore tried to redeem the wizarding world by redeeming the people within it. For example, Dumbledore tried to redeem Draco by encouraging him to act against the circumstances of his environment. Picard, on the other hand, would have considered the circumstances of Malfoy's environment to be fundamentally unacceptable, and he would have fought to change those circumstances themselves.

You brought up the example of the giants, and I think that further establishes the difference between Dumbledore and somebody like Picard. Dumbledore tried to bribe individual giants into opposing Voldemort. Dumbledore only opened meaningful dialog with the giants when such a relationship became strategically significant, and he attempted to form a personal relationship, rather than creating systematic cooperation between cultures.

On the other hand, Picard would have helped the giants because he genuinely believed in the principles of mutual cooperation, humanitarianism and universal justice. Because Picard intellectually valued these principles, he would have freely given humanitarian aid to /all/ giants, and he would have done so long /before/ Voldemort's return. Picard would have offered help to the giants regardless of their immediate strategic value, and therefore would have formed a relationship with them /before/ such a relationship had strategic utility.

Dumbledore's morality was driven by his sympathy and empathy towards specific people. Dumbledore's clumsy attempts at diplomacy came too late to be effective, or were too personal to make a difference in the grand scheme of wizarding society. Picard's morality was more concerned with the logistics of a system, and how that system effected the liberty and prosperity of the individuals within it. This is why Picard would have been so much more effective at creating meaningful change.

And I'm not implying that Picard doesn't feel sympathy for the individual, or that he doesn't value personal relationships --- it's just that Picard was intellectually aligned with his moral code. Picard believed that his philosophy was not only ethically correct, but also that was also strategically correct, especially when it came to the bigger picture of establishing a better world. In contrast, Dumbledore struggled to find common ground between his empathy for the individual and his logical pursuit of a better world in general. This incoherence made him ineffective.

If we bring this back to [[/u/Starfox5]]'s original proposition (that murdering Malfoy was the ethical thing to do), then I think Dumbledore would agree that killing Malfoy was ultimately in the best interests of the wizarding world, but Dumbledore's empathy for Malfoy as an individual is what stayed his hand. Picard, however, would logically oppose Starfox's ideology on all grounds. In Picard's philosophy, there is no conflict between empathy and the (lowercase) greater good.

  I agree, though I feel Dumbledore got extremely lucky that the world just happened to back him up. Dumbledore is very very very very very very very very very lucky that love protection magic just happens to transfer with blood resurrections. Whether he planned it or not, he is lucky that the world/science/magic/whatever just happens to function in a way that saves Dumbledore from having to make a much harder decision. He's one lucky bastard.

I think you're probably right, but at the same time we don't know how Dumbledore would have acted if magic didn't function the way it did. If the canon solution to Dumbledore's predicament wasn't viable then Dumbledore may have found another way to salvage the situation. Dumbledore was extremely intelligent, and I don't think we can discount the possibility of him succeeding through alternate means.

Also, I don't think we can claim that magic was stacked against Voldemort. If we take away Lily's love magic, then wouldn't it also be fair to take away Voldemort's Horcruxes? Voldemort had plenty of magical advantages that were only available to somebody truly evil. If we take away the righteous and loving side to magic, then we are not making magic more neutral, we are instead making it more inherently aligned with evil.

That all being said, I don't disagree with what you're saying. You're absolutely right that Voldemort was the architect of his own defeat.

And sorry I haven't replied to your other post. I'm a little overwhelmed trying to keep up with this thread. The long story short is that I agree with most of your analysis, and you've changed many of the opinions I had about Dumbledore prior to making this thread. Thanks for enlightening me.

  I'm on board with like most of this, but what do you mean "Dumbledore prefered violence?"
#+end_quote

Perhaps he didn't explicitly prefer violence, but his methods certainly left violence as the only available recourse.

  Is it not possible for Dumbledore to have to Hokey's memory about Hufflepuff's cup and for him to also not realize what Riddle had wanted it for?
#+end_quote

Perhaps, but at that point Dumbledore probably also had Slughorn's altered memory, and I don't think it would have been hard to put two and two together.
