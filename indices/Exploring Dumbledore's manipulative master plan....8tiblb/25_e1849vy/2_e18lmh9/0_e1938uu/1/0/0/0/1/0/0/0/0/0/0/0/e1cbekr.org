I said already that if Dumbledore can stop Malfoy by other means, he should do so. Ruin him, imprison him, whatever. But if none of that works, then killing him is the only moral choice - letting Malfoy be is endangering innocents.

And in canon, Dumbledore founded a vigilante organisation to fight Voldemort, so obviously he was willing to break the law to fight.
