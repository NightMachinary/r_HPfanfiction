I think anyone risking innocents in order to protect the guilty is failing the basic morality check. This isn't about "the end justifies the means" or "the greater good", it's a basic, fundamental moral matter: If the only way to protect an innocent, especially a child, is to kill an aggressor, then that's the only moral choice. Whether you believe in the ends justify the means or not - risking children when you could save and protect them is wrong anyway.

We're not talking about Garak here, or any other strawman, we're not even talking about a suspected Death Eater here. We're talking about Malfoy who has been revealed without a doubt as the mastermind behind a plot to mass-murder children. Leaving him alive and/or able to continue with his next attempt, in power and able to influence and corrupt the Ministry, is utterly unacceptable.
