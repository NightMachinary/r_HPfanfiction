  That's is a very fun idea. Most people bash Dumbledore because they think he believes in the Greater Good, but you're criticizing him for not believing in the Greater Good. It's an interesting switcheroo.

I was thinking exactly the same thing - it /is/ a nice switcheroo because while I find the idea of flat out murdering Malfoy completely reprehensible, vile, immoral, and a slippery slope towards evil and a solution that does not consider the mental health of the attacker and ignores the moral code of the story (in this case specifically Dumbledore's line, "Killing is not so easy as the innocent believe"), and ignores that this would give the younger Malfoy a legitimate reason to seek revenge just as Harry does to Voldemort, I can, /at the very least/, consider it a more self-contained solution than the other interpretations of Dumbledore that expect him to pull everything off perfectly without ever getting his hands dirty or messing up. At least a murderous Dumbledore solves /that/ double-standard, even if it would probably inevitably fail.

This is not the first time I've seen someone claim that murder, torture, and removing the rights of Death Eaters is the "right" way to govern, but I always find it terrifying.

  Dumbledore is an odd case, because I think he's torn between those radically different philosophies. Logically, Dumbledore agrees with Garak's mindset --- he can rationalize committing small acts of evil in order to prevent a greater tragedy --- but emotionally, he feels more closely aligned with Picard --- Dumbledore is very empathetic, and he's consumed by guilt for his sisters death.

REMEMBER ME FALLING IN LOVE, WELL IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN. I love the above comparison, and I think it's incredibly fitting. That was an amazing analogy.

  Dumbledore is indecisive and contradictory throughout the books because his logic and emotions are at odds with each other. This dichotomy is why Dumbledore fucks up. For example, Dumbledore knows that it's strategically beneficial to treat Harry like a child soldier, but emotionally Dumbledore is compelled to let Harry enjoy his school life without the knowledge of the prophecy hanging over his head. It's this sort of compromise that leads to most of Dumbledore's mistakes.

HOW HAVE YOU PHRASED THIS SO WELL AND SO CONCISELY? I feel I've never phrased it so well in my several years of trying to get this point across. I love it, I'm saving it, I will make sure to credit you if I ever reference this.

  Also, I think it's worth pointing out that having empathy wasn't Dumbledore's weakness; Dumbledore's weakness was that he struggled to reconcile his empathy with his intelligence. If Dumbledore was more like Picard --- if he rejected the Greater Good based on logical and intellectual grounds --- then perhaps he would have been more effective than he was in canon.

  If Picard was in Dumbledore's position, he would have invested far more time trying to redeem wizarding society on a fundamental level. Picard would have created a system in which the Blood Purist ideology could not thrive. However, Dumbledore did not value bureaucracy, truth, ethics, rule-of-law or diplomacy in the way that Picard does, and so he never focused on fixing the institutionalized corruption and bigoted culture that allowed Voldemort to rise to power so easily.

I think this is a beautiful thought and I once again love the comparison, but I also have to be the "well, actually" person and say that Dumbledore does seem to have tried to change the idealogy of society as well - although clearly was unsuccessful. Dumbledore's reputation (so long as we assume it's earned) is about reaching out to other magical creatures in friendship and understanding, he's learned many languages in order to effectively communicate with others, he understands without criticism how to work with giants, centaurs, merpeople, and house-elves and is unafraid to disagree with the Minister when he is blaming things on Madame Maxime. While we don't witness all the direct examples of Dumbledore's advocacy for these people and creatures, it is highly implied that they happened because many characters criticize and/or praise Dumbledore for exactly these things - Malfoy, Voldemort, Fudge, Rita Skeeter, Doge, etc. And considering all those people have varying motives for describing Dumbledore and yet all agree that he has done this work, I think it's safe to say that Dumbledore /has/ tried very hard to change the purist ideology.

  On the other hand, if Garak was in Dumbledore's position, then Voldemort probably would have been defeated far sooner. However, in the process of doing so, Garak would have tortured, murdered, and ultimately utilized the very same tactics that made Voldemort so abhorrent. Garak's methods would not create a stable foundation for a new world --- he would have violated all the lofty ideals on which one could base a better society --- and stability would only ever be found through continued violence. If you just assassinate every suspected Death Eater then you've legitimized murder and laid the seeds for future revenge. What then? Do you preemptively kill the Death Eater's children? Or do you just naively hope that your enemies offspring will behave more honorably than you did? There are long term consequences to abandoning due process and empathy. A world populated by the likes of Garak would not be a world worth fighting for.

:D :D :D :D :D :D completely agree. Sorry for pretty much highlighting entire paragraphs of yours, but I can't decide which sentence to highlight, so here we are.

  In the end, I think Dumbledore found a way to square his utilitarian perspective with his conscience. Dumbledore's final plan turned love itself into a weapon.
#+end_quote

I agree, though I feel Dumbledore got extremely lucky that the world just happened to back him up. Dumbledore is /very very very very very very very very very/ lucky that love protection magic just happens to transfer with blood resurrections. Whether he planned it or not, he is lucky that the world/science/magic/whatever just happens to function in a way that saves Dumbledore from having to make a much harder decision. He's one lucky bastard.

This is like Inception levels of interpretation now, but I think the reason Dumbledore got extremely lucky is because the utilitarian method just happened to eventualy coincide with morality and humanity in this one particular instance - and not because Dumbledore orchestrated it that way (though this comes down to the level of control we believe Dumbledore had), but because Voldemort accidentally did, and because Voldemort /kept/ doing so. I think Dumbledore really did not believe there was any hope for Harry - and then Harry miraculously discovers and attempts to save the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort and then he miraculously saves Ginny from the basilisk and Voldemort, and he refuses to let Peter Pettigrew be killed, and Voldemort steals his blood and Harry stood up to him, overpowered his wand, absorbed some of Voldemort's own magic, and escaped with Cedric's body. I think the end of GoF, Dumbledore is like "well, holy fuck, this kid really does have something, doesn't he?" and through analyzing how Harry's has succeeded, Dumbledore discovers that Harry's consistent power has been love. I don't necessarily believe that Dumbledore had always known it would be or that he planned for it.

And what I love /best/ about this series is that Harry is really not that unusual. His level of love is fairly standard to those around him. What makes Harry different from everyone else, what makes him more suitable to defeat Voldemort is not that he loves better or stronger than his friends, but that Voldemort gave Harry the connection that /weaponized/ Harry's love against himself. Voldemort really did create his own worst enemy and then continued to empower that enemy with each new attempt to do the opposite. Poor Voldemort, I almost feel sorry for the guy.

In the end, while Dumbledore did a helluva lot of work to ensure that Harry was the victor, it was still magic itself that dropped the first domino when it favored Lily over Voldemort.
