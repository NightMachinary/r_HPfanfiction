Part 1/2:

  However, what differentiates Dumbledore from Picard is that Dumbledore believed that those evil ideas where the fault of individual people, whereas Picard believed that individuals were the product of the underlying logistics of their environment.

I don't necessarily disagree (because I'm not really sure what your comparison means yet), but off the top of my head I can think of Dumbledore explaining that Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards. While one could interpret this as Dumbledore singling out the Black family specifically, as Harry thinks at first, I think in context it becomes clear that Dumbledore is speaking generally about wizardkind, and how both Sirius and Kreacher are symptoms of a larger societal problem, when Harry accuses Dumbledore of being a hypocrite for blaming Sirius for hating Kreacher, Dumbledore says,

#+begin_quote
  “Sirius did not hate Kreacher. He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.”

And I feel Dumbledore does more than just acknowledging this, but has acted on this too.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore only opened meaningful dialog with the giants when such a relationship became strategically significant, and he attempted to form a personal relationship, rather than creating systematic cooperation between cultures.
#+end_quote

One of the reasons the Gurg listened to Hagrid and Maxime was because the Gurg had heard of Dumbledore already and of his advocating for giant rights. Hagrid said,

#+begin_quote
  "He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say."
#+end_quote

In light of Dumbledore having done this in peacetime, it seems to me that you are saying this was still insufficient. But what is the better option, then? Should Dumbledore have personally befriended all types of magical beings and been their white knight? What's the balance of aid you're expecting? It sounds both impossible and dishonest, like white folks who qualify themselves by mentioning their black friends or Hermione who forces her ideals onto the house-elves. Or is it more that advocating for others isn't enough, it's got to actually work otherwise it's a reflection on the advocates intentions? Is the corrupt and stubborn Ministry not even a little responsible? Is Dumbledore responsible for all of them becoming better people?

#+begin_quote
  Picard would have offered help to the giants regardless of their immediate strategic value, and therefore would have formed a relationship with them before such a relationship had strategic utility.
#+end_quote

It seems to me that Picard and Dumbledore have this in common, then ... and I kind of want to read that fanfiction now... But I don't understand where your version of Dumbledore comes from. Where do you imagine he got his reputation from? Is everyone else lying when they attribute these qualities to Dumbledore?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's clumsy attempts at diplomacy came too late to be effective, or were too personal to make a difference in the grand scheme of wizarding society. Picard's morality was more concerned with the logistics of a system, and how that system effected the liberty and prosperity of the individuals within it.
#+end_quote

Are we talking about the same character? It seems plain to me that Dumbledore has devoted his life to inspiring others, especially the government, to be kind and humane. If he is less effective then Picard, then bully for Picard for having a better track on which to run, but I'm honestly confused on what grounds this criticism is laid against Dumbledore since the books seem to overwhelmingly imply and show Dumbledore saying and doing the things you say only Picard would do. The only fault I can think of is that Dumbledore turned down the Minister position making him less aptly-positioned to affect change than he might otherwise have done, but I feel condemning that choice is ignoring Dumbledore's attempts to deal with his own inner personal problems and demanding that he simply not /have/ personal problems so that he can fix all the world's problems instead. Is this the price Dumbledore must pay for being intelligent? Is Dumbledore's problem that he is so close to perfect that his imperfections appear much worse than they would on anyone else? Is his flaw being clumsier than a god? I'm asking this from the perspective that Dumbledore is much closer to the Picard that you've laid out. When bad things happen around Picard, is it because he started too late to make friends? Is Picard also responsible for the choices and actions of everyone else in his world?

#+begin_quote
  Picard believed that his philosophy was not only ethically correct, but also that was also strategically correct, especially when it came to the bigger picture of establishing a better world. In contrast, Dumbledore struggled to find common ground between his empathy for the individual and his logical pursuit of a better world in general. This incoherence made him ineffective.
#+end_quote

In the context that our conversation is mostly about preventative measures and fixing society during peacetime, then I fail to see where Dumbledore's ideology is conflicted. I love your analysis that Dumbledore /during wartime/ has discovered that the best way to save the world does not align with his ideology, but all you have convinced me of in this post is that Picard's god dealt him convenient cards and Dumbledore's god dealt him shitty ones. What would happen if Picard found himself in Dumbledore shoes - would magic alter itself to Picard's authority? Would it suddenly function differently to save Picard from making difficult choices? If your answer is that Picard would have solved the problem sooner, do you mean to say that Dumbledore didn't try to? Is there a religious faith element at play I'm missing, where if one believes strongly enough, that god will alter things to help?

After Grindelwald and before Harry, what incoherence do you mean? What is causing this conflict in Dumbledore's mind? Are you saying he is selfish for advocating for giant rights during peacetime because it's somehow clear he is not doing it for the giants' own good, but in preperation for a future conflict?
