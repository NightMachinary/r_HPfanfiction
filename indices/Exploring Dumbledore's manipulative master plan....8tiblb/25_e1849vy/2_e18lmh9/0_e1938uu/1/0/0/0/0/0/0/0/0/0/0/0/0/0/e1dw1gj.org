If there is no competent, benevolent government, then letting children get murdered while working on reforming the government is not morally acceptable. You can't build a benevolent, competent government on child murders.

However, a competent, benevolent government would absolutely condone Dumbledore's actions because, as I said, he'd only have done so if there were no other choice to save children. A government that values Malfoy's life more than it values the lives of his victims is not benevolent.

I'm not advocating an authoritarian government - I'm advocating doing what is needed to save children if there's no other choice, and rebuilding a better government at the same time.

  Can't you see the hypocrisy? You're not selling me on this idea.

It's really simple: If you need to save children from being murdered, then that takes precedence over following the law or obeying the government.
