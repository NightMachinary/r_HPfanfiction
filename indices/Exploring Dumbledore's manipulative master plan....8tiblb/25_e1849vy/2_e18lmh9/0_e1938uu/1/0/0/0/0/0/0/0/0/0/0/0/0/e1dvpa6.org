  It's not an either or - you kill Malfoy while you work for a better government. You kill Fenrir while you work on eradicating bigotry. But you can't create a better government without rooting out the causes of the corruption of the present government. And that means dealing with Malfoy and co.

You're wrong, because a better government would not condone your proposed murders, and everyone should be equal in the eyes of the law.

  If Dumbledore has no other option left than killing without due process to save innocent lives, then he is morally obligated to do so. If that means killing after killing, then so be it - the alternative is to let innocents die. You could argue that it's better to let a few dozen children die than to subvert the country to that degree, where Dumbledore runs everything - but I'd say that would be a clear case of the Grindelwald style "Greater Good" - putting ideals over the lives of innocents.

  The thing is that if Dumbledore has no other option than killing, then the Ministry is too far gone to be helpful, and you can't trust its justice any more. Him running everything is better than the alternative.

You're advocating for the creation of a "benevolent" totalitarian dictatorship. Such a system is not desirable in contrast to a constitutional democracy founded on strong ethical and empathetic ideals. This is the key difference between us; you don't recognize my style of government as being a credible "other option," while you present your totalitarian solutions as being "the only way."

You try to sanitize your totalitarian philosophy by appealing to emotion --- will somebody /please/ think of the children! --- and then you refuse to acknowledge the systematic failings of your philosophy and the inevitable suffering that will result from those failings. I mean, just look at the quote below --- you are rejecting idealism while simultaneously trying to appeal to my humanitarianism.

Can't you see the hypocrisy?
