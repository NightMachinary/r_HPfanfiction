  Dumbledore's vigilante group was illegal, but I thought we were discussing what should be allowed, meaning, what should be legal? Is that not what we were talking about?

Anything the Western Allies and the French Resistance did during WW2 should IMO be considered legal against Voldemort and Death Eaters, who were actually more evil than the Nazis in their essence. They couldn't afford to lose because the consequences would be ghastly, just consider what would happen if Voldemort got control over UK's nuclear weapons.
