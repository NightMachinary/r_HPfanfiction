If he could use the authorities, there would be no need to kill anyone. And Dumbledore isn't a school teacher - he's the most powerful and most dangerous wizard in Britain, maybe the world. He was the one who stopped Grindelwald, who had the Elder Wand. There's no one more suited than him - and I like to think that he wouldn't burden anyone else with killing, but shoulder that himself.
