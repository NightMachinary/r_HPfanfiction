  A government that values Malfoy's life more than it values the lives of his victims is not benevolent.

What victims? What are their names? How will they die? When? You say that a preemptive murder is the only solution, but I can't offer alternate solutions because you can't answer these questions. You are using ambiguity to justify certainty. You're peddling fear in the name of righteousness.

And please take note that I'm not asserting Malfoy's innocence. However, if you don't prove his guilt prior to passing out judgement then you are legitimizing a system of ethics that /will/ eventually condemn innocents to death. We cannot allow guilt to be determined on the basis of suspicion and speculation --- such a system would be rampant with corruption and abuse. The road from civil security to oppression is shorter than you think.

Even if Dumbledore was infallible in his judgement (which he wouldn't be), can you promise that his successor will be the same? What about his successors successor?

Every society in in the world that doesn't respect civil liberties is a shithole. Do you think that's just a coincidence? Do you think that happened by chance? You can't build a better government without ideals on which to base that government. A government cannot be benevolent without assumed innocence and due process.

And I am /not/ implying that inaction is appropriate. But if you think that murder is the only course of action, then you have to /prove/ it --- simply repeating that it's "the only way" isn't good enough. /Prove/ to me that it is indeed an ultimatum between lives. If you can't prove it, yet you still think preemptive murder is necessary, then you're advocating for a world in which death is dealt based on /feelings/ and not /fact/.
