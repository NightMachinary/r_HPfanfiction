Yeah, so I think we came back around to me not agreeing again. Just so my stance hasn't become muddled in this long conversation, my issue is not specifically with Dumbledore killing or not killing Malfoy in 1993, but that allowing this instance opens up the door for others to feel morally justified in murder, and it becomes much more difficult to enforce moral murders when most people do not consider themselves wrong. Everyone doing the murdering would /feel/ in the right. And I can't help be very confident that murdering Lucius would have given Draco the drive and passion to become a mini Lucius rather than the one incapable of murder. It seems that Dumbledore could kill Lucius and frame it on someone else, and then maybe Draco would not focus his anger at "the good guys", but then we are getting in really deep and it still only works with this single instance rather than as a blanket allowance.
