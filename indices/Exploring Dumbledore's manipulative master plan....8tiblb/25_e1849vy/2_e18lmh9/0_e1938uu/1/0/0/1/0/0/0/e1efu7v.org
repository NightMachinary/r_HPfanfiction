Part 2/2: [[/u/Just_in_it_for_memes]]

#+begin_quote
  If we bring this back to [[/u/Starfox5]] [-2]'s original proposition (that murdering Malfoy was the ethical thing to do), then I think Dumbledore would agree that killing Malfoy was ultimately in the best interests of the wizarding world, but Dumbledore's empathy for Malfoy as an individual is what stayed his hand. Picard, however, would logically oppose Starfox's ideology on all grounds. In Picard's philosophy, there is no conflict between empathy and the (lowercase) greater good.

I think that Dumbledore would agree with Picard on this one too and frankly I fail to even see much difference in this particular example between these objectives, because all I see is that Picard either may not be suited to resolve all types of conflicts (not to suggest that Dumbledore is) or alternatively that he lives in a convenient world where things always work out where moral fiber alone saves the day.

But since we're on the topic of Dumbledore considering murder - at the very core of the series is the theme of death, respecting it and developing a healthy view of it. The Deathly Hallows symbolize the different flaws of humankind and the objects are designed to exploit those flaws, consequently meaning that a person who masters the objects is less exploitable in those particular ways. The wand symbolizes our desire for power and those who seek it, but those who fight brazenly, loudly, and offensively with the wand are doomed to be attacked by like-minded people. Dumbledore, having very good reason to believe that Grindelwald had obtained that wand, and even despite believing that he, himself, was the more skilled wizard, did not go after him. His fear of learning about Ariana's death was /so strong/, that it both reveals the extent of his cowardice in the face of so many dying, but it also shows that his fear has eradicated any allure the wand might still have had. He finally went after Grindelwald not for the glory he'd gain, but because his shame was consuming him. That's how he won that wand, the opposite of glory and fame and confidence. Dumbledore never told anybody he had the wand either, because how could he? It would admit his greatest flaw - and Dumbledore's reward is readers interpreting his greatest flaw as a desire for power instead, and using that as the foundation on which they interpret all his actions. Even in Voldemort's war, he never sought out a fight, he only used the wand to protect others; therefore the wand couldn't exploit him. It's how Dumbledore describes Harry's use of the Invisibility Cloak, that Harry uses it to protect others from harm or death, implying that this is the correct or wise way to use the objects.

While Dumbledore is suited to handle the Elder Wand, it's the Resurrection Stone, the one designed to exploit those in grief, that Dumbledore fails, because he had hoped to see his family. This powerful wizard that can hold his own against the most skilled wizards, who understands the deepest laws of nature, who can produce the most impressive magic, foiled by something so mundane and average as grief.

Furthermore, Dumbledore spends an entire chapter convincing Harry in HBP that it is not the prophecy, but Harry's own will to avenge his parents, and everyone else, that is important in going after Voldemort - that the prophecy is meaningless to Harry, and all that matters now are the choices he and Voldemort make (which aligns with the prophecy anyway, because the prophecy does not prophesize that Harry will or must fight, it prophecizes that he could win. Even by the rules laid out there, it is still Harry's choice). But aaaaaaaanyway, Dumbledore acknowledges the legitimacy of avenging one's loved ones as the basis for going after Voldemort.

And this is the man who would consider killing Lucius in cold-blood? Dumbledore in one breath supports avenging loved ones and in another breath is the murderer? I'm not even sure why we're debating this because he not only didn't kill Lucius that time, but didn't kill any of the Death Eaters he caught in the battle at the Ministry and that /is/ a dire situation in which lives are immediately at risk, and yet he /still/ chose to imprison them. And not only that, but Dumbledore has a speech /to Malfoy's son/ about how they can protect him and his family and keep him safe, and if it weren't for Dumbledore's inability to communicate this offer to the Order, I fully believe they would have done so, because Dumbledore already has a history of protecting Voldemort's defectors - Snape! (sorry this paragraph is more responding to Starfox's comments than yours, I think)

I hate to resort to outside-book information, but JKR even has an entire article about almost this topic, called [[http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sno25c]["Why Dumbledore Went to the Hilltop"]] that explains his willingness to hear Snape out, who at the time of their meeting was not much better than Lucius.

  If we take away Lily's love magic, then wouldn't it also be fair to take away Voldemort's Horcruxes? Voldemort had plenty of magical advantages that were only available to somebody truly evil. If we take away the righteous and loving side to magic, then we are not making magic more neutral, we are instead making it more inherently aligned with evil.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand where this hypothetical is going. I suppose you can take away any magical element to consider how differently the character would have acted. So yeah, it would be interesting analyzing the books as if the Hocruxes didn't exist, but I'm failing to see what point it makes about Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps, but at that point Dumbledore probably also had Slughorn's altered memory, and I don't think it would have been hard to put two and two together.
#+end_quote

Do you think so? It seems much more likely that Dumbledore got the memory after GoF, prompting Slughorn to go into hiding for a year. Am I overlooking something that suggests Dumbledore got the memory beforehand? It seems incredible that Dumbledore would have not been focusing on Horcruxes for decades if he'd had that memory, especially in light of what he says in OotP about his figuring it out only after Harry handed him the diary.
