I disagree.

If Lucius had a gun pointed at a student's head, and he was about to pull the trigger, then using deadly force would indeed be ethically justified. However, unless there is an /imminent/ threat of violence, it is ethical to pursue other means of resolving conflict. That was Dumbledore's problem --- he didn't try anything, nor did he try to foster an environment in which other nonviolent options were viable.

It's very easy for you to present an ultimatum between dead Death Eaters or dead children, but that false dichotomy only has credibility under the threat of immediate and unavoidable violence, /or/ within such an unjust system that the threat of future violence is met with silence. In such a system, the ethical thing to do to is to change the system. To pursue private violence, in lieu of systematic change, is a surrender to the existing institutionalized injustices. To murder Lucius in 1992, in fear of an unspoken future threat, would be an implicit acknowledgement of the status quo as being either acceptable or unchangeable. Dumbledore did have opportunities to potentially instigate systematic changes, which could have then offered alternative resolutions, but he did not pursue those possibilities.

Dumbledore didn't take the position of Minister, even when it was offered to him, yet that would have allowed him to tackle the corruption within the Ministry. Despite being Headmaster, Dumbledore allowed a culture of bigotry within Hogwarts. Dumbledore didn't publicly accuse Lucius of orchestrating the opening of the Chamber of Secrets. Even if Dumbledore lacked concrete proof, he should have voiced the truth anyway, because the truth has inherent value beyond its strategically exploitable utility.

Dumbledore was not a man of diplomacy or honesty; Dumbledore preferred secrets and violence --- just like what you're advocating for now. From within the framework of your perspective, it might indeed seem like Dumbledore was immoral for not fully embracing violence, but that's only because your philosophy is too narrow --- it's insulated from the wider context, and from the wider responsibilities that come with power.

  We're not talking about Garak here, or any other strawman

Garak wasn't meant to be a strawman. He's extremely charismatic and articulate, and he defends his opinions well. In that scene I linked Garak was the one with the moral high ground, and his actions went on to save hundreds of billions of lives.
