I'm trying to figure out if, during peacetime, it was Dumbledore's responsibility or the government's to make the call of life and death. I'm willing to change my mind, but currently I feel that governments, rather than headmasters, have more responsiblity to enforce national security during peacetime, which is when Lucius gave Ginny the diary. During wartime, then I'm much more on board with the French Resistance. For wartime politics, the rules often change, because what is legal is usually determined by the winning side.
