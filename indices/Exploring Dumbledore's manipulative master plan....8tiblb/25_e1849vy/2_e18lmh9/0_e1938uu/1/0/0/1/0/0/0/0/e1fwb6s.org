  ... all you have convinced me of in this post is that Picard's god dealt him convenient cards and Dumbledore's god dealt him shitty ones. What would happen if Picard found himself in Dumbledore shoes - would magic alter itself to Picard's authority? Would it suddenly function differently to save Picard from making difficult choices? If your answer is that Picard would have solved the problem sooner, do you mean to say that Dumbledore didn't try to? Is there a religious faith element at play I'm missing, where if one believes strongly enough, that god will alter things to help?

Picard is indeed forced to make some shitty decisions throughout the series. There are lots of times when his duties irrevocably conflicted with the realities of his circumstances. Things didn't always work out the way he wanted. And for the record, Picard wasn't a Mary Sue; he did have flaws, but most of those flaws manifested within his personal life, and they didn't effect his decisions as Captain. As a Captain, it is hard to find fault with Picard's decisions.

So you're totally right to call me out for criticizing Dumbledore for not being perfect. In truth, Picard is close to what I would consider an ideal leader. To compare Dumbledore to this ideal isn't fair. My intentions when making this comparison weren't to insult Dumbledore, or to say "/my/ character is better than /your/ character." I was simply trying to establish where Dumbledore differentiates from the ideal, and I wanted to do it strictly from the perspective of his philosophies, rather than focusing on the more boring quantifiable aspects of competence (like intelligence or cunning or whatever).

I dunno. It was probably unwise of me to bring Star Trek into this at all, because it's a comparison that only makes sense if you're familiar with both franchises, but I'm in too deep now to back off. I just feel like there's a fundamental difference between the themes of Start Trek and the themes of Harry Potter, and I am personally more aligned with Star Trek's philosophy, even though I'm struggling to actually articulate what those differences actually are.

  And this is the man who would consider killing Lucius in cold-blood? Dumbledore in one breath supports avenging loved ones and in another breath is the murderer? I'm not even sure why we're debating this because he not only didn't kill Lucius that time, but didn't kill any of the Death Eaters he caught in the battle at the Ministry and that is a dire situation in which lives are immediately at risk, and yet he still chose to imprison them. And not only that, but Dumbledore has a speech to Malfoy's son about how they can protect him and his family and keep him safe, and if it weren't for Dumbledore's inability to communicate this offer to the Order, I fully believe they would have done so, because Dumbledore already has a history of protecting Voldemort's defectors - Snape! (sorry this paragraph is more responding to Starfox's comments than yours, I think)

I agree with your assessment of Dumbledore. I just think that the /reasons/ for Dumbledore's altruism are different from Picard's.

Dumbledore would never murder somebody, because Dumbledore is too much of a good person. Dumbledore loves people. Dumbledore can empathize with someone who's gone down a dark path, because Dumbledore almost went down that path himself. Dumbledore knows people can change, because Dumbledore changed. Dumbledore simply cares too much for other people to murder them. On the other hand, even if you took away Picard's empathy, Picard still wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood, because he believes it is /illogical/.

For Dumbledore, morality is a conflict between what is ethically /right/ and what is /easy/. Within Dumbledore, ethics is a war between his benevolent emotions and the logic of the Greater Good.

The general philosophy of Star Trek is very different; Picard believes that good and evil is a conflict between benevolent logic and malicious instinct. In Star Trek, evil is usually presented as the perversion or abandonment of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deq6_p47g54][logic]].

This is not a superficial difference. You mentioned how I could fault Dumbledore for not accepting the position and responsibilities of the Minister of Magic, but you didn't explore /why/ he refused that position. Dumbledore doesn't trust himself with that much authority. He worries that his empathy won't keep his logic in check.

You then go on to say that I can't blame Dumbledore for being "too intelligent," but that implies that intelligence --- that logic itself --- is in opposition to benevolence. This is the significant difference in personal philosophies that makes Picard more effective than Dumbledore. Picard feels awkward and unbalanced /outside/ of a position of authority. Picard relishes command; he /wants/ the personal responsibility that comes with leadership, because there is no internal conflict between his intelligence and his benevolence.

This isn't a fair point when the magic within the Potter universe was designed by JK Rowling explicitly to justify her philosophy that love conquers all.

On the other hand, half of all Star Trek episodes are resolved by the crew making some logical deduction that leads to a new scientific revelation, engineering breakthrough or cunning maneuver. Star Trek could be characterized as a show about pursuing the truth --- whether it be scientific truth, personal truth or ethical truth --- and that goes hand-in-hand with pursuing power. After all, you do not become weaker by learning something. Knowledge is power.

However, Rowling would classify the pursuit of power as fundamentally evil. I mean, in Harry Potter, ambition is the virtue of a Slytherin. It is the virtue of the bad guys.

  "And a thirst... to prove yourself..."

According to Dumbledore, what makes Harry a true Gryffindor (a good guy) is that he chose to reject his Slytherin qualities --- he rejected ambition. And in the end, Harry doesn't win because he worked at improving himself, he won because he rejected power (the Elder wand) and because of love (made possible by the magic system).

But take a look at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuzh6RT0wx8][this scene]].

#+begin_quote
  "I know I've got something to offer, I just need a chance to prove it"
#+end_quote

Even if it's not word-for-word the same as the quote from the Sorting Hat, you've got to admit that they're pretty close. Yet look at how differently ambition is portrayed. And I'm not implying that Dumbledore would have disproved of that Star Trek scene --- he probably would have commended Nog for his self-determination --- but you can't deny that there is a /tone/ of disapproval within Rowling's work towards power and ambition.

And why is that? Ambition is not /inherently/ evil. Seeking power for power's sake is ethically /neutral/ --- it's what you /do/ with that power that actually matters.

When you place logic and empathy in opposition with each other your cause is crippled by the incoherence. Dumbledore didn't accept the position of Minister because he was too "wise" to seek power, despite being the most benevolent and intelligent wizard in Britain. How is that an effective philosophy? This philosophy means that the people best suited for power are the least likely to seek it. You can't put logic and benevolence in conflict without in turn handing power to the incompetent or evil. Ironically, the negative consequences of Rowling's philosophy are actually present within her work; Voldemort (evil) and Fudge (illogical) are the two most powerful wizards for a time.

 

Man, it took me far too long to write this up, and it's only now that I read through it in its entirety that I realize how rambling it all is. I was trying to articulate this /feeling/ I have about where Dumbledore's philosophy falls short, but I think ended up abstracting everything to the point that it lost any coherent point I might have made.

But oh well, I've invested too much energy in this wall of text to delete it now.

  Should Dumbledore have personally befriended all types of magical beings and been their white knight? What's the balance of aid you're expecting? It sounds both impossible and dishonest, like white folks who qualify themselves by mentioning their black friends or Hermione who forces her ideals onto the house-elves.

The Federation has a strict policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign societies. This is quite literally their Prime Directive. But in my personal opinion, Picard is /too/ respectful of other cultures. While Picard does violate the Prime Directive when faced with a humanitarian crisis, I actually think he perhaps doesn't violate it often enough.
