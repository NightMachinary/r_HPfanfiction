If Dumbledore has no other option left than killing without due process to save innocent lives, then he is morally obligated to do so. If that means killing after killing, then so be it - the alternative is to let innocents die. You could argue that it's better to let a few dozen children die than to subvert the country to that degree, where Dumbledore runs everything - but I'd say that would be a clear case of the Grindelwald style "Greater Good" - putting ideals over the lives of innocents.

The thing is that if Dumbledore has no other option than killing, then the Ministry is too far gone to be helpful, and you can't trust its justice any more. Him running everything is better than the alternative.

And yes, this method is only needed when the government is neither benevolent nor competent - that's why it's a last resort. It's not ideal - but the alternative, letting Nazis commit mass-murder, is unacceptable.

What would you do if the only way to save children were to murder each and every Nazi trying to kill them?
