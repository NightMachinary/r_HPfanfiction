It's not an either or - you kill Malfoy while you work for a better government. You kill Fenrir while you work on eradicating bigotry.

But you can't create a better government without rooting out the causes of the corruption of the present government. And that means dealing with Malfoy and co.

The thing is, in canon, Dumbledore did nothing and we ended up with a genocidal regime. Countless muggleborns paid the price. He could and should have done something. The mere fact that Malfoy was still powerful enough to affect the plot after book 2 shows that Dumbledore failed to fulfil his moral obligation to protect the innocents. (And I'm convinced that had he not been reduced to a plot device, he would have acted against Malfoy.)
