It's what happens in real life. It might not be perfect, it might not work on everyone, but it certainly is good enough.

That's the crux with all this drivel about how "complicated" things are: Yes, it won't solve all problems. But it will solve enough on a balance. It's like Child Protection Services. Yes, installing CPS will lead to false positives and trouble for innocents. But it will also help a ton of children and generally make a country a better place.
