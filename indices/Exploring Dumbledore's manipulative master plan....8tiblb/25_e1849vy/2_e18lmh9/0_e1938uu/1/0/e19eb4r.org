The thing is, he made too many mistakes to keep such a plan going - and he avoided the most obvious ways to keep the plan going, like guarding Harry better, especially after the assassination attempt by Dementors - after which it was clear that either the blood protection wasn't working, or someone not connected to Voldemort was trying to kill him.

I think you need not just look at what Dumbledore had done and try to find explanations for it, but at what Dumbledore should have done, if your explanations were true, at each important step. And that is where the whole theory of a master plan gets derailed, because Dumbledore simply made too many obvious mistakes without ever learning from them. Ultimately, he, and every other character, was a plot device that did exactly what was needed for the plot, and nothing else.
