  Wow. Dumbledore wanted to get thrown out because he wanted to focus on Horcruxes... And he couldn't, well, step down and choose a successor who wouldn't torture kids? And who wasn't a bigot worse than some Death Eaters? And that's why he came back and became Headmaster again? Kids getting tortured is beneficial? And don't give me the shit about "Dumbledore didn't know": If he's teh master planner you portray him as, he knew - he'd never let Umbridge act freely without keeping an eye on at least the best hope, aka Harry - especially after Harry almost got killed by Dementors despite the blood protection! Also, no kidnapping is inevitable.

Sorry, I didn't mean to say that the Umbridge being at Hogwarts was beneficial. 1995 was a bad year for Harry, and everything he had to deal with was bullshit.

What I meant was that the cold war of 1995 helped Dumbledore more than it helped Voldemort. Voldemort was afraid of making any big moves without knowing what the prophecy had to say. This meant that during 1995, Voldemort wasn't pursuing his win conditions to the full extent of his abilities --- he wasn't trying to assassinate Dumbledore, he wasn't killing, bewitching and threatening Ministry officials, and he couldn't even try to kill Harry because he needed Harry to get the prophecy.

On the other hand, Dumbledore could focus almost entirely on hunting Horcrux's. The Ministry seizing Hogwarts didn't delay or impede the Horcrux hunt.

If the war between Dumbledore and Voldemort was a race, then during 1995 Voldemort was taking small, timid steps, and Dumbledore was taking long and confident strides.

  That he couldn't protect kids and fellow order members also doesn't jive with your "he didn't want to sacrifice Harry" idea.

Not wanting to sacrifice someone and not being able to save someone are very different things.

Even as Headmaster, Dumbledore was rarely at Hogwarts throughout 1996. Harry often comments on Dumbledore's long absence from school. Of course, Dumbledore had to return to Hogwarts occasionally, like to teach Harry about the Horcrux's, or to see Slughorn's memory.

I guess it wasn't inevitable, but it was necessary if Dumbledore wanted to kill Voldemort without killing Harry.
