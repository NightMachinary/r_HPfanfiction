But the thing is, Dumbledore could have easily dealt with Umbridge. Hell, he should have easily dealt with Malfoy and co. long, long before Harry even started at Hogwarts, but at the very least, he should have taken Malfoy out - if needed with assassination - after the scumbag tried to mass-murder children with a basilisk at school. After that, Dumbledore had a choice to make: Kill Death Eaters, or risk innocent children. And no good Dumbledore would chose Malfoy's life over innocents. Hell, he could have easily framed Malfoy for the basilisk, faked the evidence, after killing Malfoy at Hogwarts.

And no, Dumbledore wasn't averse to killing, or he'd never have planned to kill Voldemort.

You can twist things as you want, they won't ever make sense enough to cover massive plot holes.
