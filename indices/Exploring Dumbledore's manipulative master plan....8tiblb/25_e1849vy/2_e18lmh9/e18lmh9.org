  A man able to outthink and outplay Voldemort to that degree, stymied by Fudge, Umbridge and the Malfoys?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore was never outsmarted by Fudge. He wanted Umbridge to kick him out of Hogwarts so that he could focus on the Horcrux hunt without being bogged down with his responsibilities as Headmaster.

The status quo of the fifth book is actually strategically beneficial for Dumbledore --- it delayed Voldemort from reaching his win-conditions, and it gave Dumbledore time and opportunity to pursue his own win-condition. I'll add another bonus theory to my original post if you want more details.

  Further, how could he arrange Harry's kidnapping, yet not save Cedric?

He didn't arrange Harry's kidnapping; he just knew that the kidnapping was inevitable.

As for the rest of your post, you have to remember that Dumbledore isn't a God. He's just some dude. He's a random schmuck trying to make the best of a bad situation. And Dumbledore makes mistake --- his plan for the Elder Wand was a total fuck up. Dumbledore tried his best, and in the end his best /was/ good enough.
