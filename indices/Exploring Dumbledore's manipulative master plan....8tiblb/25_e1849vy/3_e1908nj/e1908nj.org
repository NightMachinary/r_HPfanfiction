While I disagree with your conclusion, I agree with your questions. A Dumbledore that pulls off his first plan without a hitch makes it appear like Dumbledore could have prevented a lot of bad things from happening if he just put in the effort. Consequently, he appears callous for not having tried. I would even say that this is the natural foundation for eventual Dumbledore bashing. If we do not expect these amazing long-term plans to come off without a hitch, then we would never assume he can fix anything, and we would not put the world on his shoulders.
