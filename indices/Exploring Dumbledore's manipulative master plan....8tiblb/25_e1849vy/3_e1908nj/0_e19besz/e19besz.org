As I said in another post, this plan probably wasn't exactly what Dumbledore was originally aiming for.

Dumbledore's initial plan might have looked something like this:

- *STEP 1:* Destroy the Philosopher's Stone, so Voldemort is forced to use the Resurrection Ritual to regain his former power.
- *STEP 2:* Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
- *STEP 3:* Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.
- *STEP 4:* Protect Harry, and help him grow into a good and competent adult.
- *STEP 5 (a):* Lie to Harry, and tell him he needs to be killed by Voldemort to destroy the Horcrux within his scar.
- *STEP 5 (b):* Harry willingly sacrifices himself to Voldemort.
- *STEP 5 (c):* Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.
- *STEP 5 (d):* Voldemort "kills" Harry.
- *STEP 5 (e):* The Horcux is destroyed by Voldemort, and Harry is protected from death by Lily's blood-love-enchantment, because Lily's blood is still flowing in the veins of Voldemort's resurrected body.
- *STEP 5 (f):* Because Harry believed he was going to die, and he willingly sacrificed himself to protect the people he loves, a /new/ blood-love-enchantment is created.
- *STEP 5 (g):* There are now two different sets of blood-love-enchantments, one that protects Harry, and one that protects everybody Harry sacrificed himself to save.

In this best case scenario, Dumbledore would have destroyed all the hidden Horcrux's prior to the ritual. Voldemort also would never kidnap Harry for the ritual --- Harry would give himself willingly to Voldemort, and so Voldemort would have been resurrected and fucked in the same night.

You can think of that plan I listed in my original post as the backup plan, that was made to account for Voldemort's successes and Dumbledore's mistakes.
