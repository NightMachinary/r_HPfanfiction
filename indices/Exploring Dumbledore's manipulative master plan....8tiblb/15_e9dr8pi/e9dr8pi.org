Let me start this by saying that I absolutely loved your analysis. I started reading fanfiction after all the books came out, and when I first read some of the evil Dumbledore fanfics I was astounded by how easy it was to twist Dumbledore's motives. I'll be honest, I enjoyed the trope a little bit but I realized that the basis of most of those fanfics was not an accurate analysis of Dumbledore's methods, but simply taking advantage of plot holes left by Rowling (for example the Potter's Fidelius Charm). I would however like to point out two things about Steps 1 and 2.

1) Dumbledore did not need to convince Voldemort that Harry was his main enemy. Dumbledore explains to Harry that whether he believes in the prophecy or not, Voldemort certainly does. He had already "marked Harry as an equal". And knowing Voldemort, being defeated by a baby would not sit well with him and he would try to right that wrong regardless. HOWEVER, he definitely tries to convince Voldemort that Harry has certain powers to defeat Voldemort by protecting the prophecy, leading Voldemort to constantly doubt his ability to kill Harry.

2) While it would make sense for Dumbledore to destroy the Philosopher's Stone for the sole purpose of pushing Voldemort towards the ritual of resurrection, I do not believe he would want his friend Flamel to die. This is where things get a little murky - if Dumbledore is willing to let Flamel die, just so that Harry MIGHT have a chance to survive based on a lot of guesswork, is that not evidence of him making a sacrifice for "The Greater Good"? I understand that destroying the Stone does not mean instant death for the Flamels, but the ultimate consequence is that the Flamels would eventually perish. I personally believe that he never destroyed the Stone. He just manipulated Voldemort into thinking that using Harry's blood to resurrect himself was his best option. (Which makes him even more of a genius.)
