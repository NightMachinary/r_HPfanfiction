The only thing he can? Yeah right! If it is so EASY to foist the child of on his muggle relatives (who hate magic - which Dumbledore knows ("...ten dark and difficult years...")) then it should be a hell of a lot easier to stuff him with some minions of his under a fidelius! Let them educate him, brainwash him with Dumbledore's ideas and ideology etc. you don't have to show him Diagon Alley or have him visit the ministry! Voldemort will be just as stumped if he can't find the child because of a fidelius (if Dumbledore makes sure that the secret keeper is genuine - Veritaserum would do wounders here, as would Legilimency!), not to mention that the love-protection only works against Voldemort and only once! The second time the killing curse hit Harry he did die after all, so a fidelius is probably the better option!
