Part 1/3:

I'm really excited to read this because I don't recognize you're username and it's rare to find someone who defends Dumbledore, and even if we disagree in the end somehow, we are both still clearly passionate about deciphering Dumbledore, and that's amazing in and of itself. I'm writing my comment as I go.

I'm especially curious what your interpretation is because of you singling out Philosopher's Stone, the book I generally consider too poorly written for us to understand on any meaningful level what's even happening.

#+begin_quote
  Before we begin analyzing Dumbledore's actions, we first need to deconstruct his motives.
#+end_quote

Very good chance I'm falling in love with you just for saying that.

#+begin_quote
  Contrary to what Rita Skeeter might say, Dumbledore does not believe in the Greater Good.
#+end_quote

And yep, I just fell in love. While I understand why this is a common belief, I also think that just a little analyzing makes it clear that Dumbledore is, at least, not following the same moral code he had as a teen.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore briefly considers adopting Harry himself.
#+end_quote

Obviously you said to consider this canon-compliant, so on that basis this is possible, but I would be very surprised if Dumbledore considered adopting Harry for more than a moment and I would also be surprised if his reason for not doing so had anything to do with the Ministry. I think he would at all cost want to avoid the thing that ended up happening anyway - caring about Harry. It is not in the world's best interest for Dumbledore to care what happens to Harry, and Dumbledore said he knew he must avoid it. I do like your point that there could be enough Death-Eater presence to prevent a successful adoption and that Dumbledore feared the delay could be fatal for Harry. While I do think the Death Eaters at the Ministry would all shitting their pants and pretending hands down they were Imperiused and the last thing they'd want to do is publicly disagree with Dumbledore, that doesn't mean Dumbledore would know that, and the fear of the Ministry that you've outlined still feels valid to me.

That's a round-about way of saying I agree with your conclusion, sorry about that - I just really really love analyzing Dumbledore.

Love your point on the Longbottoms. Dumbledore does say in OotP that Death Eaters were at large and almost as terrible as Voldemort and for that reason I feel perfectly justified in saying that Dumbledore would have feared Harry's safety at a regular household.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursley's love and spoil their existing son, and Dumbledore assumes they will treat Harry the way any decent people would treat their recently orphaned nephew.
#+end_quote

As much as it would make my life easier for this to be true, I have to say I can't consider this valid - Dumbledore says that he knew Harry would have ten dark years ahead of him. I think it's at least plausible that Dumbledore did not forget Petunia's teenage letter and was at least marginally aware that she and Lily had a falling out. However, I do agree with you that Dumbledore really could have had no way to know /how/ bad it would be for Harry. Not sure if you're going towards this thought, but I think Dumbledore should not be criticized for placing Harry /initially/ at the Dursleys as it frankly makes the most sense from any angle. And that anyone interested in criticizing Dumbledore for Harry's upbringing should instead criticize him for /keeping/ Harry at the Dursleys. Criticizing Dumbledore for placing Harry there shows an expectation of a Dumbledore who knows everything and can see into a future, which is expecting far too much perfection, I think.

Maybe you'll mention it later, but in case you don't, I really think a significant reason that Dumbledore keeps Harry at the Dursleys is the fear that he will care about Harry. What does anyone do when they are trying not to care about someone? Don't we all try our best to not think about that person? Don't we find things to distract us so we stop thinking about thm, don't we change our schedules to purposefully avoid them? I can think of several personal examples off the top of my head of friends who avoid their exes they still have feelings for and stuff like that - not going to certain restaurants anymore and that sort of thing. Maybe sometimes we begin to do this without even realizing it? I think this is what Dumbledore began to do. He placed Harry at the Dursleys, and maybe he was getting proper reports from Figg or maybe not, but either way, I think he intentionally (and to his discredit) tried to not think about Harry as a proper human being, because he would begin to care. It's the "trap" he mentions in OotP, and he says he started falling into the trap when Harry /entered/ Hogwarts, so doesn't it then follow that prior to Harry entering Hogwarts, Dumbledore was still successfully /not/ in that trap. It seems pretty clear to me that this means he (on some level intentionally) failed to meet Harry's basic needs.

#+begin_quote
  starting with an investigation of Tom Riddle's past.
#+end_quote

Again something that doesn't really make a difference so it doesn't really matter, but I tend to think that Dumbledore's research began long before Harry was even born, perhaps before Harry's parents were born, and that his research is the thing that prepared him for creating the Order of the Phoenix in the first place. It makes sense to me that Dumbledore, even as of Riddle's interview with Dumbledore for the DADA post, had already begun. But dates are (frustratingly and probably intentionally) vague and figuring out when he started the research doesn't really change much anyway.

#+begin_quote
  So, while Mrs. Figg was aware of the Dursley's dislike of Harry, she never knew the full extent of their neglect.
#+end_quote

I think it's very likely the Dursleys would be mortified with this news getting out and would forbid Harry to mention it. I would find it very strange that Harry would fail to tell any of his teachers or adults he sees at school but would think to tell Mrs. Figg, whom he sees roughly once a year on Dudley's birthday. This alone makes me think Harry doesn't tell /her/ even if he does have a loose tongue elsewhere. But while I'm extremely happy to get into the details of what I think Mrs. Figg knew, I also don't think it matters all that much - Mrs. Figg knew /enough/, and I feel that she's earned the right to be criticized for not doing more, as should Dumbledore (though obviously I think Dumbledore's reasons are a part of his interesting character arc).

#+begin_quote
  Eventually, though it's not clear exactly when, Dumbledore comes to the conclusion that Tom Riddle is using Horcruxes as his form of immortality. It doesn't take him long to figure out that Harry is also a Horcrux.
#+end_quote

Your phrasing suggests a couple things I disagree with. Dumbledore says this in OotP,

#+begin_quote
  "I guessed, fifteen years ago," said Dumbledore, "when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul. [...] You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.”

  [...]

  “What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard [...] it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work [...] But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read [...] he was being remarkably blasé about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. [...] The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. *It suggested that he must have made --- or been planning to make --- more Horcruxes*, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense.

  “Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. ‘Further than anybody,' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, *Horcruxes in the plural*, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil' . . .”
#+end_quote

Dumbledore has outlined the timeline of his thought process and says the earliest he considered /multiple/ Horcruxes (as opposed to just one) was when he heard about and saw the diary. And then still two years after that he gets more evidence. I suppose Dumbledore could have considered this sooner, even just as a passing thought, but nevertheless, I think it's possible that if Dumbledore can already recognize a Horcrux then it's likely he does not need to realize there were /many/ before suspecting what Harry is.
