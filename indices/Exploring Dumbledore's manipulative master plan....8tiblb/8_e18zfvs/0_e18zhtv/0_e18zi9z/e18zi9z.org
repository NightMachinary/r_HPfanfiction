Part 3/3: [[/u/Just_in_it_for_memes]]

  Even if we cast away all the speculation and focus purely on the established facts, there is an undeniable chain of cause and effect that begins in the Philosophers Stone and ends with Harry surviving his final encounter with Voldemort:

That only means the plot meets the bare minimum of what plots are meant to do, but that doesn't mean that Dumbledore orchestrated the causes. You can always look /back/ on plots and come up with ways in which it was all planned because /of course/ in hindsight you can track cause and effect, but just because things caused other things to happen does not prove /or/ disprove that those events were orchestrated. I bought a table from someone on Craigslist today because I moved apartments and I moved apartments because I got married, and I got married because I met a guy I fell in love with, but that does not mean the person who owned the table was behind me meeting my husband, even if I can track the cause and effect.

For example, I do agree with you that Voldemort realized Harry was a foe from meeting him at age 11, and I do think that that's why he wanted Harry's blood for his resurrection ritual, and I do think that that led to his own downfall, but just because Voldemort has a progression of knowledge that alters his choices does not mean that I'm convinced that Dumbledore orchestrated those events in his mind.

Everything you have said highlights specifically why I think people's interpretation of the first book greatly influences their entire interpretation of Dumbledore. My problem with that is that there is nothing concrete to work with in the first book, so readers choose a story that feels interesting to them which is great, but then they use that to explain Dumbledore's actions in the rest of the series, often forcing them to come up with convoluted ways to make it fit (like Dumbledore merely pretending to be sad in OotP because they can't possibly see a way that he's human enough to shed tears). While you have put a remarkable and amazing effort into understanding Dumbledore's actions in this book (that I truly love even if I disagree), most fans don't bother (not that they are obligated to). But maybe Harry was wrong. Maybe JKR was a bad writer. Dumbledore says in OotP that he began to fail at his plan after seeing Harry in the hospital wing, and yet none of that explanation shows up in your analysis. The multi-step plan you've highlighted as Dumbledore's original plan never veers off course as Dumbledore later says it had. Do you feel Dumbledore was lying to Harry in OotP as part of his plan? You also don't incorporate Dumbledore's death by the Resurrection Stone - had Dumbledore foreseen that as well? If not, where did Dumbledore see himself in his plan? How much did his own death effect things?

  I originally planned to do a detailed analysis of Dumbledore's decisions and accomplishments across every book, but I gave up.

Ooo, please do!! I'd love to read it!

  It's a good idea to have a back-up plan, yet no fanfics ever seem to consider that possibility.
#+end_quote

Nor do they consider the possibility that the plan Harry eventually fulfills /was/ the back-up plan.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore knew that Voldemort wasn't responsible for the dementor attack during the summer of Harry's fifth year
#+end_quote

Totally agree and I love this in Harry's hearing. Dumbledore knows someone else sent them, and I'm sure he's terrified of what the corrupt Ministry is capable of.

  Why would Dumbledore keep the real Stone in the mirror?
#+end_quote

I personally feel it was the real one and that Dumbledore did not intend Harry to remove it and was quite surprised and impressed when Harry did, but in the context of your theory, I really like the idea that it would be a fake. No use risking Voldemort getting the real one!

I want to acknowledge the immense effort this took and I'm really thrilled and happy that you care so much about Dumbledore to have written this. I also realized way too late just how different it is to analyze a book in the context of what is possible within canon-compliant fanfiction and to analyze a book as a self-contained literary written work. While there is obviously some overlap, the goals are just different enough that I realize that a lot of my critique of your analysis doesn't really apply to what you were going for. Fanfictions strongest quality is in playing around with ambiguous stuff, and that's as it should be. I'm used to analyzing the books with a slightly different goal, so I apologize for coming off as disagreeing with things that I see now are possibilities in fanfiction /because/ they are ambiguous.
