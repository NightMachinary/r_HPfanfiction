  Again something that doesn't really make a difference so it doesn't really matter, but I tend to think that Dumbledore's research began long before Harry was even born, perhaps before Harry's parents were born, and that his research is the thing that prepared him for creating the Order of the Phoenix in the first place. It makes sense to me that Dumbledore, even as of Riddle's interview with Dumbledore for the DADA post, had already begun. But dates are (frustratingly and probably intentionally) vague and figuring out when he started the research doesn't really change much anyway.

I agree. In my original outline for this post I hoped to begin with Trelawny's job interview and end with Dumbledore's death. When I narrowed the scope of my post I had to copy and past different stuff around, and it messed with the timeline a little. Dumbledore was definitely investigating Tom Riddle's past prior to the Potter's death, because otherwise he wouldn't have been able to get the memories of Hokey the house-elf, who died sometime in the 1950's.

  But while I'm extremely happy to get into the details of what I think Mrs. Figg knew, I also don't think it matters all that much - Mrs. Figg knew enough, and I feel that she's earned the right to be criticized for not doing more, as should Dumbledore (though obviously I think Dumbledore's reasons are a part of his interesting character arc).
#+end_quote

I think your analysis of Dumbledore's feelings is far deeper and far more accurate than mine.

However, I don't think we can criticize Dumbledore for leaving Harry with the Dursley's. Nothing in canon suggests that there was a viable alternative that would keep Harry safe. A miserable childhood is better than being murdered.

  Dumbledore has outlined the timeline of his thought process and says the earliest he considered multiple Horcruxes (as opposed to just one) was when he heard about and saw the diary.
#+end_quote

I think Dumbledore actually knew Voldemort had multiple Horcrux's prior to seeing the Diary. Tom Riddle's determination to acquire Helga Hufflepuff's cup wouldn't make sense if he only planned to create a single Horcrux --- Voldemort would /never/ choose a Hufflepuff relic over a Slytherin one --- unless he had already created a Slytherin themed Horcrux.

  Steps 5-6d I agree with, but I think Dumbledore can only possibly have planned these after the events at the Ministry in OotP. I would love to be convinced that he could have planned these things beforehand, but then this would make almost all of OotP confusing to me.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore felt triumphant after learning that Voldemort used Harry's blood during his resurrection. Triumph requires success, which requires an attempt, with implies a plan.

I'm sorry, but what specifically about OotP are you referring to?

  How could Dumbledore know that Neville will be good at Herbology? It's not even hinted at until GoF, right?
#+end_quote

Goblet of Fire is when Harry and the audience discovers Neville's talent, but it would have been clear to his Professors from the beginning. Harry never did any homework with Neville, and it's out of character for Neville to speak up during class, which is why Harry only learned of Neville's affinity for plants when Neville brought it up himself.

 

#+begin_quote
  While I do like the idea that the tasks would not have harmed underage wizards, I feel it compromises the safety of the stone - Voldemort could manipulate a student to steal the stone for him as he has proven with Hagrid and Quirrell that he is not above using and framing others.
#+end_quote

But it doesn't matter if it compromises the challenges, because the challenges are incredibly easy to begin with. I mean, 26 + 74 is a more difficult problem than 10 + 12, but would that difference be enough to stop Voldemort? And is the difference worth risking the lives of children? I don't think so.

 

#+begin_quote
  So far you have only talked about the tasks that lead to the stone and not how Dumbledore influenced Harry's interest in going after the stone in the first place.

Someone else in this thread linked to a [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160404122903/http://hpcompanion.com/ps/psessay/][great essay]] that I wish I'd read prior to making this thread. It goes into detail about some of this stuff.

 

#+begin_quote
  Do you feel Dumbledore was lying to Harry in OotP as part of his plan? You also don't incorporate Dumbledore's death by the Resurrection Stone - had Dumbledore foreseen that as well? If not, where did Dumbledore see himself in his plan? How much did his own death effect things?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore's /ideal/ plan might have looked something like this:

- *STEP 1:* Destroy the Philosopher's Stone, so Voldemort is forced to use the Resurrection Ritual to regain his former power.
- *STEP 2:* Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
- *STEP 3:* Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.
- *STEP 4:* Protect Harry, and help him grow into a good and competent adult.
- *STEP 5 (a):* Lie to Harry, and tell him he needs to be killed by Voldemort to destroy the Horcrux within his scar.
- *STEP 5 (b):* Harry willingly sacrifices himself to Voldemort.
- *STEP 5 (c):* Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.
- *STEP 5 (d):* Voldemort "kills" Harry.
- *STEP 5 (e):* The Horcux is destroyed by Voldemort, and Harry is protected from death by Lily's blood-love-enchantment, because Lily's blood is still flowing in the veins of Voldemort's resurrected body.
- *STEP 5 (f):* Because Harry believed he was going to die, and he willingly sacrificed himself to protect the people he loves, a /new/ blood-love-enchantment is created.
- *STEP 5 (g):* There are now two different sets of blood-love-enchantments, one that protects Harry, and one that protects everybody Harry sacrificed himself to save.

In this best case scenario, Dumbledore would have destroyed all the hidden Horcrux's prior to the ritual. Voldemort also would never kidnap Harry for the ritual --- Harry would give himself willingly to Voldemort, and so Voldemort would be both resurrected and fucked at the same time.

The plan we see in canon had been alternated to account for Voldemort's actions and Dumbledore's mistakes, but the major beats remained the same.

  Apparating is not mentioned at all in the first book. I think it's possible JKR hadn't invented all its rules yet.
#+end_quote

You're right. Floo Powder also didn't enter canon until later books. The real reason Dumbledore flew to the Ministry was because JKR hadn't yet conceived of other means of magical transport.

However, please indulge a thought experiment of mine: imagine that you (the person reading this) find a [[https://imgur.com/kMxt8QY][magical portal]] (bare with me) that transports you to the Potter universe.

Wow! You're in the Potter universe! There's Hogwarts! There's the Womping Willow! And holy shit, that's /Dumbledore/! This is so cool!

Naturally, the first thing you do is /demand/ that Dumbledore tell you why he flew to the Ministry in 1991.

So, how does Dumbledore respond? We can speculate, theorize and guess at what his answer might be, but whatever it is, it'll be something that makes sense /within his universe/. He won't blame JK Rowling, because she /doesn't exist/ in his universe.

It's those sort of questions that fanfiction can answer; we can create in-universe explanations for the meta-driven inconsistencies. That's what I've tried to do in this thread, and, like you said, you're approaching this from a different perspective. I think a lot of our disagreements come from the fact that you're willing to accept the plot holes for what they really are, but I'm still in denial.

But anyway, great posts. Sorry I didn't reply to every point you brought up. Your analysis of Dumbledore's feelings towards Harry was particularly interesting.
