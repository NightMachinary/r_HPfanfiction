  I agree. In my original outline for this post I hoped to begin with Trelawny's job interview and end with Dumbledore's death. When I narrowed the scope of my post I had to copy and past different stuff around, and it messed with the timeline a little.
#+end_quote

I totally understand! I have experience trying to fit all of Dumbledore's life into a single post as well and it is not only hard, I'm convinced it's actually impossible.

  However, I don't think we can criticize Dumbledore for leaving Harry with the Dursley's. Nothing in canon suggests that there was a viable alternative that would keep Harry safe. A miserable childhood is better than being murdered.
#+end_quote

I with you there, but I should clarify that I mean criticism in the literary sense - so it's not so much about what the reader concludes, but about the questions they're asking (and how they are asking them), which is really important in understanding Dumbledore's characterization. Being critical of him for Harry's upbringing is a start. It's a bit like the idea of "it's our choices that show us who we are". I don't think that means that our choices reveal if we are good or bad - that's far too black and white and I personally feel this series goes farther than that. I think it means that our choices reveal the very complex people we are and often betray our priorities to ourselves and to others - though I don't mean betray as necessarily a bad thing. Snape, so determined to be a Death Eater, was betrayed by his love of Lily and could never be a proper Death Eater again, and Dumbledore understood that and trusted Snape's deepest priority to defeat Voldemort because of that, despite how nasty Snape was, that foundational trust existed. Dumbledore reaching for the Resurrection Stone betrayed his commitment to understanding and respecting death and revealed how much the destruction of his family still affected him. Being critical to me is the process of dissecting and asking questions. Only that way can someone contextualize Dumbledore's choices and really understand why he made certain choices and what those choices show about him.

  I think Dumbledore actually knew Voldemort had multiple Horcrux's prior to seeing the Diary. Tom Riddle's determination to acquire Helga Hufflepuff's cup wouldn't make sense if he only planned to create a single Horcrux
#+end_quote

Is it not possible for Dumbledore to have to Hokey's memory about Hufflepuff's cup and for him to also not realize what Riddle had wanted it for?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore felt triumphant after learning that Voldemort used Harry's blood during his resurrection. Triumph requires success, which requires an attempt, with implies a plan.
#+end_quote

I do think Dumbledore had a plan, I just think it was a different one than you suggest, and I think he was failing at it, both from his own faults and also due to things outside of his control. This partly ties into the things in OotP I was referring to, so I'll answer that with this. I think Dumbledore's original plan had to have been pretty bad news for Harry, because Dumbledore himself implies that failing at his plan allowed Harry to have a normal childhood, meaning both that he definitely had a plan and also that succeeding at this plan would have (potentially) not allowed Harry to have a normal happy childhood. Dumbledore even goes so far as to admit that prioritizing Harry's happiness risked the lives of many and that Dumbledore "never believed he would have such a person on his hands".

Okay, so I can kind of tell I'm getting into my loooooong answer, so I'll link to [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/][this]] post which covers pretty much everything I think. But the short answer is that I think he knew Harry had to die if they had a hope of killing Voldemort. This is pretty bad, but in the meantime Voldemort aint back, so Dumbledore kind put it to the back of his mind. This is both good and bad - it's good in the context of what it tells us about Dumbledore's humanity - he does not /like/ the idea of hurting Harry. But it's bad because Dumbledore was not prepared for Voldemort's return - he had not yet told Harry about the prophecy and he was not ready to toss Harry into this world of Voldemort and burdens and all that awful stuff. Dumbledore freaked the fuck out because he had fallen into that trap of caring about Harry. The result is Dumbledore did not treat Harry like a cog in the machine nor did he treat him like a competant human and partner-in-crime, instead Dumbledore chose to coddle and hide information from Harry, which made sense to him at the time because Dumbledore believed himself to be allowing Harry's happy childhood to continue. In hindsight the problem was both that lying to Harry is never a good idea and also that Voldemort managed to infiltrate Harry's mind anyway and because Harry wasn't informed that this could happen, he did not realize it was a trick.

I think Dumbledore's actions in OotP are him reacting to Voldemort's surprise return. I also think that the events at the Ministry are the very things that lead to Dumbledore's new plan. One reason being that Dumbledore learns that Harry's mind is protected from Voldemort. I feel this is often overlooked when analyzing Dumbledore's planning timeline despite the problems and resolution of this issue being well outlined and explained in the fifth book. Dumbledore was terrified that Voldemort would use Harry's mind. This is even a legitimate reason that Dumbledore avoided Harry that year because every time they were near each other, Harry felt Voldemort rise inside of him, even Dumbledore says he could see it happening in Harry's eyes. Dumbledore guessed (correctly) that if that feeling was prominent enough Voldemort would feel it too and realize he had access to Harry's mind. Of course Voldemort realized this anyway when he felt Harry's presence while attacking Mr. Weasley, and so Dumbledore thought that Occlumency would do it. Dumbledore could not have known there was another option, because he does not fully understand the connection, in OotP we witness him trying to figure out what it really means through the "in essence divided" question he asked one of his magical instruments, and he also admits to Harry at the end of the book that he knew it was a connection to Voldemort, but he did not know exactly what it could do yet. But at the Ministry Dumbledore witnesses Voldemort possess Harry and /within seconds/ witnesses Voldemort flee Harry's mind because of the pain. Dumbledore now knows that Harry's mind is safe from Voldemort's attacks now, which is not something Dumbledore could have planned or had any control over, and I think was just as surprised as Voldemort was.

  "That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.‚Äù
#+end_quote

I think this revolutionized Dumbledore's plan - Harry's mind was now a safe place to put information. Beforehand, if Dumbledore had told Harry about Horcruxes, maybe Voldemort would see that in Harry's mind and know what they were after! But now Harry's mind is safe. Dumbledore has also simultaneously realized that he should not be coddling Harry, and has finally accepted that it's time to train and teach Harry, and these two things are why Dumbledore 180s from OotP to HBP - not to mention that his own death speeds things up. I agree with you that Dumbledore most likely originally intended to destroy the Horcruxes himself, but his own impending death prevents that from being a possibility.

#+begin_quote
  The real reason Dumbledore flew to the Ministry was because JKR hadn't yet conceived of other means of magical transport.
#+end_quote

I know I just said that, haha, but I prefer to leave it up in the air - while I /believe/ that JKR hadn't invented apparating yet, I don't know /for sure/ if that's the reason, so I prefer to say things like "it's plausible" or "it's possible". Sorry about being pedantic...

#+begin_quote
  It's those sort of questions that fanfiction can answer; we can create in-universe explanations for the meta-driven inconsistencies. That's what I've tried to do in this thread, and, like you said, you're approaching this from a different perspective. I think a lot of our disagreements come from the fact that you're willing to accept the plot holes for what they really are, but I'm still in denial.
#+end_quote

I completely agree, and I totally understand the basis for your analysis and realize that it's internally consistent within that framework. I agree with your mirror analogy and how you describe JKR not existing in the HP world and how fanfiction allows for us to explore the possiblities of the ambiguous. I totally support that and it's why fanfiction is so great.

#+begin_quote
  But anyway, great posts. Sorry I didn't reply to every point you brought up. Your analysis of Dumbledore's feelings towards Harry was particularly interesting.
#+end_quote

Thanks! And it's totally okay. My husband clocked it and said it took me five hours to read and respond to your post. I do not at all expect others to spend the time doing the same thing. The funny thing is, he seemed /surprised/. We were long-distance until very recently and he knows full well how devoted I am to Dumbledore analyses, and I'm like, "oh, yeah, that sounds about average for me" and he just could not believe I'd spend so long on one response. But I can't help it, I love talking about Dumbledore so much. :D
