  endangering Dumbledore's whole supposed plan
#+end_quote

This is what I find so confusing too - my issues with some of the theories I've seen is often not that I refuse to believe Dumbledore would manipulate things, but that if he /were/ going to do that, then I think he would have done it a different way. The biggest one off the top of my head is why would a Dumbledore who is preparing Harry for his Voldemort-filled future be so concerned about not letting Harry know? Firstly - eleven-year-old Harry believed he was being helped anyway, secondly, Harry is good at keeping secrets, thirdly, Harry is jumping at any chance to be the hero. He is so obviously willing to be trained and primed and prepared - why would Dumbledore ever feel the need to /pretend otherwise?/

On top of that, Dumbledore himself explains in OotP that he realized in hindsight that Harry was everything I just said above and admits that he had not allowed himself to realize this because it meant he woudl have to burden Harry. As far as I see it, this supports the idea that Dumbledore was /not/ training Harry at least between the end of the first book and the end of the fifth.

I could be wrong, but I'm getting the vibe that you are speaking about the entire series, while I'm speaking specifically about the first book and maybe the second and third. But by the fourth, and especially by the fifth, I think Dumbledore becomes very well written. I would not say that competant/benevolent/wise is the Dumbledore I'm defending, because I think he's very flawed, I just credit those flaws to cowardice and fear rather than to malevolance or lack of concern.
