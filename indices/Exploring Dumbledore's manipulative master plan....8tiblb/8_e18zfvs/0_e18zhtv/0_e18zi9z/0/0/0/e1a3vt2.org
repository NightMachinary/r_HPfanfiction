The sixth book ruins everything, though. Dumbledore knows he is dying, knows he hasn't much time left, yet wastes it all on some lesson for Harry that could be done in a single afternoon? He leaves some cryptic help for the trio, supposedly to bypass the Ministry, instead of giving them what information and gear they need while he's still alive?

Yeah, right. That's blatant plot railroading so we can have a "surprising" reveal at the end of book 7. In the later books, everyone is acting OOC (and usually stupid) in order to push the plot.
