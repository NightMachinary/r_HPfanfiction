I disagree there. The later books ruin the characters in my opinion - all of the characters, including Voldemort, act like idiots, but the books lack the fairy-tale charm of the earlier books which make that sort of thing acceptable. If you're going for a serious take on a magical civil war, you cannot have your cast hold the idiot ball and make convoluted plans that only work out because of author fiat.
