  My problem with that is that there is nothing concrete to work with in the first book, so readers choose a story that feels interesting to them which is great, but then they use that to explain Dumbledore's actions in the rest of the series, often forcing them to come up with convoluted ways to make it fit

That's the problem in a nutshell. The canon characters and the canon plot do not go together outside a children's story where no one questions tropes. Trying to reconcile the canon plot with a wise, benevolent and competent Dumbledore simply doesn't work. Too often, Harry suffered or was in danger, endangering Dumbledore's whole supposed plan. Even if he didn't want to care about Harry he would have had to care about the best way to defeat Voldemort, and would have had to take better care of Harry - which would have led to Harry not getting into quite that many adventures and to boring books.

It's a problem I encounter often when writing a benevolent, competent Dumbledore who cares about protecting the innocent and especially Harry Potter: There are fewer moments for Harry to shine since he's actually protected. (Fewer angsty moments too, since he doesn't feel isolated and neglected, but that's a good thing in my opinion.)

The other problem is that a lot of canon is over the top satire. Inept Ministry, evil step-parents, crazy wizards with no idea about muggles - trying to take that seriously leads to stupid excuses that turn Arthur into a wizard who plays the muggle-loving but ignorant fool to reassure Harry... for years, apparently. Instead of admitting that the traps in book 1 are traps for a children's book that clever child heroes can deal with, it's suddenly some master plan to test Harry or give him self-confidence, or to delay Voldemort - even though the traps barely delayed kids and that if Dumbledore had made the traps intentionally easy to overcome, Hagrid would have blabbed about it - to Quirrell, probably.

And in the end, the explanations don't work anyway - even if the< close one plot hole, they open up others, because if characters who were merely acting as plot devices to allow classic children's tales tropes were actually hypercompetent plotters, then a lot of the canon plot would have gone differently.
