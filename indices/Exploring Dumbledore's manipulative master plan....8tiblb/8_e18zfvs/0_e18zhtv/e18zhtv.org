Part 2/3: [[/u/Just_in_it_for_memes]]

#+begin_quote
  STEP 1: Convince Voldemort that Harry is his greatest enemy.
#+end_quote

Our interpretations are diverging in a major way right now. Still, I'm excited for any internally consistent theory and am excited to read what you're about to say.

#+begin_quote
  STEP 3: Voldemort carries out the Resurrection Ritual, and he uses Harry's blood in the process.

  STEP 4: Destroy all the hidden Horcruxes.
#+end_quote

So I don't think Dumbledore planned these, but let's say I did - why would Dumbledore's original plan order it this way? Surely he'd prefer to switch Steps 3 and 4, destroy all the Horcruxes /first/ and then have Voldemort carry out the Resurrection Ritual.

Steps 5-6d I agree with, but I think Dumbledore can only possibly have planned these after the events at the Ministry in OotP. I would love to be convinced that he could have planned these things beforehand, but then this would make almost all of OotP confusing to me.

#+begin_quote
  If we take the events of the first book at face value, nothing makes sense in the larger context of the overall story:
#+end_quote

I /totally agree/, though where you have come up with a way that it the book fits, I personally feel like the book is just not written with quite the skill the later books were, and unfortunately we are left with a confusing book that nobody agrees on, and not much can be helped.

#+begin_quote
  That's an explicit canon conformation that Dumbledore orchestrated the entire event.
#+end_quote

I think we might define the words explicit and canon and confirmation differently. I would say this is an explicit canon confirmation that Harry /believes/ that Dumbledore orchestrated the entire plot. I'm still on the fence about whether he actually /did/, though. Firstly I have no idea /why/ Harry thinks this in the first place, because his conversation with Dumbledore doesn't suggest that at all - in fact, Dumbledore seems to say the /opposite/, like when he says that he turned around from the Ministry when he realized Harry had gone after the stone, and that he was surprised that Harry knew who Flamel was.

I'm not saying that Dumbledore /didn't/ help Harry in that first year, but I am absolutely questioning why Harry /thinks/ he helped. What, in Harry's discovery of the stone, does he think Dumbledore was behind?

#+begin_quote
  The Devils Snare

  It's a good thing Nevile is a Herbology genius and future herbology professor, right?
#+end_quote

How could Dumbledore know that Neville will be good at Herbology? It's not even hinted at until GoF, right?

#+begin_quote
  But there's a problem with this theory --- a rather significant problem, that I'm sure many of you have already noticed; this plan is totally fucking insane.
#+end_quote

Exactly! I haven't read past this part yet, but this is exactly what I'm thinking - if Dumbledore did indeed want Harry to face Voldemort, I just can't imagine that he would resort to the methods he would have had to have used for him to be behind these things. Hiding newspaper clippings under Hagrid's tea cozy on the /off chance/ Hagrid and Ron start talking about something without Harry and Harry's mind wanders? Not to mention the off chance that Ron is even present.

#+begin_quote
  The only way the events of the Philosophers Stone makes sense is if those challenges weren't actually fatal.
#+end_quote

I agree with this statement completely..... but unfortunately the reason I agree is because I don't think the events of the book make sense. While I do like the idea that the tasks would not have harmed underage wizards, I feel it compromises the safety of the stone - Voldemort could manipulate a student to steal the stone for him as he has proven with Hagrid and Quirrell that he is not above using and framing others.

#+begin_quote
  Why would Dumbledore fly to the Ministry? Why not just apparate?
#+end_quote

Apparating is not mentioned at all in the first book. I think it's possible JKR hadn't invented all its rules yet.

#+begin_quote
  How did Dumbledore enter the room after Harry had drunk the last of the potion?
#+end_quote

How did Harry drink it after Quirrellmort did? I think the bottles must refill.

#+begin_quote
  How did Dumbledore arrive at the exact second that Harry was truly needed him?
#+end_quote

That's fair. But there are so many things that happen at opportune times in all stories and in Harry Potter that I feel singling out this event feels unfair. Though I guess one could say Dumbledore was behind all those other examples too.

#+begin_quote
  And the how hell did Quirrel not notice Dumbledore's arrival, when Quirrel literally has eyes in the back of his head? None of this makes any sense.
#+end_quote

Quirrell was writhing in pain because that is what Voldemort was doing at that moment. I don't find it curious that they did not notice Dumbledore arrive.

#+begin_quote
  The only thing in canon that isn't consistent with this theory is that Hermione remembered seeing Dumbledore rush towards the Third Floor Corridor after she had left to find help. However, there are a dozen canon-complaint ways to explain away that memory.
#+end_quote

And what are they?

I feel there're a few more. So far you have only talked about the tasks that lead to the stone and not how Dumbledore influenced Harry's interest in going after the stone in the first place. I'd love to see you go through Harry's life that year plot point by plot point and describe ways that Dumbledore could be behind Harry's increasing/decreasing/increasing interest in the stone. Because honestly, I can sort of see a Dumbledore that wants what you are describing, but I can't see that he actually did those things based on the events of Harry's year. It just doesn't gel with me, and I was really hoping that you would go through Harry overhearing Quirrelmort and overhearing Snape and all that stuff and explain how Dumbledore was somehow behind Snape taking Harry's library book and behind Harry choosing to get it back and behind Harry looking in the teacher's lounge instead of Snape's office and behind the exact point in the conversation Harry overhears between Snape and Filch. I just don't see how Dumbledore is /actually/ behind that sort of stuff, and almost all the knowledge Harry gains throughout the year is him happening down a corridor and happening to overhear stuff.
