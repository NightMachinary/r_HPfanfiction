Whilst I am against the Dumbledore bashing stuff I think you may be placing a little too much importance on 11 year old Harry's analysis of what Dumbledore was up to at the end of the Philosopher's Stone. Harry realises he never really knew Dumbledore by the seventh book, I wouldn't say that 11 year old Harry necessarily has the correct read on the situation (he isn't known for making accurate deductions).
