The Headmaster of Hogwarts isn't obligated to give an 11 year old the whole and complete truth.

I don't know either way, and I don't think there is any proof in the text, but it seems possible for Dumbledore to move the mirror from the 3rd floor to an out of the way classroom on Christmas day and only keep it there for 3 nights. He gave Harry the cloak for Christmas so Harry can visit it, and I'm sure the unsigned note had a mild compulsion to lead Harry to the unused classroom. I say mild because it didn't interfere with his behavior while he had a goal (reading about Flamel in the Restricted Section) but as soon as he stopped thinking about where he was going, he ended up exactly where Dumbledore wanted him.

Harry then comes back the next night with Ron and Dumbledore is in the room with them, invisible. The night after that, D tells Harry >“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know --- ?” “I don't need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.

And he ends the lesson saying "the Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared."
