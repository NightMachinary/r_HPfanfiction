  At the latest, the protections after Fluffy could have been set within the first month or so. By the second month of school, Halloween, Quirrel has the (obvious break-in attempt) troll incident and it can be assumed that Dumbledore would make sure everything was at maximum security immediately.

We know for certain that the Mirror was added after Christmas, so the Third Floor Corridor was indeed undergoing changes and revisions as the year wore on.

And we don't know to what extent the professors were responsible for their respective tasks. Dumbledore could have come up with the idea of each task, and then the professors had to find a way to implement that idea.

If we were to believe that Dumbledore had no involvement in forming each task, then we also have to believe that it was just a coincidence that each task synced perfectly with the unique talents of Harry and his friends. That coincidence might be acceptable from a meta perspective, but it is unfathomably improbable when viewed from strictly within the Potter universe, and it is that unacceptable improbability lead me to find an immersive explanation.
