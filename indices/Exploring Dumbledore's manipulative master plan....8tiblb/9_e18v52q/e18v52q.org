It seems like the professors set their "challenges" guarding the stone during the summer. The forbidden corridor is mentioned at the welcome feast. This brought the entire school's attention to the area, which would make it very difficult to add tasks last minute.

So how did Dumbledore manipulate the professors into setting these tasks that he personally customized for Harry and company's strengths, if he really didn't even know them yet?

At the latest, the protections after Fluffy could have been set within the first month or so. By the second month of school, Halloween, Quirrel has the (obvious break-in attempt) troll incident and it can be assumed that Dumbledore would make sure everything was at maximum security immediately.
