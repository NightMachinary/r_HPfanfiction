  Petunia Dursley has just lost her sister and gained a son. And... Dumbledore leaves a baby alone with a note. That's how she finds out that she's lost a sister and gained a baby. With a note. And the baby is just... left. Alone. Not even a toy dog to hold onto. For hours.

Yeah, that really was a dick move lol. I don't have any excuses.

Just imagine if Harry got mauled by a stray dog or something. /That/ would be an interesting start to a fanfic.
