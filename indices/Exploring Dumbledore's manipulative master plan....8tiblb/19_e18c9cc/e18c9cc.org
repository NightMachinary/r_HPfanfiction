This theory is amazing, and I love it. I particularly like your idea that the challenges in the third floor corridor actually weren't deadly. I've never seen that idea before. In general, I really love taking as a starting point that the canon makes sense and gets across the intended message, and then finding a way for that to be true. (It's much better than assuming that canon is literally true in the most obvious way and then extrapolating out to all the characters being stupid, which is what bashers tend to do.)

Ooh, wow, I never considered that the Dementors attacking Harry could get to him because they weren't affiliated with Voldemort. That's a really neat idea.
