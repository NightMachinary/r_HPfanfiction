Fantastic stuff. My two cents on an easier way to find the cave:

Step 1: Find one of Riddle's still living muggle contemporaries from his orphanage days (shouldn't be too difficult through government orphanage/adoption records)

Step 2: Ask (or coerce/confund/imperius as needed) which beach the orphanage children used to go on holiday to

Step 3: Obliviate them so they forget the encounter

Then, obviously, visit the beach and search for a cave, the nearest one is probably it
