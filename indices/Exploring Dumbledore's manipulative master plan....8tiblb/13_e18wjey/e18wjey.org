    /“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.”/
  #+end_quote

  Why would Dumbledore fly to the Ministry? Why not just apparate?
#+end_quote

Maybe he actually /Floo'd/ off for London at once. Harry, being Muggle-raised, could have easily misheard McGonagall since he had not learned about the Floo Network yet. He's very much an unreliable narrator.

    /Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. “Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp./

  How did Dumbledore enter the room after Harry had drunk the last of the potion?
#+end_quote

Flame Freezing Charm from the Elder Wand would probably accomplish the same result quite well, I'd imagine, but as a kid, I always assumed that the inanimate obstacles would reset and the potions would refill themselves, considering Voldemort and Quirrell got through before Harry and company, and they still had to do most of the obstacles too..

    /He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down.../

  How did Dumbledore arrive at the exact second that Harry truly needed him? What are the chances of that happening by pure luck?
#+end_quote

Considering Dumbledore does almost exactly this in Harry's fifth year at the battle at the Ministry, I think that can just be boiled down to Dumbledore responding to danger to his students in an appropriately quick and urgent manner.

I agree that later on in the story, Dumbledore did manipulate Harry with the intent for Harry to survive, the evidence is there, plainly; but I do not agree with the notion that Dumbledore was all-knowing from the beginning and manipulated events to get 11 year old Harry alone in a room with Lord Voldemort. He holds two important positions in the Wizarding world, in addition to his duties as a headmaster of a school. It doesn't make him senile or incompetent if he makes mistakes, it only makes him human.
