  The teacher's might know who is involved in the defense, but I don't remember any indication that they knew what those defenses involved.

The professors

  Magic that would kill Harry, works against Harry, EXCEPT the AK. Riddle casts magic that was definitely harming Harry before that moment and clearly could cast other magic to have killed Harry. Harry wasn't invincible from being killed by Riddle, just invincible from being AK'd by Riddle.

Not true; Voldemort uses the Cruciatus Curse on Harry and it doesn't effect him.

  What? There is evidence to the contrary and it does not set a decisive precedent that the danger was merely superficial. Wizards chess is damaging to the pieces. We know this. There is no evidence that it was spelled/enchanted to work different from a normal, giant, wizards chess game. You would have to add assumptions to believe it wasn't dangerous.

I dunno. I think if that game of chess was truly deadly then Ron would have died. I mean, the /Queen/ couldn't kill a /scrawny defenseless 11 year old/. How could the best piece in the game fuck up so badly against such a vulnerable target? And since we don't have any proof that the other tasks were deadly, I think it makes more sense to assume they weren't fatal at all.
