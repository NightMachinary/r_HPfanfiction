  The professors
#+end_quote

The professors? I know they know which professors were involved, but there is zero indication that they knew what defenses the other professors put up.

  Not true; Voldemort uses the Cruciatus Curse on Harry and it doesn't effect him
#+end_quote

100% false. It worked in the graveyard. The time it didn't work was after Harry took the AK, and it still tossed Harry's body because of the force of the spell. Riddle still used other magics in the duel against Harry in the final battle. Riddle could use any indirect spell against him and it would work.

ETA: The Cruciatus didn't work on Harry because of the Elder Wand and we know Dumbledore did not plan that out. If anything, Dumbledore meant to die with the Elder Wand and break the cycle.

  I dunno. I think if that game of chess was truly deadly then Ron would have died.
#+end_quote

That's a guess, but there is no evidence that it wasn't a deadly chess game without more assumptions. The Queen killed a Knight, for all we know, when a Knight is defeated, it always kills the horse instead of the rider.

#+begin_quote
  How could the best piece in the game fuck up so badly against such a vulnerable target?
#+end_quote

Again, we don't know how pieces get destroyed. It doesn't have to be complete annihilation and still could have been deadly. I'm not saying it's an awful assumption, just don't present it as concrete canon proof when it requires outside non-canon assumptions.

#+begin_quote
  And since we don't have any proof that the other tasks were deadly, I think it makes more sense to assume they weren't fatal at all.
#+end_quote

What? Absence of death doesn't go one way or the other towards if the tasks are deadly/fatal or not. It does not make MORE sense to assume they aren't fatal. We know there is poison, a troll, a three headed dog etc. All those are deadly tasks on the face of and just because no one dies doesn't mean it isn't fatal. It makes MORE sense to assume they were fatal than not. Assuming they aren't fatal requires other assumptions that have no canon hard evidence to support. Whereas assuming they are fatal requires nothing other than a reading of canon.
