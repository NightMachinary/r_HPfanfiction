  But you said that only the killing curse wouldn't effect Harry. Why didn't the crucio hurt him?
#+end_quote

I edited it in and it might have been while you were replying, but the crucio during the final battle didn't hurt him because he was master of the Elder Wand. It was cast on his "dead body". Dumbledore got extremely lucky. Harry would have died if it wasn't for the Elder Wand. And the killing curse would effect Harry because he technically had 2 souls inside him. The AK only needs to take one, which it did, hence "invincible" to Riddle's AK.

  No he didn't. Voldemort only cast one spell in his final duel with Harry.

Misspoke, not during the final duel, but while showing his dead body

  That's from the movie. Run doesn't ride a horse in canon.

Fair, it's been a long time since I've read it, but do we know 100% for sure what pieces he took over? I do remember them being missing pieces so probably because of the movie I just filled it in as knight. But I don't remember it saying how they took over the piece. It could have just been they were riding the broken pieces as play.

Besides the tasks can be deadly and not fatal. Proof that the other tasks were deadly is in the actual tasks themselves for the most part. It would require proof that they aren't deadly, OTHER THAN no death, to actually say the tasks were not deadly/fatal.

If i start listing deadly tasks, without other information, it is impossible to say they aren't deadly, just because no one has died in a extremely small sample size. It's taking in other assumptions that isn't supported by canon that allows you to make that assumption.

Yes we know Dumbledore doesn't want them to die, but we do know his end goal was to set up Harry to face Riddle under controlled circumstances. We know he is extremely manipulative, and tbh, willing to sacrifice pieces for the final win. The tasks might be safer then normal, but it doesn't mean they aren't deadly. All it takes is one wrong misstep and it could have killed any of them.
