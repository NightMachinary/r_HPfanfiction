Late to the party but I'd like to take a stab at this. I like both good and dark Dumbledores. I think there is good material for either one to be honest. Dumbledore's character has enough support to be written however you want for the most part.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore is not evil, or insane, or incompetent, . . . I fear that most Dumbledore bashing is sincere, and it stems from a misunderstanding of Dumbledore's actions throughout the series
#+end_quote

Evil: Dumbledore isn't evil yea, but it isn't exactly a huge leap to believe he is when taken as a whole because his actions are pretty dark. Dumbledore is extremely manipulative and more or less killed the Flamels. The Fidelius is at the moment a known unbreakable charm. The only reason the Potters died to Voldemort was because they trusted the wrong secret keeper. Flamels likely could have just as easily placed the stone in a location under Fidelius and continued living. That could be a way to view Dumbledore as being evil and isn't exactly against canon.

Insanity: Agreed, not sure how this one came about for more serious stories.

Incompetent: Honestly, canon Dumbledore can definitely been seen as extremely incompetent. And the reason for this really is because the books went from children stories to YA stories. First book: Potters die, Dumbledore sends ONLY Hagrid to go pick up Harry. Hagrid who has no magic and unknown if DEs were lurking around. Potters die Oct. 31st, and arrives Nov 1st late night to Private Drive before being found Nov 2nd morning by Petunia. What happened between Oct 31st and Nov 1st. Harry wasn't seen examined? If examined, could he seriously not recognize what was in the scar, despite recognizing the ring in the latter books? It might be explainable, but it could also be incompetence. There are more examples, but that's just within the first section of the first book. So it isn't a huge stretch to portray Dumbledore as incompetent. There's also the whole Hagrid introducing Harry to wizarding world with zero information, having a spy in Riddle's midst, who is a freaking potion's master, and not having Riddle drugged with Draught of the Living Dead, basiliks not being known about etc etc.

Believing it to be a misunderstanding of Dumbledore's action just tends to mean you read his actions a specific way, but some other reader has read his actions a different way. Of course this breaks down in the 7th book, but if it's an AU story post 6th year, it could honestly still be a evil Dumbledore.

  Contrary to what Rita Skeeter might say, Dumbledore does not believe in the Greater Good.
#+end_quote

Possible he doesn't believe in the "Greater Good", but there is no doubt he believes in the greater good, lower cases.

#+begin_quote
  Taking that into consideration, Dumbledore does the only thing he can, and sends Harry to live with his muggle relatives.
#+end_quote

This decision makes sense. Sirius was the godfather and believed to have betrayed the Potter's, no trial notwithstanding. The protection that went around Private Drive was supposed to be near impossible to breach by DE's. The issue is, post-GOF. How exactly can Dumbledore be justified in sending Harry back AFTER Riddle has Harry's blood flowing through his vein. There is a safe house, under Fidelius, with himself as secret keeper.

#+begin_quote
  It is an established fact that conventional magical defenses aren't enough to protect Harry's guardians from You-Know-Who
#+end_quote

Define conventional magical defenses. I keep repeating it, but Fidelius 100% would have been complete protection from Riddle if Dumbledore decided to make himself secret keeper.

#+begin_quote
  The blood-love-enchantment is the only thing known to work --- even the Fidelius charm failed to stop Voldemort in the past. It really is a choice between the Dursley's or death.
#+end_quote

The Fidelius did not fail to stop Riddle. Peter Pettigrew failed to stop Riddlet. Don't mix this up. It isn't a choice between Dursley's or death. While the decision to send him to the Dursley's makes sense, it doesn't mean there weren't other options.

#+begin_quote
  Based on this information, Dumbledore forms his master plan to defeat Voldemort and save Harry:
#+end_quote

Yea the master plan is great and all, but is extremely dark. There was no possible way Dumbledore knew without a doubt that Harry would survive Riddle "killing" Harry. Dumbledore was more than willing to have Harry die so that Riddle could be stopped and honestly went about it in a convoluted way. Seriously no chance of drugging Riddle when your spy in the enemies midst is a potion's master?

#+begin_quote
  He can't win. He can't kill Harry, because Lily's blood (within Voldemort) keeps him alive
#+end_quote

What? Riddle could have straight up cut Harry's throat, decapitate etc. Magic that would kill Harry, works against Harry, EXCEPT the AK. Riddle casts magic that was definitely harming Harry before that moment and clearly could cast other magic to have killed Harry. Harry wasn't invincible from being killed by Riddle, just invincible from being AK'd by Riddle. It is hinted that AK is soul magic because of the fact the AK tried to take Harry's soul but instead took the Horcrux, Dumbledore gambled and happened to win.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore engineering an encounter between Voldemort and Harry --- under tightly controlled conditions --- to lay the groundwork for Voldemort's eventual defeat
#+end_quote

Agreed, dark as fuck though. Let me place an eleven year old schoolboy in front of a great dark lord.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore gave Harry his Invisibility Cloak on Christmas because he knew Harry couldn't resist exploring the castle (which meant Harry would discover the Mirror and learn how it worked)
#+end_quote

Agreed, but if he didn't give Harry his Cloak, Dumbledore could definitely be seen as evil just by virtue of being a thief so he could collect the Deathly Hallows, not for some benevolent reason.

#+begin_quote
  That chess set wasn't deadly at all --- it doesn't kill you, it just knocks you unconscious . . . We know with absolute certainty that the chess game was not deadly
#+end_quote

There is no canon support that it wasn't a deadly chess set. We do *not* know with absolute certainty that the chess game was not deadly. It could have been luck. If there is a plausible other explanation, it is not with absolute certainty. Agreed about Fluffy and Devils Snare. Troll, no way he could have predicted that. A troll could have gotten a lucky swing in and killed any one of them. The fact is the Troll and Chess Set were deadly.

#+begin_quote
  Remember, all the teachers at Hogwarts knew about these defenses.
#+end_quote

Support? The teacher's might know who is involved in the defense, but I don't remember any indication that they knew what those defenses involved. Quirrell knew how to get past Fluffy at the very latest, around Easter Holidays and before the forest detention. If he knew about all the defenses, the only defense that should have stopped him is the mirror. With at least 2 months before the crew went down to stop Riddle, are we really going to say Riddle is so dumb he couldn't figure out what the mirror was for 2 whole months? And yes, Riddle clearly did not know what the mirror was as indicated by the scene between Riddle and Harry

#+begin_quote
  Would Minerva McGonagall have ever approved of a killer three headed dog in her school?
#+end_quote

Yes. Yes she would. It is Hagrid's pet and Dumbledore said so. When have you ever seen McGonagall go up against Dumbledore?

#+begin_quote
  None of those potions were deadly to people under the age of 18
#+end_quote

What? Does the poison go oh look, an eleven year old, lets not kill them?

#+begin_quote
  It's out of character for the teachers of Hogwarts to be so apathetic towards their students well being.
#+end_quote

That's what you want to believe, but it could 100% be in character for the teachers of Hogwarts to be so apathetic towards their students well being. You can't actually say this given what has happened.

#+begin_quote
  The only way the events of the Philosophers Stone makes sense is if those challenges weren't actually fatal
#+end_quote

It could also make sense if Dumbledore is a dark manipulator who chooses to take risks for the bigger prize.

#+begin_quote
  Since the chess game sets a decisive precedent that the danger was merely superficial, and because we have no evidence to the contrary, I think that is a fair assumption to make
#+end_quote

What? There is evidence to the contrary and it does not set a decisive precedent that the danger was merely superficial. Wizards chess is damaging to the pieces. We know this. There is no evidence that it was spelled/enchanted to work different from a normal, giant, wizards chess game. You would have to add assumptions to believe it wasn't dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  How did Dumbledore arrive at the exact second that Harry truly needed him?
#+end_quote

It could have just been timing. Dumbledore awhile ago, and possible /flooed/ off to the Ministry. Remember, Harry doesn't know about the floo system and if I remember right, floo sounds like flew.

#+begin_quote
  "No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you -- " PS excerpt
#+end_quote

Dumbledore doesn't always tell people everything. If he was lying here than either he was in the room or he had gone to the ministry and finished up and came back.

#+begin_quote
  If Dumbledore really was already in the room, and invisible, then Harry was never in any real danger
#+end_quote

This is never definitive. All it takes is one lucky spell. To be honest I think it was a two fold plan. One to force the encounter, and two to test Harry's morals (if he could get the stone).

#+begin_quote
  In conclusion, I don't think Dumbledore was incompetent or insane. Dumbledore wasn't indifferent towards Harry's well being. He had a plan--- a manipulative plan, to be sure--- and his plan worked.
#+end_quote

That's fair. But there is evidence that Dumbledore was in/competent and his actions could be taken as dark. When an action tends to be dark, it isn't a huge leap to evil despite there being a difference. If all of Dumbledore's incompetence is just being seen as manipulative then yea he isn't incompetent, but it could honestly go either way for a lot of his actions.
