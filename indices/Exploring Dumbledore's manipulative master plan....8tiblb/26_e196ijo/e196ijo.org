A valiant effort to justify Dumbledore's actions, but it all falls apart if you just consider the alternatives. Why didn't he ask the goblins to remove Harry's horcrux? How come the key to Harry's vault is alternatively in the hands of Hagrid and Mrs. Weasley, but never himself? How could he have never received any owls during his childhood?

It's obvious the lemon drop guzzling goat was stealing Harry's money and denying him his inheritance. The ultimate plan you speak of was nothing else but sacrificing Harry and then stepping in to finish Voldemort off himself for fame and glory.
