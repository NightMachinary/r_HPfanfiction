Great writeup! There are a couple things I disagree with, especially with regards to your PS interpretation, the Horcrux stuff, and keeping Harry at the Dursleys long term, but overall was definitely interesting. I especially like your interpretation of Voldemort seeing Harry as stronger than he is due to overcoming the challenges alone. Minor note, the Dobby/House-Elves apparating through magical protections/Hogwarts is used liberally in fanfics, especially any Dark/Indie Harry ones, but it's never really used in a particular interesting way.
