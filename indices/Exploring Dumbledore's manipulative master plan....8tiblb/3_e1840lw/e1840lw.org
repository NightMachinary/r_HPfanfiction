It's a good write-up and I enjoyed reading it.

  it gave Voldemort the impression that Harry solved all those challenges by himself

This is clever. Voldemort couldn't actually say something about it to Harry, because Harry would very probably respond that his friends helped him.

Putting the Doylist hat back on, I can't help but think that response would be expected in a children's book, that it would be arrogant of Harry to let someone think otherwise. By omitting the whole topic Rowling leaves it as a realization to be discovered later. We learn what sort of person Voldemort is, and this is the sort of assumption he'd make without remark.

  That encounter with Harry was what convinced Voldemort to use Harry's blood in the Resurrection Ritual
#+end_quote

I hadn't sufficiently absorbed this insight either. I am probably not the only one.

There is a certain set of time-travel stories where Harry deliberately prevents Voldemort from taking his blood, and this puts them in a new light. To the extent those stories don't mean for Harry to die, they either already removed his partial horcrux with the time travel or posit that the horcrux just takes the killing curse instead of Harry (an interpretation not exactly supported by the text, see: your post).
