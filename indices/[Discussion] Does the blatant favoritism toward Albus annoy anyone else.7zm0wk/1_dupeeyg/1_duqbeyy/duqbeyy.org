It's... /not/ a fanfiction. I'm not saying it's /good/, and fans have a right to ignore it (though it's officially canon), but calling it fanfiction seems to be missing the point... and sullying /fanfiction/'s good name.

Let me explain.

"Fanfiction" has the word "fan" right there in it. It is defined, to me, as non-profit writing created by fans of an original work, just because they /want/ to see their idea of a story with those characters they love realized. /Cursed Child/ is nothing like that: it's clear that Rowling decided to do a play, wrote up a summary, and then she /hired/ Tiffany and Thorne to help her clean it up. They obviously don't hate it, but I'm not even sure either of those two are "fans" of HP to a meaningful degree, and I'd wager they did this more for the big money in it than out of a genuine desire to write that play.

/Cursed Child/ isn't any more fanfiction than you would call an /Expanded Star Wars Universe/ or /Expanted Whoverse/ novel a fanfiction. It was written at the original author's request by a writer who's likely doing it for the money more than anything else, and thus is simply not fanfiction.
