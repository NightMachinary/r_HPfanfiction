Okay, there's an almost universal consensus that the writing of CC, at least, is a flop. I haven't seen the play, but I've heard it's good on stage, so props to the director (John Tiffany) for that. It takes skilled actors and directors to make poor dialogue into something good.

But the purpose of my question isn't that. It's about the parental neglect.
