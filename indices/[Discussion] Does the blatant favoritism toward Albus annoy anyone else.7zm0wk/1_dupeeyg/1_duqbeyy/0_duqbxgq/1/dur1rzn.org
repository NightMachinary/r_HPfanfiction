Fanficiton isn't an indicator of quality. It's quite sad that a /fanfiction writer/ would go there. Fanfiction is a genre of literature, and comparing a book of a certain genre's quality to another genre is just reductive of both genres. It's like if I said of a tragedy that it's "just as bad as a comedy", as if it was an inherent part of a comedy to be terrible.
