The original post called for actual discussion and criticism of /CC/. Whether positive or negative, further replies would only be good, accurate discussion if they, y'know, actually discussed a point of view. The post I replied to literally just said "Let's pretend CC doesn't exist", with not even an explanation. That's no discussion at all, positive or negative.
