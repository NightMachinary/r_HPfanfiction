I had exacly 0 knowledge of the Fate universe when I started reading this. Didn't even know such a thing existed xD. You don't need that much info about it. I simply read the wiki pages of the characters that matter to the story and also read about the grail wars but otherwise I didn't know anything and found it a very entertaining (and unique) read.
