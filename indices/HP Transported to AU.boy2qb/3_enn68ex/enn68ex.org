[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), has a rather jerk!James, and it was his negligence that Lily was very badly hurt once. But it's not the exact fic you are looking for.

If you like this genre, I have several more dimensional travels in which James and Lily are alive:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Both Harry and Sirius ended up in a world where Tom Riddle was good, but there were different bad guys. No Harry in this world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): During the Horcrux hunt, Harry ended up in a much worse place where his counterpart was quite bad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477819/1/Lily-Potter-and-the-Worst-Holiday][Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday]], linkffn(2477819): The entire Ministry Six got catapulted into an alternate world where Neville was the BWL. Super!Harry soon showed his mettle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483): Harry and Ginny ended up in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] universe, linkffn(5511855), and 20 years into the future. They were kind shocked to find Bellatrix as the Minister and married to the other Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadows Walks]], linkffn(6092362): In search for Hermione, Harry embarked on a long dimensional travel and encountered many different outcomes.
