- Not exactly what you're looking for, but /Delenda Est/ by Lord Silvere is a Harry/Bellatrix fic that's pretty good. It's got some time traveling going on and Harry meets up with a young Bella who isn't totally dark yet. Although I think it kind of peters out after about the midway point. YMMV. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]])

- There's also /Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/ by TimeLoopedPowerGamer which is another time travel fic, and this time Harry is kinda-paired with a Hermione who was a Dark lady in the future and is now a dark lady in training. It's a good fic, but sadly abandoned. One of the could-have-beens of HP fanfiction. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen]])
