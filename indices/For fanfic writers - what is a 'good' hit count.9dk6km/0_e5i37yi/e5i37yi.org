Remember hit count also depends on how many chapters your story has. If a story has multiple chapters, then every time the same user logs in to view a new chapter, that counts as another separate hit. So stories with more chapters tend to have many more hits.

I don't look at hits at all much because of this. [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] is a bit better in some ways, because you can track how many viewers you've had in addition to hits.

I judge how well my stories are doing on Ao3 more by number of subscriptions, bookmarks, and, to a lesser degree, kudos.
