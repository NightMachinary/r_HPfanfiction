It's hard not to be! I have to actively not pay attention to other author's clicks and faves and such and just focus on my own. I was talking to my husband the other day about my current WIP and how my latest chapter hadn't really gotten any reviews and I was a bit bummed about it. But, at the same time I realized that I was being ridiculous. I write and share my work because I enjoy doing so, not because I'm hell bent on beating author XYZ on hits and faves.
