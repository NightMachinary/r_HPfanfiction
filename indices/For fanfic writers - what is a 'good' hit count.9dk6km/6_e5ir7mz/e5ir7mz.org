For my stories:

Pureblood Princess averaged around 15000 a chapter in the ten days or so after a chapter was published.

Vitam Paramus was usually around 6-8k.

Quidditch World Cup was around 5k

LdS was about 3k and then spiked to around 9k at chapter 20 or so and stayed around that through the conclusion.

It's sequel is around 2k a chapter now in the early stages.

I wrote another fic too but the name is escaping me so I can't check it on my profile to see where it's at.
