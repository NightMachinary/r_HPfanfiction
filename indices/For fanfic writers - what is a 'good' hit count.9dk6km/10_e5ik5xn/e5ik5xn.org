When I am looking for specific things (pairings, certain POVs, whatever) rather than just sifting through recommendations (something I do by following [[/u/FanFictionBot][u/FanFictionBot]]), I always sort by favorites (FFN) or amount of Kudos (AO3) the story has. It does get a bit skewed with older stories, but it's the best metric there is.

Basically, I wouldn't give a shit if a fanfic has 1 hit or 1k, I'd only look at the favorite counter.
