Sorry I was sleeping during that time since i messaged at like 12 and then fell asleep. And the only ship I will always read even if I don't like the fanfic itself is Harry/Tonks. The ships I don't like and cannot stand them are Drarry, and Ronmione. I know everyone loves Ronmione but I personally dislike it. Harmony has way too many cliches in them but a well written one can be treasured by me
