Perfectly understandable. I just wasn't sure if I had misunderstood what kind of conversation you were wanting to have. Wouldn't be the first time that happened to me.

I like Drarry sometimes, but I have to be in the right mood for it. I don't really understand why they're so popular together. I've never liked Ron/Hermione. It doesn't feel realistic to me or at least I feel like it would end badly. I do like fics that show them divorcing.

I oversimplified things a bit in my comment. While I'm good with just about any pairing if it's well written there are two exceptions. I don't read straight pairings for Snape or Harry. I can't see either of them as anything other than gay. It's weird, because I routinely think of other characters as different things depending on the context but those two I get annoyed when they aren't portrayed that way. So while I love the idea of Tonks/Harry, I know they would be amazing together, I can't read those fics.

It's usually the background characters that I get really enthusiastic about pairing together. My friend and I decided recently that I should have Narcissa/Irma Pince in one of my fics and I can't wait to write that. And in another fic I'm going to have Dobby/Kreacher, which I love the idea of. I'm weird.
