A lot of Snarry fanfics I have found usually just don't be careful on how they fall in love. Snarry is just a relationship I dislike as i've always seen Harry as straight (Partial reason why I hate Drarry.) and have always seen Snape as a heartbroken person who never got over Lily. I didn;t mention Snarry in my last comment because i've read an amazing Snarry fic with Snape as the master and harry as apprentice and I loved it.

I agree with you on the fact that background characters you always wanted to see together in canon, actually being together is cool. I always thought that Sirius Black should have had a pairing with someone or at least hinted with a serious (No pun intended) relationship in the past. I saw a fanfic that pairing Crabbe and Goyle together in the background and it was so adorable. Which was surprising because I always thought of Crabbe and Goyle as mindless brutes with no intelligence.

Sometimes for Harry/Tonks they change the personality of Tonks a lot so I undestand that even if you like the pairing you can't read it. Its the same with me for the pairing Dramione. I find the concept nice but its the details with how easily hermione fits is what annoys me and stops me from reading the fanfics.

​

How would you rank the following pairings from 1 - 5.

​

Ronmione 2

Snarry 2

Harmony 4

Honks? 5

Drarry 1

Dramione 3

Fanon Slytherin/ Harry 4

​

The last one is purely just how authors take fanon characters like Ice Queen Daphne, The joyful Tracey Davis, or Gossip Queen Pansy. The last one idk if it is canon or not, i think it isnt tho.
