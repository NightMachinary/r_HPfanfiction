What makes you see that harry is gay and thinks that he is in denial? In the original stories harry has never shown a hint of gayness? He would've probably noted that Cedric and Victor Krum were handsome if he was. I do not believe he had any thoughts like that. Besides that he has always shown continous intrest in girls.

​

Neville/Luna should be considered canon but they aren't idk why. Well, they haven't shown anything much in the actual books but Neville/Luna is probably the largest fanon thing people want to be canon.

I don't exactly like pairings that feature Voldemort. Voldemort is a person who literally cannot love and I find the idea of a 65+ man being with a young adult and teen extremely weird.

​

My favorite gay pairing and probably 4th or 5th pairing overall is Sirius/Remus. WOLFSTAR IS AMAZING. It made so much sense to me that the two of them were together when I read book 5. Then Sirius died, but I still thought they were together. Then in book 6 tonks canonly liked Remus and remus did too. Wolfstar is still amazing in my mind.

Sirius and Tonks are related.... Very closely...

​

Triads are weird for me as I've always thought that a relationship is between two people. Adding a third person is weird.
