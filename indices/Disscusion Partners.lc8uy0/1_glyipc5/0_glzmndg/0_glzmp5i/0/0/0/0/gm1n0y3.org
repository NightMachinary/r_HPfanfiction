I don't really enjoy fanfics where the two people in a relationship are far way in age. For example, Snape is old enough to be Harry's father yet they are a popular pairing. Then again Voldemort/Harry is extremely weird. Voldemort was old enough to be a grandfather when Harry was born. I find relationships with vastly different aged people weird.

Why don't you like Dramione or Harmony much? I agree Harmony is overdone and so is Dramione but the concept of the two is very nice. Also why do you not like Dramione but you like Snarry. The relationships are extremely similar. 1 is good, 1 is bad, 1 redeems the other. Also do you prefer Gay relationships over straight ones? Because it seems like you prefer gay couples and different age couples over others.

Also, what do you think of the pairing Drinny. I think it is very similar to dramione but I prefer Drinny more as it is more realistic. Draco malfoy bullied hermione for 6 years (In most fanfics) while Draco malfoy really didn't do anything personal to her, they just hate each other because Weasley vs Malfoy. Ginny is also a pureblood so it makes sense she would make more sense with malfoy.
