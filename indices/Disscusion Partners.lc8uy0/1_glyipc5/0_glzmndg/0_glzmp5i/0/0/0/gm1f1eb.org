I love the idea of Snarry and I'm very forgiving of that pairing even when it's terribly done. That's the main one I write in fact. Although I also write a fair bit of Harry/Voldemort. I love taking people who hate each other and making them change their minds. It's difficult to do realistically and I like the challenge. I understand why most people hate the idea of those two pairings though, the dynamic can be really gross. Which I enjoy writing too, but I have made myself shudder with certain things that I wrote.

I've never been very fond of Sirius but I like him in some fics. Crabbe and Goyle I've always liked, but I don't really have a preference for pairing them with specific people. I do like them as a couple though.

Dramione is usually terrible, but every once in a while I'll find a fic where I don't hate them being together.

Drarry 3

Dramione 1

Fanon Slytherin/Harry 2 - since we're talking girls. I rather like him with Blaise for instance. But even then I prefer him with someone much older so it would only push it up to a 3. Of course I tend to like older men, and women, in general.
