He kissed Cho and then described it as wet. He was obsessed with the Half Blood Prince and at the same time absolutely convinced that the Prince was a guy.

I'm not saying there's proof he's gay but even as a child I read him that way. After almost two decades it's a bit hard to see him any other way. As far as him not lusting after other boys he also isn't shown doing that with girls. He admires them but there are plenty of young gay boys who do the same. He isn't shown doing a lot of the things he would have to have done during that time period, such as having wet dreams or masturbating. A lot of that you just have to assume happens in the background. Everyone else may have assumed he lusted after the girls but I assume he did it to the boys, even if he didn't realize what he was doing. Which is more common than you might think.

When it comes to Voldemort...eh, I like them old. I think Minvera is sexy too and she's about his age.

Wolfstar is a great pairing, I agree.

They're cousins. I grew up reading Victorian novels and marrying your cousin was extremely common back then. It's not like they grew up together anyway. He's been in prison for twelve years. I don't think of that as being incest but I don't have a problem with fictional incest anyway. Real incest squicks me out. Although actually now that I think about it, they aren't cousins, she's his niece, right? I honestly don't remember. Either way they're in the age range that most families would consider them cousins. That's the way my family handles it anyway. My own niece has an uncle about six years her junior, it's just easier if you think of them as cousins.

I also like foursomes and poly relationships. There's no reason you can't care for more than a single person at once. But I know a lot of people hate the idea of them. To each their own.
