I do prefer gay relationships. I'm bi and I find women attractive, but I can't really see myself with a woman. I lean more towards the masculine. So for me anytime I'm reading or writing a fic about two men, preferably with an age gap, I'm putting myself in the place of the younger man, although I'm trans non-binary. Any other type of pairing and I'm reading about strangers, and I don't enjoy it as much.

With Harmony my problem is mostly that I can't stop seeing Harry as gay, so any fic where he's with a woman I can't stop seeing him as being in denial and it makes me sad. It's irrational, I know.

Dramione I just haven't really liked the majority of the fics involving those two that I've read. So I stopped trying to read them.

I love a lot of straight pairings though. Drinny is a good example, those two can be really good together. I love Neville/Luna, although I also love Ginny/Luna. I like Ginny/Blaise and Theo/Hermione. Dean/Ginny can be good too.

I also love triads. Harry/Snape/Voldemort is an extremely underrated ship in my opinion. And I love the idea of Sirius/Remus/Tonks.
