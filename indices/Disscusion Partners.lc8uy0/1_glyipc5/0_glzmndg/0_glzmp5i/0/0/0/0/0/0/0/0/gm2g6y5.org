True, whatever one likes they may write or read. No one is stopping them.

​

As for the topic of Tonk's and Sirius's relationships.. its best if you just simplify it to cousins.

​

For Black family tree history (in detail)

Phineas Nigules Black (Headmaster) had 4 Children. 2 would go on to become the main branches of the Black family tree while one would become the Bustrode Family tree and one would be the father of the first trio of black ladies.

The two who would become the main branches of the family trees are Sirius Black II and Cygnus Black I. Sirius II would have 3 children, Regulus Black I, Lycoris Black, and Arcturus Black. Arcturus had 2 children Lucriata Black and Orion Black.

​

On the other hand Cygnus Black I had 4 children. 1 was a squib and 1 didn't marry. He had Pollux Black and Dorea Black who married into the Potter family.

​

Pollux had 3 children, Alphard Black, Walburga Black, and Cygnus Black II. Cygnus Black II had the second trio of black sisters. There was Bella who didnt have any kids and married into the Lestranges. Narcissa who had a child named Draco and married into the Malfoys and Andromeda who married a muggleborn and had a daugter named Nymphadora.

​

Walburga Black married Orion Black and had 2 children Sirius Black III and Regulus Black II.

The first trio of Black ladies were ladies who married into the Longbottom, Weasley, and Crouch families.

​

Thats all of the important lineage stuff about the blacks. They are bound to have so much hidden incest besides Walburga x Orion. Example, a Longbottom can marry a Weasley or Potter in the future and that would be incest. Ginny Weasley marrying harry potter is incest.
