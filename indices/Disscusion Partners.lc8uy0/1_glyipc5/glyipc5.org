I'm avoiding writing at the moment. Did you have any specific pairings in mind?

Edit. Apparently not. Personally whether I'm writing or reading I enjoy pairings which feel realistic and compelling. Doesn't matter if we're talking noncon or a situation that's disturbing or upsetting, if the story is both those things then I will enjoy reading or writing it.

Although there are a few pairings that I simply can't stand no matter how well written they are. And a few I love so much I'll read them even when they aren't.
