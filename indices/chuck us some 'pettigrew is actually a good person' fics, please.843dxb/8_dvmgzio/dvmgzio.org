linkffn(12682621) has something that just barely fits the criteria - Pettigrew still sold out Harry's parents, but he helps Ron prank his brothers (he's pretending to be a rat who can turn into a human instead of the other way around) and generally is not an asshole for the duration of his stay at the Weasleys'.

HPMOR also has something similar to your prompt, but it's so stupidly executed that I'm not going to bother linking to it.
