Just read 'the deathly hallows'.

Pettigrew has a redemption story where he is killed by Voldemort after letting Harry and company escape from the Malfoys.

The plot is quite similar to 'the deathly hallows' part one and two (the original movies), but the author has sprinkled in some AU scenes in the story.
