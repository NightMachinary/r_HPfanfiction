From what I remember linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) kind of counts? Don't want to spoil too much, but his interactions with Lily and little Harry made him a little into doing-bad-things-but-still-good-at-heart kind of person? Again with question mark because it has been a while since I read it. Actually, I'm going to reread it right now.
