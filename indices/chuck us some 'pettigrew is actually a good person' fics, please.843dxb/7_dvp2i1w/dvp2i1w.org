After_the_Rain (a_t_rain on LJ) had one of my absolute favorite Peter-centric stories; her work actually shaped a lot of how I view the Marauders, especially Sirius and Peter.

*Running Close to the Ground*: /They call themselves the Death Eaters' Drinking and Cynicism Society. They are bored, world-weary, damaged men, too resentful to obey without question and too afraid to rebel. One of them spends his nights dreaming of the past as he waits for the order to kill the last of his childhood friends. His name is Peter Pettigrew. And he still has a touch of the old Marauder in him./
