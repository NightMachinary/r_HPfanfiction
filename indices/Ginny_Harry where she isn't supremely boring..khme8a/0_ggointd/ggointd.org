linkffn(The Arithmancer) is not Harry-centric, but has a slightly more assertive Ginny who properly befriends Harry earlier. They're mostly in the background, but the story is well worth reading on its own merits, too.

The linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series doesn't have a proper pairing for Harry as yet (he dates Cho Chang, but only briefly, as per canon); however, Ginny is present from quite early in the story and is within his circle of friends pretty much from the start, skipping her elbow-in-the-butter-dish phase. Since it's only reached fourth year, there's still plenty of time for Harry/Ginny to happen, and a much better setup for it, but only the author knows where it's headed. It is actively updating, though.

There's a definite Harry/Ginny /pairing/, albeit not a romantic one (they're prepubescent), in The Meaning of One: linksiye([[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833&textsize=0&chapter=1]]). Ginny is fiercely protective of Harry, and certainly does "get" him. The soulbond aspect may seem a bit cliche/saccharine initially, but I recommend sticking with it for a bit longer; the fic does an excellent job of portraying the Weasleys' varied reactions to what has happened to their sister. They all have depth, both strengths and weaknesses, no one-dimensional caricatures. Mrs Weasley, for example, struggles to accept that her little girl is effectively married at age 10, and puts them under a lot of stress with her worrying and nagging about their behaviour, yet it's always clear that she does genuinely love Ginny and is trying to be a good mother to her in an unforeseen and bizarre situation. Harry and Ginny themselves, being in each other's heads, are very supportive of each other and always have each other's backs - but they're still both dangerously impulsive, and they /don't/ cope whenever one of them is incapacitated. Books one and two are complete; unfortunately it doesn't look like there will be any more.

You could also take a look at something like Northumbrian's work, about Harry and Ginny's family in later years. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is quite a good one, where they've moved into a new neighbourhood in the countryside with their three children, told mostly from the perspective of a Muggle neighbour whose children go to the same school and who quickly befriends them. There is an underlying plot involving Harry's work as an Auror, but most of it is a slice of life.
