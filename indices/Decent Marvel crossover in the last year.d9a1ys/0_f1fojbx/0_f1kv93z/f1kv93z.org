Warning for those who haven't read it, this is pretty much a wish fulfilling Gary Stu rainbow coming out of his arse type of story. Everything Harry does in the new universe is unbearably and sickeningly perfect. There's not an ounce of real tension or struggle surrounding the main characters, like at all. It's not really a spoiler as it doesn't give away any plot but better be safe than sorry and if you're into that then go for it, the writing is not bad and updates frequently as well.
