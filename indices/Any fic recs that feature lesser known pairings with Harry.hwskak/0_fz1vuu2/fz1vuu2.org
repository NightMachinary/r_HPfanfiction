I got you my dude, enjoy!

A Badger's Love - linkffn( 7857389 ) - Harry/Hannah - A sweet story that is a decent read.

Twins - linkffn(13491812) - Harry/Hestia&Flora Carrow - Its an odd pairing but it works really well to create a nice story.

Aren't Little Girls Made of Suger and Spice? - linkffn( 1300829 ) - Harry/Alicia Spinnet - The only fic I know of this pairing and one that is pretty good.

Family - It's In the Blood - linkffn(13292346) - Harry/Astoria Greengrass - A well-done story of this pairing with some world-building to go with it.

Finding a Place to Call Home - linkffn(9885609) - Harry/Astoria G. - Another really well thought out story and some solid moments between the characters.
