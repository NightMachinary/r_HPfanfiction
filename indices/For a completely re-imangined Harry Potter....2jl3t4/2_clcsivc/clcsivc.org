Ehhh...pretty boring, lots of long, drawn-out scenes. Also, full of teenage "edginess". It's sort of /shoved/ in, as if there only to make sure everyone knows that, though they're writing a Harry Potter fanfic, they're really mature and into guns and pot and Gears of War and shit. Not like, into baby stuff, man.

Not even Darth Mars' best stories.

My fics have straight-up sex in them, and I do outright smut fiction too, so it isn't like I'm a prude. But it just seems...more blatant in the eye-rolling power fantasy and over the top adult, darky dark darkness than it has to be.

Technically, true.

  It's so gripping and realistic and emotional

Tried three times to read it, never made it even halfway through. Would really help if the purpose of the story was put front and center, with stronger foreshadowing. Or, maybe not.

I think his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]] is a much better story. And that's a fucking /soul bond/ fic. But he does it well, really deconstructing how uncomfortable and invasive something like that would be.

So, no. Skip the Trilogy and try that one. Much better story. Much more "realism".
