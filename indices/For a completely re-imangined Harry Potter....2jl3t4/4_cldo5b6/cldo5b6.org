Darth Marrs is not as bad a writer as made out to be by many and though his work gets panned in places like DLP or this sub, I don't feel that it's entirely deserved. He writes technically competent prose. His biggest forte is that he's reliable, putting out new updates every week with few misses, a pattern he's been following for several years now and millions of words. As the fandom slowly dries up, as updates of quality stories become fewer and farther in between, this is no mean feat. This is both good and bad--his stories often drift, losing the consistency of, say, an Inverarity or Perspicacity, who write their stories to completion before posting.

As [[/u/firaxus]] notes, the /Firebird Trilogy/ is Grimmdark with a capital 'G'. It's truly a shitty world full of shitty people unworthy of saving, making the story an emotional downer to try to read. Harry. Hermione. Luna. Even Lily was a shitty person.

I do follow it, but I read it in fits and starts. I'll sit and trudge through a dozen or so chapters at a go, then I need to put it down for awhile and work up the nerve over the course of months to go for some more.

That the author has made the reading experience decidedly unpleasant is a pity because there's something here that could have been great. Truly, the worldbuilding is commendably unique, something that's rare to find in a fandom of a million-plus stories rehashing the same old same-ol'. That's really the attraction to this story. I just wish there were more bright spots to temper out the bad. (And that he'd get out of the harem rut: Hermione and/or Ginny + Luna + ... gets old after a dozen takes.)
