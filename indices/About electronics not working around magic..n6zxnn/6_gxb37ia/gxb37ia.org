If you go by a strict canon explanation... we don't really know more than the fact that electronics don't work at Hogwarts (although Colin's camera - unless he had a really old one - worked). However unlike Diagon Alley and the Ministry, which are public properties and any witch or wizard can go to, Hogwarts is heavily protected by spells, unlike the others which seem to only have a concealed entrance to the Muggles. Also Hogwarts has a magical architecture with moving stairs, switching rooms and hundreds of people performing spells at once. Diagon Alley seems to be mostly a regular shopping street with magic items where only the few vendors practice magic on a regular basis. While you could argue that some of the magic in the Ministry would be powerful enough to disrupt electronics, it is still buried deep underground and probably that's why the Department of Mysteries is the lowest floor... because it has so powerful magic that it could really make Muggles suspicious.

Otherwise if you want to put it in a fic, you have pretty much free reign.
