It isn't that electronics don't work around magic. It's that the amount of /accidental/ magic floating around Hogwarts makes electronics unreliable. I believe one of the reasons Hogwarts is kept so remote is to concentrate most of the potential accidental magic (coming from children struggling through puberty) in one place where they can manage it, away from muggle interference.

I also believe that the protections making the school appear as a ruin to muggles and that make it Unplottable on maps interferes with radio signals. One other thing - even if a student got some electronics to work there, it's nearly certain that the electrical grid hasn't been extended into that area, so their batteries would be the only source of power. Can a refilling charm recharge your batteries? Sounds like NEWT level work.
