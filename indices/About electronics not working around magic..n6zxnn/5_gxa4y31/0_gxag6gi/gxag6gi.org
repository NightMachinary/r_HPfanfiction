Do you mean ambient magic? Most people in the fandom believe that ambient magic prevents electricity from working properly. Accidental magic is just a spell that has been casted unintentionally.

I believe that Howarts is as remote as it is because the Scottish highlands are a strategic location for a castle that is supposed to keep people safe.

I highly doubt that the wards can stop all muggle technology like radar and satrelites.
