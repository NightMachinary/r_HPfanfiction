I'm of the opinion that ambient magic doesn't inherently impede electronics any more than ambient gravity. They are simply two entirely separate forces of nature. Magic would only stop a device from working if a specific spell being cast at it has an effect that alters it in such a way as to render it inoperable, such as an unbreakability charm stopping a hard drive from writing for example, just like gravity would only affect it by breaking it from a fall or sufficiently warping space.

Our only official canon source on the issue as far as I recall is a throwaway line by Hermione quoting a history book written by pureblood wizards.

Frankly I don't consider anything a bunch of purebloods wrote on this subject to be a particularly reliable source when there isn't any firsthand evidence to back it up.

I theorize that someone tried bringing a simple lamp or radio to Hogwarts back in the early 20th century, found nowhere to plug it in, and the ignorant wizarding staff just dismissed it out of hand without understanding why it didn't work. They then go on to write that down and tell new muggleborn not to bother trying. When asked why it doesn't work, they just throw out 'because magic' since that's essentially a viable catch-all answer in the wizarding world for any effect that isn't really understood.

Muggleborn then enter the wizarding world primed with this 'fact' from their supposedly knowledgeable professors, then adapt to wizarding society and never pursue the question further.

Thus the cycle of ignorance is perpetuated.

It wouldn't be until the modern day where personal portable electronics have become so entrenched in everyday life that there might be sufficient motivation for a young muggleborn to really take a crack at solving the problem in order to bring their precious smartphone back into their life.
