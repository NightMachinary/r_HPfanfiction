You mean EMC/EMI or ESD not EMP. And you're wrong anyway.

EMP is "electromagnetic pulse" which works by causing EMI and ESD, but isn't a thing any consumer electronics is going to experience.

Modern electronics are actually far less susceptible to EMI than vintage electronics. Vacuum tubes for example, are incredibly sensitive to phonic and electromagnetic interference.

Modern ICs are rated to a higher level of ESD and EMI protection.

Metal casings on boards, used for shielding from all the EMI around us in the form of microwaves for communication, are designed specifically to protect from interference.

The issue probably comes down to macro or microelectronics rather than age. Or whether it is actually electrical mains and not an electronic device.
