Ah I was more meaning the actual metals,

In the Fae legends that JKR, drew some inspiration from for her world building they are often weakened by Cold Iron, so I wondered if maybe that could also be why magic supposedly blocks electricity, its not the electrics themselves but the conducting metals and components used that interfere with it

With progress and development however the metals and other components used have been refined and altered to where they are no longer affected directly by magic and thus "modern technology" does work in the HP Universe with little to no issues where as the original tests and experiments would have been classed by the Magicals as a failure

Alas, tis only a theory anyways
