No proof, really, and some proof otherwise.

If magic really screwed up tech, it's likely that there'd be a great deal of issues around Diagon Alley especially, as well as likely around the Ministry and St Mungo's.

There isn't.

My opinion is that it's likely the result of lies that's been taken as fact due to time spent known to be "truth".
