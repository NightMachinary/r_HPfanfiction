  Harry as an elfling on Arda. A new world, a new life, a new chance. A new hope to finally find that which he had been searching for for such a long time. Can he truly start afresh, or are the shadows of his past too lasting to shake off?

  What if Harry had somehow gotten involved with the mafia after Voldemort's defeat? What if Reborn was just a little too bored? What if the Conqueror met Chaos personified?

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.
