I read up to about chapter 55 and never got back into it because of slow updates but it is really good. It's got 800k words. There is currently 93 chapters.

I'd suggest reading it because when I was reading it I risked bringing my phone out during school to read it.

I'd love to try and get back into it but that would mean re-reading it and I personally cant read such a long book without getting bored and wanting something fresh.
