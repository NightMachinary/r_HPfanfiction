The Dangerverse! [[https://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]

It's an AU where Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius and a couple of OCs, one of whom is Hermione's twenty-year-older older sister raising her after their parents were killed by Death Eaters. It's got a few issues--for a series with quite a large number of minor relationships, for example, and which goes on to implement a reorganization of the basic family structure, it doesn't actually seem to remember that people who aren't straight might exist--but I'm still quite fond of it, and it's one of the fics I end up rereading every few years. Aletha and her and Sirius' daughter, Meghan, are still two of my favourite OCs.

--oh, and it's very long. The first book comes in at a little over 200k; I think the series as a whole is a little under two million. This is an advantage for me, but I appreciate that not everyone might feel the same way.
