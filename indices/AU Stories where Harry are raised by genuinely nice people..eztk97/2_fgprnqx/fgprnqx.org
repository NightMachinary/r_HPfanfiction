I like the series "alternate living arrangements" by Triscribe that as it says is a series of stories (unconnected from each other) where Harry is raised by different people. My favorite is "The Extra Weasley"

Unfortunately most of them if not all are incomplete, but still very entertaining. Another interesting story, by another author called AnyaYanko, is "The Phoenix burns brightest" where Dumbledore himself takes up on him to raise Harry, and I'm happy to tell you that one is currently being updated the last update being on 23th of January so i have hope to see it finished.
