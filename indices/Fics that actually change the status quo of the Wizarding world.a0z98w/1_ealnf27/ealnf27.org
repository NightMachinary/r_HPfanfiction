That's a theme in most of my AU fics. "Democracy" and "Divided and Entwined" as well as "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" feature a struggle to reform the Ministry and Wizengamot. "Patron" features both werewolf-discrimination as well as a caste-system, which the protagonists fight against. And "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" features a revolution in Wizarding Britain, followed by revolutionary wars in most of Magical Europe as the ancient regimes fight to keep the muggleborns oppressed.

And the status quo doesn't survive in any of the stories.
