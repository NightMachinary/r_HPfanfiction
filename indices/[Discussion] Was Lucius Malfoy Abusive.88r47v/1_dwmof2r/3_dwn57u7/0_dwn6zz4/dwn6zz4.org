Oh, I don't think Lucius was a good person, he certainly believed in pure-blood supremity. These views were passed on to Draco too and maybe initially he was excited at the prospect of joining the death eaters.

While I'm sure Lucius freely joined the death eaters before 1981, when Voldemort was first defeated Lucius tried to move on. He got into wizarding politics, began raising a son, claimed the imperius curse, made no effort to seek out Voldemort and gave away the diary for his own motives. Voldemort's return basically ruined his life as he once again had to serve him and this time his wife and son got involved.

When the dark mark appeared in GOF, the masked death eaters ran away.
