It was ol' Lucius free choice to join the Death Eaters, and, as we know, the return of his Dark Lord has been quite obvious for his followers in GoF. Lucius was one of the first to stand on the side of his Dark Lord again. I'm always amazed that Lucius incompetence, the reason he fell out of his Dark Lord favour, ensured impunity to the Malfoys after Voldemort's defeat, just as after the first war.

I think Draco himself wanted to become a Death Eater. At the beginning of HBP, he was proud that his Dark Lord has given him an important job. It was always obvious in the books how proud he was of his Dark Lord, well ... until he realized he was incapable of the job he was given. Well, in the books it was quite obvious that he was a coward.

Well, usually, I don't really care about Malfoy. However, I'm allergic to redeemed Malfoys. It's a bit too OOC.
