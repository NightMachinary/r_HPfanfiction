I honestly don't think Lucius wanted Voldemort to come back. Once he did come back, Lucius reaffirmed his loyalty only out of necessity.

Draco being used by Voldemort to kill Dumbledore during the sixth book was a form of punishment for his father. Therefore I wouldn't say Lucius wanted Draco to become a death eater. The books indicated he genuinely cares about his son, one of his redeeming qualities.
