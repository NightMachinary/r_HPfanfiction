Draco was spoiled as fuck. Although i suppose teaching your son to be a racist could be seen as abuse. Also when Draco joined the Death Eaters it was done as a punishment for Lucius losing one of Voldemorts horcruxes, so Lucius had no say on the matter.

I'm pretty sure Draco was pretty giddy at first being a death eater, only having second doubts not because he realized Death eater agenda was evil, but because Voldemort gave him an impossible task just to punish his family without alienating his other followers. So him being 'good' is definitely pure fanon. Also Voldemort cruciating his minions for minor failures is fanon.
