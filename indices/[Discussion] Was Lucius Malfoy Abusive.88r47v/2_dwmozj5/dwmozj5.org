I'd just like to point out that from the Malfoys' perspective, the Death Eaters were a /revolutionary/ movement, not a terrorist one. Lucius was brought up with pureblood ideals -- much like people in the antebellum american south were, in regards to slavery -- and he instilled those values into Draco.

Niether Draco nor Lucius really had a much of a choice when it came to their bigotry; they simply conformed to the societal values surrounding them.

I always thought that there was such a brilliant opportunity in canon to show how such ignorance could be overcome; how Draco might have transformed to see past his hate and play a more redeemed role, but alas...

Thankfully, that's why we have fanfiction!
