I don't think he was particularly abusive.

He didn't seem very patient with Draco though, consider his reaction to Draco complaining about Hermione and Harry in Borgin and Burke's. I think that's sort of where the abused!Draco thing originated, too.

Maybe he just gave Draco what he wanted so that the boy would shut up.
