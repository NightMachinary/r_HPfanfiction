I don't really agree with people saying "Draco was spoilt, therefore Lucius never hit him". There are lots of rich parents who buy their kids all manner of needless shit in place of actually parenting them, and when the kid does something wrong, they turn to physical abuse, again, rather than actually parenting them.

When it comes to wealthy parents, I'd say being the type of parents who give their kids anything is a symptom of not thinking about how their own actions will affect their child's development. That mindset makes abuse more likely, not less.
