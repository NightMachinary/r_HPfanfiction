I was never suggesting that they were good people, but a lot of fanfic writers seem to believe that he was preparing for Voldemort's return ever since 1981.

I mean, Malfoy was pretty powerful in the early 90's, arguably more powerful than during the war, having the minister at his beck and call and everything. He had no reason to hope for Voldemort's return, and very little to gain from it.
