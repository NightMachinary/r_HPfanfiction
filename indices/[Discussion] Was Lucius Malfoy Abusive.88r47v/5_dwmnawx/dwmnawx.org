Lucius undoubtedly was abusive, but never to his son. He has always spoiled and petted his son, e.g. when he bought the brooms for him and his team, or when he tried to execute Buckbeak because he had hurt his darling son. It was his goal for his son to get an influential position at the side of his beloved Dark Lord.

I think all attempts to portray Malfoy Jr as a maltreated son are only intended to construct an OOC plot for ferret!boy. In fact, Malfoy Jr still fought for his Dark Lord when his father had already fallen out of favour due to his incompetence. Remember the skirmish in the Room of Requirement during the Final Battle where Malfoy Jr ordered his minions to kill Harry.
