  What sort of caring father encourages or even allows his son to become a member of a magical terrorist organization where the leader regularly tortures his inferiors?

thats fanon, also one of the more stupid pieces of fanon.

we have no evidence that Voldemort regulary tortures Death Eaters. We have only see him do it three times and all of them were for serious fuck ups. Considering Harry was able to see what he was doing when he was really angry for three years that is very little.

And we have no reason to assume that he was abusive, Pottermore even makes this more unlikely. Draco loved his father and his father aided Draco when ever he could.
