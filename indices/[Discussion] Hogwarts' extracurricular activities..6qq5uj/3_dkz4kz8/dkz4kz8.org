Something about magical musical instruments really gets me excited. We don't get to see much of the music in wizarding world barring Celestina Warbeck, The Wierd Sisters, and the mention of Stubby Boardman and the Hobgoblins, and many fanfics display the music as old fashioned music. But i really think there's some potential there. Music being so powerful that it can help people fight duels, it being a whole new branch of magic is really exciting. I like to imagine there being a choir in hogwarts, or something akin to that, a room from where melodious tunes play, something that relaxes people even if they're just walking past that corridoor. It's really magical.
