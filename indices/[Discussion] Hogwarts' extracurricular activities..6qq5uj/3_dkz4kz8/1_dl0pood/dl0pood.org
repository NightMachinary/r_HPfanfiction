In the third film, the Hogwarts Choir performs. And they're really good for not having practiced together all summer.

Or, it just occurred to me, maybe they get to campus early to prepare their song? It would be kind of like band camp. That would be a fun setting for a fic, though you'd probably have to drop in more OCs than most people are comfortable with.
