  I wonder if that's the equivalent of becoming an mma fighter when you grow up.

You could be right, but I just personally thought that Duelling could be a way to bring other schools into this. Instead of multiple Quidditch teams, Hogwarts has one Duelling team that goes against other School's Duelling teams. I can't see how anyone is going to win against Durmstrang if they don't at least have a Duelling Club.
