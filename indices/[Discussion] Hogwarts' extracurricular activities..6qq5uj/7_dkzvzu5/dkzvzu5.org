I always imagined that at some point during OWL year, children would also find out their 'Specialization' and in turn would get more of a certain class or have a new one altogether based on certain 'groups' of Magic (Mind Magic/Psychic Magic/Divination, Elemental Magic, etc...) This would, in turn, spawn clubs where Children talked about their different innate abilities and learned more about them.

So for Tonks, being naturally a 'Metamorphmagus' would be more of her having an extremely rare affinity and ability over her own body that few others have. I have no idea of the nuances of this, but it sounded cool in my head.

Duelling Club also seemed like a 'must' for Hogwarts, I can't imagine a society where Power is so coveted not valuing pure displays of Power against Power against Wit against Ability.
