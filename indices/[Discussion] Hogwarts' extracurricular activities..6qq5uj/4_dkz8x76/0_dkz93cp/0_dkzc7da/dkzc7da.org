Well I know the failed drama club is mentioned in the book of wizarding world fairytales, The Tales of Beedle the Bard. There was an attempt to put on a play from one of the stories in it (the one with the knights). I think its mentioned in a footnote?

Here it is: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/event/hogwarts-presents-a-pantomime-of-fountain-of-fair-fortune/]]

I think the art club is mentioned in pottermore in a few small aside? Does anyone else know?

Edit: I might be mis-remembering a fact from one of the Harry Potter games. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Art]]
