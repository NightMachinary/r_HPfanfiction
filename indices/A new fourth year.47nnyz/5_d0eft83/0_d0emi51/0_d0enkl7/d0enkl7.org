I've had the central scene of the epilogue already in mind when I started, and the rough (very rough) path to it. Lots changed, much of what was planned was dropped or altered significantly as the characters developed (taking a sort of life of their own), but that scene didn't really Change fundamentally.

The story's in the last arc, a few more chapters I'd say, depends on how long it takes to wrap up a number of side plots. (Though originally I thought "30 chapters, 10 per school year" - that didn't pan out.)
