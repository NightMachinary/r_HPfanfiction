I'll reccomend linkffn(4641394). One of the few fics that make me cry every reread. It's entirely 4th year based and takes an interesting plot twist early that shapes the rest of the fic and its conflict wonderfully. Not everyone's cup of tea, but worth reading.

The ending is fucking tragic though. A less depressing ending can actually be found in the author's WIP dump on their profile, so if the ending is unsatisfactory for you there's a happier one you can read instead. Both are well written and plausible ends.
