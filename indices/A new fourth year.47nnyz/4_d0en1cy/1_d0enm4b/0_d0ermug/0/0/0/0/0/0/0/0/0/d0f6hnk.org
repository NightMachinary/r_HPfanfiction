I think the canon characters are ruined by having to serve as plot devices - especially Dumbledore. He is supposed to be wise, powerful, and benevolent, with decades of experience and a tragic past. A man willing to do what's right, not what's easy.

And in canon? He's a stupid plot device, rendered impotent so Harry can be both tortured and angsty in every damn book and save the day since the adults are useless. His actions and inactions in canon utterly ruin a great character, just because the plot demands it.

And most of the characters are treated that way in the later books. So, I try to stay true to how the characters are portrayed, not how they act in canon. And that means discarding much of the canon.

I'm currently writing two weekly stories, and have three more planned out, so I don't have the time for another story for several months.
