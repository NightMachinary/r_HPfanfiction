I generally write Ron as the kid that was ready to die for Harry twice (book 1 and 3), growing up. I don't really care about his portrayal in the later books, I feel his character was wrecked for cheap angst.

I'm a bit wary of politicking in school - kids simply don't have that much clout or experience.

Though a story where Harry becomes aware of being a decoy early on, and then fills in his friends might be possible as well. It would derail the canon train just as early though.
