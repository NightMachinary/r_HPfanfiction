True, that would change it quite a bit. I think that in the case of the trio vs. everyone pot thred, it would need to happen either 3rd year or 5th year instead of during the tournament in order to work. Ron is already ostracizing Harry during this period and he likely wouldn't come arond until far later if Harry's 'nature' is revealed during 4th year. He holds grdges too long and stubborns hiw way through things too much to get over it in time for 4th year trio dynamics to return.

Of course then something other than the goblet would need to ct asa catalyst to reveal what harry is then; perhaps the dementors in 3rd year or the mind games with voldemort and snape in 5th.

changing the year wuld also change how Harry would respond just based on his past experiences; 3rd year harry would likely deal with it better, since he's just dealt with the 'heir of Slytherin' debacle and is better adjusted to dealing with the shunning. 5th year harry would be coming off of cederic's death, and considering how poorly he handled that alone in canon, adding something like a complete shift in his undestanding of himself and who he is wouldn't end well. Ron might be more iclined to stick close though, having learnt not to be as jealous the year previous by the end of the tourney.

Herione would be instrumental though, in helping him handle the fallout. TBH this could make a really nice premise for a politicking fic given enough thought.
