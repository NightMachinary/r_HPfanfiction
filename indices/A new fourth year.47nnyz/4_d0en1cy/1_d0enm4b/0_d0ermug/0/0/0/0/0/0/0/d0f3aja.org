Ah, I generally tend to ignore canon when it clashes with my characterizations. I want to let my characters drive my plot, and not the other way around. Much less trouble with plot holes and idiot balls that way too.

I have a rather twisted explanation in mind as well, for the origin of "Harry". Or rather, for his soul. Probably an even bigger shock than what he suffered in "The Substitute".
