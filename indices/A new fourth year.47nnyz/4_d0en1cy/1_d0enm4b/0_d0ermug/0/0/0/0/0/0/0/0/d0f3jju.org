I get that. I tend to do the same, but I still think keeping canon in mind is a good thing; otherwise the characters wont ring true compared to their canon counterparts and you'll end up just writing mary sues and stus disguised as canon characters.

Sounds interesting! Are you planning on actually writing it out or just thinking about alternates?
