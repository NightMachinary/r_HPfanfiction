I agree that Ron gets shoved aside later on, but I try not to ignore any part of canon if I can help it. The books can be contradictory and even degrade the characters at times, but they still help characterize them and grow them. Book four illustrates is jealous streak, which is reasonable given his upbringing as the last son in a long line who got nothing but hand me downs his whole life.

I meant more that it would set them up to be interested in it earlier on, and then they could really get into it during the later books timelines and after. Set up for it while in school and then start up a political strom once they graduate with what they've built up during their school years.

It'd definitely derail canon a lot; there'd be totally different issue and challenges to face given this knowledge earlier on. Of course, earlier in the timeine, Dumbledore likely wouldn't know if Harry was still somehow the chosen one given he was mared, and would manevuer to keep him around. Justifying this to the ministry would be a nightmare though and it'd likely lead into some very interesting and drastic choices needing to be made.
