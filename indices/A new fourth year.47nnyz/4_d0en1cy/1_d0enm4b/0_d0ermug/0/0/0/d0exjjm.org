Well, off-hand, I'd say a happy ending would already change the story from a tragedy. Though for a more in-depth change, I'd focus on dealing with the revelations thanks to a modern outlook. Hermione wold be key as one of the few sticking with her friend, no matter his origins or "nature". She would also have the background (modern values, probably having read SciFi stories that deal with this question as well) to help Harry accept that what matters is his mind, not his body. Ron staying his friend would work too. Basically, the trio versus the rest of the world, sticking together and winning in the end, and giving the finger to all notions about Blood and other prejudices.
