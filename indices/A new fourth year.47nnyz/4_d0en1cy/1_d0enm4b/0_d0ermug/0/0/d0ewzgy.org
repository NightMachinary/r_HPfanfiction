True, but I really think its the tragic parts of this particular fic that make it as memorable as it is. Harry dealing with not only school and the tournament, but the tradgedy of who and what he is and trying to come to some sort of terms with how this will effect him is a wonderfully emotional experience to read about.

A happier version could also have a lot of potential to it, but I'm not entirely sure how you'd pull off this premise in any way that could be seen as 'this is okay and not upsetting to learn about at all'. Could you maybe conjecture some happier plot threads? It'd be interesting to see alternative versions of this idea.
