It dosent divergent too hard. The task keep the same, but to show you one thing for example [[/spoiler][fake Moody is exposed way earlier.]] Cant really tell whether its worth to you. I found it entertaining enough. Indeed you missed the first "big" change by one chapter (; I would suggest read the fourth chapter and if this isnt enough you might as well stop. Expect when you are into Harry/Fleur than its definitely worth.
