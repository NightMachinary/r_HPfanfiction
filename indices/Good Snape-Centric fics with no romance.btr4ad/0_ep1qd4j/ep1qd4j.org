Remember Remember linkao3(1171254) has Snape/OFC in the last few chapters, but the pairing is not the focus of the story at all, and it's basically gen. Two decades after the Battle of Hogwarts, amnesiac Snape is found when his daughter receives her Hogwars letter

World in Pieces linkao3(790488) is "Harry is summoned to the alternate universe" story, and although it's Harry-centric, Snape plays a major role

Baby In A Box linkao3(593693) is a Snape-adopts-Harry kidfic

Edit: Here's another fic worth checking out: A Different Messenger linkffn(5602286), mentor!Snape fic written from Snape's perspective. Snape doesn't have the most selfless intentions at first, but learns to be a better person in the process
