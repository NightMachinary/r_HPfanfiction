  21 years after the FInal Battle, regrouping after Ginny is severely injured, Harry goes on a mission for Minerva and discovers that Snape is alive, is living as a Muggle with no memory of his magical life, and has a daughter Lily's age who has just received her Hogwarts letter. A sentimental journey to bring Severus home.Thanks to my wonderful badgerlady, who re-beta'd this entire story in the space of a day or two, formatted it with HTML tags, and got it ready for archiving here.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Every year on Christmas, Harry wants to hear the story of how he arrived at Spinner's End... in a box.
