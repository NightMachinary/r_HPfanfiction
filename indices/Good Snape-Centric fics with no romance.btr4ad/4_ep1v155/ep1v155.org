This one's a Severus adopts Harry one,"Unsaid" linkffn(8424769), and this story an extreme AU now, but super fun, "It Falls to the Young" linkffn(2713360), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4787853/plutoplex][plutoplex]] writes a lot of Severus-focused stuff. I especially like "The Sorting of Severus Snape" linkffn(11856536) and "Thine Own Self" linkffn(12492649). Then I'll throw out my own fic. Admittedly, there's some romance, but it's not truly a big part of the story, "Black Eyes" linkffn(12921782)
