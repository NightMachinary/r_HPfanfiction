Currently, publishing houses tend to prefer manuscripts written in First Person or Third Person Limited because their sales data indicates that's what readers tend to prefer - they want stories where they have a closer connection to the protagonist, something you don't get so easily in Third Person Omniscient.

The general advice seems to be to use First Person if you have a sufficiently interesting/quirky main character and/or your characterization if better than your plot; use Limited if your plot is stronger than your character. The HP stories wouldn't have done so well if they were First Person through Harry's eyes.

There are also some types of stories that can't work well at all except in First Person, like mysteries. Readers need to be kept ignorant of the things that the main character is ignorant of. In contrast, political thrillers and similar stories are usually better in Third Person Omniscient (there's a reason why Clancy always used that).

It's easy to see, then, why First Person is hard to do well. You need a strong main character - strong enough to carry the story and interesting enough for it to be worth being in their head all the time. You also need to be able to construct that plot in a way it will work even though you're only ever seeing things through the eyes of the main character (breaking away from that first person perspective is possible, but needs to be done carefully and rarely).

Some authors manage to do it well and others struggle with it. Jim Butcher, author of the Dresden Files, has written that he had a lot of trouble doing Third Person, but found First Person much, much easier. The first Dresden book was, in fact, his very first attempt at it.

My two current series are Third Person Limited, and I think I do alright at it. I've written one story in First Person and it has been quite the challenge - editing is taking much longer than even the early chapters of my other stuff. I wanted to stretch myself and see if I could do it because I'm developing an original novel that probably ought to be done in First Person - if I can do it well, it will probably end up being a much better story.
