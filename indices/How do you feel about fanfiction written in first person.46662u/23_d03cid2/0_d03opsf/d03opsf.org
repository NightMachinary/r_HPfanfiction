Or the type I like to read/write in general (not just fanfic), third person limited/mostly limited with shifts to diary entries/letters. Diary entries/epistles are great for getting through the mundane and really developing the character. I'd say letters are better if it's a couple. One thing I hate is the switching POV between a couple (actually, I don't like multiple POV, with the exception of ASoIaF), when that could be done better by separating the couple and having them write letters to each other. You can have epistles in a third person limited type story, and that can actually be really useful for seeing the thoughts of the person the main character is exchanging letters with.
