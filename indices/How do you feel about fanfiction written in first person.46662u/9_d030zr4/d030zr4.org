First-person is fine with me as long as the writer knows what they're doing and is good at convincing me this voice belongs to that character. They also have to be aware of the particular limitations of first person POV. There are a lot of pitfalls to first-person, similar to third-person but somehow more grating when it's meant to be the character's thoughts or stream of consciousness. Too many first-person fics feel instantly OOC. And violating the inside POV will throw me right out - Harry describing an expression on his own face, for example, or knowing something he couldn't possibly know because the writer has forgotten they can't suddenly info-dump the way they could in a more flexible 3rd-person narrative. You can't reveal a backstory if Harry has no plausible reason to know that backstory.

It usually takes me a page or so to adjust to the writer's conception of a character's voice, but if it feels plausible, I can give myself over to a story just as easily as if it were 3rd-person. And if I enjoy being in that character's head, I'm happy to read thousands of words.

If the voice feels wrong or I simply don't believe it, I backbutton. Very few writers can manage 1st-person Snape, for instance. Ditto 1st-person Dumbledore - although, come to think of it, I'm not sure I've actually read 1st-person Dumbledore. Even close third would be difficult in his case. Also, Hermione. All three of these characters have habits of mind that require high degrees of competence, but their intelligence would express itself very differently.

In some ways, I'm more likely to lavish praise on someone who executes a good 1st-person POV because, done right, it's a huge challenge. So I'd give extra points to anyone with the writing chops to pull it off.
