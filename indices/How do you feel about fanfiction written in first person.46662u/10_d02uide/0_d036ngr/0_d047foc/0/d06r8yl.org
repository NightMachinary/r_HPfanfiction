I took it from near the start of a fic I'm writing and just changed it from past to future tense as a stupid exercise, but reading through your post I see what you mean.

It does take a good writer to pull it off, but I have seen some stories use tense changes to good effect, especially present tense when describing dream-like sequences or to keep the reader off balance. IIRC linkffn(By That Last Candle's Light) was a great example, but it's used in professional works as well.

Actually, Tim Winton's short story "Big World" might be the only story I know that uses future tense. At the end the MC is stuck out in the desert and it describes what will happen next. It creates a pretty good effect actually.
