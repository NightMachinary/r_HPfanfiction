What about future tense then? Here's a sample of text rewritten for your enjoyment:

#+begin_quote
  Rain is going to be coming down in sheets. The streets will be dark and empty, barely illuminated by lamps whose light will struggle to break through the fog to pool faintly below. On either side are going to sit rows of unspectacular townhouses, that will form a dreary fa√ßade of grey-brown bricks. Curtains will be drawn firmly across windows, and any light that is going to escape will be quickly absorbed into the night.

Annoying, huh?
