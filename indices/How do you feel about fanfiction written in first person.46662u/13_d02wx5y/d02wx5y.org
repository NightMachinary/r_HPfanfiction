I generally don't with fanfiction. I feel it's harder to pull of a good first POV in fanfiction because the fandom already knows how the character is supposed to sound like and what they think, especially in a such a well-established series like Harry Potter. There are lot more opportunities to sound OOC in first person, imo. I'm extra critical with fanfics if they are in first person.

Of course there are always those awesome gems that are the exception, but that's because the author has nailed the character down perfectly.
