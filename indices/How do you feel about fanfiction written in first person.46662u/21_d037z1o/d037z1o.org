I'm not sure why I don't like it, but I've felt that way since I started reading. It's not the author, though - it's definitely me.

Take Joe, for example. I just can't get into Wastelands of Time, but An Unfound Door is really engaging. The only first-person fic I've ever liked is The Lie I've Lived.
