No, I don't think there is a right or wrong way - it's all down to personal preference, the same as with tenses. I can't stand stories (fanfic or original works) written in present tense, but other people don't mind it or even prefer it to past tense.

Likewise, I don't like first person as much, for the most part, while others love it, and neither of us are wrong. I can be convinced by good writing, but it does make me hesitate when I see it's in first person. I think it's because HP canon is in third person, so it just doesn't feel very 'Harry Potter' to me? At least that's the best reason for it I can articulate, since I'm not generally bothered by it in original stuff (though I still like third person best). Second person, however, I loathe with my entire being, and I would rather gag on a mouth guard for an hour than read it, regardless of how well it's written.
