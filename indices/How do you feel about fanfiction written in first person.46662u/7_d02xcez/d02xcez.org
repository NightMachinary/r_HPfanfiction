It has its merits. Having both read and written first-person fics, the margins are a lot smaller: it's a lot harder to write than third-person, but once you get the hang of it, it's also a lot more fun to write than your run of the mill third-person story.

Of course, first person a bit irksome to read, particularly for people who are very used to conventional third-person stories, but if you really want to get into a character's head, there's really no substitute for it. My humour fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]], wouldn't be half of what it is if it wasn't told from Harry's POV.
