The fight scene at the end of significant digits has exactly this

"Bellatrix!"

The cry came from above.

"Bellatrix Black!"

It was otherworldly.

"Bellatrix Black!"

It was enraged.

"Bellatrix Black!"

It was magnificent.

"BELLATRIX BLACK!"

It was Neville Longbottom.

He came from the sky. He didn't land, exactly - rather, he plummeted to the roof in a swooping dive, so steep that it seemed as though he would simply crash straight through the slates, but Longbottom pulled up at the last minute dead even with the slates, alighting and walking without even an instant of transition. He stepped forward and the broom clattered to the roof and Longbottom was already attacking, once twice thrice, as though gravity and timing and all the laws of possibility were mere formalities that he'd chosen to discard. Tall and terrible, the Lord Longbottom moved like the wind.

He attacked Bellatrix, and it was a thing of beauty and glory - choreographed, as if it had been practiced every day for years. High feint drawing a shield, which put him into position for obfuscation, and which in turn flowed seamlessly into three glowing offensive bolts. It was a series like any auror would learn... but rather than two or three spells in sequence, Longbottom attacked without ceasing, a rhythmic and timed flow of variety and passion. He switched from low attacks to broad ones, raised wards and then shattered them with surprising new offensives, and stripped away Bellatrix's defenses with a hurricane of attacks.

In an existence that threatened to become overcrowded with the unbelievable, Pip still found room for astonishment.

Bellatrix laughed; high-pitched, insane. "Silly little do-" she began, but a flurry of attacks cut her off, and she was forced to defend herself. "Silly bi-" she began again, only to again be forced to bark out a shield of crystal and dodge away from danger.

"You -"

"Silly bi-"

No one could be standing after attacking endlessly, relentlessly, unstoppably, but Neville Longbottom never broke his stride and never broke his sequence. One spell followed another, one attack followed another, one shield followed another. No openings, no weaknesses, no opportunities, no respite.

Bellatrix Black's laugh broke. She lashed away attacks and raised wards and cast curses, but she was not fighting a wizard. She was fighting an elemental force.

And every taunt and every joke and every insanity was cut off by some new attack. Every word broken by offense. Every moment under siege.

"That's -"

Longbottom advanced without pausing, never breaking stride. He was discarding his humanity, and doing it despite eyes streaming with tears.

"No -"

"You -"

And finally, Bellatrix's mad smile cracked as she desperately ducked the hundredth attack, and she shrieked with a voice full of fear, "Stop!"

And like a wrathful god, Neville Longbottom, a thousand feet tall and burning with brimstone, roared in return, "That's what they said to you! Avada Kedavra!"
