I would not say this is a BAMF Neville. This is a pretty good Neville centric fic, but with the exception of the ship felt like a straight canon rehash. I skimmed the first third, very bored, and then enjoyed the ship as it developed more in fourth year and beyond. However, he didn't really develop any major skills or exhibit any traits that I would characterize as BAMF. good canonish defiance of Voldemort at Hogwarts battle, but it literally says he does his big thing by sheer dumb luck. That kind of deus ex machina is exactly what dragged me down from canon. The protagonist squeaking their way through on luck is not BAMF.
