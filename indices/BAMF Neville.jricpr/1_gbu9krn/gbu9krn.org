So, this entire fic is dark as fuck, but Neville is absolutely a badass in it. However, let me be very clear - he is not a good person in this fic. None of the main characters in this fic are good. This author is /amazing/ at writing sympathetic villains as main characters in such a way that you are engaged and kind of want them to win while at the same time being completely unable to deny that they are not good people and while their enemies may be not the best people either, the MCs are objectively worse.

So. If that isn't an immediate hard stop for you, I very much recommend Pygmalion by Colubrina.
