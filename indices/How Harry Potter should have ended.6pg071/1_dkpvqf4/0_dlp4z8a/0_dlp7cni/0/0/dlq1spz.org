Can't think of one off the top of my head; but I do recall reading fics with Atlantis before HPMOR.

FFnet search seems to offer at least some, but that's only those that offer it in title or description: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/search/?ready=1&keywords=Atlantis&categoryid=224&genreid1=0&genreid2=0&languageid=0&censorid=0&statusid=0&type=story&match=&sort=&ppage=1&characterid1=0&characterid2=0&characterid3=0&characterid4=0&words=0&formatid=0]] .

For that matter, I suspect that LessWrong was at the very least inspired by the /Vision of Escaflowne/ anime in that respect.
