It's not an unreasonable ending, but not really more interesting than canon.

One ending that would have been interesting to see would be Voldemort being on the brink of taking over the world to begin his eternal reign of terror, while the protagonists are scrambling to find Atlantis, which is their last hope for something, anything to defeat him. When they find Atlantis, they do find something: a capacity to simply turn off magic, everywhere in the world, forever, irreversibly.

Do they do it, stopping Voldemort once and for all at the cost of losing something so precious and taking it from everyone else? Or, do they keep the magic, hoping against hope that Voldemort can be defeated in some other way?
