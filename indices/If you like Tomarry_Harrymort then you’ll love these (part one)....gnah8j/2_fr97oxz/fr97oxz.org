#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  Harry finds an oddly cuddly pet in the Dark Lord, and Voldemort finds a sanctuary for his heart in his old nemesis. Fate had never been so strange.

  Voldemort is a day old when he realizes those blasted muggles had named him “Tom.” And he's a day old when it fully sinks in that yes, being reborn, legitimately, instead of from an experimental ritual, sucked. Because he has no idea where he is, what time he is in, who these people are... and he can't control who he is born with. Namely, some other brat who would take the title of his twin... his brother.He is a year old when it sinks in who his twin could possibly be.Because his twin might, possibly, probably be Harry Potter.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

  Harry had no idea how it was possible, however it didn't really matter. What mattered was that they were there and he would do anything to protected them. Even if that meant siding with Voldemort. Even so, he was sure that he had been suffering from temporary insanity, how else could he explain how they came to be? Yes, temporary insanity was the only possible answer.
