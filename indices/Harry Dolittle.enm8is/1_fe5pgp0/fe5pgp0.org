Just a bit nitpicky here, but... "Dolittle blood" wouldn't make you able to talk to animals.

I JUST read a few of the original Doctor Dolittle books by Hugh Lofting, and despite what those Eddie Murphy movies try to claim, Doctor Dolittle didn't have a natural ability to talk to animals. He learned their languages the hard way, by studying, communicating and deducing (and of course having his friend Polynesia the parrot help with the translations, because the parrot who spoke both human language and the language of the birds, and could at least get by in the languages of other animals). It was established that anyone could learn to talk to animals, if they had someone to teach them and were willing to put in the work, which is what happened with Doctor Dolittle's assistant/apprentice Tommy Stubbins.

Also, it was a big plot point that not all animals spoke the same languages. Some stories had as the big plot hook that Doctor Dolittle was trying to learn a new animal language... like he spends large parts of the second book, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, trying to learn how to talk to shellfish.

I mean, Harry being a descendant of "a crazy Muggle doctor who claimed he could talk to animals" could be cute, but there was nothing magical or inherent about Dolittle's ability to talk to animals.

Actually, a Harry Potter/Doctor Dolittle crossover could be interesting. Even though Doctor Dolittle according to the original books lived sometime during the 1800s (one book has him mention "that young man Charles Darwin that everyone's talking so much about these days"), it wouldn't be too hard to find some magical way of getting the Doctor to modern days...

Ooh! How about Doctor Dolittle, out on one of his voyages, encountered a Basilisk, but managed to just look at its reflection and so he got Petrified... and nobody knew where he was so everyone just assume he died. Then, more than a century later, in the 1990s, a wizard finds him and revives him with Mandrake draught... and now there's a bit of a problem because here's the Muggle man, from a century ago, can't let him back out into Muggle society just like that.

Then, they discover that Dolittle can talk to animals, and begin wondering if he really IS a Muggle or not. And... why not, let's get Hagrid in on the mix. Hagrid and Dolittle become friends, and the Doctor tries teaching Hagrid animal languages, and they have tea in Hagrid's hut and the Doctor is a guest lecturer at a Care of Magical Creatures class, and he gets fascinated with Parseltongue...

Now I want this storyyyyy!!! I want a John Dolittle/Rubeus Hagrid friendship fic!! It has nothing to do with the original post, but I want iiiiitt!!!
