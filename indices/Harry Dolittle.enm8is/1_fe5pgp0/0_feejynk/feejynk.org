Outline: John Dolittle is found by Feris Gaunt who hears about a muggle that has a unicorn crossbreed in violation of the statute of secrecy. Feris nabbed the muggle, who is a unknowing a muggle born squib. Feris has to renovate Hogwarts and plans to use John to help control the Basilisk while he re-hides the Chamber entrance. He uses the Basilisk to kill John and tosses the body in the water. John planned ahead and wore mirrored glasses so he was only petrified.

AU end of second year: Harry realizes the Basilisk is worth some money that can be used to hire tutors for the kids that were petrified and missed classes.

Chamber is fully explored and John is found. His story is told and he is given a job as CoMC professor along with Hagrid.

Rough draft outline.
