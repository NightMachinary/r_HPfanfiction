It's a massively-expanded adaptation of a one-shot of the same name which [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][can be found here]] (on FFN). Note that while it does do a lot of world-building, the original writer is very cynical (and Scottish), so pays a lot of attention to how magic can be used to make society very unfair...

Cue Severus Snape teaming up with Dragon!Harry to try and overturn/rebuild Wizarding Society...
