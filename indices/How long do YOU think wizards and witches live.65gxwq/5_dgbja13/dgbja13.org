Two cases:

1) Wizard medicine has, for quite a long time, been of a quality analogous to the best Modern mundane medicine of perhaps another few decades from now, and wizards' standard of living is comparable to at least the middle class of modern first-world nations. In this case, 137 as average life expectancy is not so far-fetched, perhaps.

2) Being magical makes you live longer, intrinsicically. Like, your magic will instinctively take over body functions as your parts would otherwise fail due to old age. The strongest wizards live for a ridiculously long time, because they have more magic power, so it takes longer for their magic to not be able to keep them going. Squibs likely are on the upper end of mundane lifespans. Dumbledores and Merlins live for centuries, if they do not fall to accident or disease. However, since most of their magic is stuck keeping them not dead, their ability to actually do magic is much weakened - so such wizards probably hide themselves away, OR they run into 'everyone I ever knew or loved is long dead' and die of broken hearts, or even suicide, as they lack the ability to share their long lives with others. This recurs because even these wizards are too damn stupid - or lack the courage or cunning - to use their longevity to singlemindedly stalk Death across the lonely centuries, to banish it forever. In this case, Flamel is/was a relatively low-magic wizard, but he maintains the same level of magic due to the Stone, or the Stone requires one to permanently sacrifice a large portion of one's life and magic to create or something like that (which explains why so few seem to attempt it. I sure would.)
