Rowling has never been good with numbers. 137 seems really high.

I would expect the median age to be on the upper end of our life expectancy. So, maybe 85ish, with some living a lot longer and some a lot shorter. The number of wars (at least in Britain) has some effect. I'm also going off the Black family tree: the oldest person listed there lived to about 90. Then again, I /just/ said Rowling has never been good with numbers (and there is a 13 year old having a kid), so I don't really know.

Edit: autocorrect never understands when I try to type "just"
