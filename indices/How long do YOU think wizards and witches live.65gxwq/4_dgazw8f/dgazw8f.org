My sense is that the wizarding risk profile is very different from the risk profile of a Muggle in the developed world: the hazard (annual risk) of death from natural causes is much lower for all age categories; the hazard of death by accident is probably about the same, especially for adults (since children are protected by Accidental Magic); but the hazard of a violent death is much higher.

Now, most wizards and witches actually has quite a bit of control over the latter factor: if they

1. refrain from being a Dark Wizard/Witch;
2. refrain from fighting Dark Wizards/Witches;
3. hide when categories 1 and 2 take an interest in them;
4. do not engage in magical experimentation;

then they can expect to live for a very, very long time --- easily hundreds of years.

In short, the 137 life expectancy at birth might actually be plausible, if one excludes violent death, and the "silent majority" of wizards and witches who don't ever do anything interesting enough to be noticed by Harry Potter may well reach or exceed that lifespan.

Mind you, not everyone has that option. Muggleborns certainly didn't with Voldemort around.
