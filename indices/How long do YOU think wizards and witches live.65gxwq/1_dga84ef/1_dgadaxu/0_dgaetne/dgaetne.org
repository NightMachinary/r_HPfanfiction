I'd say Flamel doesn't count tho, since he had specific magic aid to live longer, he'd be an exception.

I guess magic generally helps you to live longer because getting food is much less of a problem for an adult wizard than for a muggle, and "muggle" sickness is also no problem as JKR stated.

Even if there's magic illnesses, doesn't seem like part of every-day life for them, to get sick. Most of us generally get a flu/cold once per year at least, and have to deal with allergies, stomach problems or something. A person who never gets sick is remarkable.

I imagine all these, added up generally helps wizards to naturally live longer.

Now, I'd say it's commonplace to wizards to hit three digits, but not more than 130. 130+ is not unheard of, but it's like 90 in the muggle world. And 150+ is like 100 in the muggle world, you occasionally heard about this, but rarely know someone personally.
