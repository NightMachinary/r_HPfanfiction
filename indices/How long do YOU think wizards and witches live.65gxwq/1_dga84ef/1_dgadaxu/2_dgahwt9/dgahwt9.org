Was it ever confirmed that Flamel didn't just cook up another stone? I mean as long as he goes into hiding (so no telling even Dumbledore!) nobody will be the wiser till he shows back up once Voldemort has been dealt with (hell, he doesn't even have to show back up, he can get himself a new identity)
