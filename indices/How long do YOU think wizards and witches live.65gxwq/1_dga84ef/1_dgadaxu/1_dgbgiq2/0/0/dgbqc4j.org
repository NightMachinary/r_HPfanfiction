Rowling has shown time and time again that canon consistency between mediums is not at all a priority. Even her own [[http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/therules.htm][list of rules]] contradicts what is established in books.

Your final point, is however a good one. I don't disagree with the notion that Wizards have supernaturally lengthened their lives, just using the movies as a source.
