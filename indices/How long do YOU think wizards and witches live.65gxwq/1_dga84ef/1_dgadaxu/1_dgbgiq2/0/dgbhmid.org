I'll admit, most of this is not from the books, but it's all from Rowling or works Rowling was involved with so there really aren't grounds to reject them (save the first one).

Barry Winkle

- A newspaper from the Philosopher's Stone (this was probably a reference and not really meant to be taken seriously.)

Armando Dippet

- Snape's newspaper in the Chamber of Secrets confirms the month and year of his birth.

Nicholas Flammel

- "There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)." (Chapter 13, 176)
