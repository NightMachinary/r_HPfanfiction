In canon, we only see like two witches and wizards naturally living longer than the oldest muggle on record (jeanne calment lives to 122). Off the top of my head, there is Bathilda Bagshot (who was Grindelwald's great-aunt) and Griselda Marchbanks (who was like 130 in book 7). Other than that, you've got the Flamels because of the Philosopher's Stone. I can't think of any other evidence to supports a triple digit average lifespan other than "magiclol".

Given what we know, I think it's possible that a witch/wizards average life span is 10-20 years older. But, it also seems like they're more likely to die from other causes before old age catches up to them. Dumbledore was pretty active when he got killed at 109, so I could see him having lived to 150, but that I definitely think that would be an outlier and not the normal.
