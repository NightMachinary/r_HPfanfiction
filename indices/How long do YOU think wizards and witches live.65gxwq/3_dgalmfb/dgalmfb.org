I go with the average Rowling presented. It doesn't matter for what I write, so I didn't waste too much time thinking about it, but in general I like it when the expectancy for a wizard or witch is so high.

Most humans die of some disease. Magicals shake off dementia or cancer like its nothing with the right potion.

  Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. - from Pottermore.

So if the main reason for death is gone, a high life expectancy is just something to be expected. Add magic to the equation and its going to be relatively normal to reach ridiculous ages (in the eyes of muggles).
