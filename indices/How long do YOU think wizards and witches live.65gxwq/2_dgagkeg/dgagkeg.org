Well, Griselda Marchbanks examined Dumbledore, who taught Voldemort, who recruited Lucius Malfoy, who fathered Draco Malfoy. If we say generations are 25 years apart, Marchbanks is at least 15+25+25+25+25 = 115 years old.

And she's still working happily and isn't mentioned as unusually long-lived. So 137 life expectancy is pretty consistent with what we see in the books.

EDIT: Bathilda Bagshot is yet another generation above (so, at least 140). But it's clear she's getting on a bit by the 1990s...
