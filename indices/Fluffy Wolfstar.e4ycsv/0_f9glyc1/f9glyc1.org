Fluffy Wolfstar?

The first idea that came to my mind is Remus giving Padfoot a really good wash to make his fur coat nice and soft, and then for Sirius to do the same to (a Wolfsbaned) Moony.

Softest cuddly doggos.

Edit: Unfortunately, I haven't read enough Wolfstar to remember any fics to recommend.
