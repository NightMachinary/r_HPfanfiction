Please. Those fics are so rare, you'd be able to find a gold nugget randomly on the street before you find a fic that doesnt overexaggerate the angst-hurt-drama and abuse to limits where no fiction should go. Especially those fics, that are so drilled on portraying a victim-Harry, that he suddenly starts hurting himself, is suicidal and gay and has creature inheritance and is pure-bottom and submissive and likes knotting. and whatnot.

FUCK. I forgot. He also gets raped by Vernon, Dudley and Voldemort and then Fenrir and then a vampire and then starts sleeping around with all the males in the canon story because thats what gay bottom rape victims who are suicidal do.
