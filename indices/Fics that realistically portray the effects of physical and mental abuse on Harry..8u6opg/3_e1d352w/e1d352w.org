Well, I have a post Hogwarts female Harry story I'm writing that does include issues and troubles that she still has as an adult due to her abusive childhood, most of which I took directly from my own experiences as a child in an abusive household, and my own experiences now as an adult with issues from it still, even after therapy and actual love and care given to me.

But I'm sure it's not what you're looking for, because it's not canon rehash Hogwarts years in the slightest, and it's not a huge focus of the story, because in my life it's not a huge focus to me either. It's there, it always is, and sometimes it bursts out and totally takes over, makes itself known, but...it's not a focus. I don't focus on it. So it's not focused on in my story.
