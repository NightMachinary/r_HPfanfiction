FYI, there is a psychological concept called "resilience", which refers to an individual's ability to come out of adverse/traumatic experiences relatively unscathed. Some individuals have more of it than others, and the causes of this variation are the subject of much research.

Harry's high level of psychological resilience is unusual, certainly. Very few people have that level of resilience and it is perhaps his most laudible characteristic. Dumbledore certainly seems to think so, because in HBP he describes Harry's continued good nature despite everything he has been through as his greatest power.

But it's not /unrealistic/ in the sense of not being able to happen in real life. There /are/ people out there who do just have higher psychological resilience than others.
