That's the one thing I try to get across in my fics. Harry is a survivor, a fighter. All the shit that life threw at him didn't keep him down.

BUT, everyone has a breaking point. It might be something completely mundane or random and yet trigger a flashback. In canon, it was the deaths of Cedric and Sirius. Yet it also won't just reduce Harry to a moping mess of angst and tears. For Harry, it would probably be an episode where he feels like shit or breaks down, but he'd get his shit together the next morning because he is highly functional.

Same with those atrocious "Hermione gets raped" stories. That girl went through some quality time with Bellatrix Lestrange and came out slightly worse for wear. Does anyone really believe that "Random Thug No 4" could break her if not even Voldemort's right hand could do the trick? If anything, Hermione would lay back and think of +Britain+ 28 ways to extract retribution to her rapist and anyone even remotely connected to him.
