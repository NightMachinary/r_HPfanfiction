"Harry is a survivor, a fighter"... really? did we read the same books?

as far as I can remember Harry is most often than not an impulsive child with a Hero complex that usually waits until the shit hits the fan and then marches unprepared and survives by the skin of his teeth when he probably shouldn't... probably because of fate. The only instance of which I remember Harry behaving as a survivor is when he basically said: "hey there are those soul sucking thingies that are around the school and totally want to kill me, I should probably look for a way to protect myself against them"
