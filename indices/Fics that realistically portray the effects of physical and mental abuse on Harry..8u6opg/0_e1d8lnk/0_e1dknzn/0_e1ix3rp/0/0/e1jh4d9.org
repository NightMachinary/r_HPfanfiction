-"He survived "10 dark years" filled with child abuse and torture"

result of "off-screen" backstory, hardly counts as actual characterization. Even more so when the author treats it as cartoon violence

-"He continued the fight after Berlin had fallen Voldemort took over the Ministry. He defied Umbridge. He told the Minister to go fuck himself."

again "Hero complex" is not survivor behavior, and notice how he pretty much always waited until everything crashed down onto him and then pretty much bashed his head against the problem unless St. Hermione was around, again hardly a survivor behavior

But then again the Harry Potter franchise has more plotholes than a swish cheese, these ones only adds to the load

as far as saying he's a fighter... well I would argue that a "figther" should be willing to use more than a training sword when his opponents are using guns and that he should accept that in a war you should aim to the permanent incapacitation of enemy combatants. (read: his fixture in expeliermus and his unwillingness to kill are both retarded) but I guess that would depend in how one saw such things
