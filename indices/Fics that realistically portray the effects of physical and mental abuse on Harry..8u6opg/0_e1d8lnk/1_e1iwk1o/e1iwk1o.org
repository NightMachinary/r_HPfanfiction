It is actually unrealistic, while is true that "resilience" can get you trough a lot of shit Harry's behavior is not really consistent with a really resilient person.

Resilient people who have been submitted to systematic abuse more often than not have one or more of the following characteristic

-unemotional reaction to most social interaction as a defense mechanism -fanatical and almost unbreakable belief in a concept or idea -high level of proficiency at any given skill that they relied to survive (resilient people are known to show different grades of obsessive behavior, it is believed that is this single mindedness which allows to tolerate hostile environments)

the unrealistic thing about the books is that Harry doesn't really show so much resilience since his reaction to negative environments is more often than not brooding and mopping
