  Like, the above fic by Potato19 sounds like a massive cliche, all it needs now is for Harry to gain a harem with Daphne, Luna, the Patil twins and Tonks and bam, instant powerwank mess of writing.

Luckily that's not what's going on in that story - at all.

It's really dangerous to judge fics by their summary or which clich√©s show up - I wouldn't have ever read some of my favorites like "Dodging prison.."
