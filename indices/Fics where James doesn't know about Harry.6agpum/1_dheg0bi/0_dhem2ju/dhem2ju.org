Yeah, I've never understood the points of fics like these, because they always devolve into bashing and horribly OOC protagonists and antagonists.

Like, the above fic by Potato19 sounds like a massive cliche, all it needs now is for Harry to gain a harem with Daphne, Luna, the Patil twins and Tonks and bam, instant powerwank mess of writing.
