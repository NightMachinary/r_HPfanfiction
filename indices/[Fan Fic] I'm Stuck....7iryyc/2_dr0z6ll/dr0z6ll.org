I've only got two chapters done. I thought this up in the shower this morning then wrote most of it while in a towel.

Since then, I've sat down and fleshed it out quite a bit more, however I knew if I didn't write it now, I'd never even get started.

P.S. Going over the first book to make sure I had timings right I realized just how incredibly fast it moves. Harry makes it to Hogwarts on page 113. Most of the books I read now wouldn't have the MC arriving at his destination till the second book.
