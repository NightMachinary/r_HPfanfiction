Stop, take a deep breath. My recommendation is to not publish anything for at least one month after you first write it. Nothing is ready to publish for at least three revisions. If you don't have a beta that's fine, but read through your story multiple times for plot holes, flow, and general ways you can improve the story. Try to write as much of the story as you can before you publish, because it is key that it come together as a cohesive whole.
