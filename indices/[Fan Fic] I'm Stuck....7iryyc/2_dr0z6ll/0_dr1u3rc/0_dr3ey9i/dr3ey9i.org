Thanks for the feedback. I really do appreciate it. Most of my writings I do exactly what you said, but I've had so many ideas for HP fanfics that I've never acted on, I knew I would never write it if I didn't get it out.

As bad as the first two chapters are, I now have an incentive to finish. I've actually sat down and started the work on it now, but I had to get it out, otherwise, I'd still be sitting here daydreaming.

I will admit, this is my first time using MCs from the source material. My other writings have been about side characters we don't know much about yet, which allowed me to pretty much make them OCs. So I'm a bit nervous about writing with characters so well fleshed out through canon and Fandom.

I ask that you be patient with me and I promise you a story that will be fun to read.
