I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] by Silently Watches. Its fem!Harry, but the main character is a voodoo witch who tortures and murders people. It contains many other unique elements and is extremely well written, but it does contain some disturbing topics.

  Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. DARK and NOT for children. fem!bisexual!Harry, minor fem!Harry/Viktor, eventual fem!Harry/Luna, powerful!Harry, James and Lily are alive, twin is BWL, year 4, less cliched than it sounds
