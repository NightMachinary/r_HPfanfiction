/HP & the Descent into Darkness/ (W:267,992|Complete) matches your criteria perfectly, but otherwise it's of a rather poor quality. HP\LV slash, moral hypocrisy, OoC LV (especially as the story progresses), manipulative /and/ stupid Dumbledore.

There are two stories in which, because of the nature of his magic, Harry is inclined to enjoy causing sufferings and death, but in both he struggles to keep his moral grounds intact and his alliance at least as Chaotic Neutral. These stories are /[[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc]]/ (W:3KK|Complete) and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]/ (W:205,387|7 month-long hiatus).

I also second /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]/ (W:283,053|WiP), but it starts as a crackfic and I'm not sure where is it headed now. Still, it will be worth checking out.
