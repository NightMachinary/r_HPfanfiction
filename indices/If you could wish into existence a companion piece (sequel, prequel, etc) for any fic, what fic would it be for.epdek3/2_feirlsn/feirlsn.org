Puzzle is great, and they also have a great SW fic as well as a Dresden Files/ASoIaF cross (on Ao3), though if I had the power to wish a sequel/prequel I'd probably wish for a fic to be finished instead.

For the HP side of me, I'll have to go with an actual Denarian IV (Apocalypse), though if that's a bit too crossovery then I'd wish for I'm Still Here to be finished.

That said, for non-HP fics I'm once again wishing for a fic to be finished, this time either “A Demon Among Devils” (a Persona 3 and High School DxD cross) or “Beyond the Outer Gates Lies...” (a Dresden Files and DxD cross) though the latter has a sorta-sequel with a fan made continuation which is also pretty good.
