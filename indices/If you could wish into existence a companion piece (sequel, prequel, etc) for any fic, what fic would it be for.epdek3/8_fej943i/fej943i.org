[A BIT OF SELF-PROMOTION]

Don't wish into existence anything, just sit down and write it. My two last stories (very much unpublishable pre-alpha drafts so far) are such, and I could very much use some opinion on what I am doing there:

- [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/prayers_another_take.html][Prayers --- another take]] is a prequel to linkffn(6494461) (warning: yes, I am a Christian, and it talks about Bible, faith, prayers, and such; don't read if you cannot stand it), and

- [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][Brother and Sister]] includes (among other things) a kind of sequel to linkffn(12551744), which is a very nice story, but it feels abandoned although it is marked as Completed.

Any opinions on where those stories should go? The first probably will stay as this one shot, Hermione will leave and we can continue with DH as if nothing happened (I wonder whether she even tells the truth about this to Harry & Ron), well the completely idiotic Battle of Seven Potters wouldn't happen, and good riddance. With the second, I don't know: it misses some overarching plot and story, it is so far just an amalgamation of various headcannons thrown together. Any ideas?
