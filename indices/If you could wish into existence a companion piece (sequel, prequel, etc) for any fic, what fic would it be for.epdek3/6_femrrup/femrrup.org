I want an alternate ending/sequel to Starfox5's Marriage Law Revolution where the war on the continent despite initial successes goes badly, and fears of invasion lead to a coup installing a respected, ambitious, and strategically brilliant general as a military dictator. I want to see him turn the war around, I want to see him slowly consolidate power, I want to see him crowned emperor, I want to see a hubristic invasion of a major foreign power, and I want to see him finally deposed. Basically I want Ron as Napoleon, presented as an antivillain with good intentions slowly descending into despotism over the course of the story.
