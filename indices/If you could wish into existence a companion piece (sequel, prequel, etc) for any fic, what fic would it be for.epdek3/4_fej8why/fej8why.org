I'd like a fic like Petrification Proliferation with adults acting sensibly for every year. Year One McGonagall takes Harry seriously and resolves the issue. Year 3 Harry gets done body guards and Lupin/Snape don't play games with the werewolf thing. Year 4 involves lawyers. Lots and lots of lawyers Year five a parental lynch mob after the blood quill.
