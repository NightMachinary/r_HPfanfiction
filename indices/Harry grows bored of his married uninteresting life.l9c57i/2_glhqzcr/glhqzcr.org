Plot Twist: Harry picked up quite a few things from Dumbledore. He knows that the witch is planning to escape without fulfilling her promise, but capturing her will prove to be enough of a adventure. Harry 'accidentally' releases her, and when she is released focuses more on saving his subordinates from being killed by a dangerous witch with Wandless magic and thus allows her to escape.

After that his Head of Department wants to give him a slap on the wrist, but Harry begs her to suspend him and give him the mission of solo capturing the witch so that he can 'right his wrongs'.
