Yeah, this plotline with a smarter Harry will have some repercussions as well. The witch was using wandless Light and Colorchanging Charms but Harry's 'lapse of judgement' had him protecting his colleague from harmless spells. Also Rita Skeeter still publishes her article with lots of hearsay about a romance between Harry and the Dark witch.

If you wanted a story where Harry has an actual moment of vulnerability, have Harry sleep with the witch - she escapes after that. Either she seduces Harry into it, or Harry uses his power over her to get laid. It would give Harry lots of internal turmoil.
