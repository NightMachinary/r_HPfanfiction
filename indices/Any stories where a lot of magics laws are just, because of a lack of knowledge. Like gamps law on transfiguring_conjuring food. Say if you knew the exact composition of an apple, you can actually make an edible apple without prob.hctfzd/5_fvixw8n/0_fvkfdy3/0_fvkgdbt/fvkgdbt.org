Usually, that sort of story starts going into "all wizards are idiots" territory, with the key to all magic being atoms or computers or something like that. And that inevitably leads to making a nuke and blowing up voldemort.

That's honestly what I've observed. I don't think I've ever seen a story that has both play a part in it without making one superior in every way.
