No, it isn't. It's magic. Magic is neither physical nor chemical, it's /magical/. There are magical reactions, which make potions possible, there are magical energies, which spells are made from. But none of these are "just another energy", because otherwise, muggles would have discovered them with the rest. What you're describing is classic mugglewank.

Not to mention, the wizards understand /much more/ of the universe. They know what souls are. They can map the mind, walk around inside memories. They have accurate, real-time maps of the entire galaxy. They know for a fact that the afterlife exists, that secrets and knowledge are tangible, real things. I hate what you're describing, it's so damn reductive in all concievable ways.
