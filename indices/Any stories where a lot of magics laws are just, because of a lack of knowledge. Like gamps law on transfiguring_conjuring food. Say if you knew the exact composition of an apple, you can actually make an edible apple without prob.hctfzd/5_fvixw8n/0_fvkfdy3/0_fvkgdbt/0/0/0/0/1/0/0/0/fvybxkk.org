Alright, I agree there. A magical will always think with magic first, while a muggle won't.

As for your second point - magic definitely actively evades muggles. Dementors for instance can't be seen by muggles, and they aren't created or built, they just spring up around misery. Additionally, I disagree with the notion that it's somehow explainable through physics or chemistry or biology. It's magic, therefore it follows magical rules. Just like how you can't accurately explain a physical reaction through chemical terminology, so can't a magical process be explained through physics.
