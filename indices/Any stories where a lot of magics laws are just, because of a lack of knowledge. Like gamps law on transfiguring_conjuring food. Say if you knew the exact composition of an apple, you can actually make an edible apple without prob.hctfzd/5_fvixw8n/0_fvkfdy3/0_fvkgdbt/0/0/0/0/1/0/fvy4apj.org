It's mugglewank in that you make the magicals too stupid to figure out their own magic, while making the muggles insanely overpowered by somehow managing to understand a force they can neither interact with and which actively evades them. And not only can they interact with it, they can somehow shape and understand it better than those who have literally studied it for thousands of years.

If magic is "just another type of energy", that means that it's a part of the universe, and ergo, interacts with all other parts of the universe, like the universe tends to do. What this means is that the universe wouldn't make any sense without magic, and the muggles would know this.

(and don't say that it's dark energy or dark matter, that's ridiculous)
