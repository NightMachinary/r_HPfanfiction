Because magic, like any force, is energy. It's a very powerful, chaotic, but strangely controllable energy, but that's all it is. Wizards have the power, and creativity, but muggles have the science know-how. Like you said, they've been studying magic for millennia, so imagine if you now add a whole new element. The muggles understanding of the universe. That's why they'd have more to add, because to be honest, wizards have already added most of their stuff to it.
