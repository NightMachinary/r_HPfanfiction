No. I'm saying that muggle science could find ways of using magic that Magicals would not. You've got to understand, a magicals mindset is not as straightforward as a muggles, which makes sense when you can do just about anything with a twist of a wand. Muggles would offer another view point. They have a completely different understanding of life, and that understanding could add to what the Magicals already have. I'm not saying that they can use magic better, i'm just saying that a completely different mindset could help augment how a Magical uses magic.

Also, of course it's another type of energy that's at least a part of Earth, if not the universe. That's why magical flora, creatures, and such esist. The magic permeates the world like any other energy. Magicals are just really good at hiding it.
