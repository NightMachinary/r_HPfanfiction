I'd say that, /were you to describe it using physical terms/, it would be "a form of energy". It doesn't /really/ fit all too well - you can say that Iron is "an array of three-part arrays of 160, 166, 169 or 172 subatomic, twodimensional strings, 54, 57, 60 or 63 of which vibrate with a slightly different frequency from the rest, 1 inner electromagnetic shell containing two subatomic strings that vibrate at a different frequency from those in the core and three more shells, each with 8 more of those same strings", thereby describing the element of iron using physical terms rather than chemical ones, but saying "Fe" is better & infinitely more concise.

And that's chemistry and physics, two fields that are almost intrinsically linked. Any chemist could make sense of that explanation, even if they'd shake their head at it, but magic is only "energy" in the faintest, most conceptual sense of the word. For instance, it seems to be somewhat alive, or at least receptive to concepts only a consciousness can really use or understand, like Secrets or Memories.
