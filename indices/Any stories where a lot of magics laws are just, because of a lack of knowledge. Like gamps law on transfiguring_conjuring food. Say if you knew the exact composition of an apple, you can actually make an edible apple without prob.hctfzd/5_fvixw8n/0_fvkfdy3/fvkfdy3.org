Both. Also understanding the make-up of the world is not mugglewanky. WTH do people always assume that a character gaining a better understanding of what makes up everything is automatically mugglewanky. Sure, using muggle sources makes it much easier, but that doesn't mean I want muggles to be superior. Why can't I just want a story that uses the best of both worlds?
