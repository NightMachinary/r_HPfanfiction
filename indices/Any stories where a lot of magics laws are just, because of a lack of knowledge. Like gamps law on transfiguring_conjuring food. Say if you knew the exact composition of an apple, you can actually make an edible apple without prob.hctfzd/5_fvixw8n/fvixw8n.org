To clarify, do you mean not enough knowledge on muggle sciences, or magical theory? Because I can guarantee you the former would be a very bad, very mugglewanky and very weird story.

It would feature Hermione or Smart!Harry doing something blindingly obvious, make wizards dumb as shit and then degrade into either a soul bond or a lordy lord fic in which Dumbledore and the Weasleys are "punished" and Voldemort is nuked or airstriked despite being the most paranoid motherfucker this side of the atlantic and living through WWII.
