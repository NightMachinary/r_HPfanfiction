I think that Linkao3(689909) had Harry doing something similar with food. He also transfigures things by changing their molecular structure instead of doing the standard spells, and if I remember right at one point he accidentally blows himself up by splitting an atom? Its been a while so I could be misremembering how that happens. The explanation for why his magic is different is that Harry learned real Latin as a child instead of the fake Latin that Hogwarts spells are based on, so he has to make his spells follow different rules.

Don't worry about the relationship tag if that's putting you off, its not relevant yet.
