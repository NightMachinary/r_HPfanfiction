Yeah, the pacing was so bad in that one. I recall that the first part of the story was set in the summer holidays, which dragged on and on and was chock full of exposition. I skipped to the end out of morbid interest and wasn't surprised at what I found, basically the author's self indulgent fanfiction checklist.
