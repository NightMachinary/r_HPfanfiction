In canon, all the books mentioned by Hermione are History books (which make sense considering he pretty much singlehandely ended a Civil War). There are absolutely no mention of any fictional book about Harry ever existing (which is totally the kind of thing, if it existed, would be mentioned either by Draco when mocking Harry or by Skeeter when she wrote her articles in GoF).

The fact that no book exist about him does not change the fact that Harry Potter probably became a household name and that every child at least heard about him and how he survived "You-Know-Who".

That being said, I don't think I read any fanfic about this kind of story. In the rare case where the "Harry Potter fictional stories" are even mentioned, it can usually be summed up by:

- "/Harry find out about these books./
- /Harry is outraged that they didn't ask him the right to use this name or gave him money./
- /Harry sues the authors and/or publishers and get the books taken out the stores with a big sac of galleons going into his vault/".
