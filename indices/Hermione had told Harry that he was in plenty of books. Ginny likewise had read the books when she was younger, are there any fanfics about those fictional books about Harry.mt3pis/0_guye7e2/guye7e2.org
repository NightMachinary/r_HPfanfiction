Well Hermione specifically mentions the books she read in about him: The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts, Modern Magical History and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. I know this is not a discussion but quite frankly I think those sound like boring books for most normal children.

My thought is that Harry was a mystery. He vanquished the darkest wizard and then disappeared into the Muggle world. I feel like many of the stories would have been spread through word of mouth as Harry was rumored to be sighted by some wizards.

I can totally imagine Dedalus Diggle saying "I ran into Harry Potter and he was fighting this evil hag and her pig minion as she was dragging him into that Muggle carriage thing. I wish I could have helped him but I was too taken aback." to which someone responds, "Oh, I think he's safe. I saw him the other day being chased by a band of half trolls-half goblins and he just flew on the roof of a Muggle building to escape them."
