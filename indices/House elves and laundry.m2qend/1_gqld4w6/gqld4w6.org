I like the interpretation that Dobby tricked Lucius into releasing him. Releasing an elf simply requires the symbolic act and intent. When Dobby grabbed the sock, he pretended he was free, which caused Lucius to believe he accidentally freed Dobby. Dobby, being fae, took this belief and used it to slip his bounds.
