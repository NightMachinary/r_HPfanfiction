It's the elves. Unfortunately, Hermione's SPEW efforts with the hats are an example of Rowling's poor worldbuilding. If an elf simply picking up an item of clothing is enough to free them, anyone could free anybody's elf. We know that the elves are aware of what goes on in the school, so they know Hermione is trying to free them. According to the Harry Potter Fandom wiki, the reason they stop cleaning Gryffindor tower is because the elves felt insulted by Hermione's efforts, not out of fear of becoming free.

If the article of clothing has to be given to an elf by their master/mistress /without/ orders to clean it/iron it/ mend it/ whatever, to count as freeing them, this raises a question - for the school elves, who exactly is their master? Is it the Headmaster or Headmistress of the day, or the school as an institution?
