Dobby explains to Harry that the Hogwarts elves felt "insulted" by the Hats. Not threatened. Given that Hermione should have no authority over Hogwarts elves anyway, it seems like nobody except Hermione thought that any elf would be freed by them. The elves probably saw it either as an attempt to fire them from a prestigious home, or as a statement of "I would fire you if I could".

It seems most likely to me that the normal elf must be explicitly given clothes /for themselves/. Given how Kreacher hangs up Harry's cloak, they can handle clothing as lon/ as it's clear that the clothing is still their master's.

Dobby was an extreme case who was desperate for any excuse to leave the Malfoys.
