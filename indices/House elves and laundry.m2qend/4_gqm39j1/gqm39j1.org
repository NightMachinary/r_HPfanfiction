My interpretation is that Hermione's scheme wouldn't have worked. It was just the principle of the matter that offended the House Elves, hence they stopped cleaning the tower:

  “Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. “She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. [...]”

Hence, I think the House Elves do the laundry, and they also tidy up clothes, whenever they /aren't/ left lying around with the intention to free them.
