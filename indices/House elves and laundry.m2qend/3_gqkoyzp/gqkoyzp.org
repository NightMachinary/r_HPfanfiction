HP magic is very much based on intent and symbology. As such, each of those little hats or socks is infused with Hermione's intent to free the elves. This is different to the dirty clothes that everyone else leaves out, which are not intended to change ownership.

What happened with with Dobby is that Lucius threw away a sock that Harry had intended to free Dobby. As Dobby also wanted to be free, and caught the sock, the intent made it so.

It's the difference between saying "I want you to wash and clean all the laundry before putting it away." and handing them clothes before saying "Take these, and get them cleaned." In one you could possibly see a temporary change in ownership, and in the other it's clear that at no point do the clothes change ownership.
