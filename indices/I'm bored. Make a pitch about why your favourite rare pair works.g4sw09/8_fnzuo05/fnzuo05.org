Draco/Ginny is a really interesting one that I haven't seen nearly enough of. It's got all of the â€˜enemies to lovers' potential that Dramione has, but it's also got potential for a competitive rivalry between the two (Quidditch), and I feel like Ginny's characterisation could better with Draco's than Hermione's does.
