Harry/Cedric is one of the most unbelievably sweet pairings I have ever read... I was really surprised when I first came across it. They actually have a really interesting dynamic, they have things like quidditch and the tri-wiz in common, but then have such starkly different family lives. They are both also unbelievably loyal and brave.\\
