I'm a big fan of Harry x Tonks. When Harry meets her he's super angsty, with the weight of the world on his shoulders. She's a bubbly fun older girl, and a lot of fanon tropes around her include her being bullied/used while she was a teen. While it's overused in fics, with Harry being the one guy who likes her for who she is, I think it could be used in a much better way, with her helping him deal with the bullshit he goes through at school by relating it to her own experiences and how she dealt with them. They have a common link with Sirius, and his death could have been used to bring them closer together. She could help loosen him up, and learn to let the bullshit go and only focus on what really matters and what he can control, like dealing with Voldemort and being with his friends. She's also an auror, so she could help him become a better combatant, and they could have a closer relationship even if they're not paired together.
