Eh, they're fictional characters so I see them differently than real life ones. Although the issue for me would be Harry's age specifically rather than the age gap. Like, if he was 18 and she was 25 no one would have a problem with it, but him being 15 when he meets her makes it an issue.

I know that in a lot of places in Europe the age of consent is 16, although I don't know the full context of it (like if it only applies to people less than 5 years older than a 16 year old or something like that), and the wizarding world's adult age is 17. That also only applies to a sexual relationship, so having them not have a sexual relationship until that time would be acceptable legally within the context.
