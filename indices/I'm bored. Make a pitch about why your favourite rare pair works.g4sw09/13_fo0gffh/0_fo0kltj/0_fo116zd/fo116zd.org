Age difference is a funny thing - it's very much dependent on what 'bucket' we mentally slot people into. Like, I sort Tonks into the one /just/ above Harry, so it feels like it's fine but somewhat borderline - whereas her canon pairing of Lupin feels like he's /way/ older than that.

I don't know how the actual differences stack up, and it's very much an emotional response.
