I agree with you, maybe Astoria?

I, however, think any Slytherin would be a nice move to kind of redeem the House, I mean, we never get any named Slytherin being proactive in the bullying other than Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Parkinson, for all we know they were just there and reacted like everyone else, it would be nice to have a character go against the norm and be a black sheep in the House because they are ambitious but don't agree with the racist crap.

This would go against the rather black and white view of Gryffindor = Good and Slytherin = Bad with the other two Houses just being there for show most of the time.

It would also force JKR to write a better romance than HarryxGinny flash romance.
