I legitimately think that Harry should've ended up with a Slytherin girl (or boy, but we all know that was never an option) a year younger than he.

Someone in his year would be a difficult sell, since we never get any indication that any of the Slytherins in Harry's class are anything but totally on board with Malfoy and Parkinson's bullying, and anybody older would have graduated at the end of HBP, so there's nobody to for Harry to worry over in DH like he did Ginny, so it has to be someone younger, but not /too much/ younger, because that'd be creepy. Since Harry was born in late summer, having someone whom he initially treats like a kid because she's a year below him only to have her point out that he's, like, two months older than she is would be pretty funny.

+Plus think of all the "notice me senpai" jokes. Frankly, we should've been making them with Ginny all these years; I'm a little ashamed of the HP fandom right now.+
