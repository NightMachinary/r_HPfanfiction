I loved that fic! Have seen it recommended a couple of times but only got around to reading it today(because someone recommending an author their own work is just hilarious and a great reason for reading it)

Loved both Dudley's and Chos characterizations and the weirdness of trying to fall into a group who all went to school together and dated each other :)

Thanks for the great read!
