Dudley/Cho (post Hogwarts and when he's had time to work on himself a little)

They're both jocks who are kind of underserved in canon and have Complicated relationships with Harry - and throwing them together is a fun way to make that even more complicated.

Plus, anything to get Dudley more attached to the magical world is interesting for me.

On a less wholesome Dudley note... I'd love an AU where Dudley also gets a Hogwarts letter, somehow ends up going, and then Dudley/Draco, two horrible little bullies. They start off enabling each other and bonding over bullying Harry, but later having Dudley around would probably help get Draco to question a lot of his views on muggleborns and could lead to some interesting growth from both of them.
