Krum/Hermione could be a real power couple. Both are smart (Krum a TWT Champion!), courageous, and cosmopolitan. They clearly have some chemistry between them.

Unfortunately, it's hard to find Krumione fic in which their personalities---including the rough edges---are not erased in favour of yet another faux-aristocratic courtship play or some such.

*Edit:* "rough edges", not "rough ages". :|
