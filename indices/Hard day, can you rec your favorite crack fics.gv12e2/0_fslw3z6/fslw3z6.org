  Severus pulled Harry into the closest alcove. “Do you happen to know where Professor McGonagall is?”

  “Nope. The last time I saw her was at breakfast. She didn't appear during our class. Rule Lover went and reported it.”

  “Granger did inform Professor Dumbledore.” Severus was trying to think about what could have happened to Minerva.

  “Severus, what is the pet policy? I have Amber, a birdie, and now a cat. Do I need to get rid of one? I really don't want to. Amber likes having friends.”

  “Amber? A cat?” Severus knew he was going to regret asking.

  “Yes, a sweet tabby. No collar and looked a bit lonely.”

  “Where is this new addition?” Severus pinched the bridge of his nose.

  Harry reached into his robe pocket and pulled out the expandable pouch. “I need to buy supplies for the new kitty.” Harry reached in and pulled out the confused cat. He held onto her, running his hand over the fur. “Isn't she pretty? So sweet.”

  The cat transformed into Professor McGonagall. “In all my years!”

  “Hey, what did you do to my cat!” Harry wasn't happy about his missing cat.

  “Potter, come with me right now.” McGonagall tried to get by Severus who was standing in the front of the exit.

  “She stole my cat!”

  Severus couldn't believe he was going to say this. “I believe there has been a slight misunderstanding.”
