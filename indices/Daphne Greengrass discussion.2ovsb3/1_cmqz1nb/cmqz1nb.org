We're given nothing more than a name in Canon, but somehow (And I'm sure someone on here knows exactly how, and can explain) Daphne as the "Ice Queen" was born. Quotes required since she usually thaws on page 2. I like the Daphne(s) from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][Curse of Truth]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] though.

The Daphne in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] is fun too, but feels like Daphne's name but Tracey Davis's personality.

--------------

You asked for Daphne as she lives in my head however, so I present to you the mishmash of details that have stuck from various fics:

- Pureblood, from the house of Greengrass who stayed out of the first war with Voldemort but are generally viewed with suspicion as they're not a "Light Family"

- Friends (and maybe cousins, roommates, etc) with Tracey Davis, the 'Half-blood cheering-charm-given-human-form'.

- Malfoy's existence (and Gryffindor behavior) makes her want to vomit in her mouth just a bit, and she tries very hard to pretend that they don't share a reality.

- She is embarrassed by her sister Astorias who she thinks ought to have been in Ravenclaw. But Daphne loves her anyway, and will poison your food if you make her cry.

- She reacts violently to hugs. As in stunners at a minimum.

- Resents the idea that she's expected to be a housewife, and reacts violently to any such suggestions (see above).

- Has Arithmancy and Ancient Runes with Hermione, who she... tolerates because she's good at academics.
