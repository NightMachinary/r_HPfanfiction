I read on DLP once that it possibly stemmed from Jeconais' fic, [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]].

As has been said already, we know almost nothing about her canon-wise. I'm fairly confident that JKR has a browse of the fandom every now and again, though, so who knows: we might just see an article of the 'other students' on Pottermore someday.

Personally, I have ideas for her character within the confines of my own AU fic. She definitely isn't an 'Ice Queen', but she is rather unpleasant at the moment.

P.S. I've seen 'Ophelia' as a middle name more than once.
