My question is, isn't Daphne a blonde? That's what I always thought, then the last two daphne stories I've read had her with dark hair like Harrys.

Anyway, side note I've always seen pairings with undeveloped characters to be to help the author in a couple ways

A) exploring the cross house relationship dynamics

B) the author thinks the Canon options are poor fits (Ginny, Hermione, and Luna) so use either Daphne, Susan, or other undeveloped background girls to quietly slip their own OC into a story that has already begun.

Don't get me wrong, I like most off the grid pairings. I liked harrys girlfriend in The Refiners Fire more than any other character I've ever read. To me though, that's how most authors use girls like daphne. As a blank slate.
