In JKR's 'original 40' notes on the planned characters, she was originally identified as 'Queenie' Greengrass. That plus the obvious bitchy popular girl archtype made her characterization a fait accompli.

My version of Daphne is very much the opposite of fanon. It's based upon what I'd call 'negative space reasoning'.

Pansy ruled the Slytherin girls of Harry's year, so she can't be better at being popular. This also might indicate that she wasn't as attractive, but we have other evidence to consider.

Draco married her younger sister, Astoria, who appeared to be a good fit for whom the trio expected Draco to marry. Was Daphne less desirable or simply unavailable?

At no other point is Daphne referenced in terms of beauty (unlike Cho and the Patils, who were noted to be the most attractive girls of their respective years) or brains or Quidditch skills. She isn't even notable for intimidating strength like Millicent Bulstrode.

So we have a girl in Slytherin who is of no real merit to be mentioned for being exceptional, either bad or good.

I'd say she's a dirty-blonde, slightly portly and otherwise meant to be kept in the background. It could be that she's a somewhat attractive sorority-slag type who started servicing the older Slytherins before she knew how to leverage her sexuality. That's why no one talks about her in the books, but her sister is worth marrying.
