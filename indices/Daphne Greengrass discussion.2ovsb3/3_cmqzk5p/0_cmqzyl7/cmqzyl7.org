I'd hazard that a lot of your reasoning ignores the source of a lot of our information. Not necessarily wrong, or invalid, just of questionable source.

Isn't the one who comments on the Patils' beauty Ron? Who I can't see complimenting a Slytherin, even if she is pretty. Also, 'most beautiful' is subjective and will vary from Beholder to Beholder, though they all seem to agree that zapping you with eye lasers is a reasonable way to say hi.

Harry, our unreliable narrator extraordinaire, really only interacted with Malfoy, who had Pansy attached like a barnacle... but then didn't marry her... marrying Astoria instead. So did Pansy die in the war? Or was /she/ the girl Malfoy amused himself with but never planned to marry?
