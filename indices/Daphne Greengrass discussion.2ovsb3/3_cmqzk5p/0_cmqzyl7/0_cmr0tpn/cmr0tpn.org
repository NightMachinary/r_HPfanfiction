Fair point- I think the descriptions of Cho and the Patils were narrative and not dialogue, but that still is limited by Harry's perspective, and he barely had his head above water most days.

I think Pansy lost her bid to be Mrs. Malfoy when she suggested that Harry be given over to the Dark Lord. Even if Draco loved her, she had shot her reputation like a dying horse as far as living in a Harry-victorious world was concerned. This still makes Astoria the second-best choice and Daphne third or even lower on the politically-advantageous marriage front.
