Not necessarily...

Assuming it's an arranged marriage, and that tells us that the Greengrasses go for that sort of thing... Daphne may have been spoken for by the time Draco needed a replacement for Pansy.

Example: Daphne Zabini nee Greengrass isn't the third-best choice, she's not a choice at all.

Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure there's a Dramione fic out there where Daphne and Blaise run an underground smuggling operation in a world where Voldemort won... but it's been ages since those wanted posters on Imgur sent me down that very strange road.
