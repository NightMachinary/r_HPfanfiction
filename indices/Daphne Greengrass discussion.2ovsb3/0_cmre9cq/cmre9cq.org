Since this is a discussion on Daphne Greengrass, I wanted to state a dissenting opinion, since I seem to be the only single person in the fandom that holds it.

I 100% do not see the appeal of using or reading stories where Daphne Greengrass is a major character. She is not a character in the Harry Potter books in any real sense of the word. She exists almost entirely in J.K. Rowling's list of Harry's classmates and a passing mention of Draco marrying her younger sister. She is just a name people attach to what is essentially a pureblood Slytherin OC, and you could just as easily switch her name out with Tracey Davis and it would make no difference to any story. Her characterization consists entirely of fandom tropes.

I am biased, of course, in the sense that I do not like any stories with OCs as major character. I want to read fanfiction about the characters I know and love from canon. Okay, rant over.
