(In my head)

--------------

Her family is not poor, but less wealthy than even Harry, and their renown is more for her father having Death Eater associates and being a Wizengamot... person?

She's grown up away from the other families (The Malfoy's / Zabini's / Nott's and so on) courtesy of her mother's influence, and so there's an intrigue the other families have for her when she turns up at Hogwarts and is seen to be a budding beauty.

Thus, we have an inexperienced family girl who has people fawning over her and trying to ensnare her, whilst she thinks their attitudes' deplorable and remains aloof to their advances, thus the "icy" persona outsiders are subjected to.
