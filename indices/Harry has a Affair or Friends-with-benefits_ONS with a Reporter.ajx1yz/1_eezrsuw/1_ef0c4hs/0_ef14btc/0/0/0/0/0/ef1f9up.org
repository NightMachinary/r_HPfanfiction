I mean, the classified information should be covered by magic after the experiences made during the wars (Bagman, Rookwood).

And if you want to dismiss muggle laws, there is always the aspect that Harry singlehandedly slew Voldemort, so messing with him would not be a thing many people would do. Especially since his best friend kidnapped the last reporter who tried, held her hostage for a few days and then blackmailed her. And Hermione was 15 back then, full of teenage naivety (looking at Malfoy here). Take Hermione at age 25 and they would never find the reporter again.
