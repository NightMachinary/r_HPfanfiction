The fact that there is no "Greater good, gimme yo gold" or "momma's gonna have one big happy Weasley Family" reasons behind the love potions, and that Ron actually makes use of his strategic thinking outside of chess and quidditch, makes this much better! Would have loved to see what Hermione would have come up with for how/why she got a "love potion fetish" if she wasn't on some truth serum though.

"Yes, well, as you know, I... have a lot on my mind... a lot of the time,"

"Most if not all of the time." Both boys chimed in, correcting her.

"Quiet, both of you. But alright, I'll admit, it is /most/ of the time. But, well, Harry, the love potions... make me more focused. It's quite exillerating to have all of my focus on one thing, one person, and not have any stray thoughts about unrelated things..."

Ron decided to chime in again. "By unrelated, she means if it doesn't involve the target of the love potion, erm me, you know? Like last time she went onto a little rant about the pros and cons of adding a muggle condiment to the fun, for either, erm, side."

Hermione almost matched a tomato at that reminder. "I'll admit, it had its merit until I considered his eating habits."

"Oi!"

"So let me get this straight," Harr said as he looked between the two, "Hermione is doping on love potions because it lets her use all of her amazing brain power for one subject and train of thought?"

"Yes."

"Pretty much. Certainly better than having her suddenly remember she had an extra credit assignment to work on right in the middle of things, and next thing I know Mione is half way out the door mumbling about research and notes."

"Ron! I thought you said you'd stop bringing that up!"

"I did, with you. I figured Harry could use some extra context for why you got a love potion fetish."

Edit: if, not of. Also added linebeeak between comment and scene.
