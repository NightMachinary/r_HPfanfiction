Some time in the future of Hogwarts-

---

''John? John, what is this? My dad never said about there being, a love potion reserve at Hogwarts?''

''Mary, sorry, got no idea'' he replied unfocused.

Mary had always that her boyfriend was always thinking about something else, so maybe this could help..

''John, take a sip, it's supposed to improve focus'' Of course he did as he was told, and probably thought it was focus for studies, not intercourse.

--Couple of nights after that--

''John, you- you were amazing this time! How did you become so good?''

''Oh, you see, this love potion it makes me concentrate on the important things..''
