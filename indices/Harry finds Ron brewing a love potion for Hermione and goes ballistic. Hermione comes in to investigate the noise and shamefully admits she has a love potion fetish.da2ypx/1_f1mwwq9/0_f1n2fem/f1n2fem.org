Hermione sighed, "Yes I'm serious, I get almost no pleasure without them..."

Harry, blushing, stuttered out, "H-how, W-why?"

Starting to get flustered herself, "I'm just never in the mood, Ron's idea of foreplay is a giant row, and that just doesn't do it for me. The potion helps me get in the mood, and helps me forget my tru-" She quickly cut herself off, her face turning redder than Ron's hair.

After a awkward moment, Harry got up the gumption to ask "Your true what?"

'M-my true... uh. True form..."

Harry fixed her with a piercing gaze, "really?"

"Uh... True fetish?"

At this point the sightly battered form of Ron interjected, "Then why did you tell me it was to dull your-" At this point he was silenced by a look from both Harry and Hermione that perfectly got across the point of "Please be silent sweetie, the parents are talking."

"Okay, fine, I am just not attracted to Ron in any romantic matter, I was hoping that the potions would allow me to transfer my sisterly and motherly love for him into a viable relationship..."

"But why are you doing this, Hermione?" asked Harry with not a small amount of concern.

"I am in love with someone who won't love me back."

It was with great conviction that Harry stated, "Anyone would be lucky to have you, If whoever it is doesn't notice you, he doesn't deserve you! Who is this idiot!"

As Hermione was struggling to make up a satisfactory answer, Ron reflected on how well his plan was working... A anonymous note sent to Harry, a small amount of a mild truth potion slipped into Hermione's morning coffee (How does she stand that stuff!) and maybe, finally, his friends might stop dancing around what they truly felt.
