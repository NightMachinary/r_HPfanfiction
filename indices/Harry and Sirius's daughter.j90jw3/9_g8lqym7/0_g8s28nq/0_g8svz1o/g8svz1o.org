yeah they're an acquired taste for sure. I like â€˜reverse' harems better, but it's still only a particular mood I get once in a while.

I've been writing a bisexual harem, because there aren't any, and I thought it was an interesting challenge. it is honestly so hard to make them interesting.

I find that most people don't pull them off, even if that is what you want to read, so I don't blame anyone for not being into them
