I feel like the biggest limit to this argument is that we have no idea about the depth and actual power of magic. Are there really spells for everything? Is it possible to increase casting speed (spells seem to be quite fast based off of Fantastic Beasts)? Where does magic come from? Can a wizard run out of magic like ninjas run out of chakra? How instantaneous are spells that we can't see (transfiguration spells for example have no physical form)? What about rituals? We know they are possible, but what can they do? What's their limit? I could keep coming up with these types of questions. I just think its kinda hard to draw conclusions when we understand so little of what makes Voldemort powerful while we understand chakra far more than we know magic.
