End of series Naruto and Sasuke react to intangible clones without taking any damage from them, and they are invisible and silent. As sane as Voldemort could be, I don't think he would have any way of dealing with the ninja world's heavy hitters.

What counter would Voldemort have for a mid-tier shinobi body flickering to him and cutting his head off without making a sound? What counter could he possibly have for a shinobi of Madara's level? End of Series Naruto and Sasuke level? Reality warping Kaguya level?

I like Voldemort as much as the next guy, but Voldemort, even with access to Chakra, would be murder stomped by the majority of the Ninja world, not even a named important character, but one of the fodder ninja at that.
