this hasn't been that popular, and I feel if it goes on worse arguments could break out on either side. I'm not 100% agreeable to some opinions, and neither are a few people, and I feel it could just go on, and on. I may have over-estimated a lot of Voldemort's abilities, and i'm just tired of the convo/argument/discussion now. So i'm going to delete it really soon, so if anyone has any last minute post now's the time to reply.
