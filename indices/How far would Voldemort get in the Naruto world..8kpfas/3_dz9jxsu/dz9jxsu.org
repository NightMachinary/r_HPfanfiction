Voldemort with chakra would be terrifying, especially if he keeps his magic. Apparition, transfiguration and Legilimency would let him easily acquire the knowledge he needs on how to use chakra (infiltrate ta ninja village and steal scrolls or rip the knowledge from the minds of genin). Give him 5 or 10 years (hello immortality) and that's pretty scary.

Remember, Voldemort was controlling his magic consciously as a kid who didn't even know what it was, so he could probably figure it out quickly, even with little to no direction.
