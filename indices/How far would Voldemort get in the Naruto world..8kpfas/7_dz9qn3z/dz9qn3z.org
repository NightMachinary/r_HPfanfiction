Hmm...I don't know very much about Naruto, despite reading a few fanfics of it...

What's the strongest destruction technique that appears in Naruto? A cut-something-in-half attack, a massive explosion attack, an incinerating attack, a total annihilation attack, a balefire-esque time-space shredding attack...?

Because, I was thinking, if Voldemort did end up making horcruxes in the Naruto world (and he could use regular innocent people, not prey on ninjas), what would be able to destroy them? It takes basilisk venom or fiendfyre (or possibly the killing curse) to destroy them in canon, to deal incurable damage that puts one beyond normal magic's ability to repair.

So, are there any canon ninja techniques that can break through almost any defence and totally destroy an object or at least make it irreparable?

...Failing that, I wonder if a Voldemort horcrux could be sealed in a tailed-beast-esque way...
