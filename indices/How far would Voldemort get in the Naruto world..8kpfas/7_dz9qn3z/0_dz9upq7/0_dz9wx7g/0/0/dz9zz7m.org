  I think the only one that had clairvoyance was some chick in a movie? Can't remember her name, I think it started with an S?

Shion? Predicts her own death, tells someone else that they'll die that way so that they protect her fatalistically? I'm pretty sure I saw her in one of Saphroneth's fanfics.

But yeah, speed does seem to be something Voldemort (and the Harry Potter world in general) has trouble with; he and an entire graveyard full of Death Eaters couldn't catch Harry when he broke Priori Incantatem and went for the Triwizard Cup. So in a stand-up fight, he probably would be toast against any ninja, and Apparating away from battle could probably be matched by Body Flicker.

So, what does that leave? Stealth, staying hidden from ninjakind, laying curses and traps down (he managed to put a pretty big curse on the DADA post, after all), perhaps possessing a younger ninja who doesn't have anti-spirit techniques (Quirrel-style) in order to access their abilities? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Seen?
