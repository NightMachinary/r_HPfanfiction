I think the only one that had clairvoyance was some chick in a movie? Can't remember her name, I think it started with an S?

Anywho, the entire last arc was about dealing with reincarnated unkillable zombie people, and they managed to either destroy or seal away the souls of all those involved. Orochimaru also had a horcrux like device with his Cursed seal, where he had splinters of himself in them and could revive himself with them. So basically speaking, some form of horcrux is already around in the ninja world.

Sealing techniques could probably handle horcruxes in some fashion, but its hard to say without it happening, so it's mostly speculation.

Those types of techniques are reserved for the God Tier Shinobi yea, but even then, the rest of the shinobi forces weren't slouches either. From what I imagine, unless Voldemort trains himself to the level of speed of even an average ninja, he won't have the reaction time to keep himself from getting killed repeatedly.

Take what I say with a grain of salt though, apparently I can't post any counterpoints without being called biased towards Voldemort. I just don't think giving him a chakra network and his sanity back would help him any against superhuman enemies, because even fodder no names are faster than anything he has ever dealt with.
