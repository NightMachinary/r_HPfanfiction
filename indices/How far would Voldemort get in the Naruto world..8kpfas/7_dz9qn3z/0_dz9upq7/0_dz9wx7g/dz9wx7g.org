Alrighty. Still, I assume that those sort of techniques are only held by a small handful of ninjas? So Voldemort's situation wouldn't be so different from Harry Potter canon, except that instead of needing to keep Dumbledore and Harry away from his horcruxes, he needs to keep ~quickly looks up stuff~ Sasuke and Itachi away instead?

What about divination? Is there any way for ninjas to see into the future or the past or use clairvoyance or speak to the planet or otherwise learn 'Oh come on, how is this weird noseless guy still alive'?
