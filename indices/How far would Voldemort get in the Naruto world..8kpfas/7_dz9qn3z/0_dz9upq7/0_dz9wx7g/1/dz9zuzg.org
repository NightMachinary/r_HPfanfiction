Let's see at the point the OP is talking about there's the 9 Jinchuriki + the 5 Kage's, Orochumaru, Jiraya, the 11 members of Akatsuki, 5 or so members of each village that I don't know the names off of the top of my head.

They have a system that can tie people down and cut them off from their magical energy. That's just a small paper note that they need to put onto him and it's all over.
