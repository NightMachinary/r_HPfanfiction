Some of the strongest destructive techniques in Naruto consist of reducing mountains to pebbles, dropping meteors out of orbit, cutting the moon in half, destroying dimensions, and other such things. The Truth Seeking Orbs alone would be something Voldemort would have no answer for.

A canon ninja tech that comes to mind that would destroy a Horcrux is the soul ripping technique available to Rinnegan users. Possibly summoning the King of Hell and tossing the horcrux into it as well. Maybe the sealing technique Itachi uses with his Susanoo? The Shiki Fuuin could probably do it too. Amaterasu probably burns hot enough to damage it too.
