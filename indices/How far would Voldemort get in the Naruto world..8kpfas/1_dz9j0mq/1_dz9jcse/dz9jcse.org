Almost no ninja are shown to have their own original techniques, I don't know where you got that from. In fact, actually inventing techniques seems quite rare, and even then it's usually (as with most things) derivative. Kakashi created Chidori because he couldn't combine the highest level of shape manipulation (Rasengan) with the mastered nature transformation utilizing the element he has an affinity towards (Lightning). Rasengan was derived from Minato's 3 year observation of Bee using Tailed Beast Bomb. Hiruzen created the Shuriken Shadow Clone based on one of his master's techniques (Shadow Clone from Tobirama), etc.

The only characters who really seem to create techniques are a few S-rank ninja like Hiruzen and Tobirama, most others are, at best, rare techniques.
