In general terms? Voldemort is /fucked./

Ninjas probably won't even lose any Gennin to him once they get a handle on his abilities. Spells apparently take long enough to cast and move slow enough for normal humans to react to them from a distance of less than 30 feet. Gennin are enhanced enough through the use of chakra that they're more or less expected to be able to fight arbitrarily large numbers of normal, unenhanced, untrained (but not unexperienced) bandits by the time they're ever allowed to leave town.

Bandits who, for the most part, don't even seem to bother with bows because of how utterly worthless they are against ninjas because of their mobility and reaction speed.

And arrows shot from any bow worth a damn will be able to be fired and travel much faster than your average human can react to if fired within 30 feet.

Voldemorts biggest advantage will be apparation. Odds are the ninjas will not have any real answer for that direction, but they have had to deal with teleporters or people with techniques that allow them to move so fast from point to point that they might as well have teleported.

Some of his more esoteric abilities will be difficult, if not impossible to counter, but he's unlikely to be able to do anything more than terrorize the civilian population in areas where ninjas are not present.

So, best case scenario, He's constantly in wraith form because the moment he gets a new body and tries to do something, he's ganked by one of the human monsters roaming narutoland.

Now, if he gains access to chakra, I'm not really sure that helps much. Chakra seems to be very personal, compared to magic. While Voldemort does appear to have developed a few spells on his own, most of what we see is just him using spells that were created by others, if not necessarily common knowledge.

Compare that to Naruto ninjas. Sure, there's a few standard jutsus that everyone learns, but even by the Chunnin level, they seem to start branching out into personal styles and customizing their techniques to suit those styles. I have a theory that Kakashi is famous not just because he copies everything, but also because he /only/ has the one original technique -- whereas most jounin are probably using a whole stable of original techniques as the basis of their style. Because what is known is what can be countered.

Almost all of the s-rank villains we see in the show/manga fight using almost exclusively original or unique techniques.

Voldemort is a powerful wizard, but his power, at least in the books, is primarily ruthlessness with a dash of speed and spell selection.

And ninja have that in spades.
