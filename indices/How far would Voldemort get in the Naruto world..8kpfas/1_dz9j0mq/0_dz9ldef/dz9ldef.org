Voldemort can also fly, has a range of spells that can make him invisible, soundless, and without smell. He has spells that are instant(as in no light to dodge, just straight up effect), and has a form of telekinesis(with the levitation charm, banishing charm, locomotis charm, and summoning charm). He has spells that can turn the environment against the enemy(ministry of magic fight), and can create his own undead army. Don't forget impressive wandless abilities, and a host of spells designed to f*** with the mind.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
