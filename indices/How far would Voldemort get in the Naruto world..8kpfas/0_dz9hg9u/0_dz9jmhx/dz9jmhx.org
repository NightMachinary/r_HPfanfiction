  And being able to create a chakra network through a ritual does him no good, because he has no way to learn to control or use chakra, and would be dismissive of a force that could only increase his physical abilities.

Eh, you lose me here. The fact that Voldemort was consciously controlling his magic as a kid who didn't know it was magic seems to make it clear he has an extraordinary ability to develop whatever powers he finds himself with. Voldemort with chakra is terrifying if given even a few years to work on it. Not to mention, if he still has magic, then he has Legilimency and Transfiguration. He could simply alter his appearance, sneak into a ninja village, and either steal rudimentary materials that describe what chakra is and how you control it, or capture a peon and rip the required knowledge out of his mind.
