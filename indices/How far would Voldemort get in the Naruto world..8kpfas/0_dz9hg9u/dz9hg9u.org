Naruto in general is just a higher power level world compared to Harry Potter. The average ninja a couple years out of the academy would be more than capable of killing a Voldemort with no horcruxes if a fight started for some reason. You give him access to plentiful potions ingredients and creatures, but we know nothign of Voldemort's herbology or magical creatures skills, he might very well not be capable of taking care of either. And being able to create a chakra network through a ritual does him no good, because he has no way to learn to control or use chakra, and would be dismissive of a force that could only increase his physical abilities.

But let's consider the situation. Voldemort has just arrived in this world with the materials you describe. Would he want to stay in this new world full of people with powers he never knew existed who make him look weak by comparison? Would he try to find a way back? If not, would he be willing to risk his life trying to conquer this world full of more powerful people, or just try to find his own place in it?

Really, most likely scenario is that he ends up captured and dissected by some unscrupulous researcher who wants to know how his magic works, probably Orochimaru, but there are plenty of others who would jump at the chance.
