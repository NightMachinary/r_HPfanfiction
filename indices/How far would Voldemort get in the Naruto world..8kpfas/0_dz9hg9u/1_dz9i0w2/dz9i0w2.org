I disagree. Magic's incredible versatility gives him a strong weapon against chakra's rigidity. Plus, fighters like Gaara show that you don't have to mobile to be successful.

I think Voldemort would prefer the elemental nations. It's far more martial and an entirely ableist society, both of which play to his strengths.

When comparing ninjas to wizards I always viewed it like this; the average ninja far outclasses the average wizard, but the greatest (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald) can keep up with the greatest ninjas.
