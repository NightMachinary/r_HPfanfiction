  When comparing ninjas to wizards I always viewed it like this; the average ninja far outclasses the average wizard, but the greatest (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald) can keep up with the greatest ninjas.

This is just patently untrue. The most powerful things Dumbledore and Voldemort get up to barely compare to moderately high level jutsu, and are completely outclassed by the wrath of god level shit top tier ninjas like the kages and sannin. To say nothing of how far and how clearly he's outclassed by jinchuuriki and Rinnegan users. Sharingan users might not necessarily get an edge in power over him, but their foresight would be a significant advantage against his casting.

You do have a sound point about the level of versatility Voldemort has, though I'd argue that he would need to be a mobile combatant. Gaara can get away with being slow because he has a nearly-unbeatable defense, whereas I can't see Voldemort's shields being able to hold up nearly as well.
