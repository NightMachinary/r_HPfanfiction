Like I said in a previous post. You're discounting his intelligence. He's not just going to go in guns a blazing. He's not crazy either, so same rule applys. He's going to be smart about it, and maybe try infiltrating the system without giving away his true abilities away, and that's after he's gathered intel from some hapless civilian/bandit. Everyone here seems to forget that this guy is a genius. Just read my previous post, as i've grown somewhat tired of the subject, everything i'd want to say is in earlier posts to other commenters.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
