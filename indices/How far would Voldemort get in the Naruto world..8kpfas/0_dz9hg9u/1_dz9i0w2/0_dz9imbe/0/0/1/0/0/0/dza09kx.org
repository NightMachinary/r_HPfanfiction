OK. This is an argument based on pre-canon. Five years before in fact. 12-5=7- That's a year before the Uchiha Massacre. Which means that maybe it doesn't happen which means more Sharingans running around. Which in turn means more people that can detect Chakra running around. Let's not forget the Byakugan and Sensors that can also detect Chakra. All of this makes the point of HP-based-invisibility pointless.

Flight can be either impressive, or pointless.

Now who is it that he can run into at this point: the 9 Jinchuriki(2 of them are kids, but that doesn't mean they can't rage and turn into the tailed beast anyway) + the 5 Kage's, Orochumaru, Jiraya, the 11 members of Akatsuki, 5 or so members of each village that I don't know the names off of the top of my head. All of whom could beat him without too much issue. And the Akatsuki works in pairs. And running into the Kage without at least 2 bodyguards which are two of the members from their village that would be able to fight Voldemort and be able to beat him. Then the Jinchuriki is a bigger issue, but they are usually part of a strong team. I mean for Kumo that's the Kage, a Jinchuriki and two other bodyguards. Good luck with that one.
