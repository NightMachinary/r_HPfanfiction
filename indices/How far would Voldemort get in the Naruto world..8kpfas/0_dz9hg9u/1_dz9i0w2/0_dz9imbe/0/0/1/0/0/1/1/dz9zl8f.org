And I dislike when a person is clearly too biased to actually consider said arguments. Voldemort will have five years(until canon) to build up his speed, and with the type of genius that he is, it'll be a non-issue. He'd understand how outclassed he is, and will take steps to rectify it. Also he's not an idiot, he's not going to pull any truly dangerous moves until he knows he can win, or at the least stands a strong chance of winning. You're looking at his powers, but disregarding his intelligence. Large scale water jutsu could work, but it'd have to be either a really powerful shinobi with powerful water jutsu, or a lot of average shinobi with water jutsu, think Madara with his annihilation fire jutsu against the Shinobi Alliance. That's not an over-exaggeration either, Fiendyfire grows incredibly large, incredibly fast. You keep forgetting that this is a guy who has charisma, intelligence, and abilities this world has never seen, and the time to grow powerful enough to pose a threat. No-one knows of him, and as long as he's smart, and stealthy enough about it they won't until he's ready.

P.s. The reason I say you're biased is, because you keep bringing up the speed argument, and I keep explaining how that'll not be an issue, because of a variety of reasons, and then you ignore it.
