I understand what you are saying, but canon Voldemort wasn't exactly what you would call a genius. Sure he was strong, and had people following him, but a genius he was not. It would take him longer than 5 years to get to the level of any accomplished ninja, especially starting from 0. He would have to develop a ritual to give him a chakra network, something he has no idea on how it works, and then do all the training from scratch, with no outside help. As smart and fearsome as he can be, not having any reference point to start with will kill his plans right off the bat. You say the ninja world has never seen techniques like his, but it also works in reverse, he would be out of his depth the second he landed in a new world. You do know ninja can sense each other across long distances right? Some unknown person in the ass end of nowhere doing traning and experimentation would draw attention in all the wrong ways. Assuming Voldemort would get to A rank in 5 years, then what? He wouldn't be able to rely on any spells that are visible, as they travel slow enough to be dodged by regular people. What then? He would have Fiendfyre, and an average level of speed, and high intellect. His flight would have an ill defined benefit and....? Levitating objects and banishing them at people likely wouldn't do anything, because of the speed factor, so he would have to rely solely on shinobi techniques to take people down. Where would he acquire those? Fresh genin don't exactly have jutsu libraries in their heads, and even then, how would he know to train in chakra natures?

Sure, make him S rank, give him every magic spell, and he would be dangerous, but it would be like dropping him into the DC universe and giving him Superman's powers.

In my opinion, the power scale between the two universes is too large to be surpassed just with smarts and charisma, unless you start stacking the deck in his favor and ignoring everyone else, but then what's the point?
