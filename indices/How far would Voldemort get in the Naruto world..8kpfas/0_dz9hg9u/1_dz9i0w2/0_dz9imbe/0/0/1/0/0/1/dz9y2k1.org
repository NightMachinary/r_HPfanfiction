Hidan was an S-class threat simply because of his Immunity to damage. He wasn't fast, or smart, or had any special techs, you just couldn't kill him. Inferi would be patently worse than Zetsu clones IMO, as they are slow, shambling corpses, so again, IMO it would be a non-issue for even Genin to deal with. Sentient fire is more dangerous in the HP universe because people can't deal with it, but I assume large scale water techniques would deal with it, along with the seal Jiraiya used to seal away Amaterasu. I still don't see Voldemort getting past the speed wall he is going to encounter, no matter how sane he is, or his ritual given chakra network. How is he going to stop himself from getting killed by people he can't even react to? In my opinion, there are too many ninja with too many varied techniques that have to deal with crazy shit all the time to be slowed down by a mind reader that can fly and move stuff around with his mind. Otherwise the Yamanaka would rule the world.

I really dislike when trying to have an argument with someone when they bust out the "You're so biased I'm done talking" shtick. You asked a question, and I posted counter points, now you're taking your ball home because you don't wanna play. Bye.
