While I agree that end series Naruto, Sasuke, Madara, and Kagyua could kill him 97/100 times, he won't be killed by a no-name ninja. It's like asking why don't they do that with every ninja. Right at the beginning he might lose to a no-one, but after a few years with training with chakra, and also brushing up on his magic more it'd take someone of at least Neji at shippuden, and beyond to stand a chance at him.

Remember in this scenario he's not insane, and he gave himself a chakra network, and just the sheer variety of magic will help majorly. Heck Tobi became a serious threat, and his main trick was teleportation, and phasing. He's not a one-trick pony, but those two abilities solidified him as a major threat to a lot of people. So when someone comes along, and can do what Ibiki can to the mind as well as transfigure people at a whim, and summon sentient fire, as well as having trained with chakra to at the least reinforce his body, as well as flight, as well as limited telekinesis, as well as summon an undead army, and a host of other abilities he'd be classified as at least an A-class threat, if not S-class. If Hidan can become an S-class, then this version of Voldemort can.

You're seriously underestimating Voldemort, and overestimating the ninja of Naruto. I mean yes Naruto can sense limbo clones, but that's with senjutsu which less than 10 people in the last 50ish years could do. Also flight is a big deal, before the final fight only Onoki, and Madara, only two-three other people could do it(not including Gaara, and Deidra since they require a tool, or substance to achieve their version of flight) so it would provide at least a battleground advantage.

Lastly considering Voldemort can basically do a better version of Jiryia's camouflage technique(which very few ninjas can detect, all of them being high level ninja) with spells, that would also be a huge advantage.

Now i'm done, you can continue being as biased as you are, and I may still reply, but i'm for the most part done. You can't convince someone who doesn't want to be convinced.
