And Civilians and Bandits know how much exactly? Myths and legends, sure. But besides that, they know nothing. They don't know the limits of what one can do with chakra or how things work. And ifiltrating the system would be hard as he doesn't know the system. And the system in one country is different than the one in an other. Konoha = Team 7 legacy route. Suna = Kazekage descendancy route. Kumo = Raikage descendany route I suppose. And Kiri = seemingly whoever.

Then there's the power structure used within the village in general. There's nothing that tells us this will be easy for a foreigner to comprehend as there's enough debates within the fandom regarding how it is.

You seem rather hung up on the idea that Voldemort managed controlled magic at a young age as a proof that he mastered it. Which is not the case. That's like saying that you can control your anger so that it blows when your not at work to mean that you've successfully mastered anger-management. It isn't.

And you seem rather hung up on that anything that doesn't agree with your view to be biased. You don't post something without wanting criticism or ideas. You wanted people to agree with you and call it a day.

The work that goes into a normal fanfic is easily ten times as much when it's a crossover, so have fun with that.
