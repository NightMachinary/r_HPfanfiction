If you read the wikia of Voldemort you'll see that he has shown instances of animal to human transfiguration, and the ability to modify memories, and he even tortured others to madness through just pure mental manipulation(according to Snape).

Also I believe the Imperious curse has no light show accompanying it, it's instant. With Apparation at his command along with flight, and chakra strengthening him, along with inferi, and such he could go quite far in the Naruto world.

The point of this is to see how far he'd get, not become a hermit. Also it's actually said(at least in the wikia) that he's proficient in magical telekinesis, removing the masks of his death eaters in GOF, disarming Harry with a wave of his hand, lazily flinging a dead troll aside with a wave of his hand. Just read the magical abilities & skills in the wikia before you reply back, i'm not the best when trying to convey my reasonings.
