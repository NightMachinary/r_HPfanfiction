But the Imperius curse can be thrown off with sufficient force of will, can't it? Come up against a strong enough ninja, and it wouldn't do anything to them, they do train against mind control techniques and torture so that they don't spill village secrets.

Plenty of ninja had access to flight abilities, it's not totally unheard of in the Ninja world, it wouldn't be as big an advantage as you think it is, especially with the massive area of effect Jutsu they have access to.

The body flicker technique is something every half ass ninja has access to, and tons of them are able to move even faster than that just with physical strength, so what advantage would apparition have?
