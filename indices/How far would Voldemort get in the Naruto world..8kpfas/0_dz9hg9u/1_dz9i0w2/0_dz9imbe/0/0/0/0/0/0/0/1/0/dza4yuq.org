Personally I wouldn't delete it. There's been some decent discussion and I haven't seen any tempers flying yet. Mostly we're debating with a lack of hard knowledge here, which leads to a lot of opinionated posts, but that happens more often than not on this sub anyway...

Your choice though, I can understand if you feel this could get out of hand.
