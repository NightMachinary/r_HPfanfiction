  True, but then Voldemort can turn them into a table,
#+end_quote

Not an ability Voldemort has ever been stated to possess. Human transfiguration is considered an incredibly difficult art that few people master, and Voldemort would likely never bother to learn it when he can just curse people. If it was that easy to use effectively, Dumbledore would have turned Tom into a comfy chair decades before canon.

  or Obliviate,
#+end_quote

Also not a spell ever established to be in Voldemort's repertoire, although it is very possible. We know he's capable of using Legilimancy to break memory charms, but there's no word one way or the other on his ability to cast them.

#+begin_quote
  or mind rape them in general(in terms of mental powers HP universe is better)
#+end_quote

You've got to be joking with this one. Voldemort's only "mind rape" ability is legilimency, which allows him to read minds and implant false visions very effectively with people he either has eye contact or strange indescribable soul connections with, and a poorly established possession ability that he's never shown to be able to do a great deal with. You're comparing this to the Naruto universe, where the Mangekyo Sharingan, the Yamanaka clan, and the art of genjutsu all exist. The ninjas have the advantage both in sheer breadth of mind-effecting abilities they have access to and relative power.

#+begin_quote
  Don't forget the AK curse is a one-hit kill attack.
#+end_quote

That requires him to say a long activation phrase and hit the target with a projectile. It's powerful and useful in battle, yes, but hardly unbeatable.

#+begin_quote
  Fiendyfire is comparable to Amaterasu in some ways, especially when it's sentient.
#+end_quote

Another spell that Voldemort was never established as being able to use, although I would actually expect he could. There's just very little reason why he would in most situations. I actually agree that, based off the little we get to see of it in canon, Fiendfyre is probably roughly on par with Amaterasu, although the latter is much more controllable and can be used defensively (then again, the Mangekyo comes with it's own laundry list of problems and isn't exactly common).

#+begin_quote
  He also has something similar to TK with his wandless ability mixed with the levitation charm, banishing charm, locomotis, and summoning.
#+end_quote

This I'll give you, ninjas don't have the sheer breadth of ability to move objects that wizards do, and Voldemort can proably do so very effectively in battle, although I think you're overstating his wandless capabilities.

#+begin_quote
  He can raise an undead army(inferi) whose only weakness seems to be fire if I remember correctly.
#+end_quote

Maybe. The implication is that creating inferi is difficult or time consuming (being that nobody other than Voldemort seems to bother with them) but there's certainly nothing that says for certain that he can't make some. As they're zombies, of course they're mostly vulnerable to fire or being cut apart (although Harry's other spells seemed to work perfectly well on them, it was the numbers disadvantage that required Dumbledore and his fancy fire whip). Of course, fire is something ninjas (particularly in fire country) don't exactly lack, in addition to other abilities perfectly capable of cutting through bodies.

#+begin_quote
  Overall with him being physically strengthened with chakra i'd put him at S-class. Also him being strengthened with chakra isn't an argument, I made it a requirement to even out the scales a bit.
#+end_quote

Yes, you did, but you failed to adequately explain why he would do that. He is Lord Voldemort, his magic is great and terrible. Why should he seek to make himself more like these filthy muggles he's found himself surrounded by?

All of this, of course, is based on the theory that Voldemort would seek to conquer this new world. It's entirely possible (if unlikely) that he might try to fit in, or live as a hermit, desperately trying to find his way back to the world where he understands.
