True, but then Voldemort can turn them into a table, or Obliviate, or mind rape them in general(in terms of mental powers HP universe is better), or Imperiose them. Don't forget the AK curse is a one-hit kill attack. Fiendyfire is comparable to Amaterasu in some ways, especially when it's sentient. He can also fly, and teleport which is considered a pretty OP ability in the Naruto universe. He also has something similar to TK with his wandless ability mixed with the levitation charm, banishing charm, locomotis, and summoning. He can raise an undead army(inferi) whose only weakness seems to be fire if I remember correctly.

Overall with him being physically strengthened with chakra i'd put him at S-class. Also him being strengthened with chakra isn't an argument, I made it a requirement to even out the scales a bit.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
