Voldemort has a small number of spells and abilities that might make him succeed. If the assumption is that he is not insane and has chakra, he can simply slowly build up what he can of his reserves, learn how to more efficiently use his supply, and train and study over time. If he has to attack, his best choice is to attack genin, or genin to be. As long as he's patient enough, he'll eventually find someone he can ambush, stun, then Imperius and study. Using legilimency, he ought to be able to slowly steal techniques. Otherwise, AK, while slow and ineffective at some of the best shinobi, is able to kill point blank many chunin and below. He can apparate and fly, allowing him to survive dangerous situations, and Fiendfyre will at least allow him to do massive damage if he absolutely must.

Given time, Voldemort would probably figure out some insane way of using chakra and magic and how to steal chakra to add to his own power. He'd be able to steal a large amount of techniques, and his ability to apparate and perhaps cast devastating spells or use large scale techniques after many years of study would undoubtedly eventually put him at the upper end of threats.

However, early on, he'd be incredibly weak, having to rely on ambushes and sneak attacks to win against most foes, even genin.
