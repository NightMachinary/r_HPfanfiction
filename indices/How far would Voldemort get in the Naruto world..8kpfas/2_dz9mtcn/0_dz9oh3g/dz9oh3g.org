My thing is the Imperius and Legilimency early on. Imperius especially, since basically no one is going to try and Dodge it since in the books it doesn't have colored spellfire like AK does. That immediately gives him an advantage even against super speed since, well, who's going to dodge when they see a weirdo pointing a stick at them? Or when he simply looks them in the eye? Granted, many are wary of looking in the eyes of the Uchiha but Voldemort doesn't have Sharingan so most wouldn't think twice.
