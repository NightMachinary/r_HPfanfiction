Ideally, Voldemort would probably find a minor village, wait for the genin with their teacher to go on a mission far away, use a tracking spell (assuming such a spell would be unnoticeable), then wait for them to go far away. Probably use a homenum revelio while under a silence spell to check for other shinobi, then ambush and Imperius the group, starting with the sensei by apparating and point blank casting. Then slowly rip out information and use veritaserum to discover and learn more about chakra.
