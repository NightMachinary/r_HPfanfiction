Linkao3(malfoy flavor by vorabiza). Atrocious title, but fantastic fic. Harry hides under another identity - in Hogwarts - and goes undercover as a potential Death Eater.

(I also recommend Secrets by the same author, but I actually just linked that in another thread and didn't want to repeat.)

Also, all of [[http://keiramarcos.com/tag/harry-potterdraco-malfoy/][Keira Marcos]]' H/D stuff. So good. War Mages is my favorite.
