The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elightningonthewave][here]] If you don't mind Lily and James being /very/ different from canon, it's freaking massive. Some people think it's awesome, some can't stand it (read the warnings before you start it), I'm somewhere in between. As it is longer than canon, I didn't make it to the end. But I hope you like it.
