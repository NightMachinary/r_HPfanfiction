Argos was the hound of Odysseus that was so loyal that he refused to die until he saw his master home again.

Shuck or Black Shuck is a grim-like dog that haunts the coastline of Eastern England.

Laelaps was the immortal hound the always caught its prey fated to chase the uncatchable Teumessian fox forever.
