This has a really unfortunate ending. It's technically complete, but I wasn't prepared for it to be completed simply because it was preceding a part two that never came.

Warning to anyone before they start, this is not a standalone story. The ending is abrupt and, as far as I can tell, there's no reason that this would be considered a "Part One" on its own. There is no Part Two.
