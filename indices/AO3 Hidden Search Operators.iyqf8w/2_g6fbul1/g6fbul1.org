Ooh, didn't know you could filter chapter count. Sometimes I forget about fics, but end up remembering the chapter count of all things (for example, there was one time when I had forgotten a fanfic's title but knew it had 7 chapters. Ended up browsing like 30 pages on a particular ao3 tag, and ctrl+f 7/7 on all of them). Good to know you can filter on it.
