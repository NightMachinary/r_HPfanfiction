Yes it works; I just tested it on the front page of HP on AO3. I made a quick gif of it [[https://i.gyazo.com/7859f10ee80af492e6785cad2949e425.mp4][here]]. Just gotta tag a relationship, type "otp: true" into the "Search within results", and it pops up fics where the only main pairing is the relationship you chose.

The issue with searching things like Dark Harry and excluding M/M is that it relies on the author to put it in the M/M category in the first place. So if they put it in, for example, "Gen" category but it has a slash pairing, it'll still show up. The best alternative I can think of is to search Dark Harry, exclude M/M, and then exclude popular slash relationship tags. It won't get all of them, but it'll get more of them.
