Saw one once that has since been my head canon that her 'true form' looked a bit like a brown haired Bellatrix, which makes sense since she's her aunt. I think it was sort of implied she changed her looks slightly from natural most of the time because a lot of people remembered Bellatrix as a murderer from the last war and it was awkward.
