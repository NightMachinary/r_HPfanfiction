That is some fucked up logic.

So black hair is also a no-go because it was his father. What about blonde ? Vernon and Dudley Dursleys are blondes, so, is it out, too ? Because they're family, too.

Also, brown hair is Remus' iirc, and he's kinda parental to Harry to. A bit. So brown hair are out, too.

Bald isn't an option too, because Voldemort, and by that logic, it way too close to dating someone like Voldemort, and it's weird.

Let's not even talk about other physical features. Among the Weasleys, The Marauders, and School Staff that care for Harry, and The Ennemies, no one is either an option because they'd share a trait that made it weird.

Harry (and everyone by that logic), is condammned to stay single and celibate all their life.
