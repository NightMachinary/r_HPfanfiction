I used to have an obsession with time travel fics, and I noticed in a lot of crappy ones that whenever Lily would meet Ginny her first thought was "WOW! Am i looking into a mirror?? Is it my long lost twin?? Why do you look so much like me??" (sigh...)

Sometimes I would read other fics where an older character will do a double take when they see Ginny, and breathlessly say, "Lily?"

At that point, I'm sick of the story, and the trope.
