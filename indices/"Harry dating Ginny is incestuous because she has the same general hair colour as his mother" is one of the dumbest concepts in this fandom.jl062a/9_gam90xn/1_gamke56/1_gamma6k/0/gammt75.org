Fair enough, my dad was blond as a child and has dark brown hair. Any idea as to why it darkens? And it's a damn common hair colour for a recessive trait. :) Not blond personally and male I doubt I'm getting any highlights. Who knows though, maybe vibrant purple because why the hell not?! Edit: typo
