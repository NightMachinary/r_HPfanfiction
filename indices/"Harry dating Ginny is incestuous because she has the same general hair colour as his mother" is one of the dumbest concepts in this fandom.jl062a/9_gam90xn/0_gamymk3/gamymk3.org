Alleles and phenotypes are two different things. It's possible for a brunette to have an allele for red or blonde hair, yet their phenotype will still be for brown hair because the brown hair allele is dominant over the alleles for blonde and red hair.

Realistically though, discussing the genetics involved in hair and eye colours at a surface level is bloody confusing because there is more than one allele pairing that affects what hair and eye colour someone ends up with. That's why we see eye colours like green and hazel, and not just the straight brown/blue dichotomy that high school science/biology teachers teach about. I personally like using ABO blood types to teach the concepts of alleles and phenotyopes because they are more strictly defined. The downside is that you can't see the specific antigen coating (or lack of coating in the case of O blood types) on blood cells in a classroom, so it can be a harder concept for students to grasp.
