I think its more to the case of if you have the gene for red hair, you likely have a close relative with red hair, be it a grandparent, an uncle/aunt, a great grandparent, a parent, a sibling (like, I'm a redhead. My moms got red hair, my dads half native with a red-haired dad so by the logic of "can't date someone with a relative with a similar trait" my dad shouldn't have ever been with my mom because she had the same hair colour as his father, and I guess I could only date blonds lol) but you're 100 percent right genetics is complex and frankly, to me, confusing lol
