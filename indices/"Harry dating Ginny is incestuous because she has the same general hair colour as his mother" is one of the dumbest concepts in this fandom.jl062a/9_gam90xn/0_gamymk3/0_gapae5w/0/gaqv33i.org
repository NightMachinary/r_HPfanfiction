I remember first learning about genetics in high school, and it made perfect sense to me, but I was always inclined towards science in general and biology topics in particular. As a teacher in an education system that has mandatory science education up until the end of Year 10, I find it a very challenging topic to teach. Particularly when I've only taught students who are in a stream that indicates that they struggle with the subject.

I know there's genes for red hair kicking around in my wider family, but it only seems to pop up once every generation or two, if that. I have a cousin that had the most beautiful auburn hair as a child. I believe it darkened somewhat as she got older, but she dyes it so much now that I don't think even she knows what her natural colour is anymore. I also remember being told that my great-grandmother had red/auburn hair, but it was well and truly white by the time I came along.

I was kind of hoping to have a child with red hair, but my husband was blonde as a child, so that wasn't going to happen. I'm dark enough in hair and eye colouring that my kids both have the same hair and eye colour as me. One of them has my colouring, but very much looks like my husband facially, and the other one is the male version of me at that age in colouring and facial features, but has his dad's height and build.
