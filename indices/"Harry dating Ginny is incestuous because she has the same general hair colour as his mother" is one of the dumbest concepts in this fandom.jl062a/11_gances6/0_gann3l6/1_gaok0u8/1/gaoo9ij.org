Honestly, this would only interest me if (1) they didn't care.or (2) they find out after they have children. Any other outcome is basically just the same as having them break up because, say, Ginny wears gloves or Harry hates sandals or whatever random reason an author might choose. Or, as you say, just more Dumbledore bashing... which is usually a nope for me.

And the reason why (1) is interesting is because of everyone else's reactions... compare this [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/377188][Rose/Albus]] fic (which is also an example of 2 actually and is the only incest fic I've read).
