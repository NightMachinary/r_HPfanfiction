linkffn(Chaos of the Potter Family by TheGirlWithFarTooManyIdeas) is the only fic I remember seeing it in. Although rereading the first chapter just now did not give me much confidence about the quality of the rest of the fic

I think it's a potentially interesting idea, but it's one that would get old really quickly. Especially if it's just used as fuel for more Dumbledore bashing.
