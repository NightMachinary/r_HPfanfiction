You do realize that there are 1.1 million Harry Potter fics between ff dot net and AO3? Even accounting for overlap we're talking about a million stories on those two archives alone. Just because it's not a trope you have run into doesn't mean it's not well-known to others. I have seen it in dozens of fics, and it's annoyingly stupid every single time.
