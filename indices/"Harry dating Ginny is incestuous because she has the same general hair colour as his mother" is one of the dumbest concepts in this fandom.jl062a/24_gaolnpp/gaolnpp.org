It's...I've never heard it called ‘incestuous‘ but she does resemble his mum quite a bit. She's a spit-fire, smart, red haired, powerful, kind, etc. Really the only differences are eye color---though personally I've always imagined Lily with green eyes and Ginny the same---and blood status.\\
Taking that into account, Harry also resembles his father a bit. Messy black hair, bravery, fighting death eaters, powerful(I always imagined James being quite powerful, as well as Lily), wears glasses, and some more. Again, blood status is different, and eye color(James has hazel eyes as I remember, and Harry has the iconic emerald). They were also both pretty mischievous, although Harry didn't have much time for tricks, what with dying and fighting Voldie as a kid.\\
If you think too hard about it, it is sort of weird. Then again, what isn't?
