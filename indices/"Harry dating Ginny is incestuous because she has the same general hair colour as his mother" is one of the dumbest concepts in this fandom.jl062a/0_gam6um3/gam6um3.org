It's only a problem if Harry sits there, looking at Ginny, and smiles at her softly.

"You know, Gin, you look a lot like my mother."

Ginny smiled back. "I've been told."

"Yeah," he continued. "It's kinda hot."

"...What?"

"I mean, Dad had to fight off Sirius and Remus just to get a chance with her. And I saw Snape's memories, don't forget." He closed his eyes, lost in thought. "Mum had an arse that just wouldn't quit. It was really something."

Harry's eyes snapped open as the door to the dining room slammed shut.

"Ginny?" He called. But she was gone.
