It still remains a /far/ better argument than "she kinda looks like his mother". And we don't know everything that happened at the Burrow, maybe Harry and Ginny interacted more than we see in the books. It's kinda hard to completely avoid a family member that lives under the same roof after all.

Not a very good one IMO, mind you, but a far better argument.
