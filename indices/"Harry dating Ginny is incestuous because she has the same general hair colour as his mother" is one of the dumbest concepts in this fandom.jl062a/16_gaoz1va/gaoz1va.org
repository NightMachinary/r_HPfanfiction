It's not incest. Incest is between blood relations, ie Jaime and Cersei Lannister. The fandom thinking "Harry+Ginny=ew" because of Ginny's hair being like Lily's is an Oedipal complex - he's attracted to girls that look like his mother, because a)He is desperate for familial love, since the Dursleys never showed him any, and b)On some subconscious level, he's thinking "I look like my dad. Ginny looks like my mum. We're supposed to be together."
