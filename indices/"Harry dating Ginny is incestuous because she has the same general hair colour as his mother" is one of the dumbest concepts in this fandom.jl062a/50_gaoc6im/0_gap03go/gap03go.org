There's a 52% chance of such cousins sharing no DNA whatsoever, so... really calling this incestuous is about as real as calling any other couple you see on the street.

I certainly couldn't tell you who's related to me beyond cousins, simply because my parents both had a dozen brothers/sisters, and so did their parents. Who the fuck keeps track of that? By the third or fourth generation you could start dating someone you meet in a bar without knowing they are related to you.
