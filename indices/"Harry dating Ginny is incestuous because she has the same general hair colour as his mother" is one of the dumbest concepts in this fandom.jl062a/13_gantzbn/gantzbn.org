There are reasons I don't care for the /canon/ relationship, but that isn't one of them.

I don't mind it when fanfic writers use the canon relationships. What I don't like is just how poorly shoehorned in the romance between Ginny and Harry is. Like it just sort of appears out of nowhere in the 6th book. Before that, she was always just Ron's little sister.

THAT said, I could see the thought process being something Harry might use to rationalize to himself why he doesn't like Ginny /that way/. Like he sees Ginny, and hears all the stories about what his mother was like, and can't help but notice just how much Ginny reminds him of those stories, and he gets a little weirded out.
