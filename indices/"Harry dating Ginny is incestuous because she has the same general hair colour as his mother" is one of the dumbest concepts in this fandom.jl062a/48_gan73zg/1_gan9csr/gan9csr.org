Let's not forget she was a fan girl until suddenly he had feelings for her in 6th year which is coincidentally when love potions etc got introduced in a major way outside of possible mentions with both Hermione and Ginny being curious about the ones in WWW as well as Slughorn having a cauldron full of Amortentia. Not saying she used one but to go from no interest in her and only seeing her as the shy fan girl sister of his best friend to loving her in the span of a short time is weird especially when he wanted nothing to do with his fame which she was all about from the get go. I feel a serious relationship for Harry would have been better if whoever he got with actually had some sort of ambition and knowledge about how the wizarding world works which certainly isn't a poor pureblood who has a crush on him just because of story books made up about him. Like I really don't see when he had time to get to know her without anyone else around really. Honestly Luna had more backstory and about the same amount of character building as Ginny as far as similar experiences outside of the whole Chamber of Secrets thing which honestly wasn't a lot then. Hell most of the time Hermione is the best potential relationship just because we know her and her and Harry did have a relationship in some form that was actually pretty strong compared to the fan girl, the airheads, the mentioned once or twice people and everyone else.
