It's my opinion that Harry highly benefits dating someone older, smarter, with knowledge and desire to teach him history, culture and power. Essentially his best match is an upper-year Slytherin.

A point of several Slytherin-centric fics is that practicing magic makes you stronger, and most students simply goof off outside of class instead of really putting in practice time.

Instead he ends up with a younger Gryffindor who barely has a personality beyond 'shy' until book 5 where suddenly a romance interest is needed. ...and again, if she spent her time learning from Molly about cooking, cleaning and such, she could be a domestic goddess, but that would be too much personality for such a flat love interest.
