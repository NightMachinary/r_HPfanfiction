4th Cousins are, for all practical intents and purposes, not relatives. Do you know who your fourth cousins are? Probably not. And you would only be able to find them quickly if someone in your family has already drawn up a very extensive family tree.

#+begin_quote
  They're still related.
#+end_quote

Yeah, except they're not.

#+begin_quote
  And more closely related than is necessary.
#+end_quote

Again, do you know your fourth cousins (any degree of separation)?

#+begin_quote
  There's nothing comfortable about meeting a cousin of yours at ages 11 and 10, spending years living with her family then hooking up a few years later.

And they were first cousins.

Also, Harry doesn't "live" with the Weasleys. The whole point of the books is that Harry considers Privet Drive home. He lives with the Dursleys.

  You can tell me 4th cousins have an acceptable level of risk til I earn a genetics degree, won't make this relationship any less gross.
#+end_quote

First cousins have an acceptable degree of risk. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#Genetics][You have to have multiple generations of first cousin marriages before there's a problem.]]

And, again, we're talking about (hypothetically) FOURTH cousins (with a removal)... so it's not more than 0.2% shared on average and probably not more than 0.1% based on the other examples of removals in that link.

And we're talking about fourth cousins!
