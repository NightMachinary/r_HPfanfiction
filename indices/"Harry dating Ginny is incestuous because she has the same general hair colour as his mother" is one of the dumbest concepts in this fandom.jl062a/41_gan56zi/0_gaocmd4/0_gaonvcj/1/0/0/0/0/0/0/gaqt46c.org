You're still bring up genetics. I couldn't care less. It's safe incest then.

They're still related. And more closely related than is necessary. They can see each other on the same family tree. Or at least the family tree before JK realized it was incest and the literally went "jk ooopsie". There's nothing comfortable about meeting a cousin of yours at ages 11 and 10, spending years living with her family then hooking up a few years later. You can tell me 4th cousins have an acceptable level of risk til I earn a genetics degree, won't make this relationship any less gross.
