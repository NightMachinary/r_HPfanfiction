  I never said anything about percentages. I'm not disputing that.

What you said was:

  It's actually not that distant. They're 4th cousins once removed. Not as bad as Orion and Walburga Black who were actually 2nd cousins, but still too close for comfort.

4th Cousins Once Removed are NOT close relatives. Not by any measure... as indicated by the genetic relationship.

Fleamont is James' father. Dorea is Charlus' wife. Fleamont's parents are Henry and some unknown woman.

There is no known relationship between Charlus, Fleamont and Henry.

I suppose you could have, as a headcanon:

Phineas > Cygnus > Dorea/Charlus > Henry > Fleamont > James > Harry

or even (with some cheating)

Phineas > Cygnus > Dorea/Henry > Fleamont > James > Harry

But either way would just be a headcanon. And one that raises the question of why Sirius doesn't point out his relatedness to James/Harry. After all...

Phineas > Cygnus > Pollux > Walburga > Sirius, or

Phineas > Sirius > Arcturus > Orion > Sirius

Also... Dorea's dates are meant to be 1920-1977 (admittedly I'm not sure where those numbers come from... HPWiki can be a bit circuitous with the Blacks) which would mean she was born whilst Henry was on the Wizengamot. And Henry and Cygnus are almost certainly contemporaries.

The most natural resolution of all the facts would be something where Charlus and Fleamont are siblings, or Charlus and Henry are siblings. [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/sort-of-a-harry-potter-fanfic-4327e9e0a821][My own personal headcanon]] uses the latter relationship.
