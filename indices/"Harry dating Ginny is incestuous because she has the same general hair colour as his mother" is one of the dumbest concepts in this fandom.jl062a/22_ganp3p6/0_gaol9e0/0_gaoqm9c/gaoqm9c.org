I've seen some parts of a few of the movies on TV but I'm more of a fiction fan than a movie fan. I read the first four JKR books if I remember right, many years ago. They might have mentioned Lily's hair color but I've long since forgotten. More recently I find that I like HP fanfic better than I liked the original books.
