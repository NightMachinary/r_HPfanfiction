I immediately didn't agree with the part that him dating ginny is incestuous. However, I can see an Oedipus complex. Basically, a complex where you want to date someone who looks & acts like your mother. Not saying Ginny is like Harry's mother, but from an outsider's view it could be like that. ðŸ¤”
