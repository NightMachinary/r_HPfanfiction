The only times I've seen anything close to this is "She reminds me like my mother" is when it is used as an excuse to get away from Ginny.

Where the hell did this whole "incest" thing come from?

You know, like when people freak out when they figure out that their significant other is similar to their father/mother? Yeah, that.

When you add up the fact that he only has a handful of pictures and MAYBE a page and a half of information for both of his parents. Watching his parents die in front of him. And his messed-up upbringing, this becomes more and more of a plausible reason.
