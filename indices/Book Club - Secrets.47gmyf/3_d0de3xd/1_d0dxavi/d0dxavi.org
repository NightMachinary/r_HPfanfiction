I recced it for the book club! PtD was written before the 7th book, so Snape and lily weren't childhood friends, and the prose can get a little meta at times, but it's great writing covering the end of Lily's 5th year to 7th year and how friendships are made and break in times of stressors like war. The real strength of this fic is the characters, though there are some unique twists in the James/Lily romantic development because of (slightly contrived) situations.

It's very readable and the OCs are really great. The worldbuilding is nice too! It focuses on Lily's year mates and her eventual acceptance of peer leadership and political resistance. Lily doesn't spend her weekends training for the war against Voldemort but she becomes emotionally ready to take on Death Eaters while her friends all make their own decisions on how to handle what is happening to their world.
