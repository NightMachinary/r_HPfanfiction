This is how the person who recommended it described it:

  Complicated story about how Lily Evans grew up during sixth year, grew away from most of her childhood friends (who are amazing Gryffindor OCs, some of whom decide to avoid the war) and emotionally prepared for war. Falls for James too but he does some crappy things along the way and she holds him accountable but eventually forgives him. Really, really great ride and Lily's three best friends are truly awesome OCs who I've never forgotten. Some great anti-Voldemort Slytherin OCs too.
