I really enjoyed Secrets, I thought it was well written and a good insight into Ginny's character in CoS. I thought the [[/spoiler][dream sequences for when she blacks out]] were great. When she started putting things together and realizing what was going on I just wanted to help her. I like that it ended with her [[/spoiler][having a bit of PTSD,]] that seemed very realistic.

Personal note: For some reason the name [[/spoiler][Apple]] really bothered me. It's just really hard for me to imagine that being a legitimate character name.
