Never before has the cut throat world of eleven year old school children been so intricately portrayed. The complexities of schoolyard politics were rather simplified in the early HP books: Harry was all good, Draco was all bad. Not so here: the author's cast of OCs are all complex and realistic. No one's completely in the right, least of all Ginny. The first year social structure is easily the highlight of the fic.

Oh, and Voldemort's in the book as well. He's not too bad, I suppose. He's just got nothing on any of the eleven year olds.
