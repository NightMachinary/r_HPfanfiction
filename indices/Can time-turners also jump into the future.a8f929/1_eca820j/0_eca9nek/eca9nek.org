To escape a tight spot, for one thing. Let's imagine Harry had a Time-Turner at the Graveyard Confrontation, for example --- and assume Voldemort doesn't know this --- he can just quickly turn it under his robes the moment things are going awry. He arrives six hours later, by daylight, and Voldemort has long stormed off looking wherever the damnable boy has Apparated.
