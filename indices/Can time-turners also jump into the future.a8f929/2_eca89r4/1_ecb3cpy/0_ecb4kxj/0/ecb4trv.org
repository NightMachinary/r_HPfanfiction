Not if you stay in the same time line.

I don't know about terrible outcomes, I mean they won, most ppl survived, the trio grew up to have multiple children, jobs they like, stayed friends. Sometimes people grow to accept what had happened in the past and move on to live their lives, you know, and I'm not sure every one would want to give up everything they now had, after having fought so hard for it, just for the very slim chance that the many things that went wrong decades ago could all be changed so that life might even be better.
