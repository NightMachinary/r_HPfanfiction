That's a terrible standard of success you have there "oh, only some people have died (Dumbledore, Snape, Fred, Amelia Bones, Sirius, Remus, Nymphadora, Ted, Lavender, Colin, numerous order members)". We can do way better than that: Voldemort was only resurrected because everyone was a bumbling fool and institutions failed at every level.

It's super easy that no one has to die, especially with hindsight.
