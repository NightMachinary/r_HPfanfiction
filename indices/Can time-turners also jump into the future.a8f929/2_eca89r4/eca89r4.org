Okay first of all you have to stop thinking of time as spatial dimensions. Going to the past isn't like going to a different stage and then returning to the original stage set in the present. You'd just advance time until you're at the time where you left.

Fundamentally time travel to the future is simpler than time travel to the past. We don't see any such devices in HP, but if they can travel to the past I have no idea why they wouldn't be able to travel to the future as well (one is breaking physics as we know it, the other does not... even mere muggles on the ISS can [[https://i.imgur.com/Nyc1YP2.png][time travel]]). Normal time turners only allow you to go back 5 hours, so if you travel too far into the future you won't be able to get back.
