Ah, I see what the problem is. I misunderstood the question. The issue is whether "his time" would still exist in any meaningful way.

If we use PoA as a guide, then as long as the time-traveller follows Dumbledore's directive of "you must not be seen" in spirit, then it should be possible to jump forward effectively back to where you came from. So, like, if Harry went back 20 years and enrolled back in school as a foreign exchange student in his parents' class, and they met him and thought he was a random weirdo, but it didn't ultimately change anything about established historical fact, then he should be able to skip ahead back to the same future he came from. And it would turn out that his parents had always had an exchange student weirdo in their class. Just as in PoA, Harry and Hermione could have jumped forward for little bits when they were waiting around doing nothing, instead of hiding in the bushes or whatever.

When I was writing my time-travel HP fic, I postulated that it would actually be impossible to change the past and "split the timeline" in HP, but people still avoided trying to do so because it gave really unpredictable results. So, like, if you travel back in time to try to kill your own father before you were conceived, maybe it would turn out he wasn't your real father after all, but your mom used the opportunity his disappearance offered to convince her real secret lover, who happened to be on the run from the law, to steal his identity and live out the rest of his life under polyjuice. (Oh, you think, that's why Dad always carried around that hip flask. Maybe he wasn't an alcoholic after all.) Or maybe you just happen to get hit on the head by a meteorite and die in a ditch before you can get around to any patricide. See? Time-travel is dangerous and unpredictable. I mostly went with this interpretation because it's the most hilarious.

In sci-fi fandoms that kind of thing really bothers me, though. If you travel back in time through scientific means and cross your father's path before you were conceived, and he misses a step before he gets his stride back, what are the chances that the /exact same sperm/ is going to fertilize your mother's /exact same egg/ to create you? If you were to travel back to the future at that point, you would just be traveling forward in the split timeline where you never travelled back in time because your mother's only child is the opposite gender. They may or may not have travelled back in time themselves, creating a third timeline. I leave the question of whether that would still be "you" to the theologists.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my TED Talk. I have a lot of thoughts about time-travel. :)
