So by "finding" you mean literally causing it, or manipulating events in such a way that your original future still happens. I agree that that prospect is daunting to the point of impossibility if we're not relying on magic to inherently get us there.

I would argue, though, that if you were to look into the future, without that being able to actually affect the future, then exactly /one/ course of events would be true, because causality is a thing. You would just never know what it was or be able to predict it, because it involves all those minute cascading changes.

So time-travel forward would still be possible, you just wouldn't ever know what you would get.

I think we agree, mostly?
