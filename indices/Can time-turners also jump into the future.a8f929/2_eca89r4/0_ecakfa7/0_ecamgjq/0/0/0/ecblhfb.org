Thank you, but that's exactly what I want to talk about.

My theory is that in any given moment, there are a billion of possible outcomes resulting from any number of possible choices and accidents that are happening in or after that moment. Therefore I would think that going back in time should be logically possible but going forward you would never find your own timeline again.
