If I think about it, I believe that it might be necessary to accept the different timelines existing parallel to each other. Because if it is impossible for a person to get back where he came from once he traveled back in time, does the place where he came from disappear? I don't think so, I'd rather think that to his friends and family, he had disappeared, but everything else would be unchanged. Does that equal dimemsional travel? I'm not sure.

You see I've gotten so frustrated with the lack of good time travel fics that I started to write something on my own, even though I know I couldn't write to save my life. I thought I could maybe just write a little bit for myself to get it out of my system. But almost as soon as I started I got into this problem XD My idea is that Harry accidentally travels back to his parents' last year in the body of himself after the end of the war, maybe 3 years later, and in the beginning he tries to find out what happened and how to get back before trying to change the world completely from 1977. Then I realized that it's probably impossible anyway.
