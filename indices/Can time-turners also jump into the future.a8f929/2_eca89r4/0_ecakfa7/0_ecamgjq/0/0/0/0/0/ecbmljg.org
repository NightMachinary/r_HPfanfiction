Nah I don't know about it. I think it depends on how you define dimensions. I think we can accept that anything that happens may create a different outcome and thus a different future. For someone who looks back into the past, exactly the things that have happened are true and so is his world and timeline. But for somebody who looks forward to the future, there is an infinite amount of possibilities, are these "dimensions?" or are they not? I don't know.

What I'm thinking is that once you have traveled back in time, it should theoretically be possible, if you kept yourself out of any event with any relevance (that you cannot possibly know about), that things play out exactly at they did in the timeline you came from. It should theoretically be possible to arrive at where you came from. But that would only be one of an infinite amount of possibilities, making it virtually impossible to find it, should you possess the means to jump forward in time, or wait for it by trying to be as nonexistent as possible in the meantime.
