Okay, I would be completely willing to buy this. You're just going with more of the usual sci-fi explanation. But that means you wouldn't ever be able to get back to "your present" the long way around, either, by just waiting it out. It doesn't really have anything to do with travelling forward in time, which is where I think some people on this post are getting confused.

And if you /were/ to travel forward in time, you would still just be skipping ahead on the same split timeline you created by travelling back in time in the first place. There's not really any "finding" involved, unless you're talking about dimension-travel, which is a different thing altogether.
