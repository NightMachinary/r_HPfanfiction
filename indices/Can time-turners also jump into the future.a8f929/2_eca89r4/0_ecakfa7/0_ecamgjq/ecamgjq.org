Ok, theoretically, maybe, but if Harry's standing around with a Time-Turner around his neck, and he turns it forward, from the perspective of Ron standing next to him he would just disappear and reappear an hour later. Everyone who was making decisions during that time period would make them without his input, as normal.

There is no multiple timelines here. This isn't divination, where knowing the future ahead of time can alter it, because you /don't/ know the future ahead of time. You have to get there to see it.
