I second several of the other fics that have already been mentioned. And there's also always /The Havoc Side of the Force/ by Tsu Doh Nimh, although it doesn't meet your extra criteria. It takes place in the galaxy a long time ago and far far away instead of at Hogwarts. It's also been almost a year since the last update.

That bring said, it is definitely one of the best HP/Star Wars crossovers.
