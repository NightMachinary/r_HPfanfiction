  Meta: I don't agree with you. I think the Wizarding economy is amazing.
#+end_quote

I guess we disagree on that then. Although perhaps you will agree with me that the (inferred) value of the galleon is a bit inconsistent between the books, not to mention WoG.

  Why would there be many other families that have a vault full of gold?
#+end_quote

Just saying there could be, I don't think we know much about the financial situation of anyone except Harry, the Weasleys, the Malfoys and the Lestranges. There must be a few hundred families in Wizarding Britain, and I doubt many of them are as poor as the Weasleys.

  Purebloods are the only people likely to have vaults full of gold
#+end_quote

Granted, although we don't really know how many family are purebloods and how many of them sided with Voldemort openly enough to get affected by the war.

  and the Malfoys are the only ones that are really spending it en masse.
#+end_quote

Which doesn't mean they are the only ones who /have/ it.

  And any gold that Blacks had, Harry likely inherited.
#+end_quote

Possibly. I don't think we ever got any canon confirmation for that. It is possible that Sirius did not actually inherit much of the money. We just don't know.

All in all, I think it would be easy for a fanfic to have Harry not be one of the richest (but still rich) while staying canon compliant.
