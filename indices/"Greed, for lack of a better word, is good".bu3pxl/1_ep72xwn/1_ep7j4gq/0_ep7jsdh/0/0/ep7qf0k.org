  Although perhaps you will agree with me that the (inferred) value of the galleon is a bit inconsistent between the books, not to mention WoG.
#+end_quote

Well that depends on what you mean inconsistent.

#+begin_quote
  Granted, although we don't really know how many family are purebloods and how many of them sided with Voldemort openly enough to get affected by the war.
#+end_quote

At least 28 pureblood families in Britain according to the author of the Pure-Blood Directory

#+begin_quote
  There must be a few hundred families in Wizarding Britain, and I doubt many of them are as poor as the Weasleys.
#+end_quote

28 pureblooded families, and purebloods are the only ones I can see having vaults of gold. And even then, I would Argue that only Malfoys, Lestranges, and now Potters.

#+begin_quote
  Which doesn't mean they are the only ones who have it.
#+end_quote

True, but they are the only ones we see having a big amount of gold other then Lestranges and Potters.

#+begin_quote
  Possibly. I don't think we ever got any canon confirmation for that.
#+end_quote

We didn't. Yet, some sort of magical inheritance is canon. Harry inherited Sirius' house and house elf. It is likely he inherited his vault too, he just never checked.

#+begin_quote
  It is possible that Sirius did not actually inherit much of the money. We just don't know.
#+end_quote

He was the last living Black bar Tonks family. And since he inherited the house, he likely inherited the money too.

#+begin_quote
  All in all, I think it would be easy for a fanfic to have Harry not be one of the richest (but still rich) while staying canon compliant.
#+end_quote

I won't argue that. It certainly would be easy for an fanfic author to do so
