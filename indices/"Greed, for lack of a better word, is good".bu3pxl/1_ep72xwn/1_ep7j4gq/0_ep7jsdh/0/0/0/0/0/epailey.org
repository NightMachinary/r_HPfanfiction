  How much money does it take to fund a wizarding war? Transportation, weapons, and ammo are all free. Subverting the government doesn't have to be expensive either. Fidelius for hiding places.

My point exactly. Fighting a war there is pretty much free.

  You're down to living expenses and costumes, which can't be that expensive.

Also free if you are skilled. Food? Free with transifguration, duplication, summoning charms, ect. Clothing? Transfiguration, duplication. Housing? Free. How? Transfiguration. Or steal from a muggle.
