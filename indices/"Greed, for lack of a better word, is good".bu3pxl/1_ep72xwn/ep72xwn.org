I mean, truth be told, there's abosultly nothing to rebuild. He is probably one of the richest people in Wizarding Britain. One Galleon is worth *extreme* amounts of money in Wizarding Economy. How much can a Galleon buy? Well, Molly Weasley, in book 2, used at max two Galleons to buy school supplies for 5 of her children. All of school supplies. Including Lockhart's books.
