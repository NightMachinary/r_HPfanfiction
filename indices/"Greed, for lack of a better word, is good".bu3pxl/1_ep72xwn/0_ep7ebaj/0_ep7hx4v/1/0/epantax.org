  Unicorn hair, phoenix feathers, pensieves, wands.

I don't think pensieves are sold actually. Other than that, a wizard can get these things himself. Its just a lot easier to pay someone else to do it for you.

  All of those cost money and are beyond the average magical's ability to procure by themselves.

Not really. There's nothing to say that you can make a super potion that you want. It's just tedious process. A wizard could most likely be completely self-sufficiant if he wanted to. But it is simply easier to buy it, yeah.

Anyway, my point is, that if a economic crash somehow happened in the Wizarding World, they wouldn't give a shit. It would barely affect them at all.
