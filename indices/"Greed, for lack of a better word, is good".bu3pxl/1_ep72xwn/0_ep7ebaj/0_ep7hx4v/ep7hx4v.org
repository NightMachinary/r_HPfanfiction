  beyond the 1 Galleons = 5 Â£
#+end_quote

Rowling, I believe. She claims it is about 5 pounds. This is super inacurate tho, since the purchasing power is vastly different.

#+begin_quote
  Like the Weasleys are poor, yet neither had any problem to feed their children, and even managed to get brooms good enough to play in House Team for at least 5 of their children.
#+end_quote

Like I said. I can go very more in depth into the economy. This makes sense. They are only poor in the sense that they have little money. But the money, unlike with muggles, is relativly worthless. They can use magic to get pretty much everything. Again, I can go in depth on this. Why does it exist then? For convience sake. You could learn how to make a badass looking table, or you can give someone 5 knuts or so to do it for you. That's pretty much it. The only things of real big value(therefore costing a lot of galleons) would be things like supergood and new brooms, and magical items with complex enchantments like Omniculars which cost 10 galleons.

  "Omnioculars," said the saleswizard eagerly. "You can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flash up a play-by- play breakdown if you need it. Bargain - ten Galleons each."

  A Wand cost around 7 Galleons (price Harry paid to Ollivander, we don't know if the price is fixed or can vary depending of the wand)
#+end_quote

The price makes sense if you think about it. It is literally the only think you need to be able to live comfortably. 7 galleons is a lot, but quite small for what it offers. That and unless you are from a pureblood family, this is funded for you. Remember Tom Riddle? He got enough money to buy Supplies and a wand from the Hogwarts Orphan Fund. Purebloods can use family wands. Not as good, but good enough.

  And because it's a magical world, we can't even make a comparison with the Muggle World
#+end_quote

I'd say its fundemeny massivly different. Muggle economy opperates on Supply and Demand. Wizarding Economy doesn't have to. They have infinite supply.

  seem to be enough for him to finish his education
#+end_quote

Education is free. And, yes, mountain of gold is enough to survive until the end of education amd more.

#+begin_quote
  yet Harry is conscious that it would only be the case if he doesn't squander it (by buying gold cauldron for example).
#+end_quote

You need to remember that one, Harry never had any money in his life, Two, he doesn't know anything about Wizarding economy.

#+begin_quote
  but in my opinion, the Potter were just a "Wealthy" family (above the Upper Middle Class, but not by much), and were a far cry from families like the Malfoy when it came to money.
#+end_quote

With how much Money Harry has he is likely the Richest Person in Wizarding Britain. Maybe Malfoys could compete, but no other family. Why Malfoys tho? Well, they are seen spending huge amounts of money, so it kinda makes sense.
