#+begin_quote
  But how can you know that Harry is the richest person around
#+end_quote

I said he is *probably* *one* of the richest people in Wizarding Britain.

#+begin_quote
  I mean yeah he has a lot of gold in his vault so it's impressive but once again, it's not like we have a lot to make comparison.
#+end_quote

We can compare him to the Lestranges at the very least whom from what we saw in the seventh book are about as rich as Harry. Considering that its likely that there are more non-pureblood families than pureblood, Harry automatically gets pushed to the "top 1%". Harry, Malfoys, Lestranges, are probably three of the richest families in Wizarding Britain.

#+begin_quote
  but I believe that the Lestrange are richer for exemple. In my opinion, a Vault full of artifacts such as goblin forged items has more monetary value than another vault just full of gold.
#+end_quote

They don't have any artifacts. Just armor and creatures.

#+begin_quote
  The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures --- some with long spines, others with drooping wings --- potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.
#+end_quote

The only artifact inside was the Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  The potter may be wealthy, but they were new money (Pottermore does say that Harry's grandfather quadrupled the family fortune thanks to his hair care potion), they lived confortably but I doubt they could compete with the truly old family like the Black or the Lestrange
#+end_quote

Why not? If you note, People Like Malfoys don't actually have jobs. They are very influencial, but they live off the inherited money. Potters always worked for their money. Meaning Potters always so an increase in funds, while the Malfoys saw a massive decrease. And Lucius has been spending a lot of money

#+begin_quote
  *Malfoy's been giving generously* to all sorts of things for years... Gets him in with the right people... then he can ask for favours... delay laws he doesn't want passed... Oh, he's very well connected, Lucius Malfoy....

  Lucius lived a rather good life with his family. Independently wealthy and therefore without any need to work, 

  Gaining respect and the good will of high-ranking individuals, through his fortune and family name

  Lucius' constant donations to important establishments were little more than bribing Fudge for classified information, delaying laws, and receiving undeserved rewards and recognitions.

  Harry does get a lot of money (sum not indicated), they imply it is equivalent (or not much inferior), to what he already has,

  “This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions.

  “Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”
#+end_quote

That is all that is said about his inhertence. "Reasonable amount of gold" could mean anything from 5 to a 1000 galleons.

#+begin_quote
  and this is after the 1st blood war and the family was in disaray for 15 years.
#+end_quote

And how is this relavant? Fighting wars in Wizarding World is cheap, and the gold doesn't dissapear if you don't use it.

#+begin_quote
  As for the Malfoy, Harry didn't buy himself a firebolt because it would make a pretty big dent in his vault.
#+end_quote

Not true. He didn't know the price, so he thought it *might* put a big dent in his vault.

#+begin_quote
  A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom: ** THE FIREBOLT ** THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HANDNUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. *PRICE ON REQUEST.*

  Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost.

  The Malfoys bought 7 Numbus 2001 to make Draco part of the team, and while one Nimbus may cost less than a firebolt, the 7 together were probably a lot more expensive.
#+end_quote

Not really. Buy one, and use the Geminio Charm.

#+begin_quote
  PS : As for the price of a wand, my only problem with it is that I do not know how Ollivander can make a living with it,since it seem to be inferior to the price of raw material,
#+end_quote

He doesn't need to make a living with it. A wand pretty much gives you absolutely anything and everything you want. Muggles have to make a living because we need to buy food and stuff. A wizard doesn't need to. He can use magic.

#+begin_quote
  Licorn's hair cost 10 galleons each (as said by Slughorn in HBP), a wand with a Licorn core use several twined together.
#+end_quote

I assume you mean Unicorn's hair?
