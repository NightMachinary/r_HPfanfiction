But how can you know that Harry is the richest person around? I mean yeah he has a lot of gold in his vault so it's impressive but once again, it's not like we have a lot to make comparison.

If we ignore the one used to hide the Philosopher stone (which was empty without it), we only see 3 vaults in all the serie. So the Weasley are poorer than Harry ok (and a lot of other people), but I believe that the Lestrange are richer for exemple. In my opinion, a Vault full of artifacts such as goblin forged items has more monetary value than another vault just full of gold.

The potter may be wealthy, but they were new money (Pottermore does say that Harry's grandfather quadrupled the family fortune thanks to his hair care potion), they lived confortably but I doubt they could compete with the truly old family like the Black or the Lestrange. And after Sirius death, Harry does get a lot of money (sum not indicated), they imply it is equivalent (or not much inferior), to what he already has, and this is after the 1st blood war and the family was in disaray for 15 years.

As for the Malfoy, Harry didn't buy himself a firebolt because it would make a pretty big dent in his vault. The Malfoys bought 7 Numbus 2001 to make Draco part of the team, and while one Nimbus may cost less than a firebolt, the 7 together were probably a lot more expensive.

PS : As for the price of a wand, my only problem with it is that I do not know how Ollivander can make a living with it,since it seem to be inferior to the price of raw material, not to mention the manufacturing price. Licorn's hair cost 10 galleons each (as said by Slughorn in HBP), a wand with a Licorn core use several twined together. And it doesn't include the price of the wood, or the fact that other core seem more expensive (like the Phoenix's ones).
