The problem is, we don't know if it's true or not. The economy in Harry Potter is not fleshed at all, and, beyond the 1 Galleons = 5 £ (don't even remember where we get this), we only have a few elements to compare :

- The newspaper costs around 2 Knuts (Harry gives this to an Owl to get the prophet in PS)
- A Wand cost around 7 Galleons (price Harry paid to Ollivander, we don't know if the price is fixed or can vary depending of the wand)
- 1 000 Galleons are enough to finance a joke shop, premise included.

For the rest, nothing. And because it's a magical world, we can't even make a comparison with the Muggle World. Like the Weasleys are poor, yet neither had any problem to feed their children, and even managed to get brooms good enough to play in House Team for at least 5 of their children.

Harry's vault (described as containing mountains of gold) seem to be enough for him to finish his education, yet Harry is conscious that it would only be the case if he doesn't squander it (by buying gold cauldron for example).

​

I know Fanon loves to make Harry extremely rich (and forget about it after making Harry buy a 15 bedroom trunk and Acromentula' silk robes), but in my opinion, the Potter were just a "Wealthy" family (above the Upper Middle Class, but not by much), and were a far cry from families like the Malfoy when it came to money.
