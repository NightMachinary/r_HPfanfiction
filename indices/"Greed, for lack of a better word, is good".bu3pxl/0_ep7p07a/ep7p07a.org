The only book that the evil Dursleys ever let Harry read is [[https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Ferengi-Rules-Acquisition-guidelines/dp/153357295X][The Complete Ferengi Rules Of Acquisition: Aphorisms, guidelines, and principles to life in Ferengi Culture]].

Take a minute to [[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition][look through them]] and imagine how Harry's adherence to the Rules would change canon, especially Numbers 6, 17, 21, 74, 168, 190, 208, & 285.
