You know what people say: the road to hell is paved with good intentions or playing with fire or people did not sin, but treasure caused sins (匹夫无罪，怀璧其罪)..etc..etc... That Elder wand (if it has abilities it's said to have in legends) is treasure and hellfire, poison and alien technology altogether. I don't think Harry was capable of keeping or using it (Harry knows that too), (maybe it's better to put it in a staff for later use (like someone had put the stone in a ring) but it's still not safe enough)
