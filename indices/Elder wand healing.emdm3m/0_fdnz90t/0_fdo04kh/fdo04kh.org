Of course researching about it is essential. But healing spells are just that : spells. The Episkey spell is a very useful and easy spell to master and still is a minor healing spell. Once mastered it just becomes part of the witch or wizard's skill set. I don't think he has to be a certified healer to heal them. Have some knowledge, yes ; be an expert, no. But if he wants to help more people he sure has to get a Healing mastery. Perhaps go through it with the Phoenix wand to get fair assessment and then use the Elder wand once a master. To heal the Longbottoms before getting his mastery he can look at their charts and what has been done for the Longbottoms thus far. The treatment might not have worked because the spells were too weak to fix what was going on. Maybe mastering the spells and using them with the Elder wand would make them work.
