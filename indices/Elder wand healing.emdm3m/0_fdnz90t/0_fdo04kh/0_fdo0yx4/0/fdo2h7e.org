I'm going with the assumption that Harry is highly intelligent and determined when there is an incentive (Patronus Spell). I'm not he should just show up with a Elder Wand and yell “Healus the Longbottomus” What I mean is that unless there is a breakthrough in the Healing field, there is little chance of retrieving Frank and Alice. What I'm suggesting is that with the power of the Elder Wand, known spells and treatment could work and a breakthrough wouldn't be needed. If Harry didn't have to work for it, the fanfiction would be three line long, and it's not interesting. Of course he should study, plan, study the case and then go in with his eyes opened. I'm just frustrated that a powerful tool was used only for war and repairing a wand when it could have been used more altruistically if it had been kept. And to go with your remarks, I love a studious Harry and would like to see him training intensively so he could get Neville's parents back, the parents of the man who was instrumental in Voldemort's defeat. Maybe Healing won't be his calling, maybe it will. But the Elder wand has power which deserves to be used for good. Rebuilding Hogwarts? Rebuilding families? A wand which likes to kill, trained to heal and repair.
