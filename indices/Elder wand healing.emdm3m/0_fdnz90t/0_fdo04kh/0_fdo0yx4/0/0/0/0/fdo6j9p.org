Oh thanks ☺️ [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12506935/1/A-Slytherin-Through-Time]]

Most relevant for you would be chapters 5-8, 51, 59, 64-66 (they all deal with Neville's parents in some way) :) I'd love to get some feedback, even if it turns out the story isn't for you (perhaps even more so if it isn't for you, as I always try to improve the story).
