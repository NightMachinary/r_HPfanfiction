Perhaps research, the Elder Want and some Felix might be a good combination to achieve that. I actually wrote a fic in which his parents are healed. It's a Draco time travel fic in which Draco befriends Neville (Neville is trying to heal his parents while Draco is looking for a cure for his wife). In my story it's a combination of Herbology, Potions, Legilimency (for some mind healing) and a dose of Felix.
