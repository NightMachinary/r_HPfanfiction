I know that it's just another spell that you'd have to learn, but someone would still have to teach him or he'd have to teach himself. He'd still have to learn all the spells. He'd still have to know the problem to use the correct spell. Also, it's not just a physical problem, I assume a huge part of their condition is psychological due to extensive torture. I doubt normal healing spells would be sufficient to heal them.
