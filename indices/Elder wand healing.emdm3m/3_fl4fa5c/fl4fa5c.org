Harry goes up to neville's parents after realising he could maybe heal them

When he gets there, he realises that he only knows two healing spells

”Eh whatever” he says before trying to heal Neville's mom

”//EPISKEY//”

Now all the problems with any kind of bone have been fixed and their bones are stronger than should be possible

”Oh well”

”//VULNERA SANENTUR//”

Now all of their cuts have been healed so well that their tissue far around them is better than should be possible

Then Harry repeats the gesture to Frank

”//EPISKEY//”

This proved to make a problem for Frank, he now sported a forever-boner

”Uhm, oops?”

”//VULNERA SANENTUR//”

This gave no problems to Frank and then Harry left

Forgive me for my absolutely horrible writing but this had to be done
