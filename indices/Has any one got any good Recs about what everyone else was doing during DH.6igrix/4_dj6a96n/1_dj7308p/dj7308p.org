Even ignoring Thanfiction's pretty disturbing IRL story... I don't really like his fanfics, especially not that one.

Neville is a complete dickhead in that story, and yet everyone fawns over him like he's the greatest person ever. And I get really sick of how all the boys are described as Tough Warrior Men, while the girls are all Nurturing, Delicate Waifs. Who turn into shrieking harpies at the drop of a hat and apparently have some secret unspoken language between them since any girl can instantly tell how any other girl is feeling at any given point.

I'd give it a miss. Plenty other, and much better, stories about the DA during Deathly Hallows, and they even have the advantage of not being written by total creeps.
