It's not just the violence necessarily, it's the fact that it flat out doesn't make sense. Snape's behaviour doesnt make sense. The whole werewolf thing doesn't make sense in the first place, it especially doesn't make sense that Krum turns up to rescue them. To take an example from the very first chapter, it doesnt make sense that various characters suddenly have super strength ethnic magic they never bothered to mention, and again it feeds into the problem of race I mentioned earlier. To align India with snake charming is just... embarrassing, and the suggestion that this wouldnt have ever come up before particularly in CoS is ludicrous.

This would all be fine if I didnt repeatedly see people saying they regard it as canon compliant.
