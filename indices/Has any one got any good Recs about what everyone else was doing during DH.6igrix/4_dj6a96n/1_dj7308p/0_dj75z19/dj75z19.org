This. I'm always left wondering of I'm taking crazy pills when people say it's a good story. The plot lines are ridiculous amd melodramatic, the characterisation is awful, and it's so clumsy with gender and race that I quite often found myself feeling severe second hand embarrassment. I mean, the sudden need to write Seamus's "oirish" accent phoenetically is bad enough, the portrayal of Neville as every teenage boy's fantasy self insert is terrible.

Edit: I'm accutely aware that this might sound like sour grapes. I promise you it is not. I have a great respect and appreciation for other fics in this sort of genre, particularly A Call To Arms. But this one is just a hot mess...
