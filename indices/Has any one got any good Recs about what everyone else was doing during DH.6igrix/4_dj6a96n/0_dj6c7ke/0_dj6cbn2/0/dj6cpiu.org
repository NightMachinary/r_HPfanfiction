Haha no problem!! I try to mention all of it whenever the fic comes up, just cause lots of people don't know. There are arguments for both sides of the read it/don't read it debate, I just want to make sure no one messages him on tumblr, posts about it on tumblr (he tracks the tag and follows everyone - or he used to), or leaves a review somewhere they can be contacted by him. Ive heard he's left the HP fandom, but he has also no real problems taking on a new identity / trying to hide his past, so... better safe than sorry!

(If you want more info about this legitimately crazy story, [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Thanfiction][this]] is probably a good place to start!!)

Edit: there's actually more on [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Victoria_Bitter_Wank][this]] fanlore page!
