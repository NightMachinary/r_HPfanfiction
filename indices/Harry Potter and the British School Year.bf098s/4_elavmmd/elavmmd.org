Luckily for me, I have a Brit for an editor. This is one of the things we discussed early on, and I already had a fairly good understanding anyway. We didn't try to mimic the J.K Rowling class schedule structure, though. Instead, we mashed up my Australian experience and his British experience to create a timetable that is practical, believable and serves the purposes of the story well. It's stored in my phone in a timetable app because that makes it easy to flick through.
