I want to point out that these things aren't true in Scotland!

Our first term starts in early-mid August, runs til early October where there's a week-fortnight break (depending on where in Scotland the length of this holiday varies), then runs til the week before Xmas where there is another two week break, then runs from early January til whenever Easter occurs, around which is a two week break, then runs again til late June/ early July when we finish for the summer (which varies between 6 and 7 weeks).

Therefore our term lengths are usually unequal, and we don't have half-term breaks the way they do in England.

So whilst, yes, American and other nationalities have different school years to the U.K., the U.K. doesn't even have the same system everywhere! So this post is really about the English school system, not the â€˜British' one (which isn't a thing).
