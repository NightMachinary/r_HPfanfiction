  But you'll find more similarities between the system you described and the one in my post than you will differences.

A four term system to three term system is a pretty big difference... and the summer holidays particularly are very differently timed (HP term timing is immediately recognisable to Scottish readers as English) because of that fact. We also go to school for a different number of years, have completely different curriculums and exam systems etc.

It's fine to say the differences are smaller than between other countries' systems, but at least don't call it the â€˜British' system and then use what is clearly and instantly recognisable as the general English school year pattern. To a Scottish person, that is more frustrating than typical Americanisms in writing because where that is an accident, going to the extent of researching the school year here and still ignoring that Scotland is a completely legally distinct schooling system with a different number of terms, different year pattern, different curriculum and completely different exam system is just pretending all Brits are English for the sake of ease.

You might say missing the forest for the trees, I say that if you go to the effort of making a post to correct people on a typical school year pattern then you might as well be correct and call it the English school year.
