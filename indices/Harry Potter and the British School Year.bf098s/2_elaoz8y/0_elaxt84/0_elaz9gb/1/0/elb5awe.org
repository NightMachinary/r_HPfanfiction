  you claim that I didn't do research

Before getting angry, maybe read what I said,. I literally acknowledged your research:

  going to the extent of researching the school year here

However, [[https://www.pkc.gov.uk/schoolholiday][Perth]], [[https://www.primarytimes.co.uk/glasgow/school-term-dates][Glasgow and the West]], [[http://www.moray.gov.uk/moray_standard/page_55829.html][Moray]], [[https://www.highland.gov.uk/info/878/schools/32/school_term_dates][Highlands]], [[https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/schools/parents-carers/school-term-dates/#term19-20][North-east]], [[http://www.orkney.gov.uk/Orkney-Schools-Calendar.htm][Orkney]], [[https://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/media/12744/bcd49101-school-term-and-mid-term-holidays-2019-20.pdf][Western Isles]], [[https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/service-area/children-and-families-service/education/school-term-dates][Dundee]], and more all list four terms, and in fact the only council I found that listed only 3 was Edinburgh - so hardly the majority.

Now, I get that researching another culture isn't straightforward, especially when there are a lot of variations (and the differences between countries of the U.K. are a particular sore point for Scots because we continually get lumped with the English even by the English, let alone people half a world away) but please, when someone from there tells you that you've got it a bit off just actually read what theyve said rather than get defensive.

What you've described is the typical English system, not the â€˜British' system (because there is no such thing).
