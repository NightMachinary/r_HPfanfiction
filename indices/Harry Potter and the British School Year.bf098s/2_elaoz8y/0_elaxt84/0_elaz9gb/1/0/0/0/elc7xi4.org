I can see we aren't going to agree on this, so I'll leave it here.

However, one further unrelated bit of Brit-picking - I really wouldnt use the term British Isles. It's [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute#Republic_of_Ireland][dated and can offend Irish people]] - it dates to pre Irish independence and it's a symbol of British imperialism over Ireland to a lot of Irish people.

Ironically they do I believe also run an English term structure, however I'd avoid that phrase personally.
