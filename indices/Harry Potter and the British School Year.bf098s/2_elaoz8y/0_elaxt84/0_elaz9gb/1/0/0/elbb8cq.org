All those have 3-term school years. Note that as a small part of doing my research, I clicked randomly on five separate Scottish councils, and four of them used a three-term system. This is a case in which extrapolation led to a non-entirely-accurate conclusion. Also please note that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term#Scotland][Wikipedia page]] /and/ [[https://education.gov.scot/parentzone/my-school/general-school-information/Term][an official page from an Executive Agency of the Scottish government]] /both/ make no mention of 4-term years. So while I knew they /existed/ in Scotland, my research did not reveal that.

From your original post. They /are/ true in Scotland, but not /universally/ true. I will admit that I could have reworded my original post to take into account the non-inconsequential number of Scottish school districts that run a four-term school year.

Though you know, if the vast majority of English and Welsh schools, the majority of Northern Irish schools, and a good portion (though perhaps not /majority/ of Scottish schools) use a three-term system, and since from all indication J.K. Rowling seemed to operate Hogwarts under a three-term system, then I think I am /okay for the purposes of this post/ with giving a "generalized British School Year."

If I were to do the post again, I would not change a damn thing, except instead of saying:\\
| On the British Isles, the school year is almost universally split into three sections, called terms.\\
I would say:\\
