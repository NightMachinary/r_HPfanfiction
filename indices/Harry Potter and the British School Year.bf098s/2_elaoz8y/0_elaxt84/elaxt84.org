When I did my research, I saw that there were differences between Scotland schools and English schools. However, most of the differences tended to be minor. I saw Scottish schools with mid-term breaks, and ones without mid-term breaks. I saw ones where the October break was two weeks, and even one where it was three weeks.

But you'll find more similarities between the system you described and the one in my post than you will differences.

Again, I want to avoid missing the forest for the trees. Yes, there are very few schools that follow that pattern /exactly/. However, my post provides a general rule of thumb and introduction to how school years work in Britain, with one eye always on what details the books give us.
