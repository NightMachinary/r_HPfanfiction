Few things to take into account: JKR gives no indications that Hogwarts has half-term breaks, and the summer holidays tend to start at the end of June for them. This is pretty standard for public schools; they tend to have longer holidays than the state schools -- eight at summer, three for winter and spring -- and, tuition aside, Hogwarts is obviously based more on the public school system.

That said, there's a couple of instances in the books where the winter break is clearly only two weeks, so whether all this gets taken into account is debatable.

All that said, JKR's entire school system is flawed (1st Sept. start date /every year/?), so if you wanna make it realistic then just overhaul the lot.
