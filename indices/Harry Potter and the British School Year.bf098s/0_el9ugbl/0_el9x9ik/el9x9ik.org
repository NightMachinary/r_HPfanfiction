To be honest, the main point of this post was to illustrate to non-British authors the general overview of how the British school system works. The French school year is similar, as they both operate on the trimester (three-term) system.

In the USA, for example, almost universally uses the semester (two-term) system, with a Fall Semester and a Spring Semester. The school year isn't nationalized, so some districts do use a trimester system, but it is uncommon. Canada's education similarly isn't nationalized, so it varies widely between provinces. Some run semester, some run trimester. Oddly enough, some school systems in Canada run a trimester system for the younger years and a semester system for the later years.

Schools in Germany don't necessarily have separate terms within a single school year. Brazilian schools typically have four terms, and their school year generally runs from February to December. Australia also has four terms, typically, and also follows the calendar year (first term starts in January, fourth term ends in December).
