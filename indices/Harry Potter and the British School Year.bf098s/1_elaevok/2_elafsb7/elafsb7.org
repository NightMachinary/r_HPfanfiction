Aye, but I can't reasonably take into account every school. The majority of schools, and of resources I consulted on this matter, refer to them as Autumn, Spring, and Summer. I spoke to several friends who grew up in the British school system and each person referred to them in that way.

My aim is to give a general overview, not to exhaustively give an account of the British school system.

Rowling did not name the terms in the books, of course. And fiction writers should feel free to refer to them however they want. But I find naming the terms as I did eases the understanding of the important bits.
