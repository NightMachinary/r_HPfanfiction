This is the only similar fic I can think of. Linkffn(2954601) is your typical post-OOTP fanfic. Cue sudden determination to work hard, learn Occulmency and trip to buy a trunk similar to the one Madeye uses... However, Harry does learn wandless magic and uses it in battles.

As for Dobby teaching Harry wandless magic, (not sure if its headcannon), Dobby shouldn't be able to teach Harry wandless magic as they are different creatures. Besides, if Dobby could really teachh Harry wandless magic, why havent other wizards and witches exploited elves?
