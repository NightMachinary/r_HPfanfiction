I remember that one... I read it about a year ago? I agree, it was terrible and weird as hell. Tbh I think the author deleted it... I'll check through the AU communities on FF.Net.

Edit: Found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7806627/1/Sacrificial-Second-Chance][Sacrificial Second Chance]]. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-Alternate-Universes/24249/14/0/1/0/5/1/0/][this specific community]], in case you were wondering.
