Considering Harry's first encounter with this phenenomona would be in her first year, when she's eleven years old, I'm pretty sure it'd be against Reddit's rules (a rule which is enforced on this subreddit) to link it here.

Also, would this be considered a form of inadvertent brainwashing? I mean, she could perhaps develop some actual affection, but he'd essentially, even if he's unaware of it, be /training/ her to seek his presence.

I try very hard to never judge a request. People are different and want different things and that's okay. But I'm really, really hoping that this request was made before you fully considered the implications behind it. Because it's honestly very disturbing.
