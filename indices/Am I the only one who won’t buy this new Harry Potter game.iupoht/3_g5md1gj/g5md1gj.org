I'm going to get it. Frankly, I think some of the stuff that she's said has been massively overblown. The place where she outlined her actual views in full (and not through a medium through which it is impossible to convey stuff) shows several things:

#+begin_quote
  I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman who's older than I am and wonderful. Although she's open about her past as a gay man, I've always found it hard to think of her as anything other than a woman, and I believe (and certainly hope) she's completely happy to have transitioned. Being older, though, she went through a long and rigorous process of evaluation, psychotherapy and staged transformation.

  I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable for all the reasons I've outlined. Trans people need and deserve protection. Like women, they're most likely to be killed by sexual partners. Trans women who work in the sex industry, particularly trans women of colour, are at particular risk. Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who've been abused by men.

  because /of course/ trans rights are human rights and /of course/ trans lives matter

She is not against trans people.

  A man who intends to have no surgery and take no hormones may now secure himself a Gender Recognition Certificate and be a woman in the sight of the law. Many people aren't aware of this.

  The fourth is where things start to get truly personal. I'm concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition and also about the increasing numbers who seem to be detransitioning (returning to their original sex), because they regret taking steps that have, in some cases, altered their bodies irrevocably, and taken away their fertility. Some say they decided to transition after realising they were same-sex attracted, and that transitioning was partly driven by homophobia, either in society or in their families.

  couldn't shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with womens and girls' safety.

She is concerned with the possibility of predators, and the possibility that people are rushing into transitioning. She provides evidence to support her thoughts (the accuracy of which is questionable).

Let me be clear before someone considers me to be transphobic, that while I do agree with some of JKR's rationale and ideas and am sympathetic to her experience, */as a whole, I do not agree with her thinking and rationale. For example, she has clearly overblown the existence and risk of predators in female bathrooms/*. Do I understand why someone who has gone through sexual assault and domestic abuse might be swayed by unclear statistics on the manner? Yeah.

So JKR is coming from a place of good intentions. Her views have frankly been conveyed in a respectful manner on twitter and her website from what I've seen. Her latest book is a bit odd, but the trope of a cross-dressing killer (not even trans) is not exactly new and from what I hear, isn't even the killer (though I haven't read it).

So I am still going to get the game, because I'm unconvinced that JKR is a hateful person. And for those who won't, I'd like to point out a few things.

1. JKR is filthy rich.
2. JKR is (nominally at least) not directly involved with the game
3. Buying the game supports the developers far more than JKR

Disclaimers in advance: I have only read her tweets in a cursory manner, my only detailed reading of her beliefs have come from her website. If JKR has tweeted something that shows that she is against trans people, please share it with me.
