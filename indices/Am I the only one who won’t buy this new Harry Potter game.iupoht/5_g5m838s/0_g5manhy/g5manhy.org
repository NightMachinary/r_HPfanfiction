I agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions as well, but to an extent. JKR is actively spreading toxic and hateful speech, and as someone many people, especially children, look up to, she has a responsibility to use her platform for good. She has a responsibility to do good. I think some opinions, should not be expressed. JKR has definitely done good things, I will not deny it. But what she is doing is actively teaching the people that look up to her to be hateful towards an estimated 1.5 million people (in America alone) and especially right now, money is more powerful then words. I will stop supporting JK Rowling, because I cannot, in good conscience, support someone who tells people hateful things about people like my little sister.
