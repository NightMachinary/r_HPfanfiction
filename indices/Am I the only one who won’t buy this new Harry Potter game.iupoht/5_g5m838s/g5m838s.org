I wanna see how this maybe controversial response gets. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinions and to share them. Depending on how someone has lived and in what they believe in people will react different to a 3rd party actions.

I won't buy it because I don't have the financial means to do so, If I had the money I would, just like I'm planning to re buy the books cause my old ones got damaged, and get my own personal set of dvds instead of the family ones, and I still dream to be able to visit the theme parks and so on...

And I do it because they represent something deep and personal for me and my childhood, they're special and the Harry Potter Universe for me is something that has grown beyond the author itself.
