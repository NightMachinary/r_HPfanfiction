I'm all on board with them figuring out something was hidden, I just don't think they would feel the urgency to find it that enables Harry to get it. Their *life dream* of having their own joke shop just would not be overshadowed by their curiosity of what is hidden. And the mirror shows you your *most desperate desire*, not the lukewarm curiosity you happen to have for the puzzle of what your teachers are hiding. They would probably see themselves opening their shop at Diagon Alley when they reach the end, not themselves finding the stone.
