Would they even know something is hidden there when they just expected it to be an obstacle course, though? And even if they did suspect, would it trump their desire for their own joke shop for long enough to show them the hidden gem?

As Dumbledore told Harry, the mirror shows the most desperate wish the person looking into it carries in their heart.
