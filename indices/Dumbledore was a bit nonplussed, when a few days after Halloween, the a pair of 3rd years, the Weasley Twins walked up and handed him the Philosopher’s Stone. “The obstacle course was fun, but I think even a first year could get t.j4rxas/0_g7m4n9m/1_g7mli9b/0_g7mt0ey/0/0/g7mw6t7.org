True. This is all conjecture. The books are really vague on this. Maybe it was because voldemort wasn't directly looking into the mirror and kept quirrel from falling into a trance since voldemort was a parasite and didn't force a full possession. Or maybe dumbledore only meant to delay voldemort till he could arrive. Besides Voldemort was very arrogant and self assured and possibly insane. I mean look how he kept "trophies" as proof of how he was better than others and even admitted in front of all the death eaters in the graveyard that he was the son of a muggle.

So vodemort only partially possesses quirrel as he could possibly sever himself from him at any time and escape if there was a trap. Considering that he was already immortal, he probably needed the philosophers stone to create a new body and was confident that Dumbledore did not know of his horcruxes. This is my head cannon.
