Voldemort is also at this point pretty damn unstable. I can see it as possible that he could be trapped in such a situation. He's powerful, smart, cunning, and insane, but he is not infallible. Considering how desperate he is at this point in his life(unlife? Death? HTH do you describe him here), he could definitely miss a trap from Dumbledore with the power of the Elder wand that he won through a fight(which is supposedly impossible), so yeah. That's my thoughts.
