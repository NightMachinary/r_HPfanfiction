I think the bait was to lure voldie to look at the mirror to maybe trap him in its enchantments and the reason it was not placed in the room was because Dumbledore had to tweak its enchantments to trap his spirit once he touched the mirror or something. Considering how vague the reasons for his actions were given in the books, it is likely that the stone itself was a fake. Maybe there could have been a safe to place the stone in or even some obscure charms or enchantments to trap him on the stone itself, it is likely dumbledore wanted to ensure whichever magic tom used to make was neutralised, so he trapped him to buy himself some time to destroy the spirit.

I recently found a oneshot in which dumbledore visited him on his 8th bday and from then onwards visited him often to ensure he had a good childhood, where the spirit trapping happened.
