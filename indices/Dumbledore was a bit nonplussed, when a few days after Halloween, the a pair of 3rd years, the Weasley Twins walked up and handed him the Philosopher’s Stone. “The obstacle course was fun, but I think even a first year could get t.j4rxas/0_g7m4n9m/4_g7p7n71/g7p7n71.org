linkao3(23277868) is a guilty pleasure fic, but I do love the actual protection for the stone. Dumbledore draws all the attention to the obstacle course and the fake, while Snape tells the handful of potions students who care that he made a mistake in brewing room 5 over the summer and he's locked it down to keep students away. Then the actual room is rigged with lethal curses.
