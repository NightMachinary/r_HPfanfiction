My favorite theory re the Stone is that the obstacle course was never meant to stop anyone, or at least not anyone capable. It was meant to make the stone /appear/ protected, while the only real defense was the mirror. Snape's fire trap, however, would prevent someone leaving once they entered. The goal was to trap Tom, and either arrange a confrontation between him and Harry under semi-controlled conditions, or enable Dumbledore to imprison him (remember, Dumbledore is implied to have not known about the horcruxes until Chamber of Secrets, so this was likely an attempt to end Tom for good- Dumbledore was no doubt terrible disappointed when it failed).
