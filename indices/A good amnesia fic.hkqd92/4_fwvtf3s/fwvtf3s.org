I remember one where Harry was living as a Muggle with no memory of the Wizarding World, until a woman from the series comes and flirts with him (possibly Ginny, possibly Luna, I really don't recall) and eventually reveals the big amnesia twist. No idea what it was called, but it was quite interesting.
