Yeah i've never gotton fics where he gets emancipated because of the goblet and acts like a mature adult at 14. My sister is 14 and she isn't even close to an adult. I remember being 14 and offended for harry when fluer calls him a little boy, but looking at my sister now really has changed my perspective on it.
