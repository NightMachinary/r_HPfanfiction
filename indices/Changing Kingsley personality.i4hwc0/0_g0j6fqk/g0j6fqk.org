/Kingsley walks in from the eastern door, a sandwich in his hands. Malfoy is bound to a chair, crying, as this exact scene has played out the same every time Kingsley entered his cell./

"Now Malfoy. I'll give you one more fucking chance. What does the 6th horcrux look like."

Malfoys lip trembles, his body shaking as he looks up at the man. He shudders out a feeble, "W-what?"

Kingsley slaps the youngest Malfoy across the face, before brining a finger up to point at the boy. "Where is Malfoy Manor?"

And once again, all he can answer with is, "What?"

"What ain't no place I never heard of. They speak English over there?"

"What?"

"ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT?"

"YES!" Was the hurried reply, as he struggled in the seat.

"THEN YOU UNDERSTAND ME. NOW TELL ME WHERE THE 6TH HORCRUX IS!"

"W-what?"

"SAY WHAT AGAIN. SAY WHAT. AGAIN." Kingsley shouts, pulling out his wand. "I DARE YA, I DOUBLE DARE YOU MOTHERFUCKA, SAY WHAT, ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME."
