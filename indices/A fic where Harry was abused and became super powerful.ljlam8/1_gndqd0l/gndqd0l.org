So you're looking for a specific fic or you want recs that also fit into that category?

There's a brilliant series called Pacify in which Harry becomes SUPER powerful and is able to create land and grow flowers and life, etc (it's a Snarry fic). I don't think that's the one that you're describing, but if you're into this concept (abused/traumatized Harry becomes super powerful), then I'd definitely recommend it.
