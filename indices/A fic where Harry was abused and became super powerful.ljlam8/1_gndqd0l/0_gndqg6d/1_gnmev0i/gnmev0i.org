Oh, so glad you found it! I'll definitely check it out. I'm not even a Snarry person, per se, but I got addicted to this fic because it is SOOO well written. And I am a huge Snape fan, and he's so well-written here. It is definitely worth checking out. Of note- someone has created a “podfic” so if you're into audio, you can also listen to it.
