Oh god, within chapter one he's gone to the goblins, who are, for some reason, Horcrux experts, got a blood adoption, and is now Harry-Potter-Black of the "Potter-Black Clan". It's already mentioned betrothals and house elves have become his minions.

Is there a fanfiction cliche bingo board?

Edit: It just keeps getting worse. Ron only wants to go back because the conniving shrew Molly convinced Ron to love potion Harry and Hermione to keep them apart.

Edit 2: He's now a dark magic expert, his patronus has changed to a hungarian horntail for no particular reason, and Dumbledore is an idiot. Oh, and Daphne came out of nowhere and they fell in love.

And it's done. That was awful.
