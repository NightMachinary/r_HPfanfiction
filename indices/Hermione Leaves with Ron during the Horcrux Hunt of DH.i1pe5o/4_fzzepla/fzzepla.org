So, I am more or less good writing action and plot, so I have been reading these romance fics thinking they can help me improve at that department and found this linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13639243/1/Still-Searching]])

It is a WIP but it is updating once or twice per week.

It is well written, even if chaps are not that long and plot is advance but little between them. It focuses on characterization. It does feel like the main focus is romance, though there are also seeds there to move the adventure forward. No weird leap in logic or canon faithfulness which usually put me off on single point of divergence fics.
