Well this fic is one of my favourite HP Fanfiction. Here we get to see both Lily and Harry speak Parseltongue as Lily's grandmother was a squib from the Gaunt Line. The fic in overall is a good read especially the author's take on the Manipulative Dumbledore genre and the entire Voldemort killing Lily and James fiasco were my personal favourites here.
