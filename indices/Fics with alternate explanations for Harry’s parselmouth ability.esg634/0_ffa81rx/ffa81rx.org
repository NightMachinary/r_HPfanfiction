There are definitely some out there that explain the parselmouth as because he's a descendant of Slytherin, either though Lily who was secretly the daughter of a squib of a lost line of pureblood wizards/witches or through James and the tangled mess that is wizard ancestry -- but those are usually in powerhouse all-knowing Lord Harry fics where he inherits a dozen other nobility titles as soon as he approaches Gringotts. The power trips can definitely put people off from those types of fics, though.
