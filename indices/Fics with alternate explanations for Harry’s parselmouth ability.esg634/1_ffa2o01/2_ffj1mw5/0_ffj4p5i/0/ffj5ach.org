I don't mind slash for other characters, I simply don't like Harry slash pairings. I tried to check the comments on AO3 and Ctrl +F but I came upon the author thinking about Harry/Barty pairing in AN which made me hesitate(Since the author didn't specify any pairing in the tags which seemed like a red flag or something to me)
