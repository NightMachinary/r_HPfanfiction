You might be asking the wrong question. It might be appropriate to have the problem be explained thoroughly if it's important to the story or if it sets a certain mood--essentially, it has a purpose of being there. But if it's not important, then maybe its part could be shorter or the passage shouldn't even be there at all. You can't explain or show everything in a story, nor should you. Time is a delicate quality. If you're worried about your own story, I find it's best to step away from the story for awhile and then reread it with a fresh mind, so the pacing has time to "reset."

Me personally, I like the feeling of a story constantly moving forward, be it slow or fast, as long as I feel like there's a destination at the end.
