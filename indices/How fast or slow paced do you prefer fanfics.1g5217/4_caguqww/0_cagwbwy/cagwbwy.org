My problem is not skipping time, sometimes that have to happen. My problem is when things that are seemingly incredibly complicated are resolved in the matter of a few lines.

I gave an example with the glasses. LetÂ´s have another. You say it depends on the genre. Let's think romance then. Do characters who don't know each other suddenly discover they like each other, and as soon as they kiss everything is just peachy and/or rolling like an avalanche? I would in those cases have the characters get to know each other, and in no way would I think the story would be sufficient if everything was suddenly peachy between them and the outside world. I mean just because you have the two characters kiss or make out doesn't mean you can suddenly change everything between them. I have read a H/HR fic or two where as soon as they become a couple they tell each other EVERYTHING and they have no problems between them. They treat the characters almost as if it is one person. Why do they do that? Well, instead of a conversation where they have them talking back and forth they can gloss over it by having them say "ok" and then move on.
