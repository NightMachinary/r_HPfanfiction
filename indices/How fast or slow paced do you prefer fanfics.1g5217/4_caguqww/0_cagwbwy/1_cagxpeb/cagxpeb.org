I agree with someorangirl, but i would also like to add that fanfiction by its very nature is teenage driven, both in mind-set and fantasy. In the teenage world relationships are a big blind spot where one kiss can equal love and 'let me tell you my deepest dark secret person I've hated till today', and sometimes you just have to roll with it if the overall story is worth it.
