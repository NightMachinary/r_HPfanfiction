Well, that's a very vague question, and I could give you many different answers. I suppose it depends on the genre, mostly, as well as writing style, characters, my own mood, etc.

Thinking of my favorite stories, the pace varies quite a bit. Some stories cover several months in a matter of pages, and others stretch an hour or two over twenty chapters. On the whole, I guess I'd say that I gravitate towards stories with slightly slower pacing.
