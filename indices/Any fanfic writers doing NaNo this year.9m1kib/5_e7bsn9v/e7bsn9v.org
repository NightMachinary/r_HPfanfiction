I'm still undecided if I'll try my hand on one of my dormant fics, or if I put some effort in it and actually go for something original.

The latter would require me to do a lot of preparation in October. Writing a fic would get massive worldbuilding, character design and all that out of the way. Really depends on wether or not my schedule allows it.
