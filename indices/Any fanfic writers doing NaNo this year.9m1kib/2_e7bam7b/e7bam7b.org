Yup. I'll probably be working on a longshot called "The Dreaming Tower." It's a Master of Death fic where Harry, injured and on the run from his greatest enemy yet, finds himself in investigating Ornoch, an isolated, Lovecraftian-ish town off the coast of Scotland (in the Orkneys to be precise) that's said to be home to a tower cursed by Godric Gryffindor himself and is central to several rumours, legends, and prophecies over the past millennia. Harry's enemies are numerous, counting up the whole of magical England under the rule of its newest Minister of Magic, as well as the strange and secretive folk of Ornoch. For help all he has is Draco Malfoy, the Hallows of Death, and an evil, soul-eating sword. Sometimes immortality is overrated.

So, it's part sword-and-sorcery fantasy, part cosmic horror, part buddy cop fic between two people who hate each other, and most likely to crash and burn at about 10,000 words rather than its anticipated 30,000. Here's hoping it doesn't and I get it done by December.
