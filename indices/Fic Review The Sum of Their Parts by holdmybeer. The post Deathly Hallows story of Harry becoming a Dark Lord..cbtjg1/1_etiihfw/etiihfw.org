I was intensely underwhelmed by this fic considering how often it's recommended and touted as a top tier work within this community.

I feel it's only well regarded because of how often it's recommended, and it's only recommended because of some fortuitous feedback loop. Members of the sub see it being recommended so often they understandably assume it must be good.

Thanks for the review [[/u/Draquia][u/Draquia]]
