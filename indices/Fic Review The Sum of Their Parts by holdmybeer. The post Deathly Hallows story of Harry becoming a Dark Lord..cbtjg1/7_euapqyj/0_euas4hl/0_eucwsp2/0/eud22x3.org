I hope the fandom isn't too intimidating. It's probably the largest one on the internet, but the greatest thing about that is that you can pretty much express any taste you want and someone has written about it. Dark Harry is fairly popular as I understand it, and people are always keen to share fics which have made an impression on them.

There's a lot of really great stuff out there, and I find going through reddit is a good way to find it, because with the sheer amount of fic there is to wade through, you'll have a hard time finding the good ones without recommendations.

Thank you again for your comments on the review. If you ever find a fic you think could do with a review itself, let me know. I'm always on the lookout for more recommendations - just be prepared that I'll give my honest opinion on it! :D
