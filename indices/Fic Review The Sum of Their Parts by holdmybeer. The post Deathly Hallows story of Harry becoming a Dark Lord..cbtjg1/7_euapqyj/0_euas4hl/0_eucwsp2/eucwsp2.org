Hii! I binged a little last night and I'm already at Chapter 8. Just a few more to go.

Looking back, I can definitely see where your comments and reviews are coming from. I definitely read a lot of 'looking tired/tiredly' and 'Teddy becoming a second-class citizen' among other things. After reading those quite a number of times last night, even I got /tired/ of it. (Excuse the pun.) Still, there's a lot to admire about the story, especially for someone like me who's not in the fandom and can't write anything as detailed and thought-out as this. As you said, the St. Mungo's thing and the mentions of PTSD and both Ron and Hermoine being quite fleshed out were all good points.

The HP fandom remains intimidating and confusing to me, but there are kind and welcoming readers so I will definitely consider posting a request here. Maybe after I finish reading The Sum or after I check out what AO3 has to offer.

Thank you very much!
