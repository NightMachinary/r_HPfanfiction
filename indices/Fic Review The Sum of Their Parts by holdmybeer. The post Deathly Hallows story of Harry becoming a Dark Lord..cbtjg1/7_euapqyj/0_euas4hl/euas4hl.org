Firstly thank you very much for your compliments on the review! If you are enjoying The Sum of Their Parts there's no reason why you shouldn't continue on it either.\\
On the second point, unfortunately no I don't have any recommendations on a Dark Post-War Harry. I started on this subreddit as a way of filtering to some of the better fanfics out there, and a lot of what I've been recommended has been great. I enjoy fanfiction, but I haven't read the same sheer bulk of work that many redditors here have. My schtick is that I like to review the fanfictions I've been recommended, and I've only gone through half a dozen so far. I do hope that as I go through more people will be able to use my reviews for recommendations, but at this point the only other one I've looked at involving a Dark Harry was the Downward Spiral Saga, but that one isn't post war and might be too dark for what you're looking for.

I'd suggest you make a post using the request flair, stating all of your preferences in the description (genre, length, time period, etc) and see what comes up. You'll probably get a really good response, because loads of people are happy to share the stories they've read and enjoyed, and have read prolifically across the internet. I hope you find something you really enjoy.
