Hello OP. Your review was really detailed, comprehensive and well-written. I'm actually on Chapter 3 of 'The Sum of Their Parts' after somebody recced it on r/ Fanfiction. I enjoy the story and I like the writing style, though I didn't know this fic might be polarizing to some. I'm not really an HP fan though and I only read HP fics sporadically, but after people mentioned post-war Dark Harry on r/ Fanfiction I actually started looking through this subreddit and tumblr for other such fics. Most of the ones people rec are incomplete, abandoned, or usually /insanely/ long, which I have to admit isn't really all too appealing for a casual reader. So I'm just wondering if you have any recommendations for Dark Harry or any good post-war fics with a much more believable plot?

Thank you.
