I enjoyed it.

That said, I've never understood why Harry's first reaction to seeing that newspaper article was to immediately assume that he would have to become a Dark Lord or else everything would stay the same. It felt so very sudden that I had a hard time getting into the fic for a while, but then it started to get better I suppose (really liked the trio's interactions).

I agree with you that if it were longer, it would be a much improved work. I imagine that we would see Harry fight from the inside to make things better, then become jaded after some time with no real changes, and only then he would consider turning dark to save Teddy. For that reason, I like linkffn(Made of Common Clay) a little bit better - we don't exactly see Harry going through this process but by the time the fic starts he's 30, bitter as hell, and willing to do what it takes to force Wizarding Britain to just be better.
