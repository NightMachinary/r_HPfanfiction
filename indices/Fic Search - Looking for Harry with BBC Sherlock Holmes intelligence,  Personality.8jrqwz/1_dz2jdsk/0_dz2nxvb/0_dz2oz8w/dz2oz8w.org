  The first is one that I read a while back that is not finished, and likely never will be. I recall it being entertaining (with Hermione playing the part of Holmes), but I don't remember details. The second has Harry be very scientific, and reminded me of your request. I read it up to a point, and then stopped cause I disliked an event that occurred. No idea what happens after that. Not sure it fits what you want as much, but no harm suggesting it.
