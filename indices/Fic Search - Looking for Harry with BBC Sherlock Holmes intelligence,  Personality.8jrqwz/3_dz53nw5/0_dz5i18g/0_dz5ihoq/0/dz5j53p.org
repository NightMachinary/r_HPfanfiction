Nah, I never read it. I read the summary and the reviews. I don't usually read fics without checking it for a LOT of negatives. And I found enough to make me turn around and never look back. Manipulative Dumbledore is the least of my problems.

Which is hilarious, because if Dumbledore was manipulating a bunch of kids, said kids wouldn't even notice it.
