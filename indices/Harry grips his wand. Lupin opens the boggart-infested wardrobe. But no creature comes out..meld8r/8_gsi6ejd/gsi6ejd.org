Hmm, that can be true but I have a different thought. Since he has been living there all his life, it is now his sanctuary, his safe place. Whenever something bad happens, he wants to go back there and just curl up on his bed.

I can see him hating that place, I can see him being afraid of that place and I can see him feeling comfort from that place too (one at a time). So more like he is afraid of the loneliness he felt there and the lack of love.
