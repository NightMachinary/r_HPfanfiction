Memories of childhood, either good or bad, you never leave behind. That's the thing, these memories/nostalgia is always subconscious. You don't think about it, you don't want to think about it but it's there in your mind, always.

It was there when he felt the most extreme emotions, when he didn't know what/why of his condition. I'm pretty sure that no one can forget such emotions completely. And the mind when feeling such emotion again, will put forth an image from the past or vice versa.
