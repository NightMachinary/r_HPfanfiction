Harry stared into the wardrobe, his knuckles were a starch white. As he looked towards that empty bed, with the crammed in hand-me-down clothes, he thought he could hear Vernon right outside the door. The man's slurring voice as he yelled at Harry to get out of the cupboard do he could face the boy face to face made his legs shake.

All of the other children around Harry were pale now, and even Lupin seemed frozen. With widened eyes, Harry stared towards the cupboard, the voice of Vernon now growing louder.

"R-r-ridikulus," His voice was hardly above a whisper.

Yet the spell didn't work. He was forced to stare towards a steadily growing nightmare. A banging came onto the cupboard that forced Harry into a flinch. Everyone looked on as the boy-who-lived was reduced to a state of shaking fear and tears.

It was then, that Lupin was pulled from his shock. A fierce anger tore through him as he raised his wand.

"Ridikulus!" He shouted.

The image that the boggart had summoned vanished. Everyone was left staring at Harry, as the boy quickly walked over to his friends.

Ron said nothing, but quickly clasped his hand against Harry's shoulder. Hermione was quick to walk over and give him a fierce hug. Lupin, after a moment, walked over and hugged the boy strongly.

"I will be talking with Dumbledore about this tonight," He whispered in a shaky, almost broken voice.
