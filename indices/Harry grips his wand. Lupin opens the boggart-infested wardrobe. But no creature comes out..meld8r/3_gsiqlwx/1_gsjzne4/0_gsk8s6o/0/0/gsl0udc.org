#+begin_quote
  Cast out by the Dursleys during a horrible childhood, Harry washes up on an unknown island. Stranded with another who had been thrown away by her family, the two of them build a new family with a small group of intelligent creatures. How long can they stay alone on the island with so many unknown threats and people that are out looking for them?
