The comments saying they think Harry would see the cupboard as his sanctuary... No. Hogwarts is his sanctuary. Privet Drive 4 was his prison and the cupboard was his cell. He was never safe in there, the Dursleys shouted for him to come out and do their bidding and I wouldn't be surprised if there was a time where they had dragged him out for not being fast enough too. They also used it as his place of punishment; being bolted in the cupboard without food was how the Dursleys usually dealt with Harry when he "misbehaved" in their eyes. The cupboard had some things Harry could consider his, but otherwise it was not better than anywhere else in the house. When he was gardening or doing chores in other rooms, they mostly left him alone, too. The only perk the cupboard had was that he wasn't expected to do anything for them while he was in it, except remain quiet, but it was still incredibly confining and left Harry with very little to do.

I don't think 3rd year Harry would have the cupboard as his greatest fear, but that is more because of the scary shit he's gone through besides the whole situstion with the Dursleys. Not because any flimsy positives of the cupboard one might see when they squint somehow make it "not that fearsome" or whatever.

Poor kid has so many things to pick from. Unlike dementors which need actual, awful memories, a fear could be anything. The boggart could have shown the Mirror of Erised versions of Lily and James dead at his feet, or expulsion from Hogwarts, or losing his friends, Voldie coming back (he was really worked up and scared about it in PS and the bastard had already tried twice in Harry' presence). But even if we are going for things he actually went through, well, there's a lot. Ron getting "slain" by giant chess pieces, burning Professor Quirrel alive with his bare hands, Ginny that could've very easily died in the Chamber, petrified Hermione, the basilisk, Aragog... The whomping willow nearly killing Ron and him at the start of 3rd year. And the dementors, of course.
