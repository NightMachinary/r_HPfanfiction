"This isn't my Boggart." Harry said carefully. "Professor, how do Boggarts impersonate your greatest fears? How do they know?"

"Well..." Lupin said, thrown for a loop by the question. "Nobody really knows. All that is known is that they somehow know to take the form of your greatest fear-"

"Or worst nightmare?" Hermione asked in a trembling voice. "Is that what you're really asking Harry?"

Harry didn't answer. He was too busy focusing on the open door in front of him. He gingerly extended his left hand into the so-called cupboard, beads of sweat dripping off the rims of his glasses as his hand pierced through an invisible barrier.

Gone was the hand of a thirteen-year-old seeker, replaced with the gauntleted fist of a knight. He turned the palm up and snapped his fingers. A flame blossomed above where his fingers met. "Fuck."

Hermione bolted out the door before Harry finished flinging himself backwards, kicking the wardrobe door closed behind him. "Ron! Hold them shut!" He yelled as something tried to force the door open from the other side.

The youngest Weasley boy hit the door shoulder-first, eliciting an angered shriek from whatever had been behind it. "Plan, Harry?" He grunted out as the door started rattling.

"My bag." He said to his friend. "I've got something that should stop whatever that is from breaking through."

"Hurry, it's getting angry." Ron said as he adjusted his stance. The shrieking rose in volume. "It's starting to sound like Percy."

Harry opened his bag and reached for an old pencil case with LWPS sewn into the top. He opened it up and retrieved a vial of dark blue liquid. "What is that?" Sally-Anne Perks asked as she frantically searched her own bag.

"Dreamless sleep potion." Harry said as he put the case back in its bag. "The Nightmares are back."

"I figured that out for myself thanks." Sally answered as she pulled a wooden box out of the depths of her bag. "And that's an Incursion Gate if I'm not mistaken."

"Damn." Harry said in mock deadpan. "Guess Morpheus owes me five Gold after all."

Hermione came rushing back in. "Backup incoming Harry." She panted out, clutching a muggle water gun in her left hand and a foam sword in her right.

"Get in position." Harry said. "Ron, open that door on three! One, Two-"

Ron was sent flying as a nightmarish creature barrelled through the doors, screaming a roar of defiance out of an unseen mouth as it vectored in on the redhead's landing spot. Harry threw the potions vial on instinct, nailing the creature in the side of the head as it turned away from him. The creature burst into flames and disappeared.

"Ow." Ron said as he picked himself up off the floor. "What is it with dreamspawn and dogs anyway?"

"Dunno." Harry shrugged. "They're sorcerers in my case."

"Vampires." Hermione said sullenly. "I thought I'd seen the back of them by now."

"We all did." Sally-Anne Perks said as she and a few other muggleborn sidled up to them, carrying a wide variety of weaponry ranging from a club to a rifle in their hands. "So the adventure wasn't over after all." She said smugly. "Anyone staying?"

"Ha!" Justin Finch-Fletchley laughed. "They took my brother over the Winter holidays. I've been wanting a crack at getting him back for months now."

"You don't sound too worried." Harry observed. "These aren't the typical dreamlands you know."

"Well I'm not the same kid who faced the Oneiroi and lived to tell the tale, now am I? They'll learn not to mess with a Fletchley, adopted or not." Justin boasted.

"Right. Everyone got what they need?" Hermione asked, getting nods from the kids next to her. "Go." She said, running towards the opening.

The others followed suit. "Wait!" Lupin shouted, trying in vain to catch up the kids. "Don't go in there! You have no idea where it-oshit-" he said, tripping through the wardrobe door. "-leads."

As Professor Lupin's body cleared the threshold, the door to the Wardrobe closed shut behind him, leaving the rest of the stunned class gaping at it. After a solid minute, some tried opening the door again. Others went to fetch professors and heads of house. The rest milled around, answering questions and generally trying to get their thoughts around what they'd witnessed.

None knew where the students had gone to. A few remembered their conversation enough for deeply buried memories to stir, but they remained quiet about their thoughts. Nobody talked.

It wasn't until the Unspeakables arrived that the truth became clear- that the students were in the Dreamlands to save Hogwarts from a terrible danger. How many, if any, will make it back? Tune in next time on Harry Potter and the Nightmare Frontier to find out!
