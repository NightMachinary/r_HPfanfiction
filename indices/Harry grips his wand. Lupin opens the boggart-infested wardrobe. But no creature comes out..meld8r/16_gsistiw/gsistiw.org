good prompt! but i think the cupboard would be more of his sanctuary than his greatest fear. He despised it, but at the same time it was the place where he felt the safest. But if I look at it in another way, I can understand why this prompt would make sense. He fears he will be forced back there, and he is afraid of the loneliness and lack of love he will recieve in that household.
