Does Joe have a blog/twitter or something? I thought he did... but anyway I can only hope that it is going to be finished, because that was my main stopgap for not reading wastelands. Joe is such a good writer who I become addicted too, that if their work isnt finished I freak out... and I dont need that trauma in my life.
