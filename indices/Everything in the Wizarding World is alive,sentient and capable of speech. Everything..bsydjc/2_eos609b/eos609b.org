Oh gods. Your bed tells you that you snore. The books attack when you mark or dog-ear the pages. The flore comments on the state of your shoes. Oh gods the underclothes gossiping. “Hey mark how was your day?” ‘Ya it was good. I could not be leave the dirty mouth that lingerie at the pub had.' The wands talking to the other person in a duel. “He really just wants to go home, not fight you” ‘No matter what he says he doesn't hate you. He does yoga on Monday morning.'
