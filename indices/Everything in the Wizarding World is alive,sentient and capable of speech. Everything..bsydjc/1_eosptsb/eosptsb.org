I think legitimately this might be something that happens. It's my headcanon that the mirrors we see speak weren't purposefully made to do that, rather being used by wizards day after day do themselves up rubs off. So one day they speak back and comment on messed hair, or whatever they've learned is wrong with a person.

We've seen this sort of spontaneous awakening with the Weasley's car, and no one treated that as an extraordinary thing. They just accepted that the car was going to live it's life in the woods now.

So it's very reasonable this thing happens with toilets too. I'd think a toilet commenting on the quality of the offering would be a bit less pleasant than a talking mirror. So probably they receive maintenance so that doesn't happen.
