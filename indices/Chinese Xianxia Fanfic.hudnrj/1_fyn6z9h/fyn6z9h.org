Having read some Xianxia and Wuxia novels, I want to point that tropes are VERY heavily used in this genre. To the point that it can be sometimes hard to distinguish novels, since most of them seem to repeat the same scenes with the same outcomes, only changing the name of the characters. Expect arrogant young master, unreasonable old men, plot armor and harem (the kind where the girl lose all substance once she joins the harem, only becoming a yes girl happy to welcome a new "sister" into the fold.

There are some gems in the genre though.
