That's a really good point, thanks for adding the explanation. It actually hasn't been too bad so far (just finished year 1 so no harem), but the MC is alresdy a godly chef winning the British over with delicious Chinese food. Also, he can learn the entire Hogwarts curriculum in a year and half (before first year) because of his good study habits formed as a Chinese student.

I admit part of the reason I've enjoyed it so far is exactly because of the mix of Xianxia tropes and fanfiction cliches. It feels like two genres that can often feel formulaic to me (overpowered Harry and reincarnated as a weak person), got mashed together so now it's something new. For people who haven't read Wuxia or Xianxia, it may just come across as strange.
