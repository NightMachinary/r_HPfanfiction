I've never see dragon ball Z, but that seems like a reasonable description. It was described this way in comments I read about the story, but in the actual story so far there has been no martial arts or internal qi. I would say the reason it falls under kind of the Xianxia umbrella is mainly due to the common tropes and the idea of "weak to strong." Xianxia protagonists typically start out weak and/or disadvantaged, but are "cultivation" (in this case magic) geniuses whose power grows exponentially. They tend to be very obsessed with growing stronger. They remind me of a video game character who constantly levels and then goes into a higher level dungeon were they are still the underdog.

This is probably less of a Xianxia and more of an "oh no I got reincarnated into a novel and have to get stronger to avoid my doom." It's a pretty popular genre, in this case the novel is Harry Potter and the doom is due to MC being a muggleborn.

I enjoyed the voice, some of the fourth walk breaks, and a lot of the commentary, but it's not terribly original for either genre.
