Most people try to update somewhere between 1 or 2 weeks. Slower updates are somewhere between 2 weeks and a month, but those are usually larger (10k+) chapters. Updating every 10 days is perfectly average, your readers are just being greedy.

Update at your own pace and don't let the whining of greedy readers pressure you into writing faster, otherwise you'll just burn yourself out and end up with writer's block.
