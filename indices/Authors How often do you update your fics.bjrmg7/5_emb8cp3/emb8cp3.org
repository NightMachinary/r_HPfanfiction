Your popular fic is much much popular than anything I've written so far haha. But then, I tend to read for a niche audience.

Anyway, that's probably better for them because I'm a highly irregular updates. Sometimes it's days (in the beginning), sometimes months, more often, it's somewhat yearly. Fortunately for me, my readers never tried to pressure me into posting more often.

My minimum length for a chapter is 4K+ words,except for the one-shot collections, but I adjust the length to be around the previous chapters' one. I don't mind going long though: my longest chapter to date is between 10k and 15k words. Actually, I have to consciously force myself not to go overboard because I'm the kind of person who feels like they always have to write more than the previous chapter.
