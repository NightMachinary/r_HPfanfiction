I got halfway through the opening act of a Worm fanfic, and then I wrote a chapter that on re-reading would absolutely not have fit in with what I was trying to do. So I have like 2k words that are coherent and fic-compliant, but somewhat irrelevant to the story, and that just kinda cooked my goose.

I've a HP adventuring/cursebreaking/zombie(maybe? Maybe as 2nd part, after adventuring thing?) thing started, but it's one chapter 2/3 done and then the 2nd chapter half done, and Harry is about to fight his way out of the bank.

There's nothing lost if you just open a google doc and write some words down for your story. I have a bunch of pages that are only the beginnings of ideas, but when I get enough words on 'em that as a reader they'd be worth reading, I'll throw 'em to the winds and see who likes it.
