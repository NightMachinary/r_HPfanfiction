I tried it every day, I tried it every week. Once I left it for a month. I tried mornings, afternoons, evenings, weekdays, weekends. Nothing made the slightest difference: they still didn't get any attention. In the end, I settled for two or three times a week just to get the damn thing out of the way. Those stories, of course, were complete before I started posting.
