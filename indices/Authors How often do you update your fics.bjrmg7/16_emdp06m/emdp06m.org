Between work, home maintenance, family obligations, grandkids' school, and sporting events, and hobbies (Got myself a spiffy 3D Printer that I'm learning to play with) I average 3 chapters a year.

​

My chapters are a minimum of 10k words long, and aren't all for the same story. Some are for an original work that may, or may not ever see the light of day, others are for Technomage, my most popular story, and I also put time into older stories that I haven't finished yet.

​

I am an utterly undisciplined writer. Sometimes I'll go weeks without writing a word, other times, the words just pour out. Sometimes I will take my 10k word chapter and start editing it and end up with three or four scenes of less than 500 words each.
