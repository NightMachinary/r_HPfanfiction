For my bigger stories, I updated every 3 days for each one. One of them averaged 5,140 words per chapter (for a total of 34 chapters), and another averaged 8,770 words per chapter (for a total of 21 chapters). My two smaller stories average 2,200 - 2,440 words for chapter (both were 18 chapters long) and updated every other day. My current story is 9 chapters in and averages 4,600 words per chapter. I began updating it every week but work has been too busy to keep up with that schedule.
