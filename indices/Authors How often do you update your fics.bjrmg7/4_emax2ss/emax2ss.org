When I start a story I experience a burst of energy that usually results in me drafting a large portion of the text, probably around 15 or so chapters. I'll then post these at a rate of one per week.

However, after that initial burst, I find it much harder to write, so it can take me months to get anything else written. So I'll slow to something like a chapter or two ever six months or so. It's not a good system.

Chapters are usually around 4000 words.

Long breaks between posting does decrease readership. After finishing my first story I swore to never post again until the entire fic was finished. I then promptly disregarded that self-given advice when I got that burst of energy for my next story...
