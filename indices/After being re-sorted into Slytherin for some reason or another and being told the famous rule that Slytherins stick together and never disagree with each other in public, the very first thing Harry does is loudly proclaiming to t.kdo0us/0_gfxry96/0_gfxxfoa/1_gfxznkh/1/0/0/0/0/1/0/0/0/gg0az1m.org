we know it was run by borgins and burkes in the 1940's when tommy was young

there was also a borgin working in the 90's

so its most likely a family run bussiness, with the burkes and the borgins running it together.

Considering we know vanishing cabinets where insanely popular during the first war, I wouldnt be surprized if borgin had to repair a few that got damaged before
