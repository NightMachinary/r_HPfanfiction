I suppose it depends on how high his turnover is or whether he can afford for some items to break. The average family run trinket shop probably doesn't maintain items. Perhaps the antique furniture shop does.

I also suspect that many items are not, actually, for sale and instead in a pawn broker situation wherein rich families "sell" their dark objects on the sly and return for them once the risk of raid has gone down.
