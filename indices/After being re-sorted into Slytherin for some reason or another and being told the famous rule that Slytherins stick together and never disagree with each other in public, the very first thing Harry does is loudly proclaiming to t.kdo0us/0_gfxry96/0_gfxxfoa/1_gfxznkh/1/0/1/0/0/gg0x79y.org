It's fanon. People get that from Lucius complaining that Hermione is #1 and beat him, which doesn't mean Draco is #2, simply that he's pissed off that the Muggleborn beat Draco and is #1.

For all we know there's lots of half-bloods and pure-bloods up there. We don't really see many academic Muggleborn other than Hermione.
