Probably? Draco was probably learning as he went and we really don't get much of a notion about how is the technical knowledge of the characters since it would be extremely boring having to waddle though oceans of notes in magical theory between nanoscoptical islands of plot. Botton line is that if Draco was capable of it and there was no mention of him being particularly gifted in it then chances are that his year-mates would have pretty much the same theoretical background.

And actually an argument could be made about Harry and Ron being able to do it faster based on nothing other than a lighter workload (even more so if Harry decides to do what Hermione accused him of and use the HBP book to pass potions without putting any true effort on it).
