I do t know if this is fanon or canon but I've read loads of fics where Draco gets the second best grades in the year, beat by Hermione. It's in so many fics that I figured it might be canon somewhere, or at least lots of authors have got the idea that Draco is academically talented. It would make sense because I imagine his father would have hired tutors before Hogwarts and probably during the summer.
