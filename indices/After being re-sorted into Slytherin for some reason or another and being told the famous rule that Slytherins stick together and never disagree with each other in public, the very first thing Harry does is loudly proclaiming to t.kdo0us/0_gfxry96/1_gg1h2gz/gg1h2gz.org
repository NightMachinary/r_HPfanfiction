And thus the Malfoy had proved his worth, and his role. The Slytherin students present nodded along, though only as much as needed. They didn't speak much, nor did they provide clarification. Instead, they lounged in the shadow of Draco Malfoy, who had just drawn all the attention to himself - and away from them.

It would be puzzling, normally, how a house named Bad Faith rose to prominence and had not,in all its existence tried to change that appellation.

The reason for both would be pretty simple. Each house of Albion provided a good of service which, while not fully monopolized, no one could compete with. It could be reagents, harvested from magical creature farms. It could be potions. It could be enchanted objects if some kind.

The Malfoys provided the image. They played the same role as the Slytherin family used to. They looked guilty as sin, and yet avoided any punishment. Whenever there would be a disputed bill, they would support it. Whenever there would be a novel.idea that threatened status quo, they would drive it to.the ground.

In doing so, they would provide the other families with protection. After all, the Wizarding World had already found their villain.

AKA, Malfoys are professional scapegoats :P
