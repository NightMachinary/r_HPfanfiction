Reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]], where after a series of paranoid assumptions leading to Harry running away, he casts the Fidelius on his identity so nobody can remember the name, appearance, or any other exact details of the Boy-Who-Lived (admittedly that doesn't happen for a good half-dozen chapters, but it is a major component of the fic).

I cannot recommend that fic enough for silly-yet-serious well-written fun.
