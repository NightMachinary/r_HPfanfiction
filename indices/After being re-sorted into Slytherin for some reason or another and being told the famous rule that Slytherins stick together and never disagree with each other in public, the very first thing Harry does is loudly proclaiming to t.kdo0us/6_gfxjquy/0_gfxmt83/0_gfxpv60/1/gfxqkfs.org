Both, but once again due to poor continuity it seems the author forgets about the bloodline curse for half the story.

though also weirdly daphne doesnt also suffer the bloodline curse despite being a sister to astoria and you would expect a bloodline curse to you know affect the bloodline of the one cursed. though giving the wizarding worlds love of inbreeding surely everyone should have said bloodline curse by now
