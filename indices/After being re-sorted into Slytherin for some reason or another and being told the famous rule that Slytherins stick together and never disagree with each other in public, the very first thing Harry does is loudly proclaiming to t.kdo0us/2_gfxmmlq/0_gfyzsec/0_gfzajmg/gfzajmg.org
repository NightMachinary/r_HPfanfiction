when Harry is sorted in Slytherin, Snape always makes a speech about isolationism and unity in front of the rest of the school and solving his problems internally.

And I really can't imagine Slughorn giving an isolationist speech like that when there are so many people to connect opportunely across the school.

In fanfics it looks like a Snape thing
