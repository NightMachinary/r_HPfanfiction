I would actually love to see this happen and instead of Ron and Draco trying to win over Hermione's love, Hermione would have competition in the form of Draco Malfoy to win over Ron, because she secretly understands Malfoy's weird coming onto Ron, while Ron is oblivious with Harry getting angry at Malferret. I hope someone writes this fic or has already written it. And Snape giving a speech like that, I would love to read that.
