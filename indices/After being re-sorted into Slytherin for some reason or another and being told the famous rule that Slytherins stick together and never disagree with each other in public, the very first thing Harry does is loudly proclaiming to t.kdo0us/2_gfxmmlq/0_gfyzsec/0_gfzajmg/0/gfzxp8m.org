Would be funny if Snape decided to follow Slughorn's example and made a grand speech about being social butterflies and making connections with anyone who stand still long enough instead and it turns out that all Slytherin are actually just plainly social awkward and have built a whole set of norms and internal jokes that the rest of the school just didn't understand.

Fex.: Draco was actually looking to mend bridges with the Weasley family by dating Ron, so he did it by showing how much of a catch he really was and how much Ron stood to gain by flaunting his wealthy in comparison with Ron, remarked about Ron's father low political capital while his father could get away with pretty much anything, talked about how he had a connection to Voldemort's side of the war (so as to either be a spy or to protect him) and tried to show how he walked in a more financially and politically more powerful circle of friends by insulting Ron's (since he could find nothing truly good to say about Crabbe or Goyle).
