Maybe everyone does agree in public that Voldemort is not back and that slytherin house is sort of for Voldermort.

But.... behind the scenes voldermort is actually non-public enemy 1. Because he fucked up their house. And the slytherins are working actively against him and their parents. They hate that due to him and every dark lord their house have a bad rep and they want to rectify it.
