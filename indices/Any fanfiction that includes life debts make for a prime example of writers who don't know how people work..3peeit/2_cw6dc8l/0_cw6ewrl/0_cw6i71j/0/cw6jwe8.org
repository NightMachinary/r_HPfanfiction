I think Cho suffers from what I call "Varsity Head Cheerleader Syndrome". She's the older popular attractive girl who seems to have everything going for her and from a distance any guy would find her attractive. Then you finally get to know her and she's not as perfect as she seemed and the image you had of her shatters. Sometimes you find an actually decent person underneath that original image but in Cho's case we found a shallow, overly emotional, gossip that was basically the farthest thing from what Harry needed.
