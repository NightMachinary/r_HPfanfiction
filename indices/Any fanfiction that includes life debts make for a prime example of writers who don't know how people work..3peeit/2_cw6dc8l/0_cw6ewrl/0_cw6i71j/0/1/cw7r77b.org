As someone below pointed out..... turns out it was you. Hmmm, I am going to continue as if it wasn't.

As someone below pointed out, Cho's biggest problem is that her archetype is that of a typical teenage girl. Who just happened to have her boyfriend die at school. There is a lot of potential there, but it takes a really good author to emphasize that something normal can be wonderful as opposed to accenting something that is special already.

This is one of my big issues in writing in general, a lot of stories have a subplot of the main character wanting to just be a normal person, yet they refuse to do normal things or have normal friends. This is especially bad in Harry-Centric fanfiction, don't get me wrong, Harry is special, he needs to do the things he does to survive, but when authors try to make Harry strive for normalcy, they rarely actually have him interact with anyone normal.

Cho would make a wonderful normal girlfriend who Harry is with for a few years, they fight and bicker over dumb things, she doesn't like dealing with all his hero drama, he can't find himself to care about her normal drama. They share sweet tender moments of a quick kiss in the hallways, a study session in the library, a quick pickup game on the pitch. She is a year older so during the 7th year you could have her at work, him at school, or him on the hunt worrying about her. Maybe he visits and puts her family in danger? Maybe the life styles are too different and they break up, to re-unite later when they both are more mature. Or, more likely they fall in love and break up a year or so down the line, maybe they become friends again, maybe not.

Sorry for the rant, my point is that the reason most people dismiss her, is the same reason I think she has a lot of potential.
