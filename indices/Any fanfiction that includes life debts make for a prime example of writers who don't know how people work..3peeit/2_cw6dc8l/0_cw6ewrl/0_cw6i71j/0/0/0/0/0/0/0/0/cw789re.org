I can only speak for myself, but my idea that Lily and Ginny look somewhat alike comes from looking at [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/File:Lily_Potter1.jpg][this]] pic of Lily Potter from the first movie and [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e9/Ginny_Weasley_hbp_promostills_05.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090317022440][this]] of Ginny from when she is supposed to be only a few years younger than Lily was when Harry was born.

They do share a couple of facial features. They have similar chins, similar shade of red hair, very similar blue eyes. . . (blue eyes? stupid lazy directors) and their facial structures are not that dissimilar. She looks more like a sister of Lily Potter than Petunia ever did.
