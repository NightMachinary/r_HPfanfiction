She does deserve a chance but when it comes to characters like Snape/Draco/Voldemort there's either redeeming characteristics for the first two or just a desire to understand how someone could become that evil. With Cho she's just neutrally unlikable. That sounds weird but basically she's just a character who is neither a hero or a villain she's just a normal teenage girl among a cast of abnormal teenagers so there's very little to make her stand out.

Hermione has brains, Ginny has being Ginny, Luna is quirky, Daphne and Susan are barely shown in canon so they're popular girls outside of Gryffindor that the author can shape into what they need them to be. Cho is established as an emotional, slightly shallow, popular girl and that doesn't give the author much to work with.

A good author could probably shape her into a likable character (she did come back in DH to fight at Hogwarts), but a slim minority considers her a good match for Harry. I've seen her written really well in Cedric lived fics because the author usually just leaves her attached to him and lets her grow into a good friend for Harry.
