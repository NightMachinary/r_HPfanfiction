  Then you finally get to know her and she's not as perfect as she seemed and the image you had of her shatters

Very true, it's a possibility. But so many fics turn people around who we know to be patently unpleasant (Snape, Draco, Voldemort even) so why not Cho? It wouldn't take much doing. More popular characters could be cast in a similar light: Daphne could be indifferent, amoral, fence-sitting and opportunist, not someone to confide in, trust or fall for. If so many fics can work around those hefty negative why not work around Cho's snobbishness? EDIT: I just think she deserves more of a chance.
