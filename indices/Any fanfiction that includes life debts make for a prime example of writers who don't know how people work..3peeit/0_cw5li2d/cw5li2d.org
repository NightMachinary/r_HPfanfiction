Depends what you mean by life debt. If taken to mean a serious (but not magically binding) debt of honor in the context of a highly conservative semi-feudalistic patronage-based wizarding society then it can work very well. If taken to mean a magically binding obligation, well there's precedent for that conceptually in the canon magic system (goblet of fire for instance) but I would say it's usually a lazy plot device.
