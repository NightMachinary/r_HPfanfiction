  May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail.

As well as the passage after Wormtail loosens his grip on Harry from Deathly Hallows, Chapter 23:

#+begin_quote
  The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.
