Including life debts in a summary seems rather weird, seeing as they are canon (even if JKR used it in a weird way). Pettigrew owed one to Harry. And seeing that Pettigrew was an honorless traitor, it was most likely magically binding too. Though it's not "dedicated for life", as I remember it, but "until repaid".
