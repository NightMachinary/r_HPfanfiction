If I'm not mistaken, Dumbledore uses the label "wizard's debt." That doesn't imply that you necessarily owe your life to them, nor that you'll lose your life if you fail to honor it. It's just... a debt. Well, it's a /magical/ debt of some sort.

The implication is that magic will somehow move a person to honor the debt. Somehow.

Yeah, pretty vague, I know, but then again that's true about a lot of things in JKR's magic system. And that's a good thing, too, because it gives the rest of us more to write about. So long as you don't fill the concept with something that ridiculously contrary to canon, it still arguably within the boundaries of canon.
