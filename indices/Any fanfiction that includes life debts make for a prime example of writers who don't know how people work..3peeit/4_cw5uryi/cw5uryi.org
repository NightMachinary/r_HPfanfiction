Life debts are an interesting concept if they're magically bonding, and society reacts accordingly- i.e. magic knows when you rigged it, maybe, and only triggers for death that would have definitely happened otherwise. I would also require backing out be an option- it just costs you your magic, or even something less than that. not your children's, just yours, but it does cost you yours. It's not repay them or die, it's repay them or pay the fee. I'd mention somewhere that the malfoy-weasely feud began with a life debt incident, triggered accidentally, or some similar bit of history that could fit in the background, that doesn't ring too far false

They're less interesting if they're part of society that people feel obligated to act on, since that means it's just obligation asking, with less hard feelings, potential for abuse, or resentment.
