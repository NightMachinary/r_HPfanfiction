I don't pretend to understand the appeal either; there's potential in that place, but many a writer just use it to skip from what is a life debt to a soul bond and from there to a lazy attempt at romance that has no actual romance but just people being together because “because”.

But life debts do exist in the original story, and they do make sense in the setting because it's an archaic and secular society that still holds such concepts as “honour” on the pedestal. Is there anything inherently magical in it? Honestly, I do not know; on one hand one could say that yes, there is, because Peter Pettigrew had been stopped by his life debt and Dumbledore calls it a “wizard's debt”; but on the other hand, once such a thing had been a concept so ingrained that even a scoundrel, all but the worst of people, would try to pay a life debt if owed, and Dumbledore too has a tendency to use words that segregate muggles and wizards even if he does try not to.

In any case, it's a one-time thing. For a life saved, one demand, possibly of saving the saver's life, or possibly of obedience of the one being saved. On one's honour, one's self, as a person or as a wizard. That is a life debt.
