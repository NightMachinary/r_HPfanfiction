The author Sinyk from [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] has a couple that fit under this category. Warnings include that they are *very* AU, and very long. They are some of my favorites, and I've re-read them countless times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]]

This second one has over twice the chapters of the first and almost twice the amount of words, but has way more H/DG:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]]

This last one isn't complete yet, but is along the same lines:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons][Harry Potter and the Daft Morons]]

I hope you enjoy!
