Sweet Circe, enough fics there?

Anyway, I'm a bit uncomfortable talking about 'best characters' in the context of fanfiction. Because unless the character is an OC (or so different from canon to effectively be one), the character at least in part belongs to JKR.

We might like what the fanfic's done to change the character, but they're still a distortion of canon. In practice, I find that many of the 'improvements' authors make to a character are simply ironing out important flaws.

With that in mind though, I'd nominate:

- Hermione from linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or). She has very little resemblance to canon Hermione and at times comes across as /too/ good at everything. I've also been unconvinced in her character arc over years 2 and 3. But she's hard-arsed and clever and fun to read.

- Master Petri from linkffn(Blood Crest). A very convincing Scary Necromancer most of the time, he's just enough of a Wise Old Mentor to make us unsure what to think of him. One of the most convincing OCs I've encountered in fanfiction. Rosenkol's great too.

- Tom from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). The author did a very good job here of creating a plausible sane Lord Voldemort. Manipulative, yet still likeable. The characterisation at the start (and for HPAH in general) was /very/ heavy-handed though.

EDIT: How could I forget Alexandra from linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle). She's convincingly flawed and her youthfulness shines throughout the fic.
