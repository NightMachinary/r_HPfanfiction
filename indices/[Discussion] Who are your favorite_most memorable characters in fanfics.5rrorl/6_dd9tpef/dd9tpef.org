This is probably not quite what you're actually asking for because the character has really only a very short appearance and it's almost more about the part she plays than the character itself but I think it still fits and i've never seen it mentioned before despite being so memorable for me.

Tessa in Wastelands of Time. Now, most people probably don't even remember her, hell even Harry didn't remember her until almost the end of the story and she's really not important to the plot but i thought she was the perfect example of how fucked up Harry's life was.

He just tried to be happy for once and he knew it wouldn't work out, he knew Voldemort would come for him eventually, he knew he had a bigger burden to shoulder but he still fell in love with her and she still managed to make him happy despite everything else.

'Her name was Tessa. She was a muggle and she loved me.' Is still my favorite quote from that fic.
