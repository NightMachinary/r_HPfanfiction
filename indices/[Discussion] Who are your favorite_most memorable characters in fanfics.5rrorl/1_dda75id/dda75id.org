Hmm ... well, I guess for me the list begins with +Lord Vol---+Harry Potter in “Seventh Horcrux”. Then there is Harry in “The Shadow of Angmar”, next is Milo in “Harry Potter and the Natural 20”, then Harry the Forest Elf in “Fantastic Elves and Where You Can Find Them” and its sequel. Following it is Petunia Dursley in “the family evans”, and Tom +Riddle+Dumbledore in “Last Chance”. Closing the list are Severus Snape in “Digging for the Bones”, Harry in “Hell Eyes”, and Dudley Dursley in “If I Knew You Were Coming, I'd've Baked a Cake”.

Mostly, it's about the fact that, one way or another, the characters are either funny to read about (the very first one on the list) or get relatively much character development (the rest of them). I like character development.
