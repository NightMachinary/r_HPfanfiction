If we're talking about completely orginal characters, then my vote goes to Christine Hammond from [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's eye, Soul's reflection]], but I have a very limited knowledge of OCs, since that's not usually where I dwell.

But if they can just be interpretations of canon characters then... Cmon. The answer is obviously Harrymort linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes)
