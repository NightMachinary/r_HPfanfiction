I recently added a Percy recommendation post in which I mentioned this fic in but, I will post it here as well because it does /not/ ignore any of Percy's many flaws. It built a story around his pros and limitations in a way that felt very natural and, in the end, made me deeply care for Percy as a character in a way that I hadn't through canon. (Which makes sense, of course, since he isn't truly a part of the main story.) Anyways, it's linkffn(3784000) and I recommend it to anyone who is even slightly curious.
