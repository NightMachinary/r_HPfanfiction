We aren't talking about leaving Teddy behind. Teddy wouldn't be born for another 7 months. And his future depended on the success of Harry, so joining him is the safest way to ensure that he won't grow up in Azkaban or randomly killed. At least until the end of winter, Tonks would be a boon for them. She can always leave if the stakes get too high or if she is too far along to be useful.
