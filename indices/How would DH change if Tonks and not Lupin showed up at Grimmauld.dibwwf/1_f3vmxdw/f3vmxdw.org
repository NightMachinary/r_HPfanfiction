Maybe. If she had lost the baby /and/ broken up with Remus, then they might make use of her or have her along.

But Harry, Ron and Hermione are all still young people who have various close attachments and guilt to their mothers. (Ron who spends a lot of time with his, Hermione who feels guilty about not being closer to hers and what she has done to her, and Harry who had his ripped from him.) I can't see any of them encouraging a young mother to leave her newborn to risk her life when they have already spent months planning to be a three-piece and when they have been a three-piece for the vast majority of the other threats they have faced - and a three piece actively ostracized by the Order adults, at that.
