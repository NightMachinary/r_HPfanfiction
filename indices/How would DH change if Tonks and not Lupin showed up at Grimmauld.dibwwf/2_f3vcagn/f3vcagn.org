I think DH would be almost the same, because I don't think they'd let Tonks come along. Harry already tried to convince Ron and Hermione not to join him at first because he didn't want to put his friends in danger. As useful as having an auror along would be, I doubt Harry could justify endangering a pregnant woman and her unborn child.

If Tonks were to suggest she join the group, Harry would think it was a good idea for a second, and then realize that he was asking a pregnant woman to go on a mission that would likely end in her death. The group would regretfully refuse Tonks' offer of help, and encourage her to go home, knowing full well that they were passing up a valuable resource.

Since Lupin didn't get the chance to get yelled at by Harry, it's reasonably likely that he wouldn't go back to Tonks. The first time they see each other might even be at the Battle of Hogwarts, which now gets additional family drama as Percy returns at the same time.
