I feel like you can easily justify a break with previous doctrine after the horrendous flight from Privet Drive. Their plan betrayed, Moody dead, Dumbledore's plans and judgement proven wrong at least 4 times (Sirius and Pettigrew in 81, keeping Harry dark in 95/6, Malfoy's harmlessness and Snape's loyalty) and the remaining Order useless or neutralised. And Lupin's desertion as a more personal one.

It would be easy to argue for Tonks to join them. Here are just two possible arguments:

"So only you can defeat Voldemort. Alright. But my child's future depends on your success, and I could undoubtedly help you. If you fail, I will still be killed. So the safest thing to do for my child is to join you, as you are the key to my child's future."

"So you want me to go back home and hope that you succeed in your mission? So I shouldn't fight for my child's future but rely on a plan made by a man who was wrong more often than right?"
