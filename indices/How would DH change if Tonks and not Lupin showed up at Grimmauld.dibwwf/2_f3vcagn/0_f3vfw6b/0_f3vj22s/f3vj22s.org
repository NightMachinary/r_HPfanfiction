He knows it's dangerous in Magical Britain at the time. But it's more dangerous to directly associate with him.

Harry wants to protect the people he loves, and to do so he tries to push them away. We see this time and time again. He broke up with Ginny to keep her safe. When he was told the Polyjuice plan, he didn't like it at all and didn't want his friends to risk their lives for him. When he arrived at the Weasley's in DH, he wanted to leave immediately because his very presence was putting them in danger. He initially wanted to go Horcrux hunting alone, because he didn't want to put Ron and Hermione in danger.

  That does not mean that she would leave. What would they do, throw her out of the front door where Death Eaters are waiting?

I highly doubt Tonks wouldn't leave. If she insisted, the group would likely tell her that Dumbledore wanted it that way, that it had to be just them. If Harry said that he needed to do something that Dumbledore ordered him to do, and that Tonks couldn't help, I think Tonks would acquiesce. The Order still greatly trusted Dumbledore's judgement even though he was apparently wrong about Snape.
