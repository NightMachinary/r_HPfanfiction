All good points.

I can counter the Hermione one with the fact that in DH she took her ques from Harry, not even from Dumbledore (Godric's Hollow for instance) so she might be mum on the subject, but I agree your argument has some merit, but I don't think it's enough. Harry was clearly the leader and his viewpoint would be considered the most prevalent (Ron is a non-entity in such matters, as canon basically makes him a non-entity in DH anyway).

Although you have a point, I don't think Hermione's influence would be strong enough to work against Harry's convictions.

Your idea could have merit, if Harry didn't have any relationship to the spawn. If, for example, Tonks came to them in Grimmauld Place and didn't tell them that the child was Remus' (which would remove any emotional attachment Harry could have) then I can believe Harry just comforting Tonks. If he thought that the father of her child didn't want anything to do with it, he might get all-holier-than-though on the issue (as he did with Remus in the DH).
