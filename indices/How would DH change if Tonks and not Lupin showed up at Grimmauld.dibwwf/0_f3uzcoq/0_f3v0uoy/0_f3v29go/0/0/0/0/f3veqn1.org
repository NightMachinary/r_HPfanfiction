Despite all of Remus' shortcomings, Harry still considered him a part of the family, as did Remus. He did name Harry godfather to Teddy after all. So that point is moot. Harry deeply cared about Remus regardless of all his issues.

Hermione is a tricky subject for me, because her depiction in canon is so inconsistent, that I can't get a good read on her. She's the intellectual friend in the first 5 books, completing the traditional trinity trope of the King (Harry), the intellectual (Hermione), and the doer/worker (Ron). How she would behave in the DH is beyond me, she was mostly used to cast spells and not progress the plot.

As to horrible characterizations, yeah. They were. It's like JKR didn't know how to write a war. :D
