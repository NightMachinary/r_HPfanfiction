Which honestly was the biggest flaw of the last book. And the reason the epilogue felt so cheap. There was an organised genocide in which large parts of the Ministry were involved? Malfoy committed countless war crimes? People were hunted down by death squads for their parentage? All was well, take some more Christian themes.
