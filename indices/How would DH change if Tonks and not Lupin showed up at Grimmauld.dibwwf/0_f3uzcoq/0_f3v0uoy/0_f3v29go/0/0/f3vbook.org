It's a bit wishy-washy scenario you paint. Why would Harry believe Tonks, whom he knows very briefly, over Remus who he knows as a good man, even if prone to weakness? I would think he would treat Tonks like Remus, but in a different way:

"So you want you child to raised without a father? Do you think Remus would abandon you truly? Go see him and pour some reason into that thick skull of his! The child deserve both of his parents! I won't let anyone to be left an orphan again!"

Harry's compassion and reasoned logic in DH was so OOC for Harry before that it beggars belief.

Although, as I think about it, yeah. If his arguments didn't work and Remus remained to be a dick, because he was confronted by Tonks and not by Harry, I can see your argument working. But it would require Remus to disavow his child in some way. Which is unlike canon, but possible in the right circumstances.
