Well, if Tonks told the story, that would logically be the picture she would paint. Harry might have been somewhat sympathetic because he could guess that Lupin left because he wanted to protect his child from the werewolf curse (misguided as that was). But if Tonks showed up alone after Lupin has been gone for a week, possibly without even a note, well, that looks a lot different.
