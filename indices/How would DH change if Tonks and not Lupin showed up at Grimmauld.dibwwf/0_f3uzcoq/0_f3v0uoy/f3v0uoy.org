He wasn't the only one around. I can easily see Hermione take charge of the situation since she can be rather pushy and lacks social grace. She also has a vindictive side (eg Marietta) and can be cold as ice (eg Umbridge's fate in the forest and not giving a fuck about her).

Also, Harry reacted very negatively to Lupin's desertion due to the reasons you have stated. He wanted Teddy to have a family. However, if Tonks and not Lupin was there, that might manifest a little differently than what you have predicted because due to his attention on family, he could easily react negatively if he was comforting the other side. He could be very cold at times if he is on the "betrayed" side. He wanted to have Pettigrew kissed by the dementors after all, a fate worse than death and a horrible act to witness.
