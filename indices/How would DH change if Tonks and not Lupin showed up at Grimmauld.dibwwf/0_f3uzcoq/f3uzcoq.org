Hmmm depends. I think you're only looking at it from one point of view and it's not called canon.

Harry in canon was pretty wise by that point, because plot required him to be. He would probably try to talk Tonks into forgiving Remus for his moment of weakness and seek him out, so that they can be proper parents to the little spawn in her belly. Canon-wise it fits. Harry was all about compassion and forgiving faults. Hell, he even saved Draco Malfoy's life while the little shit almost brought the whole war down by following Ron, Hermione and him into the RoR. Just because Draco wanted to be informed and wanted to find out what Harry was doing. There are more examples in the DH that show Harry's immense compassion and frankly insane level of trust, good will and the belief that the best thing in the world is love, especially familial love.

TL;DR If you consider Harry's canon personality, he would most likely try to persuade Tonks to find the father of her baby and make a proper family.
