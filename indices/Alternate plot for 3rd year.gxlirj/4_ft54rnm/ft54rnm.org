Hmm, it's not a very action packed plot but I enjoy seeing an exploration of Harry and Sirius becoming a family. That relationship could also be a starting point for a more academic/inquisitive Harry, now that be has a parental figure to impress and who cares about his school performance.

Maybe Wormtail is still on the run and the Ministry think he will come after Harry, so they still have Dementors at the school.

Not sure where the time turner would come into play, seems a waste to have it be around and not use it in some way.
