Depends on what deviates.

Is Sirius on the run and in contact with Harry piror to book 3? Have the plot be a manhunt for Peter and finding out he's beelining it to Voldemort, with Harry dealing with his desire to leave school and get revenge, same as PoA. Have the seeds of paranoid and weirdness continue from CoS where the school thought he was the heir and his reputation never recovers so the Ministry badmouthing and hatred over the Triwizard tournament have plenty of buildup.

If Sirius isn't involved, explore the issues around Lupin's lycanthropy and the prejudices in the wizarding world by keeping Dobby around instead of disappearing until book 4. Have Harry confront his father's checkered past earlier, have him be confronted by Snape being both a good dude for betraying the DE but also a colossal shithead to Lupin, etc etc

Alternatively, PoA is the first Harry Trains book and he's just come off of a 2nd confrontation with Voldemort that almost killed him. Have him begin training with Dumbledore or with another mentor like Sirius. Maybe even have Harry and co suspicious about the diary and trying to investigate and it's puts them at odds with Dumbledore who has begun to look into the horcruxes again.
