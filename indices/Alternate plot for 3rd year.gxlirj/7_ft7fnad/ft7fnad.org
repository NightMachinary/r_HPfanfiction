If Sirius is free and cleared, that means he can now publicly control the Black family assets. Lucius Malfoy does not approve of this, as he wanted to take those assets for his family once Sirius died in prison. So Malfoy could proceed to do one of the following:

- Hire a group of wizard mercenaries/assassins to take him out, the year is spent foiling increasingly dangerous attempts

- Orchestrate an Azkaban breakout to have them kill Harry and Sirius

- Runs a smear campaign against Sirius, Harry, and Dumbledore, trying to convince Fudge to throw one or more in Azkaban

For all options, he gets found out and has to flee the country, heading to Albania to try and find his master - acknowledging that only by Voldemort conquering Britain would reverse his fall from grace
