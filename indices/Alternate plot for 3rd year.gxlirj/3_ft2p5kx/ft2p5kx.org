Hmm....

- Lucius Malfoy is forced to go on the run because of the Diary fiasco, and eventually assumes Pettigrew's role in the events of /Goblet of Fire/, with Draco trying to get revenge on Harry for getting his dad arrested.

- The Ministry starts interfering with Hogwarts, in response to the mysterious death of Quirrel and the petrifications of students, with the near death of a pureblood at the end of that series events being the last straw. Umbridge doesn't focus on Harry specifically as much as she would have, but focuses more on making muggleborns miserable due to her own bigotry, but has to be more subtle about it, because Dumbledore has a lot more clout than he did at the beginning of Voldemort's second rise.

- The Queen of England sends representatives to visit Hogwarts, because the inspection is long overdue.

- Thanks to poor vaccination rates among muggleborns, a mutated strain of Dragon Pox breaks out, Harry Potter suffering the most due to his poor nutrition at the hands of his family, Snape and Slughorn must work together with a top healer from St. Mungos to save the future of the Wizarding World.
