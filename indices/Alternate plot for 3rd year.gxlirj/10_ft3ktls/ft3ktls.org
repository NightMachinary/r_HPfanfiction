If the events of second year take place as per cannon then it should be obvious to all that Voldemort's supporters are still at large causing trouble.

How about a quest to quietly eliminate them while he hangs around as a wraith in Albania.

Also, if Sirius has been rescued then it is equally apparent that the ministry is at best criminally incompetent and at worst actively malicious.

A similar quest to eliminate troublesome elements from the magical government might make for a good story.

Speaking of Sirius, his stories of Azkaban would paint the place as pretty horrible. Maybe a quest to improve things there.
