Harry pondered. Some smartass in the room past the Great Hall had, upon hearing Mad Eye Moody's suggestion that the Goblet had been Confounded to put Harry's name in, decided to do the same thing to the judges.\\
Their reasons why were unknown (and whoever it was remained unknown), but it had caused Barty Crouch to let slip that the first task involved dragons.

So, now Harry had three weeks to figure out; how was he going to slay a dragon? That's probably what the Task was, that old thing with knights and dragons and chivalry. Though he'd likely only need to knock it out to win.\\
As he pondered, he passed a knightly suit of armor in the corridor...and a plan started to fall into place.

Fred and George helped, of course; they were exceptional at enchanting and they definitely wanted Harry to survive the tournament.\\
Hermione helped too, researching dragon types and what charms would be effective in protecting against them and bringing them down (though she drew the line at dark magic).\\
Even Ron helped, once he knew that Harry was up against dragons, writing to his dad and to Charlie and planning out what muggle and magical weapons and armor to emulate.

The time had come. Three champions had challenged their dragons for a golden egg, and all had walked away in one piece. Now it was Harry, up against the Hungarian Horntail.\\
The tent flap opened...and if Ron and Hermione didn't know it was Harry, he'd be unrecognisable; the boy was clad in a suit of knightly armor, colored in red and gold Gryffindor colors, with a gatling gun, its aged bronze having developed a green patina, shrunken down and stuck to the side of his gauntlet.
