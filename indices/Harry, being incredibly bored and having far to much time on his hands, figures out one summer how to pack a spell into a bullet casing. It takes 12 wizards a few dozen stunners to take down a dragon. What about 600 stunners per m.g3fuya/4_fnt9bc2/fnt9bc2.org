I always imagine that Voldemort's reign would be pretty short if the UK had a magical equivalent to the MI6, Wizards trained in modern tactics with magically enhanced weapons and the option of calling airstrikes.

I mean, how would Death Eaters react to snipers, explosives and automatic fire.

Oh, how would they react against a force who was trained in dealing with counterintelligence and asymmetrical warfare instead of the corrupt Ministry and the woefully unprepared Order of the Phoenix?
