Oh boy, I'd have a great list for you if it wasn't too much. Not sure why, but I've been stuck in an OC loop for years, so almost everything I've favourited is an OC fic.

Top of my head (everything is on FFN) WastelandRose has a ton, there's a series by EmeraldStorm7.

Sorry, I'm new and don't know how to link a bunch of stuff yet, but 99% of my favorites (SparksAdrift) are OC, usually with Marauders or trio.
