  The year before she began Hogwarts, when her mother died and the Malfoys took her in, Ariadne Black thought that things couldn't get much worse. She was wrong. Now one friend hates her because of her house, another is missing at all hours of the night, and her father's a murderer. But at least she has the chance to get some answers, right? Now in Year 3. Sirius daughter AU.
