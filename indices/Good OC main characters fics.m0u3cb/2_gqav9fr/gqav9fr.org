Off the top of my head,

linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House by Belial666) replaces Hermione with an OC who is about as clever but (even) more ruthless.

In most WBWL and Fem!Harry fics, Harry is effectively an OC, so if you can just run a search-and-replace to give the character an original name.
