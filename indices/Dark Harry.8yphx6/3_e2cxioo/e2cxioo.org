Harry Potter was sorted into Slytherin, but he doesn't know his real identity. Neville Longbottom is the Boy Who Lived. It's a short story told through a series of letters delivered by owl and exchanged between Neville and other familiar characters from the series. It won a writing competition on Wattpad a few months ago. It's one of my fics.
