linkffn(The Smart Way by Chris Hill). Agents 86 and 99 are honeymooning at #4 Privet Drive when Harry is dropped off. Cross with Get Smart. All you really need to know is that Max (Agent 86) has been promoted past his level of competence, but is still successful.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alternate Tournament by twistyguru). Cross with several Disney films. Minor slash element (Harry says he likes guys, but that's about all that happens in the story).

linkffn(Agent O by Rorschach's Blot). There's more to Hedwig than is immediately apparent.

linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot). Mass redo.
