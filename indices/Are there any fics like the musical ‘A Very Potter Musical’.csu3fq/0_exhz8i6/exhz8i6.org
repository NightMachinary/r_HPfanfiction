Linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155][Full circle]] by tetsurashian) both have absurdity and extreme character alterations like A Very Potter Musical.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18394745][A Mentor's Burden]] by Naidhe) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16329614][Civil Disobedience]] by Oceanbreeze7) have Voldemorts that are similar to the musical's in that he's sympathetic in a weird way if you really squint.
