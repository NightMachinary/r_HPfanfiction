Same universe:\\
- When someone breaks the rules, *Hermione* turns berserk (looks very similar to Super Sayan transformation) and becoming OP until the rules are restored, while muttering 'Honestly...' under her breath\\
- When *Nevile* feels insecure, he gains a fighting style similar to 'drunken brawler' only his is 'awkward', he is constantly moving in weird patterns while smallest move of his wrist casts the most awkward spell in the worst possible direction, looks like a disco ball from a distance\\
- When *Ron* eats like a pig, anyone who looks at him turns into stone, anyone who hears him talk with a full mouth, become deaf, madame Pompfrey is not amused, since students have nightmares after recovery..\\
Cant think of anything good for Harry
