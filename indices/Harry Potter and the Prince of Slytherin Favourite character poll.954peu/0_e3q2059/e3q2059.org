Lazarus White a.k.a Regulus Black is my favorite. I'll give you some reasons why.

As the DADA Professor he uses ordinary schoolchildren to do a year long project. This not only helps them learn but is actually done for the sole purpose of breaking his brother out of Azkaban. This is genius and something that is deserving of the overused "that was so Slytherin of you". He managed to teach well and use schoolchildren to break someone out of Azkaban.

Fiendfyre in PoS requires you to wish for the destruction of the object of your ire no matter the cost. I love this requirement. Furthermore the culmination of Lazarus's backstory fits it perfectly. His family is killed savagely by werewolves and only then can he summon the hatred, hatred so great that he has no regard for himself or any other, allowing him to cast Fiendfyre.

The way he is able to use Tabula Rasa through a clever little loophole.

His freaking name. Lazarus, from the bible came back to life. White is the opposite of black. Cool little foreshadowing thingy.
