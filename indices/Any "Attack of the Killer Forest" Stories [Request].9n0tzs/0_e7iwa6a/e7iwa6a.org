Please do. I love the Tree-Animating Jinx's existence, and the fact that it's apparently permanent (semicanon suggests that one of the trees later took to wandering the Alps and wrote a bestseller). I have included a nod to it in my story, with one of the protections on the Rinx Horcrux which Dumbledore disabled in canon before we got to se them was that the trees around the Gaunt Shack would come alive and attack you. But it was mostly offscreen due to plot constraints.
