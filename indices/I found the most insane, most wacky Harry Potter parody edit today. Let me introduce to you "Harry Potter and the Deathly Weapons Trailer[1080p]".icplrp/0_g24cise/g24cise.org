The entire movie was remade like that, not juste the trailer. Look a bit and you should be able to find it. It's quite the enjoyable watch, you're just watching Philosopher's stone and suddently there's a gun.

It has also been posted again and again everywhere even remotely Harry Potter related for a week or so.
