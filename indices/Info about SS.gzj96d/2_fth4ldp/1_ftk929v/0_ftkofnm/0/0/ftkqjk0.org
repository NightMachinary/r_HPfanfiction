PoS is not trying to make you side with the DEs it is trying to show how a Slytherin would have fought them instead. PoS never pretends that the DEs aren't monsters. S&S for me failed on two counts it did not explain why Harry decided not only to not support the cause his mother fought and died (for him no less) but instead decided to work for the side that killed her and why Hermione Granger was happily regurgitating DE propaganda slogans.
