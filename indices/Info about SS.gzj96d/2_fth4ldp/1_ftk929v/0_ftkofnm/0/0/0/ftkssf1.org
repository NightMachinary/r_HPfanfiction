Yes. Like I said. The point is for Harry to /not/ fight Death Eaters. That's literally the premise of the trope and the entire and only reason to do the "Harry gets abandoned" nonsense to begin with. Asking why the story does this is like asking why Harry doesn't get involved with Hermione in a H/G story. It'd not be /that story/.

Of course, in the case of S&S the other side is so braindead that any reasonable person would fight them, but rolling your eyes at dumb "light side" (terrible moniker) wizards is still more fun than whatever PoS tries to do.
