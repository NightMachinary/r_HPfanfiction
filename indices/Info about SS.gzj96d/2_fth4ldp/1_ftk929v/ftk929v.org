I like Prince better too. James and Dumbledore in S&S were one dimensional villians, which I'm not a fan of. In Prince they at least had some explanation for their actions and were a bit more developed than mustache twirling villians. And IIRC the Slytherin/Pureblood wanking was significantly stronger in A&S than it was in Prince.
