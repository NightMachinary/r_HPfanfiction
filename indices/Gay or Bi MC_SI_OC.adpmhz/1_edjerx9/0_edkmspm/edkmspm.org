The problem is a matter of statistics. I've heard it reported that upward of 10% of the gen pop is non-straight, but I'm not sure those statistics are really reliable, and I've heard it reported elsewhere that the value might be as low as 1%. Personally I don't think anyone is actually 100% straight, finding true zero on the Kinsey scale would seem somewhat unlikely, but sexuality is an evolving thing which is different for every person. I like to think that in a few more decades we will have moved past really caring about a person's orientation, that it will become a secondary detail like what their favorite magic class is. As of now, I think M/M pairings are probably over represented, partly because of the glut of male characters in Harry Potter, and partly because maybe people are trying to over compensate for the previous cultural lack of gay ships? The problem likely stems more from the former though, because it means we get gay characters only in the context of Draco/Harry or Snape/Lucius or whatever. The characters might actually be gay, but maybe they are just being used to explore a particular ship (which is fine but not what I'd prefer) rather than being genuinely gay and then being set free in the context of the story to date whoever the course of events would naturally push them towards. Idk, maybe that's just bias from my own story writing method coming through.

I look forward to reading your story when you write it!
