  Bitch have you ever talked to a woman? I straight up asked two of my female friends whether they would prefer length or girth over christmas. You know what they said? 'Neither'. Taking something too large inside your body is uncomfortable and not everyone is down for that. You know who do sometimes actually like really massive dongs? Quite a lot of gay men.

If you want a gay Harry, have fun, you just need to ask. You don't have to invent bizarre statistics.
