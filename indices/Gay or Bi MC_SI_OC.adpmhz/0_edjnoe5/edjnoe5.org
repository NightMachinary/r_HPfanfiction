Only thing that comes to mind is linkffn(Second String), according to what I've read on this sub it's well-written and slash is planned later. The OC I've posted about is also gay, but it's unlikely to have any relevance (maybe possibly a bit at the end, but I definitely don't plan on fully tackling romance.)
