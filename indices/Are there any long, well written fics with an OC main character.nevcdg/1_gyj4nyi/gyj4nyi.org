Well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is technically Harry in name, but so different that she's effectively an original character. She's a careful planner and a natural academic, who is singlemindedly passionate about brewing potions, raised by both her parents, with Sirius and Remus being "uncles", and Sirius' son being as close as a brother. There was no war and there's no prophecy about her. However, since Tom Riddle went into politics instead, she faces legalised discrimination that canon Harry never did.

Book four recently finished, bringing the series to over 1.4 million words; book five is starting later this year. The plot is very clever about introducing canon-inspired elements taken in a whole new direction (eg the first flying lesson is significant for quite different reasons), expanding and explaining canon ideas (eg the Boggart in Defence class is used not just to teach the students how to deal with a Boggart, but how to deal with fear in general), while very much telling its own story rather than any kind of rehash.
