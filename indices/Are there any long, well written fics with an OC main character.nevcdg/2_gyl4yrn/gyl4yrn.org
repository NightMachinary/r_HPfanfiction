linkao3(Seven Devils by please_dont)

Not sure if you're into Tom Riddle fics but this one is my fave OC fic!! The main character is a Muggle from our modern time who has knowledge of the books and gets thrown into the HP world just before Harry starts at Hogwarts. Her main goal is to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes before he comes to power and she thinks they can use Tom Riddles diary for it.

It's a really slow build up to romance, I thought there wasn't even going to be any for a while but when it comes it's really good. Most of the focus is on the plot! I like that the main character doesn't try to change every little thing, she knows things and knows what to keep to herself and what to share. Also she doesn't have magic but is still badass I thought her character was awesome. Highly recommend!! It is a Tom redemption fic so he's not a psycho killer playing mind games, if that changes your opinion!
