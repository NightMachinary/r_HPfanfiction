Now I'm curious how many fics, if any, feature a spaghetti scene in a human ship lol (I've read one that had something spaghetti related but it was only one person, in Larceny Lechery and Luna Lovegood the titular character slurps an entire plate of spaghetti as a single noodle cause shut up with innuendo about swallowing)
