Right /cracks knuckles/

Mrs. Norris heard the Bark and her ears turned and twisted as she took it in. Dogs often forgot that cats too could understand their little system.

A human kit needed protection? The kit of the not-dog she had never liked all that much? The kit was coming to Hogwarts? His colony had been betrayed?

Mrs. Norris decided to keep an eye on things.

Weeks later, she had found the kit and was dismayed; he was sickly, skinny, and skittish like one of the strays that were kicked often.

Eavesdropping and questioning other cats, she learned the kit's history and was horrified.

This would not do. Mrs. Norris may have not particularly cared for the human kits that lived in her home, because they were loud and smelly and often mean, but even she was worried about this particular kit.

She made a decision; her servant was rather busy so she slunk out easily.

She knew the castle better than anyone else, save perhaps the elves, and so knew which twisting ways she needed to find who she was looking for.

In a little cranny, barely big enough to fit Mrs. Norris herself, she found Agnes.

“Mrs. Norris!” the little mouse squeaked, having been cleaning her little nest.

“Agnes,” Mrs. Norris greeted, “I need you to send a message. A human child is in danger. The dogs are doing their best, but I do believe they need relief.”

Agnes blinked but then nodded grimly, quickly scurrying to where she kept her stockpile of parchment pieces and almost empty ink pots.

Dipping a toe into the ink, Agnes quickly wrote out what Mrs. Norris could tell her. Orphaned boy, Harry, abused, family betrayed, guardian gone. Wizard, Hogwarts, Scotland. Dogs on case. Norris requesting back up.

Agnes rolled up her missive, grabbed a bit of twine, and headed up to the Owlery.

“Richard! Richard!” she hopped around, waving her arms at the non-descript Barn Owl.

“Agnes?” he swooped down, “Whatever is the matter?”

“Business, I'm afraid,” Agnes replied shortly, scurrying forward to attach the missive to the owl's leg, “To the station in London, if you'd please.”

“One of the owlets in danger, then?” Richard asked, voice grave.

“Yes. The poor boy needs help.”

“Of course,” with that, Richard took wing.

Within hours he was arriving in London, circling then landing in the ledges of Parliament.

“Richard?” the attendant came up.

“News from Hogwarts, Jacob,” Richard held out the leg with the missive.

The mouse, Jacob, untied it, unrolled it, and read it quickly, growing serious, “We'll send it on.”

Jacob turned and ran, into the building and down into his station, rousing his team.

It was easier now, than it had once been, they had computers, the humans, and those could send messages within seconds.

Jacob and his crew found an unused computer and began transmitting, jumping on keys and pushing around the mouse.

From there it was a direct shot to New York City, instead of it being a relay.

The attendant there took the message and raised the alarm, recalling all agents available.

The RAS was on the case.
