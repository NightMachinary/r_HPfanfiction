Yup! I can 100% see Fang being not only a bit of an old man about things, but also knowing what Fluffy was talking about. Dogs have this amazing ability to remember us, no matter how long it's been since they've seen us last. I know several dogs whom I've met through the years, who will get so happy to see me again when I come back to visit. Dogs are too good for this world.
