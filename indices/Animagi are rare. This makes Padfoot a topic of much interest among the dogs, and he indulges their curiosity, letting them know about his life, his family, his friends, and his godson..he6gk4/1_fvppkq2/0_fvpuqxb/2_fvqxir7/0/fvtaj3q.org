For you? Sure.

Fluffy, as they were known, was rather smart for a dog, perhaps not border collie or poodle smart but there was something to be said about how three heads were better than one.

They knew that they could not be guarding the pup themselves, humans were rather timid creatures after all, however, they had a plan.

Once done reporting in that they, the Get of Cerberus themselves, were at the place called Hogwarts and had the pup safely in paw, they called out again.

The dog known as Fang was sleeping in front of the fireplace when the great voices woke him up.

Padfoot's pup at Hogwarts. Find and protect.

Fang vaguely remembered Padfoot, the strange not-dog who was a dog too, though he had been just a pup himself last time they had met.

Lazily, Fang got up, taking the time to stretch even as he listened. He did not like the strange multi-headed dog calling to him, Fang after all was a coward and could admit it, but one did not ignore the requests of the Get of Cerberus.

"Goin' out, boy?" Hagrid asked as Fang made his way to the door and left.

A decent ways away from the hut, Fang stopped, sat down, and responded: Fang, reporting in. What's going on?

Padfoot's pup at Hogwarts. Pack betrayed. Padfoot taken. Find and protect. Skinny, pale, male human pup, messy head-fur, wears circles on his face. Smells of our kind.

Fang cocked his head, suddenly vaguely remembering the human child Hagrid brought home a long time ago. It went away again soon after and Hagrid had been sad. A some time ago, however, Hagrid had been happy, making a treat that was 'fer little Harry'.

Fang responded: Will find pup and protect.

Little did they know someone else was listening in.
