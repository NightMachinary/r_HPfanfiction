The dogs of Private Drive hear the word: a pup is missing, find and protect.

It takes a while for them to connect the missing pup to the human child but a collie finally pieces it together.

The pup is found.

Harry grows up accompanied by at least one dog at all times; Dudley and his little gang dares not touch him. The bad dogs get scared off.

The dogs help as much as they can, the smarter ones, the strays, even stealing food for the sickly pup under their care.

Harry leaves Private Drive for Hogwarts and another Bark goes up: the pup is on the move, to some place called Hogwarts. Find and protect.

In the Forbidden Forest a beast slumbers; six eyes wake and six ears prick up: a pup is coming to Hogwarts, find and protect.

The creature called "Fluffy" lumbers to their paws and responds, baying with three throats and three voices that boom, echoing: Get of Cerberus, Hogwarts. Pup is found and protected.
