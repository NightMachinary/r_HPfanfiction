It started in the Forbidden Forest.\\
On their monthly forays with Remus, the Marauders encountered the forest's wolf pack more than once. Intelligent enough to understand humans and dogs, they taught Sirius Black how to see the world through canine eyes.\\
 \\
Then it continued in Hogsmeade.\\
Many purebloods kept dogs as a status symbol, other witches and wizards kept them for company in the dark days of Voldemort. From these canines, Sirius learned the common Lycantongue, the magical language that was as to canines as Parseltongue was to snakes.\\
 \\
It traveled throughout Britain.\\
With Lycantongue, Padfoot tapped into a wellspring of wisdom. The numerous dogs around the country, muggle and magical, could tell of disturbances to their day, their keen noses covert spies that could tell Sirius the movements of the Death Eaters no matter where they went.\\
 \\
It ended in London.\\
Pettigrew betrayed the Potters, canines bearing witness to his presence alongside Voldemort in Godric's Hollow. With a description of a rat and a rat-like man, Sirius circled Britain, until he came to a dog that spotted Peter.\\
 \\
Sirius Black was wrongfully imprisoned in Azkaban, but he had left an impression on the dogs of Britain. Word spread far and wide of his capture, though no dog could report his location.\\
But, the news found its way into crup ears, magical dogs who understood human affairs, and they spread new word; Padfoot has been taken away. A pup of his pack survived the dark wizard. Find him and protect him.
