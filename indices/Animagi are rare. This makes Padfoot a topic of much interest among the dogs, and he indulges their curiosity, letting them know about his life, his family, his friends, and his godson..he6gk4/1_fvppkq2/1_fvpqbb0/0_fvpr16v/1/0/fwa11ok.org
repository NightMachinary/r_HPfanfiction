Albus Dumbledore was expecting a humble, meek child. One who had grown up happily with his mother's family, away from magic and the unwanted influences of the British magical Ministry.

What he got was a steel helmet wearing, hulking boy with a loud, boisterous voice, riding what seemed to be a mix between a Rhinoceros and a hercules beetle and communicating with the various magical creatures surrounding Hogwards....

A surprise indeed. But, he decided as he watched the eleven year old anomaly laugh at the barking of a nearby owl, not an unpleasant one.
