Damn. That sounds awesome. I'm imagining Ripper being bullied by all the other dogs in the dog park and chased away after he chased Harry up a tree.

ETA: this is why Fang goes with Harry and Ron into the Forbidden Forest even though he's terrified of going in without Hagrid. Crookshanks knows all about how Sirius has had dogs watching over Harry and deigns to help since there aren't any dogs in Hogwarts, except Fang who is still traumatized from watching over him for the first two years.
