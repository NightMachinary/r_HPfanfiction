It's sad that we lose the story but that's ultimately the author's decision, it doesn't belong to us, it belongs to the author. It's not up to us to preserve it on the nets against the author's consent and expressed wishes.

Edit: I'm reacting to the 'once you upload it thats that' train of thought, not the situation where it was accidentally removed
