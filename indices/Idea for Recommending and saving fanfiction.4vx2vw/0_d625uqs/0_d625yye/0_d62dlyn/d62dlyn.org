This is a dickish way to look at it. "CUZ I WANTS" isn't a good reason to have everything ever. If the author takes a story down, have the respect for the creator of the story you like so much and don't deliberately go against them. It's the same with "continuing" or "adopting" stories that are abandoned by authors for whatever reason. It's their prerogative to chuck it into the trash. It's something they did for free and gave away for free. If you don't have permission from the author, whether because they refused or can't be reached, swallow your sad feels and leave it be. Don't be an ass.
