  My view on it is that if some one writes a free story and then uploads it online, that's that. Once it's out there, it's out there.

You may be conflating gratis with libre. These stories carry no cost for the reader, but being gratis doesn't give readers free rein to do whatever they want with them, not unless they were released under the appropriate license, eg a CC license. Better to get permission before sharing.
