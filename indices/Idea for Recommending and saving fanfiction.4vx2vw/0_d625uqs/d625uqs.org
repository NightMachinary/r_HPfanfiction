I like the idea somewhat but don't see how feasible it could be.

Also, a lot of people hold on to copies of deleted fics because authors deliberately took them down. The authors chose to take them down for a reason. Sending out attachments through e-mail is one thing, I don't think publicly uploading them is a good idea.
