I read it long time ago but as far as I can remember, I think its fair to say, The Merging is in its own league in some aspects.

The Merging is unique in its own way. Here's few stories, that are unique on it's own way(I guess you have already read some of the list):

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«)

Linkffn(Building Bridges by Melethril)

Linkffn(A Riddled Universe)

Linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm)

Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth)

Linkffn(A Shadowed Soul by devilblondie)

Totally different type but I like this one for it's analysis of mind magic: Linkffn(Give It Your Best Shot by Zenathea)
