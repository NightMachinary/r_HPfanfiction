Highest quality non-crack fics I've read that aren't one-shots? I'm also leaving out abandoned fics:

Hogwarts Houses Divided (fun, lighthearted, recaptures the feel of books 1-3)

Elizium for the Sleepless Souls (Superb thriller where Harry is sent to Azkaban and has to escape)

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (Fantastic world-building and plotting, where the author takes a bunch of common fanfic cliches and works them into a quality story)

I have a bunch of thrillers and other fics that I like, but the above three are imo top quality.
