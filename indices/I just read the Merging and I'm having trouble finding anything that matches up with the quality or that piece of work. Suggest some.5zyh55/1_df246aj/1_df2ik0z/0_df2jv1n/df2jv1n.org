So these aren't Pullitzer-prize worthy, but they're still really good:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Dreams and Memories]]. A 3-part canon-compliant series featuring Harry coming to terms with the Dudley and Snape. Really good plotting, but loses points because two of the scenes are kind of headscratchers.

The Accidental Animagus - Harry accidentally becomes an animagus as a kid and runs away from the Dursleys to be adopted by Hermione's family. The world-building and antagonists are actually pretty good, but loses points because I dislike several of the characterizations (I really dislike the Grangers and Luna), as well as the beginning.

Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them - Harry raises himself in the woods and gets up to various hijinks. Docked points for sub-par sequels as weird as a poor beginning.
