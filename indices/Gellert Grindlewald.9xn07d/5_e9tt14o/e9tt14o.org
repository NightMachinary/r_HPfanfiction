My personal headcanon for him is that he had some ties to the Lithuanian nobility and went to Britain to find some supporters against the Tsar. He met both, Adrianna, with whom he fell in love, and Dumbledore, whom he led on because he would be a useful tool. Albus finds out, they duel, in the end his love lies dead on the ground and Gellert knows whom to blame. Sadly, the British public believes Dumbledore and so Grindelwald has to run, swearing revenge.

So when the German Empire kicks the Russians out of East Prussia (Battles of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes) Gellert sees an opportunity. He makes common cause with the Kaiser and supplies the imperial army with some enchanted gear, Veritasserum and so on. In return, he is supposed to be head of state of Lithuania after Brest-Litovsk, but Versailles removes German influence over the Baltics and therefore Grindelwald does not get "his birthright". So he continues to work in the shadows until there is war again. Bitter over Versailles, he decides to settle an old score with the British and exchanges magic for a few V1/2s and the rights to Lithuania (which historical borders include a lot of Eastern Europe). The V program gets some magic homing heads and quite a few of the "misses" actually hit hidden magical houses. The Soviets win the war, wear down his followers over years of combat and Dumbledore swoops in to finish him.

So you have a freedom fighter who eventually grew into a warmongering monster who wanted to rule a third of Europe (everything East of the Third Reich).
