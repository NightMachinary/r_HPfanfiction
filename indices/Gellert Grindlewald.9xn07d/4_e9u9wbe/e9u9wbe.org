I generally think of Grindelwald as a Robespierre-like figure. Highly polarizing but immensely influential, vilified for his brutality but occasionally praised as a revolutionary figure. I pit him against the magical aristocracy on the Continent, leading a political movement which essentially slaughtered the ruling class of Germany and France, with a general backdrop of muggle hatred that was held back until he saw an exploitable opportunity in WWII. This answers some of the questions about why Dumbledore would wait so long to intervene---if he generally agreed with Grindelwald's goals (reducing the power of an oppressive aristocracy), if not his methods, he might have seen fit to let the foreign nations handle their own situation. However, I think Grindelwald would have seen the atrocities of the war as an excuse to start a rallying cry around the abolishment of the Statute of Secrecy, which Dumbledore absolutely /could not/ allow to happen as it would lead to the collapse of the magical world as he knew it. So he went to Grindelwald, defeated him, and imprisoned him for life.

In terms of long term impact, that sort of true purging of a class cannot be ignored, and would have led to more stable changes in continental magical society. In addition, I think it provides a compelling origin story for Tom Riddle. A highly intelligent sociopathic boy who hates muggles and is seeking power might see the outline of Grindelwalds's plan and twist it to better fit the situation in Britain. So he backs the ruling class rather than the oppressed and scales back on the anti-Muggle views that threaten the Statute, replacing it with anti-Muggleborn discrimination. It turns an already brutal political position into outright dystopian bigotry, of course, but he genuinely doesn't care about anything but his own power.
