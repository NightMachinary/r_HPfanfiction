[mild(?) spoiler] My biggest issue with the movie was its portrayal of Grindelwald. I also like the version of him where he's self righteous and truly believes in his goal and sees himself as a hero and savior (which also makes his fallout with Dumbley a lil more compelling and believable) but in the movie he just seemed plain evil. A lot of the things he did in the movie were just to make him seem like the bad guy instead of showing him contributing to “the greater good.”
