In the movie, it's debatable how much he truly believes in these ideas, but he does preach that it's their purpose and destiny to rule. He argues that wizards are just born with that something extra. He relies on prophecy to get through to his followers. He preaches that wizards should stick together and criticizes aurors for killing their own. There doesn't seem to be any concern with blood purity. The only other wizards he singles out are aurors and the ministry, framing them as the aggressors and oppressors. I didn't see him interacting with magical humanoids.
