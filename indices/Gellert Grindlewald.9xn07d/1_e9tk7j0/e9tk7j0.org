In my headcanon, Grindelwald, unlike Voldemort, sincerely sees himself as a hero.

As for his motivation... he is as similar to a religious zealot as it gets in the Wizarding World, in my view. There are many theories about where magic comes from, and a prevalent one is that it's a gift given to the Chosen (the wizards) by God/the Gods/Mother Earth/the Flying Spaghetti Monster/whatever. Grindelwald buys it, and considers it is magicals'' bithright to rule over non-magicals, not because of "might makes right" per se, but because it is their purpose and destiny in the world. He's big on destiny and Prophecy and things like that (and secretly upset that there /wasn't/ a big Prophecy made about him and Albus to foretell their duel).

He personally does not believe in blood-purity, but he has a number blood-purists (mostly "moderate" blood-purists, the sort who don't want to kill Muggle-borns and are fine with Half-Bloods, but still thinks pure-bloods are "better") in his entourage, because "magic makes you superior! Muggles were born to be inferior to us!" is naturally an idea that appels to blood-purist-types, and he's not going to turn away free support. However, he also recruits among those Muggle-raised who grew up with reason to dislike Muggles (Obscurial or not, someone like Credence would always have been a target for him, and that goes regardless of blood status).

He is also very accepting of magical nonhumans, though if pressed he'd still admit that wizards should be at the top level of the hierarchy in his ideal utopia. He believes in the widespread (but not entirely proven) theory that magical humanoids are all offshoots of wizardkind, whose magic mutated them, Lamarck-style, over the generations. For this reason, his army also include great support from rebellious Goblins and so on, who don't necessarily believe in his "magic is superior" ideology but consider he is their best shot at getting more power over wizards.
