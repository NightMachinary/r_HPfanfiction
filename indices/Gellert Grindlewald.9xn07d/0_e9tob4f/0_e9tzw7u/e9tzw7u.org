SPOILERS for CoG: the OP mentions it but just in case.

. . .

Isn't that essentially what Grindelwald is in the movies? He's pro-wizard. He has followers who are into blood purity, but he doesn't focus on it. It's wizards vs muggles for him. He criticizes aurors for striking down their own kind. He uses prophetic visions of WW2 to show wizards how cruel and dangerous they are. His ultimate goal is to rule over muggles. He's charismatic and ruthless and he has everyone following the path he lays out for them.
