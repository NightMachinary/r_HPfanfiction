I haven't seen the movie that just came out, but judging by /Fantastic Beasts/ he lacks charisma, acting more like a transparently conniving Disney villain. If he actually had strong wizard vs. muggle beliefs then he would have been more sympathetic about the abuse Credence suffered from muggles rather than just wanting to use him as a weapon. Grindelwald comes across as deranged in the end of that movie.
