Personally I prefer the Grindelwald I've seen in fanfiction before the movies came out.

The fics I like portray him as pro-wizard and anti-muggle, without any of the blood purity nonsense of Voldemort's followers. In those fics Grindelwald's followers included muggleborns, halfbloods and purebloods and were brutal against their opposition regardless of blood status.

This works well in my opinion, because it differentiates the two figures and shows how Voldemort's beliefs developed as a warped ideology that twisted Grindelwald's original "For the Greater Good" goal. Voldemort's campaign was built from the horror of living through WWII and was supported by the remnants of extremism that were left after Grindelwald's campaign failed. Both Dark Wizards grew up in different time periods with different political realities that shaped them, so their beliefs should not be carbon copies of each other.

In the fics I've enjoyed, Grindelwald used the Nazi movement in Germany for several reasons:

- The violence of the muggle war provided a smokescreen for his followers' attacks on muggle and wizarding locations, thus maintaining a false sense of security for the rest of wizarding Europe until it was almost too late.

- The extreme destruction and loss of life from the muggle war would cause more wizards to start viewing muggles as dangerous, thus weakening the nonintervention stance of those who support the Statute of Secrecy.

- Grindelwald's ultimate goal was to have wizards reign supreme over muggles, but this is hampered by the fact that muggles vastly outnumber wizards. Thus, the 'final solution' enacted by the Nazis was a convenient way to decrease the muggle population.

My favorite portrayal of Grindelwald is in the fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]]. In that fic he is charismatic, ruthless and driven, with schemes conducted behind the scenes that history would never learn of.
