In my personal headcanon, his central beliefs are of a meritocratic nature while absolutely putting magic above non-magic, pretty much without exceptions. So differently from Voldemort, who basically allied himself with the strongest faction, Grindelwald's followers are way more diversive and also extend into the non-human range with less prejudice than the purebloods showed. I'd assume he'd strive to sign contracts similar to the one with the goblins, such as vampires given free hunting rights in certain (muggle-only) areas in exchange for not daring to attack magical folk. Throw in a difference in taste between magical and mundane blood and you already have the beginnings of another kind of conflict going.

In fact, he would probably be way more at odds with the rich and powerful than with your average muggleborn. If Voldemort basically attempted a hostile takeover from the higher echelons, Grindelwald is closer to a revolution from the ‘normal' people. Building on this, I see the rest of Europe as having less problems with pureblood-thinking: a lot of them either stood against him and were eliminated or agreed with him and fell from power after 1945. On the other hand, he could offer the muggleborns (and halfbloods, to a degree) a vision of a world where they truly belonged instead of being tolerated and where they could achieve things based upon their own performance instead of the position of their parents.

Personally, I don't like the scenario with Grindelwald as the puppeteer behind the whole WW II, or even behind Nazi Germany. I don't think anyone could've orchestrated the whole chain of events in such a way. (I'm kind of split about him having contact with Hitler. The Nazis were found to be quite invested in occultism and celtic artefacts, and together with Grindelwald looking kind of Aryan, doing something here is possible) He did, however, certainly know how to use it to his advantages. The Nazis were famous for rounding up dissidents and I'm fairly sure Grindelwald would've used the guise of concentration camps to get rid of his own enemies and blame it on the ‘terrible, brutal muggles in need of guidance'. On the other hand, it's also a personal headcanon of mine that France did fall as quickly as it did because of magical sabotage, causing the chaos of war to spread much quicker. Basically he wants to create a magical utopia, would then point to the violence in the muggle world and use this as a justification to rise over muggles and rule over them.

As for him as person: I kinda always imagined Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald as three parts of how you'd imagine some sort of fantasy wizard-king. Voldemort stands for raw power. Engaging in the equivalence of magical arm wrestling with him would always end in his victory, but he kinda sacrificed diversity and reason for that. Dumbledore stands for skill, he is in a sense ‘the best' in magic and since knowledge seems to translate into power quite easily in this universe, he's also the one who would win most actual fights. He is, in my opinion at least, however not that great at being a leader and far more suited to a life as a scholar -- even if he wasn't allowed to be. Grindelwald would, even while still standing far above most other wizards and witches, lose to both in a direct fight, but he mainly stands for charisma. He'd be the one with a silver tongue, the one who prefers gaining devoted allies over fearful obedience. His power lies less in his personal strength than the number and cooperation of his followers.

This kinda became a rant, but I'm on mobile and my station is coming up
