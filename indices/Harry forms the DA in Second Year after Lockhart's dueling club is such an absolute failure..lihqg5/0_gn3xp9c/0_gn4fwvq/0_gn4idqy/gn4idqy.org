It's a bit of a wild ride to try to find. The author had really serious medical issues for years, then came back out of nowhere with chapter 43, then the whole story was removed from ffn because of a fake copyright claim. His website says it's being re-edited and uploaded to royalroad chapter-by-chapter, but the original can be found up to chapter 38 [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/3365/][here]]. It's cut off partway through the last arc of year three, though. The original chapter 42 ended with the opening feast of GoF.
