Initially, the Twins, who are 4th years ( and who are far more intelligent than their reputation would indicate), would provide the backbone. 2 years of magical education makes a major difference. Also, just picking up a copy of "Standard Book of Spells" and saying "Hey, this spell seems pretty useful. Why don't we try to learn it?". Additionally, once Harry really put the hammer down on training in 4th year in preparing for the final challenge, it only takes him a couple of months for him to be able to both survive the Maze (albeit with assistance from Crouch Jn) and to escape pursuing Death Eaters while Voldemort was distracted. I don't see why that wouldn't hold true in 2nd year on a smaller scale.
