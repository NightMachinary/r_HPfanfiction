There was a Hermione/Snape fic I read a while back where Hermione ends up making a bunch of potions to market to muggles and renting out a huge warehouse for production, but she's overwhelmed by the orders so she brings Snape in to help her out. He freaks out and explains to her why what she's doing is a horrible idea. I tried to look for it but I couldn't find it, maybe if it's something you're interested in you'll have better luck?
