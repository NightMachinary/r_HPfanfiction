The Firebird Tiology : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]

It takes divination a lot seriously but it is REALLY different from HP canon , inherent elemental magic / non-soul bonds and magicals are genetically different from muggles.

If you have enought suspension of disbelief and you like non-canon world-settings it's really good.

Ps: Harry&Luna are seers , divination is an actually respectable and good subject.
