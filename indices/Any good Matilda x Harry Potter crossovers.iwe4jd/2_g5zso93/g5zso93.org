Professor McGonagall Delivers A Letter: Exactly what it says on the tin. A quite cute one-shot where Professor McG goes to deliver Matilda's Hogwarts letter.

Matilda Wormwood and the Forbidden Forest: A more "full-bodied" crossover about Matilda going to Hogwarts around the time of Harry's third year. Unfinished as yet, but last updated within this month so at least it's not abandoned.
