Book or Movie? There isn't much difference between the two when it comes to Matilda but there is some difference. Such as, when Miss Trunchbull runs out of town and Matilda lives with Miss Honey, she looses her abilities due to advancing to a much higher grade, thus taking up all her focus. Personally, I find this explanation as something rather impossible. She was self studying at home and training her power, so she obviously should still be able to if it became her main source of study.

Thoughts?
