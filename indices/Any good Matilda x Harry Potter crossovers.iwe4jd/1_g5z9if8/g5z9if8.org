Never seen one before but now you've caught my interest. In which way do you mean crossover? Is Matilda a witch that goes to hogwarts or simply meets Harry while they are little and they discover their powers together? Or possibly Harry developing similar telekinetic powers as her? maybe a reincarnation or possible a dream/mental connection to one another to help each other cope with their individual issues?
