Definitely hoped she was more bubbly and she didn't really look remotely like what I imagined Tonks to be but mainly it's because she just overacts in everything she's in. That Mandalorian episode she was in basically summed up my issues with her acting, I just can't believe that there wasn't someone better for the role.

Obviously not from the UK but Mary Elizabeth Winstead would've been a much better Tonks.
