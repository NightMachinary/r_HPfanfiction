You're right, that super-specific accusation hasn't come up but the 'Harry gets mad at being bait or being left out of the loop' is something that pops up in every other fic.

I also wasn't saying the premise was bad just common and that like you said 90% of fics that try it are just filled with out of character writing, edginess and foreknowledge of the other books. I'd be interested in seeing someone actually pull it off.
