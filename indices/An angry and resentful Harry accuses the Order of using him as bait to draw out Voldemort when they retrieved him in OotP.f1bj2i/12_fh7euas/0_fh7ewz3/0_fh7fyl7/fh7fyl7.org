  Apparition can be traced by Aurors and Unspeakables. Since Voldemort has infiltrated the ministry, we couldn't risk it. Additionally, magic is easier to detect in muggle environments. Casting magic, using portkeys or Apparating in non-magical areas causes detection charms to light up like a Christmas tree.

*False.* Apparition can't be traced. We know Mundungus apparated from near Privet Drive multiple times, once /right in front of Harry/. Tonks cast multiple spells in the Dursleys' house, like /Lumos/, for packing Harry's trunk and the Disillusionment charm.

  “They'd burn the whole neighborhood and torture, rape and murder the muggles until we came out. Use your head, boy!”

This is also silly. Death Eaters doing this in any neighbourhood will draw the Aurors to them like flies, let alone the Order. It's something the Order is built to fight against; their headquarters is hardly important in that scenario.

The "ranting Harry" is the worst part of the Indy!Harry trope and was something I was hoping to avoid. Cold anger is always more effective than a hot temper.
