I too will recommend three fics, since that seems to be the order of the day for some reason :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]] : /AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete!/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] : /COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/The-Resistance-of-Azkaban][The Resistance of Azkaban]] : /It's been twenty five years since the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic is now under the control of Lord Voldemort. Those who oppose him place themselves under the command of Harry Potter, former Auror and ruler of the island of Azkaban/

The first one is the best canon-ish time travel fic you'll ever find, the second is an excellent fast paced mystery thriller and the third is a really good portrayal of what a world in which Voldemort wins the second war would like. All of them are really good, and have my highest recommendation.
