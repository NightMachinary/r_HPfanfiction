In addition to seconding /Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia/, some recommendations I don't see already mentioned:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][/Harry Potter and the Four Heirs/]] (282k): Independent!Light!Harry Evil!Dumbledore AU with conflict largely through political intrigue rather than combat. Harry and his friends are more powerful than in canon but also have more enemies and more political problems to fix.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][/Following the Phoenix/]] (256k): HPMOR spinoff with full alternate ending and defeat of Voldemort, diverging at chapter 81 of HPMOR. MOR!Harry remains central throughout, and while he is a Light!Harry he has to make some hard choices.
