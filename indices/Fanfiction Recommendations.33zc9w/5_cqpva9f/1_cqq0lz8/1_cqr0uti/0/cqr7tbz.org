There. /That/ is the summary, which is supposed to sell the story to readers. So the selling points of the story are -- Harry spending the summer with the Grangers, and Harry and Hermione becoming animagi. Er....Okay? I have read those things a million times and have no interest in reading them again. I don't like Romances in general, and have no particular love for Hermione.

Now, you tell me. Why on earth would I even read the story?
