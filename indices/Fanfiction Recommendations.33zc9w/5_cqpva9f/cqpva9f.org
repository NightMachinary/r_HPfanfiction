I have three H/Hr recommendations that might fit your bill in no particular order:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] Summary: Everyone "knows" what happened during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts... right? Er... no. Find out the truth about Harry and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] Summary: Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] Summary: Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become animagi.

The first is one of the many stories on ff.net that offers a retelling of the entire series, but it doesn't age all that well and has a fair amount of bashing.

The second features several OCs and is fairly AU.

The last was finished six months before DH was published and I prefer it to canon.
