/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685][The Firebird Trilogy]]/ (494k words in three stories): A strange but interesting AU, where witches rule and wizards are a lower class.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106][Seventh Horcrux]]/ (104k words): A semi-crackfic where Voldemort's Horcrux in Harry takes over his body and decides to have fun reliving school as a Gryffindor.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]]/ (104k words): In the summer after fourth year, Harry goes stir-crazy and (unjustly) starts to suspect Remus, Sirius, and even Fudge of being in league with Voldemort. After finding out that Mundungus (whom he hasn't yet met, and who looks scruffy enough to be a low-level Death Eater) is spying on him at Privet Drive, he panics and, with Dobby's help, escapes Britain and lies as low as he possibly can.
