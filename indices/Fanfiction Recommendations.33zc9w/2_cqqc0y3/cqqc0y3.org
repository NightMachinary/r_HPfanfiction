Seems like a good number of the best fics aren't even completed yet but i'm going to link the best completed fics (imo).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]] A great Harry/Fleur fic that has Harry gaining James' memories. You won't find a better one. Quite old now but still the best one in the genre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]] The best comedy fic ever. The comedy is heightened even more by the story having a good plot behind it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade]] The first one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856581/1/The-Denarian-Knight]] The second one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/1/The-Denarian-Lord]] The third one.

The Denarian series which is my favorite completed fic or in this case series. Has a darker Harry that you will root for through the 600k-700k words. Also has one of the best original characters.

All in all i recommend you to read these if you want to read quality writing by authors who could become professional authors (one of them has written some of his own books if I remember correctly).
