I agree! Would you share some interesting plotpoints, ideas or just random stuff that you'd like to see in such a story?

I'm currently in the process of writing a.. very hard to place Harry story.. Let's just say that the current arc is set jointly in Israel and Germany and involves terrorism and nazi veterans, and I'd love to hear what someone that enjoys dark/grey/indie Harry wants to see in such stories.
