[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]]

Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to come out sometime this year. They're truly in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - a fantastically funny fic. Tons of references to other works, too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made the pairing it involves one of my OTPs. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is perhaps one of the most terrifying fics I've ever read, and it explores an unusual concept in astounding depth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that, unlike with Catechism, has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/19/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a stellar piece of work. It's quite emotionally intense, and can occasionally get pretty angsty, but I would definitely recommend it.
