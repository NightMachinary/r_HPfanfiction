For me, fanfiction is mostly about the characters, and secondly about the world. I have trouble with ES fanfiction too, because I'm not really invested in any of the characters except my own, and I don't want to read some self-insert story.

Also, did you know that Ulfric Stormcloak bashing is a thing that exists? I accidentally got invested in a story that I wouldn't have started if I knew where it went, where a perfect oc dragonborn was sent by Ulfric to infiltrate the thieves guild, where she would eventually fall in love with Brynjolf and of course decide to stay a member. I think she and Ulfric were in a relationship, but he didn't really care about her, and would send her impersonal gifts, and was probably really racist.

It was boring and annoying.
