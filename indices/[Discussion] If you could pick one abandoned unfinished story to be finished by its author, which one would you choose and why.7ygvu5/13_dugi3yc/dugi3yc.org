Has to be this one. I know it isn't HP, but this has to be one of my favourite fics.

Writing an interesting Dragon born can be hard to do, but this story pulls it off remarkably well.

This crossover niche should work damnit, but this is the only fic i have read that isn't terrible.

I also love the interactions between the characters.
