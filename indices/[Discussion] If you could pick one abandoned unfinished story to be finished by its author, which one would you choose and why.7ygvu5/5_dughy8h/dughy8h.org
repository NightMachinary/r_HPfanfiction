[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]] by evansentranced. The author killed off someone that I began to adore and simply left Harry in his grief. linkffn(3446796)

Also, (I really cannot only pick one because this other one also broke my heart into pieces.) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][Dead Man Walking]] by cywscross. This story still sits in the back of my head. linkao3(1037432)
