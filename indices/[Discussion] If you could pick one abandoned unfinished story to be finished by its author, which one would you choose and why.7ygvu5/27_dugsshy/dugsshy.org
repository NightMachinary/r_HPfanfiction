In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson linkffn(9399640)

Self Inserts tend to be poorly written but this one is one of the rare exceptions. Very engaging story. Unfortunately the author is one of those annoying fools who has terrible taste in their own works and thinks the story is worthless. I desperately want to shake them violently and explain to them just how wrong they are.
