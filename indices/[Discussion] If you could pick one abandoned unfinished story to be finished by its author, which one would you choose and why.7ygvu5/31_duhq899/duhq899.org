For me it would definitely be linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), a highly original Hermione-centric crossover with the Necroscope series. Fortunately for the readers, it was abandoned at a natural "end the story, start a sequel" point, so there's not too much pain, but still, it would be marvelous if it ever gets finished. But it won't.
