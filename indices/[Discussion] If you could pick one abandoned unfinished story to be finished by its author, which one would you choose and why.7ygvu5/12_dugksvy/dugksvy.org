[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/18/Failsafe][Failsafe]], linkffn(11281891) -- Harry and Ginny get transported to Middle Earth. I just really like the relationship here between Harry and Ginny: two friends, no drama, handling what life throws at them.

Runner-Up: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10061782/1/][In Atlantean Caves]], linkffn(10061782) -- The Ministry 6 take a wrong turn in the Department of Mysteries. I can't say I actually like this story as is, but it's a unique stage with a feeling of impending awesomeness of magic, and I would love to see where it could go.
