ID: linkffn(4828132) Harry Potter and the Ascension of Ra by Apocalypse Thou.

I was never a big fan of Smallville, but I was (and still am) an enormous fan of this story. The kinds of Magic Harry gets into and the vibe of growing into his own away from Britan and people who know him. Him growing up, instead of just growing powerful.

The same vibe I got from Jbern and his two works in second person. Also a good read but those are complete.

But the story just stopped, and I have always wondered when or if it will ever continue. It never felt like the story ended in the author's head, just people stopped reviewing. This story deserves more love than it got, I recommend it if you haven't had the chance.
