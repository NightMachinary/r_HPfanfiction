  IMP. POLL ON PROFILE Harry thought he would die; had anticipated it, even. So now what will he do in this new world, one without magic? Not to say that there isn't power lurking here... With snakes calling him 'Lord', and everyone else saying 'Abomination', is it any surprise that he's not going to have an easy time settling down? HP AU. Eventual Naruto AU. Slow paced. Dark Themes.
