This one. It's THE time travel fic.

...Well, in more detail, it's a traditional 'Harry goes back in time to fix things' fic, but really good. Dumbledore isn't evil (though Snape is), exposing Peter Pettigrew adds new layers to the story instead of just solving-problems, there's some unseen antagonist in play...and Harry, despite being powerful, is still balanced within the story.
