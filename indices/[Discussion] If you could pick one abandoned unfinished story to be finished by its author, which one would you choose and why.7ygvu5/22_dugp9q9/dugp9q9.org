Give me anything by Bobmin, BroomstickFlyer, Harmonious Cannons, Morta's Priest, or any of the other authors that have been taken from us too soon.

But seriously, Courage and Cunning by preciousann.

As a runner up, either/any of joen1801's HP/GoT crossovers.

Third place: if some of the old standby authors (who are still active, just not writing anymore) like Old Crow, Draco664, Ares Granger, or the like would come back and finish their unfinished works.
