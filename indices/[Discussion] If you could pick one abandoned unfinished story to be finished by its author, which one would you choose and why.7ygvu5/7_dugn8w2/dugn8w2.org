Unlike a Sister by MADharmony. By far the most superior Harry/Hermione romance story I've come across since reading FanFiction. The best part of the story for me is how the author portrays Harry and Hermione. They are very close (in my eyes, at least) to their canon counterparts. Reading it is like reading a continuation of the Harry Potter series itself (minus The Cursed Child drivel). I just can't believe it wasn't finished.
