The Harveste Addams series. It's about a Harry who has been rescued by the Addams family from the Dursleys. It has a lot of dark and morbid humor that may not be everyone's cup of tea. It starts off with a one-shot linkffn(Harveste) and is followed by 6 books. Books 1-5 are complete but linkffn(Harveste Addams and the Half Blood Prince) has been left unfinished.

The author has edited and reposted these stories on AO3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/51538]]) with a promise she would try to write again but that was back in 2015. :-(
