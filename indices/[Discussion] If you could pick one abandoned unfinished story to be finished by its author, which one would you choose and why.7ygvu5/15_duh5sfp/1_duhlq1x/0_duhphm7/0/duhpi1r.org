  This is the first chapter of my huge sprawling SS/LE fanfic, Sympathetic Magic, which I wrote between 2008 and 2013 (when you see it, you'll understand why it took so long!) and posted on DeviantArt. I've been meaning to post it on AO3 for ages, but I can only work in like half-hour intervals when my baby is asleep, and I'm also trying to write original fiction in those precious half-hours, so this could take a while...\\
  The story follows Severus and Lily through their last two years at Hogwarts, but it's also focused on the Marauders, Narcissa and Lucius, Regulus Black, Poppy Pomfrey, and lots of OCs. No characters are really hated, except, I guess, for Bellatrix. It's AU, but I think quite respectful towards J.K Rowling's plots and characters. It gets extremely caught up in the emotional world of the characters, and can spend whole chapters in symbolic landscapes representing their souls (I'm not sure if that's really selling it, but it's the truth!) Anyway, I can't really describe it. It was my soul for almost five years, and I haven't re-read it in way too long, but I still hear from people asking me to make the story more wiely-accessible, so I'm going to post it here. Hope you enjoy it!
