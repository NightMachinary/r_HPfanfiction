I feel the same about young Snapes, I think the main problem that most authors have with him is that to me he seems like a character than does not talk when even he should and if he says something it's not understandable enough for anyone and since characters like this are extremely hard to write authors tend to change him.

What are other stories with young Snapes that you enjoyed? I am always looking for more.
