Many of these are great, but I'll go with one unmentioned so far:

Lords of War and Thunder linkffn(9880708). It's got a lot of promise, it's extremely well written, and it's one of the few stories where Harry has a good relationship with his BWL brother.

Perhaps it isn't the best unfinished fic, but it's definitely up there.
