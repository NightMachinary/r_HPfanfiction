I'm going to say linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone), that story had great worldbuilding and a lot of potential but never got to stretch its proverbial wings. I am also naturally looking forward to the updates of /Core Threads/, /Fantastic Elves/, /Natural 21/ and /The Evil Overlord List/, but for all of those --- well --- they haven't updated in months, but the authors drop by periodically and confirm they're not abandoning them, so we'll see.
