Last Tango in Paris by Anna. It was posted on the now-defunct Witchfics. Someone posted a PDF last fall, and I got one more chapter than I had read previously. It was so interesting and well-written, and I would love to know what happens! Since it is the third story in a series and they are all long, I sometimes go back and reread, even though I know I'll be disappointed at the end.
