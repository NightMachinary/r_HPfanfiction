I am not familiar with that movie (I have only heard the title), but I would guess they are nothing alike. It is the third part of a story that is Hermione-centric; she is a researcher who has made a breakthrough regarding Neville's parents, and of course there's a mystery. She spend much of the story in Paris, so I imagine that's where the title comes from.
