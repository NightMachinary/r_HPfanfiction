Okay, I have to ask here, because that title is familiar... what's that story about?

I mean, when I hear "Last Tango in Paris" I think of that really controversial Bertolucci film from 1972 with Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, with all the nudity and non-con sex... I happened to catch it on TV when I was like fifteen and watched through it in morbid fascination, even though it was a long time before I could eat butter again. (Anyone who's seen the movie will KNOW what I'm talking about!)

I'm almost afraid to ask, but that fic isn't about an anonymous sexual relationship between two people that turns increasingly abusive, is it?
