Prince of the Dark Kingdom.

I'm not a fan personally. It drags on, I don't particularly like the worldbuilding and there isn't a single character whose arc I give a damn about. I made it through maybe the first three-quarters the first time I tried reading it. Only got through the first year the second time.

Other people really seem to like it though, so tastes differ and all that.
