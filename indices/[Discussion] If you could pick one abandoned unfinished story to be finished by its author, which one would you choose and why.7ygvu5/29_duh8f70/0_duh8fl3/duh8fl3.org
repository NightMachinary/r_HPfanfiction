  AU/Time Travel: It is 1973 and Lord Black and Lord Potter find themselves in Gringotts confronted with the unthinkable and without power - a Lord Potter-Black from the future. However, he didn't arrive alone. A Black heirloom forces a marriage, which will only complicate things further as the Black and Potter families try to unite against the coming darkness. Harry/Daphne/Narcissa
