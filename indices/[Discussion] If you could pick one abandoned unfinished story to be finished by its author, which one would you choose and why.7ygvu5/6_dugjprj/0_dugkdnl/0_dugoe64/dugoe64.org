What? It was definitely left unfinished - all the A/Ns as it went along (and her tumblr) said it was supposed to have 50 chapters or so, and end after Lily and James had actually gotten together.

I've had it on alert since it went on hiatus in~2013 and it was never finished.

Edit: Her tumblr FAQ still says due to end in April 7th year, around 50 chapters: [[http://itreallyatemyhand.tumblr.com/FAQ]] . Apparently it's just unfinished and not abandoned but by this point it really is.
