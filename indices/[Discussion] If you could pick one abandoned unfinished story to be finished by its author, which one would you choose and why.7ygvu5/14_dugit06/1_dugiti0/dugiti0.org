  Jamie has survived an entire year and has successfully kept her employment at Hogwarts. Now she has to deal with a family that knows who she is, a government that doesn't want her in the country, and people demanding to know when she'll get married. That, and there's also the pesky after-effects of throwing herself backwards through time.
