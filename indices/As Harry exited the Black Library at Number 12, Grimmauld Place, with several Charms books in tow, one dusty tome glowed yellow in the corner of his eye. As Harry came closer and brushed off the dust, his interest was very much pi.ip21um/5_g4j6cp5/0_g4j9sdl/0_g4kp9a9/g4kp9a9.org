I have a fondness for creative villains, especially 'odd and atypical' creativity. The Goblin King who makes dubstep, the house elf who cleans in certain patterns to make pictures in the dirt, or the Death Eater who sculpts with papier mache. That kinda thing.

Plus, the idea of Grindelwald being like that hipster guy who's writing a pretend-fiction-but-really-hella-autobiographical musical screenplay is hilarious to me. :D
