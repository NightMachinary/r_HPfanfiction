Sirius explicitly left it to Harry in his will. As he is the last remaining person of the name of Black. If this were the real world, if Sirius didn't leave it to Harry, it'd go to the closest living family member (Bellatrix) and maybe it'd work that way in the Wizarding World too. It was another “fuck you” to his family.

As far as the library goes, it could be just a full bookshelf or two. I would imagine that it's in the room with the Family Tapestry or something.
