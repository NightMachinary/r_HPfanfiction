Thank you, I am glad you appreciated it, I enjoyed writing this one, but I am already writing some other four hp stories, trying to make them as good as possible and wouldn't be able to give a long fic like this calls for the attention it deserves right now.

I would have to worldbuild, a lot, and do political worldbuilding which I don't find as fun as mystical and general worldbuilding.

I would then have to do a lot of research on politics to write a believable revolution the way I imagined Harry and Co. making it.

Two of my fics (non-published) are already a bit heavy on politics(it's hard for me to write a believable political system for Wizards) and it's already quite a bit of work to keep them consistent in the stories(one has a more feudal like system, the other is more modern, but it takes into account other Nations for non-humans and recognizes some of them as sovereign territories).
