Cont.

Harry looked at the book in a new light, he looked around in surprise when he noticed he was still in the library, in one of the tables there, books and parchment were strewn around him, full of notes.

"Ah, I had wondered where I left that book."

Harry turned in surprise to the door, seeing Sirius there, leaning against the doorframe with a fond smile, he thought of trying to hide it, the sudden worry of Sirius seeing him reading, studying actually, the book of someone who was considered a Dark Lord.

"Sirius, I-"

"Fascinating, isn't it? I had to get your mother to explain some of the stuff there to me, I wasn't very much interested in politics or history back then to get it, but when she did..."

He approached, throwing an appreciative glance at the things strewn on the table, "You are her son, heh, she had a table just like that, I remember seeing her studying it, this book, she would even cast some spells to not call too much attention when she was doing it."

He tapped the book cover, "Dangerous material back then."

"So my, mum, she..."

"Oh, she supported most of it, did some changes of her own, along with your grandparents and even James' help, to make it more...palatable, efficient, possible, to dilute the changes so they were not so shocking, but the end result would be nearly the same."

"My dad too?"

"Oh, yes, you would think he, the heir of a pureblood family would be against it, or his parents, but the Potters were always progressists, 'at the frontlines of change' your grandfather would say."

Harry was still trying to absorb the fact his family was planning a revolution, when Sirius continued, "We had pretty good chances if I say so myself."

Harry looked up at that, "What?"

"Oh, it was much bigger than us five Harry, I mean, Moony didn't have much faith, and Wormtail" he growled at the name, "was there because we were, but we saw he wasn't interested, so we thankfully kept him out of the loop."

He went behind one of the shelves, but continued speaking, "Your mother and others organized it, and we had a good number of the old families heirs in it, the Blacks, through yours truly, the Longbottoms, the Bones, the McKinnons, and of course the Potters, some others were more tentative, some were in it because they saw potential and wanted to be part of it, to keep or increase their power."

"All that can be used should be used, as long..."

"As long as the goals and their security can be kept, very good, Harry."

Sirius came out of it holding a pile of paper and books and notebooks.

Sirius placed them in Harry's table.

"Now, this," he indicated the book in Harry's hand, "is my copy of the book, which I guess is now yours. This," he placed his hand over the pile, "is your mother's."

Harry thought of what he could do, of all he had learned in this past week, he thought of political capital, of the one he would have /when/ he defeated Voldemort, he thought of Neville, and some of the people in the DA, Sue, Padma, he thought of Ron, Hermione.

He looked at his mother's version, and the notes he had taken, he decided to train like he never had before, to study and improve, because as Grindelwald said, 'Change requires power, in it's many forms.' and he needs a lot of it. Grindelwald had tried to do it mainly through the strength of arms, but maybe in this Dumbledore was right, and the bonds of friendship and common ground could serve as a greater source of it, when violence wasn't enough, or appropriate.

He thought of the money his family probably still had, if the books on Britain were right. He thought of the money and the name of the House of Black, plans started forming, and he remembered small conversations he had with some of his classmates, of overheard opinions, throwaway thoughts, and muttered grievances.

Slowly a smile formed on his face, now Voldemort's defeat was no longer the main objective in this fight, it was an important goal yes, essential, but it wasn't the end, it would be a beginning for change. For...

He looked up at Sirius, who had a matching smile, if a bit more mischievous, and both repeated their new motto in tandem.

"For the Greater Good."
