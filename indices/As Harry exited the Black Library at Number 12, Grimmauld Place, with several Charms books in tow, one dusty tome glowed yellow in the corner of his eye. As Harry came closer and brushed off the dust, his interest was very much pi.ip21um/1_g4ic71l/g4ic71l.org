The more Harry read, the more he thought and questioned, it had started as a fun read, he knew Grindelwald had been Dumbledore's enemy, and caused a War, so he thought it would be interesting to know how the guy thought, and how much it differed from Voldemort.

He never expected it would make so much sense.

Harry could say he came in prejudiced, half-expecting to see the ramblings of another madman, but it couldn't be farther from the truth.

The first ten pages got his attention, the next twenty got him to seriously review what he knew and look for more.

He had thought Grindelwald had an ideology similar to Voldemort's, of how Wizards were superior and Muggles were inferior, just without the problems for Muggleborns and Half-Bloods.

He was wrong.

The man described a Wizarding World very similar to how Harry knew it today, good on some parts, but full of flaws, and not willing to solve them.

He even checked the dates, because the Wizards he described were very similar to the ones Harry had met, especially the government people, corrupt, shortsighted, and unable to see beyond their own prejudices, only their names changed.

He described how some of the country's Wizarding Governments worked, and Harry was pretty sure he got the UK one on point.

What terrified Harry, is that it hadn't changed, Dumbledore had won in 1945, and it hadn't changed, Voldemort's Blood War had come and gone in the 70's and 80's and nothing had changed.

And Grindelwald explained /why/.

Harry had gone back to the library and looked up some history books, and even some records from the Wizengamot the Blacks had there.

It was all there, the systems had changed names, done some adjusting, and the name of the politicians changed, but under that, it was the same thing.

The power system, how those in power kept it, and prevented others who thought different from getting it.

Harry had this distant thought that if or when Voldemort was defeated, they would be able to change things for good, to end the prejudice, to get people like Malfoy out of positions of power.

Now he didn't believe that anymore. They may get /Malfoy/ out, because he chose to be obvious about it and went against the Ministry, but not the people /like/ Malfoy, the ones who stayed in the sidelines.

It got Harry to seriously question why he was fighting like he was. He thought of people like Hermione finally having the opportunities to show their talents, to not fear being attacked because of their blood. But he was seeing that even after defeating Voldemort, it wouldn't be that way.

In the middle of the book, Gellert stopped talking about the problems and started talking /solutions/, radical solutions, some were violent, but he explained why they were needed, and how could they be applied to be more efficient and to cause the least amount of damage.

Harry read them, and before he knew, he was taking notes, and checking the books he had to see if they made sense or were applicable.

They were. He wasn't a history or sociology genius, but it was all there, and he knew how people reacted.

It was only in the last parts of the book, that Grindelwald talked about Muggles, or the 'Muggle Question' as he called it.

He talked about the problems and difficulties between both cultures, put some history that Harry really wanted to have learned from school.

He talked about how some governments in the world dealt with muggles and the Statute of Secrecy, from MACUSA's almost total separation, to Britain and some countries of Europe having adopted a more relaxed posture, both came with their pros and cons.

He talked about Muggleborns and how the Statute made things difficult for them, in various situations, with the government, their peers, and their families.

Harry's situation was pretty unique, but Hermione's fit in some of those categories, he knew she had avoided many of the problems described because of her studious nature, and her very supportive parents(and her placement in Gryffindor). From what Grindelwald described, not all had the same fortuitous situation, Harry wondered if any of his peers at Hogwarts had problems dealing with prejudice and fear at home, while having little help to adapt to a world who sometimes wasn't very receptive.

It also provided solutions for that, some Harry thought too radical, but still logical if he analyzed it coldly.

Grindelwald advocated for change, radical change, a revolution even, of a scale not seen since the Statute itself was implemented. Harry could see, even today, many wouldn't like it, many would resist.

But he could see how much good it would make, to the great majority of the population both magical and muggle. Maybe that's why it was called the Greater Good.

The last pages were what Grindelwald himself called a dream, a world similar to what Harry had once imagined the Wizarding World to be, with magic being used to help all, where politicians followed the law, instead of using it or manipulating it for their own gain.

Harry found himself shocked at how much he would fight for a world like that.

Harry was about to close the book, he wondered how something that didn't advocate for the muggle's destruction and/or total subjugation had found its way here, he noticed there was something handwritten on the back cover in a beautiful script.

/For Sirius,/

/A friend gave me a copy, and I think this is the answer to many of the things we talked about, us five, I know the author doesn't have good fame, but it's solid Sirius, everything in it. Now may not be the time, but maybe when the dust settles, we can think of our future, I know this book speaks of a world I would be more comfortable raising my children in. And the way to get there./

/With Care,/
