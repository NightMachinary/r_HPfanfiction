I couldn't stop laughing when I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/118431/chapters/165770][Little Red Courgette]]. If you like political comedy, this one is for you.

I also thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] was hilarious. Harry needs a new toilet and Draco is the salesman.
