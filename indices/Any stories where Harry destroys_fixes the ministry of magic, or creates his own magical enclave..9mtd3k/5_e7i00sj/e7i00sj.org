I really should make a list of fics i've read already. I know about this one fic where harry is really OP, builds an island, starts collecting people and magical beings finds some magic from merlin's time on a museum, tortures some ministry people who try to force him to some tropey stuff, mad scientist luna gives them magic nanobots that will make every magical have non magical children. Hides the island for 1000 years while time goes faster or slower inside, can't really remember.

Another one follows pretty much the same plot but they go to the moon, harry is reaaally OP with several wives, one of them being soul bond voldemort but in a non romantic way. They pretty much build a magical utopia where travel to the earth is regulated, like you can go there but if you want to live there you can't come back. I think they also stole all magical babies too in some automatic magical way but I may be wrong :B
