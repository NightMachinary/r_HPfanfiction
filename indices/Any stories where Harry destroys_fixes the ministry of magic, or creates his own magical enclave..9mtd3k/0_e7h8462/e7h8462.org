As for fics having him making his own magical enclaves, "For the Love of Magic" is certainly one, but I don't like it at all so I will not link it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall]] by Bobmin356, linkffn(8837257), is a lot better, but still uses some of kind of Deus Ex Machina to overpower Harry. I'm not found of this plot device.

Of course, there is always the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2107570/1/Lord-of-Caer-Azkaban][Lord of Caer Azkaban]], linkffn(2107570), in which he (obviously) turned Azkaban into his new home. From the same author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun][On an Island in the Sun]], linkffn(9279255), is a fun read too.
