[[/spoiler][has 'Harry' be a female who got raised by an extended&badass Black family, and ends up declaring blood-feud on Voldemort & his followers... which leads to stuff which leads to the Blacks conquering Britain with 'Harry' as the leader, Harry then fixes the bullshit and leaves to find her Husband (whom she used an ritual to find when nobody fitting could be found) This is when the story switches over from HP story to Katekyo Hitman Reborn! story, with Harry&co being an out-of-context problem for the Mafia...]]
