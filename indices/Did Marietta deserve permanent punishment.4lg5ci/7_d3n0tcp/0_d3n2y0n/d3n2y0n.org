Scars are still quite permanent. Even if it fades with time, it's still there. If someone looked closely, or got close to Marietta's face, chances are, they would still see said scars. Case in point, acne scars, stretch marks, birthmarks, burn scars, and other forms of scars, are still visible and sometimes obvious, even years after the event.

I myself have a scar on my head from when I was born, thought to be from a fetal monitor, which resulted in a large and permanent bald patch I usually cover with the hair around it. Two acquaintances also both have large burn scars on their hands and elbows, respectively.
