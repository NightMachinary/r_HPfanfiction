Depending on how many scars there were (it sounds like most of them did go away eventually?) and how faded they got, it might not have been noticeable on Marietta unless you were /really/ up close. She could have wound up with a few very faint marks that no one would notice unless she pointed them out.

Could be wishful thinking on my part, though. She did sign a contract and she should have known how high the stakes were (fighting against Umbridge /and/ Voldemort), so Hermione's punishment wouldn't bother me if it lasted for only a few years, but I like to hope she didn't have to deal with it her whole life.
