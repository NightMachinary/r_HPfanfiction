I didn't say it wouldn't still be visible, I just quoted what Rowling said about the topic. I would have liked it better if she had been able to get it fixed at St Mungo's later that year... have it be something Madam Pomfrey can't fix right away, but it needs several weeks of treatment at a hospital, which she could have done over the summer. Still a punishment, but not for the rest of her life.
