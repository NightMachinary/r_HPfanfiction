I want to talk about the curse itself, I think that will help me discern if the punishment is to severe and how it fits into the morality of the larger universe.

1.) Marietta willing signed her name to a contract which /was/ explained although in vague terms.

#+begin_quote
  *“I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,” she took a deep breath, “that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing. So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge --- or anybody else --- what we're up to.”*
#+end_quote

2.) Any action performed in the Harry Potter universe has a power too it. The best example I can find of JK outright tell us this is in book 5, chapter 37:

#+begin_quote
  *...delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative... She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.*
#+end_quote

Here we see the power of making a choice of your own free will. It protects Harry and as we learn five books later, damns Marietta.

3.) This is further reinforced by Harry in book 7

#+begin_quote
  *Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.*
#+end_quote

4.) The terminology in HP is confusing when dealing with Curses. We see clear evidence that they come in at least two forms. One form acts like a projectile shot from a wand, ie: The Killing Curse. The other type of Curse doesn't require a wand or seemingly any wizard to sustain it at all. I'm talking about the curse on the DADA position. It had been in effect for 20~ years by the time Voldemort dies, and we can assume that he broke the curse so that the Carrows would be safe while working at Hogwarts, or that the simple act of replacing the DADA class with Dark Arts was what broke the curse.

I believe that Hermione's curse worked in much the same way. It was given power by the Signatory consent. I also assume that it works in much the same way that the Fidelius Charm worked(Hid a secret in a soul), by taking the Trust everyone placed in each other and placing it within the document.

So Merietta breaks the trust of the group by betraying them to Umbridge and activates the cruse and is *"disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word “SNEAK.”*

Now the curse fades overtime but never completely as a number of users have mentioned. I think this has great parallels to the notion of trust. Whilst those betrayed feel particularly aggrieved the curse is in full force, but over time the other members of the DA move on with their lives and get over it. But the trust is broken, none of them can ever see Marietta in the same way after what she did, and now, neither can the rest of the world.
