I agree that it was excessive, and it was a completely vindictive and ruthless move on Hermione's part, but we shouldn't use this as an opportunity to bash either Hermione or Marietta. One of Hermione's worst traits is that she /can/ be vindictive and ruthless, and this makes her a truly three-dimensional character.
