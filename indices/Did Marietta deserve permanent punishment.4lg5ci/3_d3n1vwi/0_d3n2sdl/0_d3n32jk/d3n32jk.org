Of course not, but what [[/u/Karinta]] was saying is that said ruthless and vindictive streak makes Hermione a flawed character. It makes Hermione realistic, because it shows that she's not 'perfect', by any means. On top of that, she can seem quite swotty, bossy, and condescending at times, which put a lot of her classmates off from her in the beginning. For much of PS/SS, Harry and Ron even didn't even seem to like her much until the troll incident.
