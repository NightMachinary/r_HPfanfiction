I agree that there are plenty examples of Hermione's flaws and I love the dimension it adds to her! But I do think that the fandom tends to overlook them in her favor. I prefer to acknowledge her faults as I like characters with some depth. I've been downvoted more than once for pointing them out (confunding Cormac, scarring Marietta, Obliviating her parents, etc) and it'd be nice if I wasn't treated like some sort of Hermione-hater when it happens. She's a person and therefore makes mistakes
