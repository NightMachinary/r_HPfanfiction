Yes. As I pointed out in my reply above, there are major examples even in SS/PS. Hermione is certainly not a saint, which Rowling herself said in an interview. Hermione is an "exaggerated" version of Rowling, with Rowling saying that she's "more intelligent", and far more dedicated in academics, than she was herself.

  *Q:* So you're writing these three characters over an extended period of time -- how much of you ends up in all three of them?

  *J.K. Rowling:* I envision a good argument that says that an author is in every single character they write. They have to be. You have to understand from the inside what someone's going through, which means that you have to put yourself in a lot of different heads. But Harry, Ron and Hermione, I am absolutely in all three of them. Harry is a curious character. He's not the most popular character in the book for a good reason, because he has to be this questing person.

  *Often that person is slightly less easy to love because their flaws tend not to be run-of-the-mill flaws.* But Harry is often the by-stander -- the eyes onto the world -- and that gives him a particular power. He is slightly detached, which isn't a very lovable quality. But often people who have that detachment are rather unusual and are able to do things. And most writers have a degree of detachment, so if I stand right back from those three characters, I can say that is the part of me that maybe is in Harry. Hermione is easy.

  *Hermione is an exaggerated version of myself at that age. She's not exactly like me, but I was certainly a very bookish girl and I was the girl who would've gone to the library to look it up.* That's how I would've reacted to the challenges of Hogwarts. I would've gone to find a book. And there's a lot of me in Ron. A lot of Ron's most base humor would make me laugh. I'm not saying that's the only stuff that makes me laugh, but I love Ron's humor -- and obviously that comes from me. I'm making up the jokes.

For example, one of Rowling's college professors regarded her as "unremarkable" in terms of grades, and she was certainly much more like Harry or Ron in the classroom. Hermione may be "more intelligent", but that doesn't mean that it wasn't treated as a flaw. Lack of a direct "calling out" also doesn't necessarily mean that Hermione /doesn't/ face negative repercussions for her choices.

For example, even later on in the series, Hermione's attitude, behavior, and lack of social finesse continues to create negative consequences for her. A large example is her creating the D.A., but needing Harry to lead it, basically /for/ her, which is covered in /Order of the Phoenix/.

The reason for this? Harry is more "likeable", "charismatic", and "personable" than Hermione is, by Hermione's own admission. She acknowledges that, with her at the helmship, people would be unwilling to accept her as their leader.

Likewise, earlier on, there's the infamous S.P.E.W. incident, whereas Hermione doggedly pursued "freedom for all house elves", at the cost of her friends' and classmates' irritation, laughter, and annoyance. In /Half-Blood Prince/, after /Order of the Phoenix/, we see the consequences of Hermione being unable to admit to herself her feelings for Ron, or muster the proper social skills to initiate a relationship with him. This results in a far more socially competent peer, Lavender Brown, starting a relationship with Ron instead, leaving Hermione annoyed and aggravated.
