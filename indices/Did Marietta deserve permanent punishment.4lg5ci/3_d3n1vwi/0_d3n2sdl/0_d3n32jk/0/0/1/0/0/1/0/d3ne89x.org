...i think people in this thread are being obtuse. [[/u/ThatGreekLady]] agrees that hermione is flawed, and that her permanently scarring marietta is an example of this. the argument is about whether or not this was acknowledged and treated as a flaw by the narrative.

from jo:

  Louie: Did mariettas pimply formation ever fade

  J.K. Rowling: Eventually, but it left a few scars. I loathe a traitor!
#+end_quote

which seems to imply that she views hermione's actions as justified and marietta's scarring as deserved
