The situation they were all in made vindictiveness useful enough that even though Hermione could be vindictive when it wasn't deserved (which is a flaw of hers), her vindictiveness helped them with the situation (so vindictiveness itself is not her flaw, or at least not by itself).

And we see that this flaw of hers, meaning her haughtiness and tendency to go overboard, is something that had caused difficulties for her. This is the very thing that made her too bossy and so hard to make friends at the beginning of the story, for example.
