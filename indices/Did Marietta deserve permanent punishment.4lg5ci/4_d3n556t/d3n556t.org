A question for you, ThatGreekLady, what's with you and having threads that pretty much answer the same thing?

To answer you're question, and not make THIS a shitpost, Marrieta very much deserved the punishment. She had a contract that she signed and she should have damn well stuck to it.

For the punishment in question being extremely vicious, you're right about that, it was vicious, but goddamn was it efficient. As for the vindictive nature of the punishment, Marrieta sold them out to Umbridge, and what does Umbridge do, or well, attempt to Crucio the leader.

Which of the two is more vicious, the one that leaves scars that correctly reflect your personality or a curse that can send you to fucking La La land?
