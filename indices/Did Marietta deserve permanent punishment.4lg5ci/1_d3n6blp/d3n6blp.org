  Imagine if we branded every single criminal this way, "THIEF" right on the forehead

This is a really bad comparison. There is legal recourse against thievery.

We are talking about opposing a terrorist organization and a oppressive/corrupt regime here. There's no legal recourse at all. You are not creating a constitution - vigilante justice is the only thing you have at your disposal.
