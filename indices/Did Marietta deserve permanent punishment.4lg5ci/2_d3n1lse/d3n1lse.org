No, I don't think she did. At the same time I also don't see it as justice being enacted, but rather as Hermione trying to be both efficient and ruthless. After all, it is her education and her best friends she is trying to protect. With danger in the air and behind every door, the DA wasn't something she wanted to take lightly. I understand Hermione's motivations but I also see where Cho was coming from when she defended Marietta.
