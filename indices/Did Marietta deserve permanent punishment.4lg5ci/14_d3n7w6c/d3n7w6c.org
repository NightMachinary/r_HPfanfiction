  Imagine if we branded every single criminal this way, "THIEF" right on the forehead

Funny you should ask that. Years ago (before the first harry Potter book was published), I was thinking about burglars. Coincidentally, at the same time, I considered getting a beginner's tattoo kit. I also wondered about how difficult it would be to incorporate iron rings into the cement floor in the basement.

No, it's not as if I planned to tie the fuckers down and tattoo "THIEF" onto their foreheads. Or testing my Taser.

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

BTW, Islam tells us to cut the right hand off of thieves. Tattoos can be removed, but limbs can't be regrown.
