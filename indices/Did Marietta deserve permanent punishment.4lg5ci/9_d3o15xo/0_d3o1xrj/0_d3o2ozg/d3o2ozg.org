/Battlestar Galactica/ spoilers: Well, [[/spoiler][Saul Tigh]] killed [[/spoiler][his own wife, Ellen,]] when he found out [[/spoiler][she was passing info to the Cylons]], so it's conceivable, but I don't think so. I don't think that they would really do much more than ostracize her for the rest of her days. Killing her would serve no real purpose and she'd already been made an example of. I just think they would have originally made it a bit harsher than some pimples.
