This is not something I strugle with, this in fact, something I always had a seething dislike for: Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents.

This was something that was only ever in a background of a movie, and even then with no clear connection between this supposed "charlus potter" and harry. Yet of course, people imediately made the obvious solution into the only correct one- Charlus is james' dad.

The reason I always disliked this is because this would make James and Sirius cousins. Not only it makes no sense for it to be no reference to it through out the whole books, it kinda diminishes James and Sirius friendship. Especially the whole thing about sirius "abandoning" his family to go live with james and his parents. Turns out he just went to live with his close family when he did it? I dont like it.

Suffice to say, I was very happy when JKR published the pottermore text about the potter family. I was less happy when it became clear that the majority of the fandom was gonna ignore it but you can't win them all.
