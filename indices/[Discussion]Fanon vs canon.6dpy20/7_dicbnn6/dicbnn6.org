The one that bugs me most is "bloody hell". In fanon, it's Ron's catch-phrase. As best I can recall (or grep my ebooks) the phrase /does not appear/ in canon. "Ruddy hell" does, once by Vernon, once by Hagrid and once by either Harry or Ron, it's ambiguous. Nor does Ron swear noticeably more than most of the other characters.

I guess he says it in the movies or something.

There are bigger, more plot-relevant bits of fanon (e.g. family rings) but most of those are /adding/ to canon, not /changing/ it.
