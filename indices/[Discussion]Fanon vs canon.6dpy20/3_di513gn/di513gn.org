It's mostly details, some more inconsequential than others.

I've had two today I had to check on - in Chamber of Secrets at duelling club is there a canon incantation for the spell Draco uses to make the snake appear? I knew there was in the film but could not remember if it actually appeared in the books. (For those interested, yes it does, and it matches the film "Serpensortia") and the second one was whether or not Veritaserum would work on an Occlumens.

Snape wearing dragon hide boots is so common in fics I had thought it must have been mentioned in canon at some point and carried over.
