I'm not talking about Harry Hunting, which was carried out by Dudley and his gang, I'm talking about physical abuse at the hands of Vernon. How does that quote imply Vernon beat him to you? I'd like to hear your read of it because I'm not seeing it. To me, it reads 100% that Vernon did not beat Harry.
