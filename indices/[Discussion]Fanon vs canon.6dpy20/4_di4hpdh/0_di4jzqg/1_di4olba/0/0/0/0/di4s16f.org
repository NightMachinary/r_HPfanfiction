I'll agree with you on this one. I could not find a better quote in all 5 min. I searched. I do however agree with Alloud99 about The Petunia quote's prove of Harry's abuse at the hands of Dursleys.:

#+begin_quote
  Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan
#+end_quote

I also agree with Alloud99 comment about said quote. I found it very fitting:

#+begin_quote
  Its mentioned way to casually for it not to be a regular occurrence
#+end_quote
