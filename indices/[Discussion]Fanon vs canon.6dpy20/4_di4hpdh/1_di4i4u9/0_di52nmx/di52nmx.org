You're not reading it properly. Look at it again:

  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. *By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started* and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

He wasn't literally locked in the cupboard for a month, because he's still attending school. It seems to be like being grounded for a month, and it just so happens that his bedroom is a cupboard.

It wasn't until CoS that Harry was literally locked in.
