I think people are looking into this whole abuse thing too much. I'm going to use what Hellstrike has said, so apologies to said person. I'm also quoting him, so he should get an alert or something.

"He was locked in for about a month."

I believe he was just locked in there. I don't mean they closed it and locked the cupboard and never let him out, I mean that once he used the bathroom and ate, or whatever, he was shoved back in there.

I mean, the smell of urine is strong, as well as other such smells, and the cupboard would /stink/ and that's where people enter. I just cannot see Petunia allowing this.

"His parents are ok with Dudley beating Harry."

From what I have learned about parents with multiple sons, it's that they seem to just let them fight. I'm sure they didn't punish Dudley for anything but did they ever?

"That is probably close to waterboarding."

Dunking someone's head into a toilet is a common 'haze ritual'. It is also used by bullies, which we know that Dudley is one of those.

;

I mean, Harry was also fed three times per day. Sure, they may be measly meals, but he wasn't starved. The story is also through his perspective, which means we could be getting a biased view.

He was abused mentally and somewhat physically, but he wasn't starved and beaten as so many fics claim. He also wasn't abused sexually, either.
