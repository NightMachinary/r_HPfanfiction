I never claimed sexual abuse and frankly speaking, using that as a plot device to make Harry more angsty (and I have only read three stories that go with sexual abuse) is simply poor form. How much Harry suffers is up to interpretation but you have to remember that the first three books were written for a younger target audience because it gets pretty dark from GoF onwards. And graphic depictions of child abuse are not well suited for a children's book.
