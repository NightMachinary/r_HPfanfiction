harry was terrified of them when dobby tried to frame him for the pudding incident. he literally said "they will kill me"

and the reason why he doesent show the signs of an abused child is because the first couple books are written like fairy tales. I mean how often do you see a Cinderella interpretation where she shows signs of being abused. If those incidents had happened in the later books they would have been perceived way differently
