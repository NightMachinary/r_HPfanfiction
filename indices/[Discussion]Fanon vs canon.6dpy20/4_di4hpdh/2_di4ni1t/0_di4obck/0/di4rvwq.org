People use "kill" as a verb meaning "to punish severely" all the time, so I'm not sure that the pudding event is quite the smoking gun you're looking for. But anyway, this still leaves the fanfiction writer in a bind: do we just keep on keeping on with the Dursleys' abuse and Harry's lack of response to it? Given how fanfiction storylines tend to focus on the relationships between the characters (and the adventure, of course), having a character behave so unrealistically is... painful for me.
