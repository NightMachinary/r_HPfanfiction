The way i see it is this. Does it matter if its abuse as is contextualized by the connotation of the word? No. If social cerivices or the equivalent of such in The UK saw such a thing, that child would be taken, provided therapy, and placed in a foster family. Period. Who gives a damn if they hit him. His bed room for 10 years was a fucking boot cupboard. There was a second fucking bedroom being unused! When he finally got there, they put bars and a cat flap on the door. If i was anyone who could take care of a child, id beat the Dursleys senseless and then take Harry away. It doesnt matter if Harry was hit. It doesnt matter if he was starved. It doesnt matter if anything other than what we heard occurred. Harry Potter was by definition abused. Do you have to go into detail about it? No. But if it was your kid, and you did just what the Dursleys did, you would spend many many years in prison as your kid was fostered. You would never be able to see them again.
