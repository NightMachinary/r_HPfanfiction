I guess the biggest problem I have fully understanding the situation that it's not consistent. Sometimes they're absolutely terrified of him and so do nothing to him. Sometimes they care so little about him that they just neglect him. And other times they try to, as mentioned before, whack him upside the head with a frying pan or lock him in his bedroom for the entire summer. And secondly, it's never discussed in any specific detail. The most extreme cases mentioned above (swinging a frying pan at him, for example) give zero details about the event. It's mentioned in passing despite being a potentially life-threatening event. But Harry doesn't seem to show any of the signs of an abused child. The descriptions of the Dursleys are always whimsical and mocking, but never reflect that, if he's being regularly abused, he is in danger from them. Harry never seems to be particularly wary or afraid of them. Even his hatred of them is oddly distant, more like dislike. We're given abusive events, but then the characters don't act in any sort of way I could understand.
