I have, for example, very little idea of how Harry was actually mistreated in canon. Fanon is rife with fics full of the Dursleys abusing Harry in every way possible, but canon appears to be... more ambiguous. They make him sleep in a closet, but there is no mention of regular beatings or starvation or refusing to let him out of his cupboard/room (though there are mentions of infrequent manhandling and such). I guess I should really sit down and reread the books rather than just looking up snippets as needed, huh?
