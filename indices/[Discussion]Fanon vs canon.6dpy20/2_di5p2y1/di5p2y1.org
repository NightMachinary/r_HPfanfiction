I'm always disoriented when I see the movies or read the books and the twins are completely bonkers or Luna isn't off the wall crazy or Dumbledore isn't just past the line of evil and manipulative or Draco doesn't secretly have a soft side and Narcissa isn't a badass. In fanfiction, the characterisation in the books is magnified. Some people have headcanons about the characters and work them in but a lot of people just blow the characterisations of the book out of proportions.

In Harry Potter though, I can't think of anything so intense as Darcy Lewis in Marvel Cinematic Universe Fanfiction. Her entire characterisation is basically a fabrication because she only appears in two movies.
