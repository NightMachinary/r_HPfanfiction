Dumbledore is certainly past the line of manipulative and evil. He knowingly sent a child to an abusive environment and defended his actions as the right thing to do. Anyone who does that is a criminal at the very least. That he only did this in order to grow Harry into a suicidal weapon definitely puts him into the evil camp.
