The blurring of characterization. This isn't because the fanon is necessarily wrong or doing a bad job, just because once blanks have been filled in, it is hard to un-fill them when rereading the canon. A really good fanfic interpretation of a character and/or events sticks in my head and adds dimension or points of view that just aren't in canon. Then speculation and extrapolation creep in and suddenly you end up quite far from your starting point.

This can be a good or bad thing depending on the author.
