Not in a bad way! But one chapter near the end is almost completely taken up with one character gathering and giving a speech to all the others on the importance of Christ and God and a meaningful life and that we need a source of moral law, and it just kind of comes out of nowhere; there's no build-up to suggest that this character is religious beforehand.

Looking at it again it's not Brutal Harry exactly, but the sequel to it, Hero Harry.
