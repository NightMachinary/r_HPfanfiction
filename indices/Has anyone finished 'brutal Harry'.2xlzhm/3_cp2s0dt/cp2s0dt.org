It's been a while, so some specifics might have slipped my mind, but here goes...

It's a decently written fic that actually explores the consequences of the sort of abuse Dursleys are supposed to have inflicted upon Harry on his personality. On the other hand, it's many of the standard Powerful!Indy!Harry tropes, including, but not limited to wandless magic (which only Harry even bothers to even /try/ to learn); a Hermione who is oh-so-brilliant but doesn't actually get to /do/ anything interesting [1]; Muggle martial arts and knife wanking; an 11- or 12-year-old Harry casually intimidating adult adversaries, like Lucius Malfoy [2]; and I've probably forgotten the other tropes.

I've interacted with LordsFire in an online forum, and he is, indeed, a devout and outspoken Christian, and a rather conservative one, as far as I can tell; and he does not hesitate to incorporate his religious and philosophical views into his fic, often in ham-fisted ways [3]; but, then, neither does LessWrong in HPMOR. I do think that, as with HPMOR, it degrades the quality of the fic. It's telling that despite having rather vague memories of the actual plot, I still remember that while narration of Hermione mastering a number of magical and non-magical disciplines at a prodigious rate took about a paragraph, a long grace speech by Hermione's father [4] before the Christmas dinner was written out in meticulous detail.

[1] And, definitely not anything Harry couldn't do, but Harry is busy doing more important things, so she contributes.

[2] Teachers too, to some extent, but they feel legitimately guilty about what had happened to him.

[3] C. S. Lewis was about as subtle as a brick with his allegories, but LordsFire doesn't even bother with the allegory in the first place.

[4] Lamenting the secularization of Christmas, if I recall correctly.

*Edit:* To answer the actual question, yes, I finished /Brutal Harry/, though I remember only skimming the sequel /Hero Harry/, before quitting it altogether. I'm pretty sure that all the /really/ egregious tract stuff is at the end of /Hero Harry/. Still, I'd probably quit it much sooner than that were I to encounter it today.
