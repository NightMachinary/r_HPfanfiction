Hmm...\\
I'm on Chapter 4, just passed Hermione and Tom's first meeting on the Hogwarts Express, and am unsure what to think. Hermione is somewhat close to her canon counterpart though not entirely so. Tom, on the other hand, has me weary of reading the rest of the story. In no way, shape, or form would I ever imagine Tom Riddle winking at Hermione, no matter how innocent it may have been. In fact, I don't see a young Tom Riddle winking at anyone. Reading that was like the author slapping me right out of the story.

â€‹

Does Tom Riddle keep winking at Hermione? Does he ever turn remotely serious? And the way they talk (especially Hermione and Tom) is rather jarring. I understand the story takes place in 1944 and their word usage is much different from ours but it feels...childish to an extent, and it's something I don't enjoy reading. How is the dialogue as the story progresses?
