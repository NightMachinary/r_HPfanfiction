Jodi Picoult tends to switch between first person perspectives by chapter. She's certainly made a successful career of it.

This example will show my age, but back in the 80s-90s there was a popular children's book series called The Baby-Sitters Club. Most books in the series were first person limited to one of the girls in the club, but there were periodic “super specials” where the first person narrator would switch by chapter within the book.

It's not my favorite style to read, fanfic or otherwise, but I do believe it can be done effectively (The Broken Earth Trilogy already mentioned is a great example.) And it does seem to show up more in fic than elsewhere.
