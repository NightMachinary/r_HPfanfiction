N.K. Jemsin won three best novel Hugo's for her Broken Earth trilogy, which uses this technique. Ok, technically one of them is second person, which is even less common/odder. And I think Children of Blood and Bone switches first person narrows. Which is to say, yes, switching perspectives is a not uncommon writing technique, even when all those perspectives are not 3rd person.
