I can only think of /The Wandering Inn/ and other modern "post-fanfiction" works, offhand. (EDIT: For other examples, see [[/u/Colubrina]] above.)

("Post-fanfiction" is incidentally a term I just made up, but it may well become accepted twenty years from now. It's very likely that in hindsight there'll be an apparent divide between Pre- and Post-fanfiction writings, what with a substantial proportion of future writers now getting their start in fanfiction.)

That being said, say, criss-crossing "diary entires" in the first-person perspectives of two lovers in a romance doesn't sound like such a far-fetched idea. It's very possible that some book or other did it long ago.
