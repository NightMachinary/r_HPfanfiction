I wouldnt write it off so easily dude. First person is the most natural experience for readers and authors alike, case in point both you and I wrote out points in first person. Having multiple narrators first person POVs allows for a similar moment in time to completely switch how they feel, from the valiant struggle of trying to keep upright as the narrator fights to uphold thier beliefs, to a horrid beatdown as a narrator watches their freind get beaten to a pulp. Tldr; switching first person POVs allows for sudden shifts in tone to feel natural and can keep a story interesting as it allows for first person narrators to have their thoughts be obscured at points in time.
