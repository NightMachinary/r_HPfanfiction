I have a headcanon that James' parents died during his 6th year (or in the summer after 5th year). This gave him a reality check, giving him the reality of war at his doorstep. This led him to get his act together, and focus on studies and protecting those close to him rather than harassing Slytherins. This allows me to plausibly combine his pre-6th year bullying (no matter what you think of Snape, bullying is never an excuse. Especially not after he was nearly killed as-is), with him becoming Head Boy and maturing, becoming the Auror he was after graduation until he was killed, and dying for his wife and child.
