So in the entire history of a ministry noted for its discrimination against non-humans, Hagrid was the first individual with creature blood to be sentenced to a Kiss? When it's specifically noted in canon that many nonhuman groups supported Voldemort and Magical Britain fought wars against non-humans? Doesn't really work.

And muggleborns are normal witches/wizards. Why would they not be affected by the Kiss?
