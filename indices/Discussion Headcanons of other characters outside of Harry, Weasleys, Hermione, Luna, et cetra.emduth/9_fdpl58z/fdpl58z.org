Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan are cool bros. They host parties all the time and put serious effort into getting Hogwarts alumni to come so they can all stay in touch. They like to go clubbing and wingman each other except one day they go home together and hook up and realize they like that way better and get married but continue going out and occasionally have threesomes with women.

Draco had to use the very last of his political capital and enough money on bribes to get him down to normal levels of wealth in order to avoid Azkaban for the events of book 6. No one in the wizarding world trusts him enough to give him a job so he tried to become a muggle doctor but couldn't cut it in med school and ended up as a grocery store cashier making just enough to get by, while selling the remaining Malfoy heirlooms occasionally to make ends meet. He says something stupid to a customer and gets fired from even that, so he steps up selling off dark artifacts in order to eat. Eventually one of these heirlooms kills someone and he spends the rest of his life in Azkaban.

Scorpius, who is Ron's biologically after a drunken night with Astoria, is adopted by Ron at this point, and grows up working in WWW and everyone forgets he was ever connected to the disgraced Malfoy line, which is now extinct.
