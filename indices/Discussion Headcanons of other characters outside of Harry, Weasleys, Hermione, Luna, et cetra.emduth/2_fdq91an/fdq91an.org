I've always like the idea that Peter's Betrayal was a far more tragic story.

- The first time James and Lily 'defy' Voldemort, he kicks the shit out of them without much effort.
- Peter, who is cowering in a nearby building, sees said Ass-whooping.
- Realizing they could never hope to beat such a monster, Peter approaches him and makes a deal instead: Turn spy, and Voldemort doesn't kill his friends.
- Voldemort agrees, and the next two times he tries to recruit the Potters, they come out of the encounters in significantly better (though still obviously injured) shape.
- When the Fidelius plan is discussed, it's Peter's idea to switch secret keepers. Not to betray James an Lily, but to actually stop Sirius from being targeted as well. Peter's in too deep at this point, and he figures since he's already bargained for their lives once, he can do it again.
- Voldemort agrees to Peters request, like he does to Snape's.
- Finally, Voldemort breaks his promises.
