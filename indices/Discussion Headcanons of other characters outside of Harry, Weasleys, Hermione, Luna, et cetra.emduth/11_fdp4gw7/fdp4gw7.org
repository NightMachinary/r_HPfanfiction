Also, I read a Blaise x Daphne fic once and I think it makes sense in canon. We know from the Astoria info JKR released that the Greengrasses were neutral and Blaise is shown to not approve of the death eaters. They're not paired with anyone else and it would make a good side pairing.

Fanon ice queen daphne and canon Blaise have pretty compatible personalities as well.
