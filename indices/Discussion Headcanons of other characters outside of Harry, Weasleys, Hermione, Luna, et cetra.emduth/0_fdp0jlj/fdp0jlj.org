I found a certain website a while back, it's sadly gone now, that delved into the historical distribution of surnames in the UK, going a bit more in depth than just the linguistical meaning. Each name had whole paragraphs explaining exactly what the name meant, what this or that occupation was in medeival times, the linguistical influences the Vikings left, all kinds of cool stuff. According to this website, the Parkinson name was historically common in Lancashire. So I like to imagine a Pansy who finds pureblood ideals attractive because she grew up on stories of great aunt Agnes Nutter, and when Lancashire was industrializing her great-grandfather had to contend with muggles taking more and more land to turn towards heavy industry that wizards neither needed nor wanted, so Pansy feels like she has familial grudges against muggles.
