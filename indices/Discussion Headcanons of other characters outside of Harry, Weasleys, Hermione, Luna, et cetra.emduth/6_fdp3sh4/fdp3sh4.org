Draco eventually reconciles with Andromeda & Harry and becomes an uncle of sorts to Teddy. Scorpius grows up having a connection to him and thinks of him as a much older brother because they're both only children.

Lavender with werewolf tendencies (if not a straight up werewolf) and heavy scarring. She becomes the author of a mega-popular romance/adventure series with a strong focus on the discrimination & mistreatment faced by creatures, based on her own adventures & discussions with others. It becomes the "Uncle Tom's Cabin" of the creature rights movement, bringing the formerly taboo topic to every magical household in the UK. She marries Parvati and their life is never boring.

Charlie & Hagrid both remain single for the rest of their lives and are best friends/business partners.

I know Ron is a main character, but I always liked the idea of him retiring from the aurors because of the kids? I can see him as a stay at home dad, especially considering Hermione's role as MoM. The prime minister of NZ & her fiance have the same dynamic pretty much.
