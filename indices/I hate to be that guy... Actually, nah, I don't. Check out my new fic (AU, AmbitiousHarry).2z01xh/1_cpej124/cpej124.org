Hmm, i'm torn. There's nothing objectively wrong in the story but my brain is a jerk. So i'll go to point out my main concern : if you introduce something (like Harry being a metamorph) not Canon be sure it's worth it plotwise. I know it is an AU and you've all the authorial fiat you want but at the beginning it might be the thing that drives people away.

I like the competent!dumbledore bit, at least this assures me that you didn't fall for too many clich√©s. Ps : Canon dumbles never talks about the greater good Ps2: the only criticism i find myself able to do is your prose : in some points you write a lot without saying much, it's not a big deal and it's a personal preference of mine but be carefull to not lose the flow of the story, it would make it a lot harder to read.
