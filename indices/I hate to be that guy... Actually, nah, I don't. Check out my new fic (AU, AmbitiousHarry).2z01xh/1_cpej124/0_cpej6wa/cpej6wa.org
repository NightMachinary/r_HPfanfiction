Thanks for the feedback!

Rest assured Harry's metamorph abilities are not simply just another thing to check off in a list of superpowers. It will be a crucial ability.

I see what you mean about Dumbledore and the Greater Good; however, I think he does truly believe in the Greater Good, or the benefit of all over a few. (However, even he has his weaknesses, and I hope to go more in-depth with his character.)

About the story being a bit wordy - thanks for pointing that out! I'll keep it in mind while writing.
