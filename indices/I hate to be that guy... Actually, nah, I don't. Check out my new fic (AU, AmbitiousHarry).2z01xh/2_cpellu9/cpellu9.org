Like it so far! One tip: try to avoid things that are obvious, like in chapter two: 'Dumbledore's aged voice spoke'. It's a bit redundant. You have several times accentuated that Dumbledore was old. As the reader, we know. And the 'aged voice spoke'... it's not the voice that speaks. It's the person using it. You could skip that whole sentence. We know it will be Dumbledore that answers the question.

Please, don't see it as an attack on your story! Again, I like it so far! Just some constructive criticism.
