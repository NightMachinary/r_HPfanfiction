Thank you! I will make sure to proofread my future chapters specifically for superfluous descriptions.

The two main characters here are Harry and Dumbledore, so I'll keep the POV's locked down to them for the most part (with a lean towards Harry). They think far too differently to convey them properly through only one POV. One is a child brimming with excitement and ambition, one once /was/ a child brimming with excitement and ambition, but is now weathered by the resulting hardships of leadership and life.

So basically, Harry will be the focus of this story, but I will also feature Dumbledore several times. I'll try to make it less distracting, though!
