The beginnings of a good story. Just some things.

I agree with [[/u/Zeikos]]. An error a lot of writers (myself included) make is to become too superfluous in our prose. It's often better to simplify the sentence instead of trying to insert so many qualifiers that the sentence becomes broken. Take one of your opening lines for example -

*Robed men and women milled about, returning to their tents, or tending to them, before settling for the night.*

The sentence becomes so muddled that it is easy to confuse what is settling for the night. Is it the men and women or the tents? A better way to phrase it would be:

*Robed men and women milled about, returning to their tents and retiring for the night.*

Simpler and less effusive, but conveying the same point. This isn't to say you should never layer your descriptions. It's just that keeping it simple goes a long way to making it more readable instead of filling sentences with words just to be descriptive. It's just something to keep in mind while you're writing. More periods doesn't make you a simpler writer. It will often make you a better one.

The general plot and characterization is on point. Only 3 chapters in and 6k words aren't much to judge by, but the seeds of a good beginning are there. One thing to consider would be to tone down on the jumping POV's. I think it's another case of keeping it simple rather than over complicating things. If you divert to a different POV than Harry, either make it consistent enough where it appears several times throughout the story or use it infrequently so that it is important when it appears.

I think multiple POV's work often, but it can distract more than anything if used incorrectly.

Keep it up!
