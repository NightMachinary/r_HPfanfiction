Dumbledore knew Myrtle was the victim, he knew her ghost haunted that bathroom, and he knew Hagrid was innocent. And yet, he never bothered to ask Myrtle a single question, even if for the purpose of finding out what killed her and where the monster might come from. Perhaps he did, and he had known for a long time what the Monster was and where the CoS entrance was, but kept the secret for 'you-know-what' reasons.
