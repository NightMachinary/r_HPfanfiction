I can't remember a fic with a good explanation, but none of the professors realising that it's a basilisk is somewhat more convincing if you take into account that they have less information than the reader. The only thing they really know is that /something/ has been petrifying students.

The chamber of secrets is widely believed to be just a legend, so there's no reason to assume that the cause has anything to do with Salazar Slytherin. If you're convinced that the chamber is just a legend, the message looks like someone trying to spread fear and cover their tracks.

Also, the teachers don't know that Harry (a known Parselmouth) has been hearing a voice. They might not know about Hagrid's roosters being killed or assign blame for that to a fox or something else from the Forest. They probably don't know that all the spiders were fleeing the castle, Harry and Ron only noticed after Hagrid told them. Hagrid was told by Aragog, but he might not have shared that information with anyone.

Dumbledore already knows that Hagrid is innocent (and he probably also knows that Hagrid's monster was an Acromantula), so he has no reason to think that "Follow the spiders!" would tell him anything new. Dumbledore is probably also pretty sure that Voldemort is not inside Hogwarts again, so while he cannot rule out his involvement, he doesn't know how the chamber has been opened. In canon, he's not overly fond of telling others about his hunches before he has to, so it's likely that he didn't share his suspicions that Voldemort is involved with the other teachers.
