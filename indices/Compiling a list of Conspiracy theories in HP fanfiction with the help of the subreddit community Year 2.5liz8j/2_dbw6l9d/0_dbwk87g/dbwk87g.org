Actually, I have yet to read a good explanation for this one.

Why is it (ignoring the fact that its a childrens book that needs the children to be the heros), that not one of the professors figured out that a basilisk is slithering through Hogwarts?

If anybody knows a fic that explains it, I'd love to read it.
