I know of none that do it without adding some serious AU elements. I wrote the Chamber arc so that the Basilisk was put under a Fidelius, which was why the teachers didn't recognise it. I'm pretty sure I've read a couple where it's said that there were too many creatures and spells that had the ability to petrify for the staff to narrow it down. Many other fics just prefer to straight up call the staff dumb.
