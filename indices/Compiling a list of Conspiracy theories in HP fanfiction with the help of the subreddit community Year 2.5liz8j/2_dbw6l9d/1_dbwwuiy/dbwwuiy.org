It is only co-incidence that the place of Myrtle's death turned to be near the entrance of the chamber. There were students petrified in other places (Hermione was petrified near the library, for instance) that weren't near Myrtle's bathroom. Dumbledore would have questioned Myrtle as well as the other students petrified (and then cured) the first time the chamber was opened. There was no reason to believe the positioning of Myrtle's attack was more significant than the others.
