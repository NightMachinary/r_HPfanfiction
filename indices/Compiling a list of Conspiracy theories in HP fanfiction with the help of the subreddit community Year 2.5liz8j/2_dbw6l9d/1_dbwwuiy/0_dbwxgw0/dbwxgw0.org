Surely her story of how she died would be enough to at least give some suspicion of the basilisk. "I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away..." It might not give the location of the Chamber, but it seems enough to make a well-educated man like Dumbledore figure "eyes + sudden death = could be a basilisk".

The only thing I can see is Myrtle being too distraught when she first becomes a ghost, or too intent on her vengeance against Olive Hornby, for Dumbledore to properly interview her, and then by the time she calms down/is forced to leave Olive alone, he figures it's been so long there's no point. (But even then, I feel like he's the kind of guy who'd try to find out everything, even if it's several years after the fact.)
