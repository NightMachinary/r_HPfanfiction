Yeah, but a basilisk wouldn't explain the non-fatal petrifications. It would, if someone could connect to the non-direct gaze, but I doubt that depth of research has ever been conducted on Basilisk, not when one hasn't been seen for 400 years. Plus, the very idea of a basilisk (which can grow upto 50 feet in length) staying at Hogwarts is counter-intuitive.

(btw, Dumbledore in canon seemed to think it was wizard imitating a monster and doing it, given that he identified the attack on Miss Norris as one of dark magic of the most advanced kind, which seems to be the most likely conclusion given the facts known to him. I'm not sure he ever gave much credence to the idea of a creature instead.)
