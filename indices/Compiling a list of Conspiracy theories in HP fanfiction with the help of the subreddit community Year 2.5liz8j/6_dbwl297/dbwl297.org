- Dumbledore used the curse on the DADA position to screw over Lockhart, since he knew the man was a fraud [I believe this has been made canon]

- There is an enchantment on Hogwarts, at least since Dumbledore became Headmaster, that makes it nigh-impossible for students to be killed there. Adult visitors don't have that protection, though the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students were covered by it.
