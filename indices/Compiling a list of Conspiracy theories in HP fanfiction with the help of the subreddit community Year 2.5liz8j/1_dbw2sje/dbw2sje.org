I'm not sure if these would count as "conspiracy" theories, but:

- The students were petrified and not killed because Ginny was fighting Tom's influence.
- The students were petrified and not killed because the basilisk was fighting Tom's influence (for example, basilisk's purpose isn't to kill muggleborns but just to protect castle, so orders were contrary to its nature, but it is forced to do so).

Can you number your theories for easier discussion?
