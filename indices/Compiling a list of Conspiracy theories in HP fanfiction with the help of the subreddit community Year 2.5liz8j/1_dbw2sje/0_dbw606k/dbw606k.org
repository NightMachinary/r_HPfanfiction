I like the first one because the messages on the walls(Ginny fighting Tom's influence) could be interpreted as warnings, which is something only a noble Gryffindor. There is no way a Slytherin would warn their enemy's they are going to attack them. That's something a Gryffindor (and possibly a Hufflepuff) would do.
