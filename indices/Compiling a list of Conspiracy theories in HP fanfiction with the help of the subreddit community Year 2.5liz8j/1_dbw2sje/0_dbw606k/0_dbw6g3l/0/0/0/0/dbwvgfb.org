Off the top of my head, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Prince of Slytherin]] does it because [[/spoiler][Riddle knows Dumbledore knows Salazar Slytherin wasn't actually a blood purist. Blood purism started as a relatively recent political movement, so Dumbledore assumed the messages were a red herring. To keep leading Dumbelore astray, Riddle petrifies people that aren't muggleborn]]

Another (which I can't remember now :( since i read it a long time ago) involved isolating the Slytherin house even more so that when he came back he'd have a bigger base to recruit from. So he wrote the messages to encourage Slytherins to band together when other houses turned on them.
