  There is no way a Slytherin would warn their enemy's they are going to attack them.

You could argue that they were intentionally written to rile up the school or induce paranoia (I've seen them used that way in fics where Riddle has a concrete plan besides merely returning to life). But yeah, in canon it would not be a smart move at all for Riddle to warn his opponents that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened.
