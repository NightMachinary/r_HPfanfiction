Duelling Club incident was staged by Draco/Snape/Dumbledore to intentionally out Harry as a parselmouth for reasons.

Lockhart uses potions/ enchantments on the pages of his books that induces all women to love him/ believe his stories.

Fawkes came because Dumbledore couldn't be bothered to do anything himself.

The sword now magically belongs to Harry, but Dumbledore takes it to keep Harry from his legacy as Godric's descendant, true hero, whatever.

Dumbledore influences Dobby away from bonding to Harry to keep Harry down.
