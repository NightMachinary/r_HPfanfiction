I have even emphasized that I don't think they were good (nevertheless I got -10 points on it, because nobody reads what I wrote). My problem is not that they are not /good/ in the books (they are not, and I am OK with that), but that they are not /real/. Try to write a story with Dursleys as significant characters and you'll find out what I mean --- they are so grotesque and fairy-tale-like that they don't make sense as real living human beings. Even people who are evil (Lucius Malfoy, Tom Riddle) make sense in their evilness, Dursleys don't.
