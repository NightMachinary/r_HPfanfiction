Harry isn't really a narrator at all, reliable or otherwise. The language and word choice of the narrator of the HP books is not even close to Harry's character voice. On top of that the reader and Harry do not share knowledge: Harry frequently knows a lot more than the reader about what is going on, whether it be magic or Harry's plans.

The narrator of the HP books is more like an invisible demon sitting on Harry's shoulder which has access to Harry's thoughts. And which occasionally teleports to observe other people instead.
