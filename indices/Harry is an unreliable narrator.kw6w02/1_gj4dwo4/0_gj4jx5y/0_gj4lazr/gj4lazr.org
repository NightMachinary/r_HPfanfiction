Yes I am aware of the terminology.

However, third person limited is not a single viewpoint but a wide spectrum. The HP books take place around the mid-point of the spectrum - we're not so close to Harry's perspective that the voice of the narrator is his. The language of the narrator in PS, for example, is not that of an 11-year-old boy. But nor are we so far away from Harry's perspective that the narrator is telling us things Harry doesn't know (except on rare occasions, like in PS when we see the Quidditch match from Ron and Hermione's perspective).

However, one important point is that Harry's thinking and conclusions are often hidden from the reader, for the purpose of dramatic tension. The most prominent example being Harry's conclusions about the Elder Wand in DH. And of course Harry knows far more than the reader about magic, the magical world, the inhabitants of Hogwarts, etc. This is the simple and inevitable result of us only seeing a small part of his day to day life.
