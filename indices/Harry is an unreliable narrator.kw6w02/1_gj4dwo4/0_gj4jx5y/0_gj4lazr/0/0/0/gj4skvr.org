I meant to add, cause I'll stop calling him a narrator, because he is just a perspective character. But mobile. Sorry.

What I meant was that we get an objective analysis from the narrator, but we also get Harry's impressions of the scene. That's what makes third person limited such a cool perspective.

The idea I was trying to go for in the prompt was that what if our objective narrator, wasn't so objective, and was actually just Harry's interpretation presented differently. Does that make sense? I'm not sure if I'm getting it across properly.

To be clear, you're making sense. I should just no longer be allowed to post before sleeping. Because I reread that, and I make no damn sense.
