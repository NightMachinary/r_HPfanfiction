  I don't understand, do you think Harry's a reliable narrator? Or do you just take issue with me using the word narrator?

The perspective character is not the same as the narrator.

As I described above, third person limited is like an invisible demon sitting on the shoulder of a character, (usually) listening to the character's thoughts.

The narrator is the demon on the shoulder. The perspective character is the person whose shoulder the demon sits on.

The narrator of Harry Potter has a distinct voice, and it's definitely not Harry's. It is the voice of JK Rowling. When Harry enters a place, the narrator treats us to a description. That description is not the same description that you would get from Harry if you asked him to describe the same place. The words are different and the objects of focus are different - the narrator is conveying the place to the reader to best allow the reader to visualise that place, not to reflect Harry's focus.

In HP the narrator usually, but not always, sits on Harry's shoulder. But the reliability of the narrator is not related to the perspective character. The reliability of the narrator concerns whether the reader can trust the information conveyed to them by the narrator. And in HP that question is not about trusting Harry, but trusting JKR.
