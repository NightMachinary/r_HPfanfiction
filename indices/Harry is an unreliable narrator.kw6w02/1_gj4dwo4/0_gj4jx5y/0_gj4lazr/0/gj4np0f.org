It's a small perspective, that's why it's called third person limited. The third person perspective is limited to a couple characters.

Harry is still the perspective character. We don't get information he doesn't have, but like you said, we don't always get all the information he has. I'm saying he's an unreliable perspective character. That's good evidence for my point.

I don't understand, do you think Harry's a reliable narrator? Or do you just take issue with me using the word narrator?
