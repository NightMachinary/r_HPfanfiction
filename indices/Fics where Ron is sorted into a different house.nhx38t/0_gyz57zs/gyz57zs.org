I have some Slytherin!Ron fics I liked:

There are these two I: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10352232][To Those with Cunning and Ambition]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5421695?view_full_work=true][Actions Speak Louder than Words]] Both are short but have a really nice take on Slytherin Ron.

Then there is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16525733][A Darker Shade of Red]] which is also short but quite dark and really well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices][Choices]] is longer and still WIP. It get's updated slowly (WIP since 2011) but it get's updated.
