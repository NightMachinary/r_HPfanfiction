No idea if this counts but I recently read a fic where James survives Voldemort and meets a woman who hits it off with Harry and becomes a close guardian figure (SPOILER: becomes stepmother). It is written incredibly well and is the first in a trilogy (last book is WIP).

It's published on WattPad by KMBell and is called "Nepenthe".
