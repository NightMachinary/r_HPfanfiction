Blood Crest was surprisingly very good, although it's definitely pretty dark in places (esp towards the start). Harry is sort of unintentionally kidnapped by a German dark wizard who doesn't realise he's the BWL when he's about 9. Things are pretty terrible for him from them on but the Harry it creates is very interesting. An enjoyable read, esp if you treat it as 5% crack.
