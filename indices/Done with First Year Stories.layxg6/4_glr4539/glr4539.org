Eh, I don't mind first year fics, though I generally wait until a series is up to the third of fourth year before I start reading it. The ones that look interesting I mark for later and then check back on them when I'm looking for something new to read.

I'm writing a year 1-7 (plus one year post Hogwarts) series and it's a lot of work. I'm about a third of the way through book 4, and I've calculated at my writing speed it will take another two and a half years to finish the series. That's definitely a long time to focus on one project. However, I'm really enjoying it.

What I don't enjoy is blatant rehashes of canon. Like, make something different. If I wanted to reread the actual Harry Potter series, I would. If there aren't some interesting changes by the end of the first year I generally stop reading.
