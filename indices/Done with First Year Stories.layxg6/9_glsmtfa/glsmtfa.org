I can think of some really good 1st year and on fic's, but most of them are beginning again, time travel fic's too.

I see your point, a lot of the really bad ones are poorly done 1st year's, but there are some good or interesting ones out there; you've just probably already read them.

I read all kinds of fanfiction atleast twice, there are too few great stories out there to read only them.

EDIT: Looking through my ffn community of all time favorites (Those Less Forgotten), I have 9 total non-crossover non-SI/OC, non-time-travel fic's (or series') which start 1st year, all of which are atleast mildly AU; not that you'd necessarily like the same stuff I do, but that's like Ten Years of reading fanfiction, so 9 total isn't all that great.

/Firebird's Son/, /The Arithmancer/, /893/, /Harry Crow/, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, /Core Threads/, /Seventh Horcrux/, /Gabriel/, and /Harry Potter and the Manifesting Magic/.

And, heck, /Core Threads/ and /Gabriel/ aren't even complete, but they do stop at well enough a place.
