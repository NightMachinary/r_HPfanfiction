I don't mind fics starting in first year, /if/ they do something sufficiently different to the storyline of canon that it makes sense to do.

A lot of the problem is actually that people just take the canon storyline verbatim, just putting the same thing in different words over and over again. If there's a change, it's usually from something that snowballs as the years go on - and in first year, that snowball isn't even really rolling yet.
