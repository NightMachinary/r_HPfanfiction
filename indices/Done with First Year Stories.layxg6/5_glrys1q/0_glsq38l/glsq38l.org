Define “quality” as it applies to fanfiction. Is ‘something interesting or different' enough, or are you actually looking for the quality of a real book?

I'm aware of seven complete non-crossover/time travel/OC fic's (or series') that start in 1st year; though I don't know how they'd stand up to scrutiny given I don't really scrutinize fanfic's like that.

/Firebird's Son/, /The Arithmancer/, /893/, /Harry Crow/, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, /Seventh Horcrux/, and /Harry Potter and the Manifesting Magic/.
