The Arithmancer meets my standards. 893 is fine. Seventh Horcrux is highly amusing. The rest do not meet my definition of quality.

I'm investigating other works by TrekTech though. So thank you for the lead. Just because I despise one of their works doesn't mean I'll feel the same about the rest.

Edit: I feel the same about the rest.
