Meh, I've actually found myself looking for /quality/ first year/just early year fics lately. I'm tired of the post Order of the Phoenix shit. And I abhor 8th year stories so...

But I hate canon rehashes which is what I think your problem is too. And a lot of them are abandoned. I don't like that either.
