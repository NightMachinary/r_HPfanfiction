I think it's a bit more than that - people have a story that they want to tell that requires older characters but are too tethered to the canon situation that it ends up muddled/wrong in the way you describe.

Like you say, there's a limit to how smart one can make children - to use a different author/work, roughly Ender's Game/Shadow level is when it's already starting to get out there.

The solution, though, is pretty simple - just starting later (if the start of Hogwarts isn't a major point), aging up Hogwarts, or both.
