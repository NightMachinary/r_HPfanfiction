I find that the drawback on younger year fics is that people forget how children act, and make them overly smart or overly nice (or overly political in terms of the pureblood lord/lady trope). I was considered precocious as an eleven year old and I can assure you I was still dumb as a brick, impulsive, and easily frightened in life threatening situations in account of never having been in one. Sure, kids can be crafty and quick witted and succeed at a plot but there is an upper limit to how efficient and adult you can make a child character before it becomes unbelievable and embarrassing. I've read hundreds of brilliant fics but also many bad ones, so reading something that starts in first year is a gamble.
