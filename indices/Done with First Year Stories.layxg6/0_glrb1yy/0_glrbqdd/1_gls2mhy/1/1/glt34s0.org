The problem is that Voldemort is an extremely talented wizard, who always worked hard and have a 50 years headstart. I doubt any amount of training could have closed that gap, and I don't think Harry ever had any chance to win against Voldemort /in a/ /straight fight./

Harry's victories against Voldemort were never due to superior magical power or dueling skills. He won because of "love" (oldest and strongest spell bla bla bla). It's a bit cliche, but I still think this a bit more believable than "/Harry worked very hard for 6 years and became the strongest wizard on Earth/".\\
I don't think Harry ever stood a chance even if he had spent all of his time training. Even worse, I'm afraid that such a Harry would have been unable to develop some qualities such as "love" or "compasion", or to connect to his peers, which would have made him unable to use the "canon method" to win against Voldemort.

So yeah, even if I'll admit that Harry could have been a bit more proactive when it comes to learning defense (he could have seen the patterns after 4 or 5 years), I don't really see the point of him being trained as a weapon. At least in a canon setting, I have nothing against this in an AU where he may have a chance because reasons.
