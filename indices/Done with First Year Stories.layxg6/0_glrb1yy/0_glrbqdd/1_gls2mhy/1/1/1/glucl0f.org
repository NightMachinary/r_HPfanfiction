There are myriad problems with canon, but I think one fix is to have Harry be doing a little extra DADA each year than anyone else. Maybe he can read a combat spells book in one scene or he and Ron can practice with a dummy in the courtyard. Then when it gets to fifth year it can make a little more sense why he teaches them.
