As far as I'm concerned, Ron and Harry are the norm (for teenagers) when it comes to work ethic, and Hermione is the weird one. This is why I'm always amazed when people say he is "lazy" or "weighting Harry down", I can never know if these people can't remember their school years, or if I just went to an extremely shitty school.
