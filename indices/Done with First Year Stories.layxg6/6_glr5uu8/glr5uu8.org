I completely agree. I'm so tired of starting a fic that has a cool premise only to find it starts right from the first ride to Hogwarts and we have to go through first year again. And then we have to go through every single day chapter by chapter.

I currently feel like this about the Arithmancer. I'm very interested in the idea of using Arithmancy in spellcrafting but it's going so slowly. I know I can't skip because I'll likely miss crucial information but the first 13 chapters are the first two months of first year which is just Hermione mapping Hogwarts, going to class, and writing to her parents. I just wish I could speed it up and get to when they're older and the events get more interesting.

But I understand that authors want to build up the story from the beginning because it's probably important for the characters story.
