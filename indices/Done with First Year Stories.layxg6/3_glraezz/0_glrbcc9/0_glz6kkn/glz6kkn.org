Fair. It's quite fascinating how that idea of being reticent to start a fic that might not be finished stretches throughout the fandom, actually. It's sort of the opposite of the sunk-cost fallacy, being unwilling to buy into something on the possibility it won't pay off. Like a 'sunk-cost hesitation'. :D
