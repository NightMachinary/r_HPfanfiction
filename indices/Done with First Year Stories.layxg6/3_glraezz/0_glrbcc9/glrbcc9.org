I think your assessment is somewhat accurate in that I don't care for canon rehashes. But I can honestly say that even with the unique stories that do drive my interest I still have that vague disappointment reading them because I know that there's a slim chance they'll be finished. Even if the first year is excellent by itself, I still don't get the full enjoyment because I know the overall story most likely won't be done.
