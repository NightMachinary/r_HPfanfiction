Sounds like your real problem is canon rehashes, moreso than first year fics. If it's just another alley-train-troll-mirror fic, that's what your post seems to say you dislike. That I definitely agree with.

I personally have really enjoyed some first year fics - particularly time-travel repeats or those 'slightly different personality ones' (there's a couple that I'm forgetting the names of that start with Harry getting really into books and then big divergences happen when he visits Gringotts) - and like you said with 'A Flower for the Soul', all-the-years fics can be done well. I won't deny it's a strong predictor of story-death, but the idea of a first year/all-the-years fic isn't bad in and of itself. Like most times, it's not the idea, it's the execution. Some people do them well, other people need to do more work.

But yeah, I'm more of an "I want interesting stories!" person than an "I want more canon!" person, so generally the non-rehashes do appeal to me more.
