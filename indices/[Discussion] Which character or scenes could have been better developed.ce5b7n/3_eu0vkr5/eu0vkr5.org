It always bothered me how Seamus and Dean had such a shallow friendship with Harry. Hell, Harry doesn't even see them as more than classmates.

When you live with someone for six years, they become a big part of your life. And Harry actually LIKES Dean and Seamus, there is no reason for him not to have a meaningful friendship with them.\\
Actually, he actually has more stuff in common with Dean than with anyone else in Gryffindor, both having lived in the muggle world and without a father.
