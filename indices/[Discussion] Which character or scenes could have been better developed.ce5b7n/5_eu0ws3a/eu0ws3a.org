Honestly /everything/ in HBP.

Everything to do with Ginny, too.

Dumbledore and the war with Grindelwald (ignoring everything in FB, because really, who counts that as canon?).

Snape's redemption (i.e., what redemption?).

Ron/Hermione. It's the only canon pairing which had development. Said development nosedived and crashed and burned.

Other classes outside of the core set.
