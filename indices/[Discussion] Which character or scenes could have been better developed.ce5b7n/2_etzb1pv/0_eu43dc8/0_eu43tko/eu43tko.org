Exactly. I would have loved a more developed Hermione. Well and a smarter Harry. Seriously, he was very inquisitive in book 1-3. What happened?

Her mothering did not help her character at all. Very grating, especially in the later books. Her advising people on relationships is hilarious, considering she attacked the person she had a crush on with birds.

Rowling coddled her in canon. I read a fic where every time she butted in her opinion as if she were a supreme authority, people would fire back their opinion in a scathing manner. It was bashing, but it was so cathartic compared to canon...
