Ron thinking with his dick is true enough. Human side maybe? Author being indecisive? Definitely. Hermione's character can never be described as anything but book smart. She sure as hell isn't street smart at least until she is whenever it is convenient. It's just I've never found any HP characters to be human or have human thought processes. Up until deathly hallows it's still as if they are just slightly upgraded 11 year olds with a higher tv rating.
