It was the book as well.

Really was stupid of them. Although, it seems Ron was thinking with his dick rather than his head, by agreeing with Hermione.

I liked the fact that Hermione was jealous of the attention Harry got in potions. It showed a human side to her. What I didn't like was how Rowling pretty much had her not learn anything from that. Or confunding McLaggen. Or attacking Ron with birds.
