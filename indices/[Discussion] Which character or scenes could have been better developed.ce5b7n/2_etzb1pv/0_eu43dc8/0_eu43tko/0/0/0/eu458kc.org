Book 6 was okay but could have been improved so much. Show Harry dealing with Sirius' death after the summer other than nightmares, Hermione not being such an asshole about a goddamn book, some support and trust from his friends considering Malfoy.

There is no excuse for the last point. HG&RW both were there in book 3 when Draco tried to get an innocent animal killed, pretended to be a dementor, and 5th book inquisitorial Squad. You could say Draco was one of the better developed characters in the series.

Edit: Also Harry was beat tf up in the train by Malfoy though I don't remember if that was movie only
