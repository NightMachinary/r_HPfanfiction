Yep. Biggest problem is the protagonists Harry, Ron, and Hermione feel like static characters.

I didn't like the stories after book 3. There was nothing that was built upon. Magical items are used as one off plot devices instead of reoccurring and creatively used items.

Also Ron. In the first book, he was a lazy but strategic person. We don't see a hint of any of that anywhere else in the series. He is degraded to a whiny 1D static character with absolutely no growth. First book he is ready to sacrifice himself for harry. 4th book he abandons Harry. 7th book he abondons Harry again.
