Ron and Hermione in general. They both get some decent development in the first half of the series, but in the second half their development kind of halts... or to be more precise, Hermione's development halts while Ron's development is largely undermined and takes place off-screen.

Also, the Dursleys. They don't come across as characters in their own right, they seem to exist SOLELY to be mean to Harry. It sort of works in the first book where everything's a little simpler and more cartoony, but when everyone and everything else actually gets a little more complex, the Dursleys feel more and more out of place. JKR tries to give a little development to Dudley and Petunia, but it's so minor that it doesn't really work.
