I disagree, but like only a little lol. We see that she can be pretty mean and aggressive. There's also those 2 scenes in OOTP where she's able to get through to Harry. Haven't read it in a while, but there's some development there. JKR just needed to expand on that. To be honest, she gave Luna the scenes she should've given Ginny.
