All very good points. While I disagree with the pairing, my only gripe with the pairing is the lack of development of their relationship. Ginny is a name until their relationship.

Yes the cast of characters properly used was abysmal. Development on the cast that was significantly used was also abysmal. Makes me wonder what was in the last 4 or 5 books that made them that long.

Honestly, I think all subjects were kind of lackluster/poorly shown. World building was done mostly after the series was written.
