Anything with Fleur, Cho, Lavender, and the Patil twins. Someone in the Hermione arc thread mentioned her disgust of femininity. That is very much JKR because she kinda has Harry do it, too. Those characters are treated so poorly.

Barty Crouch, father and son, were given raw deals. Amelia Bones, apparently lasted against Voldemort. Also killed too soon. Bellatrix, I love her, but a cartoon.

Ginny. I enjoy Harry/Ginny. It's the only canon endgame ship that I enjoy. (L&J, too, but they're dead) I'm perfectly okay with throw away lines in HBP, /but/ she could've been developed better/introduced earlier. Having her become a true friend after her father was bitten or Voldemort's return would have been great.

Harry's lack of friendship with his teammates.

Limiting Divination to astrology, tea leaves, and tarot cards.
