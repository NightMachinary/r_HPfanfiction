The obvious one is Ginny. So obvious I will not go into more detail here as everyone knows how it ruined the Harry/Ginny pairing for many.

However, there are 4 other things that stand far and above all the others in my view:

1. First... Fleur/Gabrielle and Veela as a whole. Fleur especially deserved more time to simply show her as deeper than she was portrayed and the idea behind Veela was poorly executed and comes off as simply model-looks women with attitude problems. I get why it did not happen, but it still bothers me.

2. Slytherins, especially female ones. I have long been annoyed at how for all the sorting hat sung about the school uniting when folks say "Slytherin" all you can think about is Draco stinking Malfoy and his "goons" and "friends". Its too bad we did not get more of a glimpse into the house as a whole, and while Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff suffer the same fate to a lesser degree, Slytherin was obviously a more important component in the grand scheme of the story.

3. Fawkes. The relationship between Dumbledore and Fawkes and Fawkes as a "familiar" and the whole "familiar" element of the series was criminally underdone. It had such potential and yet was barely touched on. While Fawkes got plenty of screen time, he simply comes off as an intelligent bird, nothing more. He's a fucking phoenix.

4. And finally, the one that bothers me most (outside Ginny)... Minerva McGonagall. Some folks may say.. wait what? But let's be honest here... for being Harry's head of house, a strong witch, and an integral part of the story, she was always playing "second fiddle" to Dumbledore or Snape or circumstances. She deserved more development and for us to see more of her backstory or at least find it out. We deserved to have her play a more impactful part in Harry's life and initially, it felt like there were hints about that. With her not wanting Harry placed with the Dursleys, and moments of early interaction with him in his first year. But she never really "took off".
