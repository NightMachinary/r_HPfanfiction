I hate the ones that have all the "Some made up percentage of people <x>! If you're one of the other percentage who <y> put this in your profile!"

Or "Add your name to this list and post it to your profile for <x>!"

I don't want to scroll through pages and pages of pithy quotes from other things because you feel like they "resonate with me, man"

I'm here to read your writing. If you want to wax on about plans for your writing, fine. Other crap, and I'm not at all interested.
