This is really driving me nuts. I feel like I remember this, but it's been a long time. I suspect time travel was involved (some difference to the communication on the train) and I was thinking maybe Regrets Collect Like Old Friends because the sorting hat does a lot, but I think there's only one sorting and Neville is not in Hufflepuff. I was also thinking Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, but that doesn't seem to be right either. If i had more time I'd look through the time travel threads from 2-3 months ago. good luck
