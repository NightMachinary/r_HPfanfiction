No resorting in this one, but it was worth the reread :)

Hermione is in ravenclaw and Neville is in Hufflepuff, but they were sorted there at the start.

Overall review: starts strong, but ends weak. The general feel I got was the author went in with a solid pre-hogwarts plot, and then decided to keep going but lost the "spark". It's still worth reading though.
