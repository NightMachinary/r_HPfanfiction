I read a fic recently where they all return for 7th year, and due to the war, /all/ students are resorted. Ron is a puff, Draco and Hermione are ravenclaw, Harry and Ginny are Slytherin, Neville stays in Gryffindor. It's a DH fic, which isnusally NOT my thing, but I was really intrigued by the idea and the way the relationship develops was almost ... Natural. I think it's called eagles nest or Ravens nest or something like that. It's still ongoing and is on FFN
