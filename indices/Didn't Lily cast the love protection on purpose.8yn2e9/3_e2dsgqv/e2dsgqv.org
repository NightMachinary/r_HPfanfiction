We don't know. Given Diary Riddle knew about the effect, clearly it's written about somewhere (Restricted Section, most likely). And it's not like knowing about the effect prevents it from being brought out, you just have to meet the requirements of taking someone else's place in dying despite being given an explicit chance by the murderer to save yourself.

So it probably has nothing to do with talent, just moral character. No one can really argue that Lily isn't talented, it's just unclear if that's what the sacrificial protection is a result of.
