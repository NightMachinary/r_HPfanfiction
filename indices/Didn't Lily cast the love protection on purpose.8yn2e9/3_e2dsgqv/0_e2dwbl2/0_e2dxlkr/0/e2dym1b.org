It's just I don't have a problem with Lily being talented but the people like OP who post that she did on purpose and knew about it while ignoring what the author says are frankly being ignorant on purpose (or are trolls). I mean, the post history is a bit... trollish.

But what I do want to know is why people constantly make Lily the Magical savant and not James, while we know he was the top of his class. I don't have a problem as long as its an AU but my problem is that they forget all about James being 'exceptionally bright' as though they do it on purpose.
