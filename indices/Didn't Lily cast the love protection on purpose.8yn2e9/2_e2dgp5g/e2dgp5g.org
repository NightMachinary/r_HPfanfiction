Talent had nothing to do with the sacrifice. Look at how Harry invokes the love protection in the Deathly Hallows. He only has to willingly give himself up and accept his death, with the strongest desire within him to protect his friends and the other Hogwarts fighters. It has nothing to do with talent, and everything to do with one's capacity to love.

... Of course, this also leaves the question of why there aren't more people with the love protection, as I'm sure it isn't only Lily and Harry that have willingly given their lives for someone they loved throughout the course of Voldemort's wars. That, though, is probably a plot hole of Rowling's making, unless I'm missing something in this picture.
