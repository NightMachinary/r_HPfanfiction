It's not easy, ridiculously hard which is why only Lily could do it. Not even Dumbledore can do it. Lily was Morgan Le Fay reincarnate. She's the most powerful and intelligent and talented and skilled character in the entire series. It's literally in the books. No one can argue James and Sirius were more talented, canon makes a stronger case towards her while the Marauders are idiots.
