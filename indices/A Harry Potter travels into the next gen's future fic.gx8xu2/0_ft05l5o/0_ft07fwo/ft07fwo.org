Agreed with the fact that just the notion of not being the original characters might make them seem a little luck luster from the get go, and how they are written in the book kinda confirms that. It is not a rule, just a valid example in this case. However i read some pretty epic and creative characterizations of them in fanfics, proving yet again that fanon takes can be superior to the original material. Thank you for your suggestion, i will give it a go.
