I dont know such fic. But have something you can give a try if you want.

It is set in distant future of Hogwarts and Harry's great grandson is in Hogwarts. Though is not the primary character.

I think the next gen of heroes is actually kind of boring. I am not just speaking of wizarding world or Harry's gang but in general. Usually the successors of heroes are not that interesting as the Heroes themselves. I usually read next gen stories to see our heroes in the light of future.
