I think it's important to show that even though your character doesn't like Ron and Hermione, the story doesn't validate his feelings and believes. Having him scoff in his head at Ron's friendship with Harry is one thing, but discovering that Ron isn't loyal is another. Doing some dark stuff to them is one thing, getting away with it another.

In short, show that the OC isn't in the right and that Ron and Hermione aren't idiots, evil or easy targets.
