Why would Harry even want to be friends with someone who hates his other friends?

I'm pretty sure that every time I've seen something like that in a fic, it quickly descends into bashing, because they need to justify the Slytherin's actions and give Harry a reason to choose them over his friends. And anything that makes Harry choose to ditch his friends is almost guaranteed to be bashing.

The alternative is for your OC to realize that Harry's friends aren't so bad and eventually get along with them. And that probably wouldn't involve bashing.
