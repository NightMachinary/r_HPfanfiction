In my eyes, Ronald is an insecure, obnoxious ass, throughout the series. In my fic, Harry disappears for almost two years, and I let readers assume Ron's gotten better, and he did.

Then Harry comes back, and he's very different, both physically and mentally. Some things are revealed that make Ron's failings return, which causes him and Hermione to break up.

I wouldn't say I changed Ron's personality that much, because he's definitely not evil, nor useless, and would never, ever betray his friends. I just took what's already there, and took it up a notch.
