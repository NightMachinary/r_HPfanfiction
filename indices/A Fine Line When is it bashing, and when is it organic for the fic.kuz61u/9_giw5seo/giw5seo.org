Hello! I personally think people think of bashing in many different ways, but something I believe is true about some bashing, is they make them so evil and twist all of their actions.

Dumbledore: He's now stealing from Harry's vaults, and Ron is in on it!!!!!!

Sometimes they have the main character start hating that person/friend, but it can go so many different ways.

In a Hermione/Ron/Ginny bashing fic, all of the three were after his money.

Like I said, bashing comes in many forms and many ways, so good luck!

Can you link your fic?
