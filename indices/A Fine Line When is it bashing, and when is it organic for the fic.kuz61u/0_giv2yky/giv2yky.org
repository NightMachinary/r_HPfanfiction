If the only reason you can summarize his actions with are "it's because he's dumb/evil/a bitch-ass motherfucker" then it's bashing.

Example : Ronald Weasley befriended Harry to steal his money, because he's tired of being poor -> Bashing

Ronald Weasley stole money from his friend Harry because his family was way to poor to sustain itself, and way to proud to ask for money -> Negative depiction of Ron, but not yet bashing

Ronald Weasley took money from Harry, fully expecting to pay off his debts. He forgot after a while, mainly because life is a bitch -> Forgetfull friend Ron, not bashing.
