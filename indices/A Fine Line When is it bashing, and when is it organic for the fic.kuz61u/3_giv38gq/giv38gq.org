Honestly, there is very little fine line, since everyone in the fandom has their own mental interpretation of who that character is. Some people see Ron as a good, honest, brave friend and others see him as a feckless neo-Death Eater. Thus, bashing looks different to everyone. At the end of the day, there's no universally pleasing thing in the fandom, and there's no real way to do 'bashing' in a way that pleases everyone.

Your best bet is like A2i9 says. Give them thoughts and motivations behind their actions and make that dislike of Ron/Hermione feel like something your character would reasonably feel and you'll probably get most people at least semi-okay with what you're doing. Other people will flame at the slightest hint of mistreatment for their beloved characters, but that's the nature of the fandom, I'm afraid. :)
