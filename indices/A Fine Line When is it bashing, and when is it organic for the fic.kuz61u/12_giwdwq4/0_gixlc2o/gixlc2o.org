Sure! So it's 3rd person. My story is Canon-Compliant so basically everything is the same. My OC is dreadfully obsessed with Harry Potter, and is willing to do just about anything to be close to him. He's jealous, he's ambitious, and he's petty, but not outwardly so. He's muggleborn so he's an outcast in his own house, but he's still very much a Slytherin. He's been basically invisible to the main cast until 6th year. My goal is to make a character who you can't agree with, but somehow still root for. It was also a reason I made him not get along Harry's friends, characters who (I believed) everyone liked.

Here's an example of the relationship my OC has with Hermione:

" /Next entered Hermione Granger. It looks like she's the only Gryffindor who made it to N.E.W.T level potions, which wasn't really a surprise. It was actually a relief to find out Harry and Ron weren't going to be in this class. After what happened yesterday with Harry he didn't need the awkwardness of being in such a small class with him. He probably told Ron and Hermione some crazy Slytherin went off on him and Ron was the type to pick at that situation. If he told Hermione she would never say anything about it, she just wasn't that type. She began to walk in his direction./

/"Bias," she greeted him./

/"Hermione," he greeted back. They both rolled their eyes at each other as she sat down at the table in front of him. If Hermione had a rival anywhere, it was Jason in potions. They were constantly neck and neck when it came to the subject. Their interaction is always cold, yet sophisticated. "/

My OC's inner thoughts of Ron:

/"Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions," he complained, "a menace actually, so I probably should just be going---" Ron's annoying voice was irritating enough when he had to hear him always whining about something in the Great Hall and now Jason has to hear him here? Jason thought he was free of him this year, but that doesn't look to be the case. And on top of that Harry is there. He'll probably end up sitting at the same table with Hermione...across from Jason. So much for his lucky day.../

An example of the slightly cruel actions he takes:

/"---so you bleed all over a Slytherin and you just let him walk away without cleaning it off? Bloody hell Harry aren't you scared he'll put a curse on you or something?" Ron gawked./

/"Why because I bled on him?" Harry guessed./

/"No, he could use your blood to put a curse on you. I bet those Slytherins bathe in dark magic like that," Ron gushed. Jason couldn't help but feel extremely offended by that./

/"Percello," Jason whispered the jinx and aimed his wand at Ron from underneath the table desk. Jason's jinx slashed the foot of Ron's chair at just the right angle that Ron immediately got knocked down and falls on his back. Jason made sure to look super busy. He heard Dean laugh a little and immediately looked at Jason after. Hermione didn't pay any mind as she was trying to complete her potion./

and

/"I've actually had mine since last week. It had the original date on it before but it changed to next week. I asked Professor Slughorn and he said it was your fault. That you needed extra time on a project or something and he wanted everyone invited to be able attend his first dinner party of the year." She was basically throwing verbal daggers at Jason trying to cut down his pride a bit. Usually Jason cares very little what anyone thinks of him, but the rivalry he has with Hermione is intense. He almost wanted to tell her he was making Felix Felicis just to see the look on her face but he wasn't sure if he should. Instead he just smiled and slightly made her hair even frizzier than it is already. He wasn't worried Hermione would notice, she's probably had it look worse before./

/"Well see you around Hermione." Jason said with a smile as he walked away./
