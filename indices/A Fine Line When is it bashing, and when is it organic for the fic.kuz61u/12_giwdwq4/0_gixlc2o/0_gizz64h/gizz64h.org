Warning darling, I'm a bitch. I call it as I see it and I'm not particularly nice about it. I try to sneak in compliments but well...

So excerpt number 1.

Perfectly fine but I'm confused. I'm assuming the OC is named Jason Bias. Hermione refers to him presumably by his last name and he calls her by her first.

Without her permission (as they are clearly not on a first name basis). The result is condescending and it appears like Jason thinks himself better than her. I feel like you're trying to make them equals in potions and her a superior every where else but it's not working. Also you're telling not showing here. You're calling their rivalry sophisticated but another excerpt shows them as petty children trying to one up each other.

Does Jason think it's sophisticated? Is that what's going here? A character being immature while believing otherwise? And that continues until he gets the cliche scolding?

Also if he's been invisible for 5 years, how does he know their personalities? Is he a stalker, determined and possessive? Ultimately a shitty person but we stan because he's the protagonist? Does he even know the one claims to love? What does he know about Harry? Is he after him or his image? A way to break through the wizarding world despite his blood? Or is he just soothing his nerves by pretending to know who they are?

Excerpt 2 doesn't explain why Jason dislikes Ron. Does he even dislike at all? Because if he does why is he Ron and not Weasley? This doesn't come across as condescending. It comes across like Jason likes Ron but is in denial. So he tries to come up with reasons to dislike him and ends up with vague and useless results. It's like a boy pulling on a girls pigtails in primary school.

Also not that my opinion on any of this matters but I figured I might as well go all in. The dialogue tag “gushed” doesn't really work well there.

Back on topic, why is he mad at Ron for saying this? Is it a slight on his house (which he is on odds with) or a slight on him?

Why do either bother him to the point of jinxes?

You mentioned he's of a dark nature because he's a slytherin. Which to that I ask, why? Why isn't he just dark cause he's him? Cunning and ambition don't mean dark. Also what is dark? Dark magic? Or dark as in not anything the trio would do?

At this point in time I'd like to offer Harry and Hermione as exhibit A and B.

Hermione kept a woman in a jar and brewed an illegal substance.

Harry tried to use an unforgivable.

I'm just saying, they don't get to judge. And that's before Book 6.

Also how is Ron's little tumble cruel? I'm not getting it at all. Hermione sent birds at Ron that same year. And Ginny is praised for her hexes. This doesn't seem cruel in comparison.

The last excerpt just reinforced the first. Condescending.

Verdict: Hermione bashing is likely, OC has a secret crush on Ron and is in denial.

I'm very tired but that's what I got.
