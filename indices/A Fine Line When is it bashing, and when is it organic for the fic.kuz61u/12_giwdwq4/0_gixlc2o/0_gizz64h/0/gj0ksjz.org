Haha I very much enjoyed that. Thanks so much I actually think your feedback is very helpful!

My OC is also an exchange student. He's American, and Americans go by first names even if you aren't acquainted very well....at least that's how I grew up. I thought that was a quirk he would have.

The ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù word choice is more because I couldn't find another word for interactions that weren't always cold yet still unfriendly. They recognize each other's talents and only cut each other down a notch when they have no doubt they are justified in doing so. But I admit I don't like that word choice.

Jason knows the core three's personalities the way any classmate who has gone to school with them for 5 years would. Especially when those three are basically always in the middle of something that the whole school becomes aware of. He's just been a background character until this year lol. I imagine even a character who just sees them around Hogwarts constantly would have an idea of what they're like. Also the title of my Fic is ‚ÄúThe Boy Who Obsessed‚Äù for a bit more insight haha.

Ron being the bane of Jason's existence is more of their personalities just not meshing. We all had that one kid in school we disliked and disliked us back for no real reason at all. I thought I'd add that part of high school into Hogwarts. I do love that you think it's because he's got a crush but is in denial though. That would have been fun to play with.

Also definitely agree with gushed. I started this fic in 2016 (I'm 22 now, you can do the math lol) so I was playing around with ‚Äúinstead of said‚Äù-isms. I'm actually probably gonna go back to some of the chapters and revise them now that I'm very much diving head first into it again.

As for the darkness---personally when I think of Slytherins, I think of them having a dark side. Dark doesn't always mean evil to me though! Just...an edge. The people who think the ends justify the means, the morally gray characters, etc. So no, not necessarily dark as in dark magic. But Jason does things the trio would never do.

When I say cruel, I mean it more in a way of how teens can be cruel to each other. But Jason does commit some atrocities later on. (I also wanted to have heightened expectations for how cruel so if someone who is sensitive to bashing reads my fic they'll think it's mild and I was exaggerating...until it's too late ! Mwahaha. I maintain I don't believe I'm bashing any characters though!)

Anyways, any questions I didn't answer is because they are answered by the fic. You might have touched on actual plot points and motivations with your questions that I didn't want to spoil. Don't wanna give away the whole fruit basket here...just the nectarines üòÅ.

Overall I repeat this was amazing! I had a lot of fun reading this. Thanks for being so thorough!
