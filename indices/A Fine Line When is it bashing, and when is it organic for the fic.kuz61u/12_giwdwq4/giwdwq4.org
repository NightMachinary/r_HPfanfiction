Please can we have excerpts? From your post I have a feeling there'll be some Ron bashing.

Who's point of view is this written from? What flaws does the OC have? Why does he hate Ron? What house is Harry in? Is Harry friends with Ron?

As for bashing being a deal breaker...well I don't speak for anyone but myself but I can't stand it. If I see it, I'm not reading it.
