I think that some people will always miss the nuances of this, but if a character who is the one whose voice we're hearing is biased, then I generally put a disclaimer in the author's notes. There tends to always be people who still don't want to read a fic where their fave isn't talked up or whatever and that's their choice, but I get annoyed when people call that bashing.

It's like if I'm going to bash someone you'll know about it, lol
