I would just go with the easy way. Is the main purpose of a character's existence within your story to look stupid, be made fun of and get beat down? If the answer to that is "no", you are good.

Maybe others are more sensitive when it comes to bashing, but I would say that what I mentioned above is what the vast majority would define as the "fine line" when it comes to bashing.
