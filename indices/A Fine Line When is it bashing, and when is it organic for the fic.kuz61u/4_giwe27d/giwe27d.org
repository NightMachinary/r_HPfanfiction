From what you told in your post, the main reason why your OC dislike the Weasleys is because he is envious of them, he wish he could have the same relationship they have with Harry (best friend or . . . damsel in distress?).

I personally would not consider this as bashing, mainly because you did not downgrade these characters to justify an opinion. Your characters are the same than in canon (or at least "can be"), and this is these characters that are disliked by your MC (for bad reason I might add, mainly envy), not some bad parody of themselves who lost all their qualities.

You should still be ready for some people to cry about bashing, some Hermione fans can be riddiculous when they feel that their queen is disrespected, and fan of Ron and Ginny can be just as bad (though maybe in a lesser measure). But as long as you stay far from Traitor! Hermione, StupidPig! Ron and Slut! Ginny, most people would not care.

I would also add that your character can think whatever he wants about other characters, as long as you made it clear that it is a subjective, personal opinion. It is not surprising from Draco to think that Ron is a poor idiot, unworthy of his blood (it is even expected of the character), but I would consider it bashing if the same observation was made by the narrator, or even an move "objective" character (such as Dumbledore).
