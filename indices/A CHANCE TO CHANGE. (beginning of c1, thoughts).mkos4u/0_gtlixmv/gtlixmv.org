Better written than most fan-fictions with this trope. Some thoughts/Sugesstions/Advice:

Are you planning on giving Harry a backstory? If you do, It is better to tell it through interactions and what he reveals to Tom rather than writing a backstory chapter or through a bunch of flashbacks. Maybe make Tom learn of Harry's "past" like how Harry learned of Dumbledore's relationship with Grindewald.

Are you going to make Harry adopt Tom or manipulate him from the shadows? If He is going to adopt him, don't make Tom go to Slytherin. Make him go to other houses instead.

Is Harry the only one back in Time? I would expect Ron and Hermione or maybe Ginny(provided they survived the war) would want to help him in this endeavour. Come to think of it, I have never read a Golden Trio time travel story.
