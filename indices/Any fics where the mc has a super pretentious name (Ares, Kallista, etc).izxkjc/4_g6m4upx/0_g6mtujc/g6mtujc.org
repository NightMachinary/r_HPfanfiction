"Hadrian" is one of the most common names to use in "Harry is Lord A-Million-Last-Names, Dumbledore is trying to set him up to kill himself, the Weasleys are after his titles and money, luckily the Goblins will all bend over backwards for him because he remembered the name 'Griphook' and the Slytherins are friendly because Harry could ruin them with a word".

It's also a name that, if you look it up, a lot of baby-name websites will suggest "Adrian" instead because adding the H makes it 9001 times more likely for your baby to be bullied for having a shitty pretentious name.
