linkao3(From Ruin by GraeFoxx) has a defeated, mind tortured for a decade Harry Potter travel back in time to fix things, but something happens and he ends up having to masquerade as the heir to Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, taking the name Ares Flamel, because Nick thought it was a proper wizard name, but also because it was close enough to Harry that it's be easier to react.

The alternate world is also one where his parents are alive, and he had a twin brother, but it's completely unclear why Harry was nevertheless sent to live with the Dursleys, nor what happened to him at the Dursleys to make for the set of circumstances that brought about Ares Flamel.

I really like this fic and could gush about it for several paragraphs more, but I'll stop here for now.
