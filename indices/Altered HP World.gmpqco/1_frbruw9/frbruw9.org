I've written a few stories that would fit your request. "Patron" is an AU where the magical world developed differently since 1692. There's a caste system, mitigated a lot by custom, and wizards have a very different culture - more progressive in some areas, more conservative in others compared to muggles, and different countries have different cultures.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", Lucius Malfoy took control of Wizarding Britain in 1981, and formed the country according to his wishes. Muggleborns get taken from their homes and raised as loyal enforcers of his - like janissaries. Dumbledore moved to France with his supporters and is now, 20 years later, planning to return as Voldemrot has returned as well, and is already fighting Malfoy.
