Sidenote, does Tracey Davis exist canonically, or did some author just throw her in?

This one's a PJO x HP crossover. I've recommended it before, and was given the feedback that it's a bit confusing. I personally liked it. It's PJ x DG, and HP x TD. Harry's not the main character, but he's the secondary protagonist.
