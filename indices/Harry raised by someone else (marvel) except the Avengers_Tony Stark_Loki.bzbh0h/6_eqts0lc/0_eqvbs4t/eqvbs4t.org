I more meant, can you post fic refs for this premise.

I'm not really the arbiter of can and can not, wrt fanfics, but Indian!Harry and Black!Hermione are AOK in my opinion, and so are in-universe name changes.

Wrt ships, I'm a massive lesbian so anything outside of f/f holds no interest for me. That being said, a student being shipped with someone more than 2 years older than them is an instant “don't read”
