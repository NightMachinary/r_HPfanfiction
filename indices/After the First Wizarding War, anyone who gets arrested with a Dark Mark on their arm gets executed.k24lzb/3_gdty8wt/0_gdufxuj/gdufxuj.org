  Assuming the ministry DID try to seize it would the goblins allow them to do so? If they did not would the ministry risk escalating the war even further by risking another goblin rebellion on top of the continued civil war?

I loved your whole analysis but this particular point is one that I always questioned myself. I think that storywise it makes more sense that the Goblins don't allow this, as it would ease the canon explanation of the death eater's forgiveness in the 1st war.

A country in a post-war setting would be more willing to look to the other side when a rich person is involved. Coco Channel is a perfect example of this, in the real world.
