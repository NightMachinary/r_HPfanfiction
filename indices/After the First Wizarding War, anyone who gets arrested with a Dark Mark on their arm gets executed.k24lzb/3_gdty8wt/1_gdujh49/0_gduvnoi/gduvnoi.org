  As far as I know only Voldemort himself knew how to give the Dark Mark and was much too full of himself to use his Dark Mark in such a manner.
#+end_quote

That's a fair point. In canon I truly don't know if that's the case or not, its entirely possible you're right about that. In a fanfic context I would argue the author should be free to determine if that's the case or not. I think it could be well written either way, but personally if I was writing it I wouldn't have it be the case. If it were that case it'd slam the door on what I think could be an interesting plot point to explore. Were I to write it if anyone who has the mark would be able to bestow it upon others. The head-canon I'd run with is that the the spell to grant the dark mark is the same spell used to produced the version raised over the site of a death eater attack. When it is applied to the skin instead of cast into the air, it takes the form of the dark mark that is marked upon death eaters. While Voldemort himself created the spell, I'd write it so that it was possible for those he marked to in turn mark others. I think it's entirely possible that the news of death eaters doing what I suggested would anger Voldemort once he discovers a way back to a body however long that takes. If that was the case he could then forbid death eaters from employing it afterwords, but I think doing so would be a case of him catching the villain idiot ball. Assuming it isn't possible though, I could think of other ways around that restriction too that desperate death eaters may try ranging from Glamour charms applied in a permanent manner to something as mundane as a muggle tattoo or brand to make it a passable enough facsimile to where questions are raised. Are unspeakables or some other manner of subject matter experts verifying at a trial that every mark is legitimately a proper dark mark and not just a forgery? Or is anyone found with the mark subject to summary execution on the spot?

  I think you think the goblins have more autonomy than mentioned in canon.
#+end_quote

I'd argue that once again this is a fanon environment so the capacity for the goblins to cooperate or make trouble ultimately is the author's prerogative. That said in canon I think there's enough evidence just from Harry's time in history of magic class to suggest that historically the goblins have been relatively quick to attempt a rebellion when they aren't satisfied with the state of affairs. In this fanon story-line the ministry would be attempting to mount what is essentially a financial coup while in the middle of a decade long civil war that has left it significantly weakened due to both outright losses and covert infiltration by enemy sympathizers. I see several ways the ministry's attempts could be written in this story. You could assume the ministry does have the capacity to force the Goblins to comply with their demands and that they do so without offering any form of concessions to goblins in exchange. At a minimum I think this option is likely to build resentment in the goblins making them more susceptible to possible recruitment by surviving death eaters or a returned Voldemort as he attempted to do with other oppressed magical species in canon. Alternatively the goblins could be convinced to go along with the ministry's plan perhaps if the gold itself remained within the goblin controlled system in ministry maintained vaults. I could easily see a subplot within that manner of story where a non-marked yet sympathetic to the DE cause official within the ministry could either co-opt the money for the cause indirectly, or use it to empower himself while he makes a play for greater power within the ministry. The potential splinter faction I mentioned previously could also easily play into that story line. Both this option and the last option leave a scenario where the families of death eaters are stripped of their wealth, their families are (from their perspective) unjustly executed. That'd be prime recruitment material among the next crop of Hogwarts students once Voldemort returns to a new body. Finally I can see a story where the ministry tries and fails to force the goblins into compliance due to it's weakened state from the civil war. The consequences to this failure could range from anything from a begrudging rebuff from the goblins without a lot of change to the status quo to an outright war between the ministry and the goblins in another all out goblin rebellion.

  A criminal marked for death on the run and cut off from his assets is better than still in power advancing his master's with political means instead of curses.

  But he'd have it much harder then without his rich supporters being inside of the enemy.
#+end_quote

I decided to address these last two points together. I think you've got a point about the first part of the first quote, but as it's directly linked with the second idea I still wanted to address it together. While financially it may be somewhat harder with some, a majority, or even all of his richest supporters cut off I think in some ways Voldemort would ultimately have a much easier time of continuing his campaign if he was able to come back sooner. Yes in the short term in the political arena his options may be more limited than in canon, but this is also a timeline where he does not need to rely on supporters to advance his objectives politically as opposed to continuing his terror campaign/civil war. Clausewitz said that war is a continuation of politics by other means, and I think that would very much be the case for Voldemort in this story line. In canon most of his supporters pay lip service to their devotion when Voldemort finally returns, but in truth they were largely content with the status quo that had arisen after his first downfall. They had convinced themselves that their former master was gone for good, and even if he wasn't truly and completely dead he had no realistic way to return to whatever height of power he once held. In canon it took the actions of just two death eaters neither of which had any assets of any significance of their own to see of to return Voldemort to power. What could a properly motivated network of 20 do? Or 200? 2000? The scale of his remaining forces the author decides on ultimately isn't nearly as important as the fact that he'd have significantly more than two sufficiently motivated followers utterly devoted to returning him to power. Completely motivated and largely united in purpose to search out even the faintest whisper of his presence it wouldn't take nearly long enough for him to return. And once he does what would that return from death do psychologically to both his supporters and his enemies? To his supporters it would be a massive moral boost to have their lord back from the dead so soon, and it an absolute affirmation of their fanaticism to him. Yes Harry Potter may have lived, but he did not defeat their lord. And at this most desperate moment he returns to them, ready to rise again and continue what (from their perspective) is a righteous cause. What sort of zealotry would that inspire in his followers? And what sort of terror would it inspire his enemies. Financially a more rapidly re-risen Voldemort may start off on the back foot, but what rallied so many people his cause in the first place was his charisma, and I certainly don't see him lacking in that once he's back. Longer term financially the death eaters could finance operations via liberal use of veiled threats to those who are still wealthy, overt coercion and intimidation against the populace through force, or subtle use of the imperius on useful targets.

I have to say I just started some preliminary work on my own first fic that has nothing to do with the idea that started this thread, but I could envision so many ways you could write this sort of plot hook into a fic in it's own right. Personally I'd really like to try my hand at it at some point. I think it's a plot bunny begging for a proper story, whether it's you, me, or anyone else on the board that happens to come along and see it that writes it.
