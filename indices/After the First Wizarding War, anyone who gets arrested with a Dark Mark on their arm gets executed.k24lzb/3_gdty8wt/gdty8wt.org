The problem I could see with this is that it would mean that the first wizarding war would likely continue well after the point it ended in canon. In canon many of the rich death eaters were handed an easy out when the dark lord disappeared by coming forward and claiming they only acted under duress and weren't in control of their actions. It was an easy out for the death eaters, but also an easy out for the country too. Both sides got to cease the violence and begin rebuilding. Sure there was a lot of very obvious wink wink nudge nudge to how obviously corrupt that system was, but from canon we learned that the war was already not going well before Voldemort's disappearance. Obviously this out wouldn't exist for either side once the first one of the lords came forward claiming to take the mark only under the Imperius and was executed for his or her trouble. Instead of peace, that would only escalate the conflict as the death eaters became more desperate and/or vindictive. While they were certainly evil, many of Voldemort's followers weren't exactly stupid. Many would likely go to ground or even go into exile out of the country if it became necessary. Either way in the underground on the run, or out of the country on the run the DE become far more motivated than they are in canon to seek out any trace of Voldemort. The signs and rumors of his continued existence were there, it was just that in canon there was little motivation to even begin to seek them out. In this timeline I can easily see a scenario where Voldemort manages to find a way back to a real body far more quickly than in canon.

I could see a scenario where if it wasn't already an adopted tactic death eaters beforehand, death eaters would target their enemies and forcibly make them take the dark mark under duress of some manner whether by use of the Imperius curse, or threats to the life of the target's family. Then after the target has the mark, the DE pass along information covertly to their sympathizers which likely still exist within the Ministry. That would lead to their enemies their enemies being executed legally for their supposed crimes. Sure you'd get some of Voldemort's followers, but you'd also end up executing innocent people too if the no tolerance policy was adopted. Ironically that'd likely be able to draw more people to the DE's cause as a reaction to the ministry's action. The dark lord was dead, and yet the Ministry continues to execute his (supposed) victims who were "forced" to take the mark. You might even see a scenario where there is a schism within the ranks of the death eaters. While some death eaters search for Voldemort, others may co-opt the movement to continue the war against the ministry for a different aim under different leadership. Sure Lucious may not be as powerful as Voldemort, but he could certainly be dangerously charismatic in other ways assuming he wasn't the one who came forward to be executed.

On a final note what would such a ministry do with the mini death eaters? Those who were still in school, not yet ready to take the dark mark themselves, but who certainly sympathized with the cause and now had far more reason to hate the ministry. These children would likely inherit the assets their family's had assuming the ministry didn't try to seize whatever wealth those families had. Assuming the ministry DID try to seize it would the goblins allow them to do so? If they did not would the ministry risk escalating the war even further by risking another goblin rebellion on top of the continued civil war?

All in all I could see this idea leading to a much darker new world in a myriad of ways for Harry to find himself in when he turned 11. Could make for a great fic.
