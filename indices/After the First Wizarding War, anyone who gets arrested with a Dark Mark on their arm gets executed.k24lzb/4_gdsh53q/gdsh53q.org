1. Peter and Barty survive ( his mum convinces his dad to let him live & to let her be executed) and Voldemort comes back to life as in canon.

2. Since Lucius is dead, the diary remains hidden in the manor and Dumbledore cannot figure that Voldemort has horcruxes or he will figure it out later than canon.

3. Without an audience, Voldemort may just shoot a killer at Harry at the graveyard and as there's nobody to lie and even if Wormtail lies to Voldemort about Harry's death, Voldemort may have enough time to shoot a killing curse at Harry's back when he's running to grab the portkey.

4. If Sirius is executed under false charges, then the Order never gets No. 12 Grimmauld Place and the hunt for the locket will be prolonged if everything else goes according to canon.
