  They may even look harder whether he's really guilty if he has none.

Going by your initial post that doesn't naturally follow. Malfoy not being able to at least reduce his sentence makes it more likely they're also more extreme in case of Sirius and execute him on the spot instead of "just" throwing him into prison without trial.

I assume you have a specific set of circumstances in mind for the start of the story - i.e. all Death Eaters dead and Sirius going free? What might lead to this is the government wanting to root out support for Voldemort on all levels. They still wouldn't necessarily give Sirius a trial but question him to find more unmarked agents and in result discover his innocence (major ramification in Peter getting exposed) or at least weird inconsistencies.

Tangent: there's potential for a (noir) detective story here. Veritaserum seems dependent on the questions asked. For all they know Sirius acted spontaneously, he cannot name a reason why he betrayed the Potters, wasn't instructed by anyone, didn't work with anyone. He is convinced certain people are Death Eaters (similar to Ron thinking all Slytherins are evil) and names those. An auror investigates because someone beloved is implicated. What do they do when saving the beloved comes into conflict with saving Sirius, whose innocence they discovered.
