2) signet rings that bear the family crest, to be used as identification or seal and authenticate communication was in fact in use when aristocracy was in charge of government. It isn't too much of a stretch that magic might be used to ID and safeguard the owner of said ring as the head of a prominent wizarding family whose members are invested in preserving their particular lineage. A ring is both visible when needed and can be made discreet if required, plus they are a gender neutral piece of jewelry.

I'm sure if wedding rings are a thing in the wizarding world, they'd have a magical element to them as well, anchoring a strict or lax contract (based on the purpose of the marriage or the personal relationship of those involved) to the ornament that's used as it's symbol for the rest of the married person's life.

A family with power and wealth in an aristocratic culture would definitely have all kinds of personal possessions that identify its members, with the identifier changing even based on an individual's prominence within the family. Every thing from bed linens and underwear to stationary to jewelry were personalized with a crest or somesuch by European aristocracy at one point, and maybe even now if they've retained the wealth to back up their titles.

Tl:Dr magical signet ring to identify the head of a family and maybe keep them safe isn't too much of a stretch.
