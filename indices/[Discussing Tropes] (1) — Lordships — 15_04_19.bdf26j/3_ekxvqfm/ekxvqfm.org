Did you forget family magicks? It exist in almost all Lordship fanfic.

The thing that bothers me the most is with Lordship trope is how worthless everyone but the Lords are. They can't do anything impactful to Wizarding Britain without some involvement of a Lord.

You can invent a new potion for werewolf cure? Sure, find a powerful family to support you. You're a genius at transfiguration? Get close to a family so they can help you find a Mastery. If you're not one part of X family in britain, however big your contribution are you can only be a small note in a history book. Hermione/Lily/Ginny is lucky because when she marry to House Potter, then her accomplishment will be known. And even then they will be known as an 'extension' of many success of House Potter.

A muggleborn can create as many potion and spell as they like but their name will never be as prestigious as a Lord. And you can't really hope for that to change, since the Lords has existed for more than a thousand year.

Your MC want to change the system? Sure, but make them a Lord first. You could also make them a muggleborn that has a Lord best friend/romantic interest, doesn't matter.
