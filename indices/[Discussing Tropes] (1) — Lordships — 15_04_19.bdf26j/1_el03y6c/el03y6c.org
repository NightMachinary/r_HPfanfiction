My own thoughts on the pros and cons of Lordships:

*Cons*

- Wizarding Britain is culturally similar to Muggle Britain. They celebrate the same holidays, which have become similarly secular/consumerist, the dating culture is the same, the economy is that of regulated capitalism, the government has a professional civil service with a similar culture, the Minister for Magic is elected, etc. It is therefore rather jarring to have the wizarding world possess a functional nobility, especially in the feudal nature fanfic often uses (something that was abolished in Muggle England in 1290).

- Harry just inheriting a load of political power is boring and lacks conflict.

- Political power being supported by magic (as is often the case in these fics) makes politics boring. One of the most important themes in political fiction is the distinction between de jure and de facto power ("Any king who needs to say I am the King is no king."). This difference is one of the key drivers of conflict in a political story. Most Lordship fics remove it entirely by having magic itself enforce the political structure.

- The Potter family wealth having existed since time immemorial removes the opportunity to tell an interesting story about how it was acquired.

*Pros*

- Muggle Britain still has a nobility, though their political significance is heavily reduced. It makes sense, given the parallels between society, that magical Britain would also have a largely *defunct* nobility.

- Nobility can be used to emphasise inequality themes which run through the books and which I find particularly interesting when the inequality is that of class or socio-economic status.
