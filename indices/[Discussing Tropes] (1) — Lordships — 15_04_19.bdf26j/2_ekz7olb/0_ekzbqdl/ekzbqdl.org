Of course, the dos and don'ts are just suggestions to keep the story balanced and interesting; not everyone will want to have Harry struggling in his political career, and if Lord Harry is simply a subplot point then having a weakened Potter family could negatively affect the story. Like almost every other trope, it really isn't a problem as long as you can write well. Really the thing that most people seem to dislike about lordships is having an OP character, and that's just bad writing, and not limited to this trope either.
