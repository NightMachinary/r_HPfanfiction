You have listed "Do: make the Potters an average importance house, and give someone else tons of political power." This seems more appropriate to determine on a per-story basis, to me. I've read a lot of good stories where the Potters are a really old, very wealthy family. It's a plot point, but not /the/ plot point, if that makes sense. For me, this can go both ways. It just depends on how the story is using that plot device.

Personally, I like Lordships as I think they make a lot of sense based on where canon was based and the culture that JKR created. Creating a culture where they use quills and candles and then expecting their government to have magically progressed to modern democracy doesn't make any sense. On the other hand, I agree with you, having Harry be the Lord of The Universe with twelve wives isn't an enjoyable read. More realistic uses of Lordships, perhaps where it is even still land-based, would be awesome.
