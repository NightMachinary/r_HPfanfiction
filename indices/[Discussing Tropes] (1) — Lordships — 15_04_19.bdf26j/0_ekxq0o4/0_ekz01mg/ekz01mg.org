Good point, I should have made it abundantly clear, in all capitals, that the list of dos and don'ts is my opinion on the matter. Sorry about that. I seemed to have miss typed IMO as IMM. ; )

But all that aside, your points are valid, and kinda the whole point of me making this Post, to discuss it with other people; First, I completely forgot the trope of using rings to defend against mind magic, and while I'm not saying you /can't/ use the rings for those things you mentioned... yeah, actually I completely agree with you, I had just forgotten all but their basic functions of signing post & magical coronation.
