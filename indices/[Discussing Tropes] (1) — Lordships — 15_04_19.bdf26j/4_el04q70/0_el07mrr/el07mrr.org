In regards to tagging, simply add the appropriate line of text ([1-7],[8+],[AU]) at the beginning or end of your comment so someone (probably me) can easily find which comments fall into each category when they are searching for certain things.

True, but there are some tropes (eg. everyone betraying Harry) which are really, /really/ hard to do right. Sfu69 mentioned some things about house rings too, and as I told him/her/them, I kinda honestly forgot about them.

Thanks for your comments. :)
