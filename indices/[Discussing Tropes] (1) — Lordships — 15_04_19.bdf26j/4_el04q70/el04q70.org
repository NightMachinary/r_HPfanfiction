First of all, I don't remotely understand your system for tagging comments, if that's what it was? Just scrap that. But for real if there isn't a thread about trunks I'm gonna be bummed. Moving on.

I think that anything /can/ be done well, so long as there is a point to it in the story.

House rings are a great example. Usually they're utterly pointless. Like, they detect love potions and turn invisible if you don't want them to be seen, but none of it matters in the story. Just a few wasted paragraphs in a story that's probably pretty boring and abandoned fairly early. However, I'm glad they were included in I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by Kathryn518, because she used them in a way that emotionally impacted Harry a lot in his past, and ended up being his primary motivation in the present.

That's why I feel like there aren't /really/ any tropes that are just 100% bad. Surely there's some talented mofo in this community that can make even the cringiest trope an integral part of their work. The key is to make it matter to the character, because otherwise it won't matter to us.
