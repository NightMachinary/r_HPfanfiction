If you think Voldemort/Harry is odd, then Death of Today by epic solemnity. (On Fnet) it's also a very violet and dark story, but it's one of my all-time favorites.

Also, if Cedric/Hermione is odd, then Finding Himself by minisinoo (on Fnet). It's not dark or violent, but it is really really good AU where Cedric is crippled rather than killed in the maze. And where he (believably) falls in love with Hermione.
