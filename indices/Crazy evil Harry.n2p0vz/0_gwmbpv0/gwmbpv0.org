They should be read in that order. Now, at the beginning, it seems like a sterotypical dark harry. But he goes crazy, gradually. Burning villages and torturing his servants and cuddling with dementors crazy. Tiro is an amazing author! He's not at hogwarts, but he's very crazy evil Harry, especially in the first book. He eventually chills, and kidnaps a few kids, adopts them, and just casually murders on ocassion rather than all the time.
