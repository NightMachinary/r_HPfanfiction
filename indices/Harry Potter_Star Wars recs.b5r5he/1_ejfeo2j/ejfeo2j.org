well, I tried to find your comment & failed, so.

Tbh there's just a major lack of HP/SW fics to rec.

linkffn(Magic of the Force) I forgot about this one, but it updates occasionally.

linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force) I've never read it, but everyone recs it, so I assume it's good. it also has a sequel.

linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair)

linkffn(Last Second Savior), classic Plums story, Harem and all that, but I enjoyed it.

Yeah huh, that's all I've got.
