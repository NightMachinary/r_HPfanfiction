The IATB duology has been mentioned and linked before. I enjoyed it because it's a fully-fledged HP/SW crossover that is largely set on Earth and in the wizarding world. There's more planned for the series, but while the author is still around and reading fanfiction. he/she has been silent for a year on new releases. Then again, it may just take a while to prepare and get out another epic-length story like the previous two.

Darth Marrs isn't everyone's cup of tea, but since there were already two other SW crossovers mentioned, why not add another one? Revenge of the Wizard linkffn(10912355) is about a post-epilogue canon Earth that gets discovered by an Empire that's up to their typical evil ways and what happens after they clash. Why I enjoyed it: the tale has some interesting magic vs force interactions and the author is known for following through with the bitter consequences of his set-ups.

I liked the humor and personal interaction between Harry and Leia in the early chapters of Shiver me Timbers linkffn(11675231), a story in which Earth eventually develops into the ice-planet Hoth. The author had a long hiatus after the first half a dozen chapters and it's been really slow going since. Not sure exactly, since I haven't kept up with it, but I do remember enjoying it back when it started posting initially.

Sadly there' so much uninspired crap out there that builds upon the same idea that bluminous8 first used in his Sword and Magic fic. Out of all of them, I probably like the original (before it was rewritten and only partially reposted) the best.
