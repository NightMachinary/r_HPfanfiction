What are you talking about?

It's cookie cutter plot filled with cliches..

And what do you mean knowing star wars lore? There's no SW mythos, almost nothing about jedi/code/techniques. Just some statements what the jedi did and a power-up for Harry.

It's barely even a SW crossover, it's basically just Harry with more powers and a lightsaber.
