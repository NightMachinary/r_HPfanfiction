Ron is ambitious. Remember the mirror of Erised? Remember how it sometimes pains him to be in Harry's shadow?

Hermione is absolutely ruthless, and on occasion downright vicious. At the age of 12, she comes up with a plot to drug two classmates and steal their identity by brewing and taking a highly restricted potion and that's just the beginning. She kidnaps and blackmails Rita Skeeter. She proposes founding a defence group directly under Umbridge's nose. She leads Umbridge into the forest to let Grawp and the centaurs deal with her. She wipes her own parents' memories.

Harry has Slytherin's own prized talent of parseltongue. Character-wise, I'd argue he is the least "Slytherin-ish" of the trio.
