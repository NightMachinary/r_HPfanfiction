Depends on what traits you really see as defining of Slytherin, which in many ways varies from person to person:

- Harry - already settled into a non-trivial amount of prestige and political power do to the whole BWL thing. Views the rules as something that are good sometimes, but can be broken for your own wants and desires. Determined to follow through with his desires at any cost (see HBP and DH mysteries as proof).
- Ron - aside from the whole blood purity of his family, he has a more wizarding background than Harry or Hermione. Even if there not wealthy, the Weasleys are very much a part of the culture. Ron's also dedicated to and generally proud of his family (sort of), which say what you want seems to be a common aspect of purebloods and Slytherin House (family loyalty). He also has a more blunt approach, which fits Slytherin depending on how you view many of the more thuggish individuals in the House.
- Hermione - someone who was extremely idealistic initially, then found the world is much more grey than black and white (a bit like Draco and possibly Snape). Is much more cognizant of minutae of politics and behavior than most others. Like Harry, she seems to value respecting the rules, but just as often she knows how to skate or even turn those rules against others (see her reasoning for the Hog's Head Inn meeting in OotP). Hermione is arguably the consummate lawyer, which makes sense given some of her post-DH career work.

But these are my opinions, and as I said the relative 'fit' of each house really comes down to much of our innate biases and relative values to each house characteristic.
