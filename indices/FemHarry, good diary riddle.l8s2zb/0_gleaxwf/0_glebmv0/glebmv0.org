You just write linkao3 or linkffn (depending on where it is hosted) and then the title and author in brackets. The author is not always necessary and the bot usually find the fic even of you misspelled something.

E.g:

Linkao3(You Get What You Give By Watermellonsmellinfelon)

Linkffn(You Get What You Give By Watermellonsmellinfelon)
