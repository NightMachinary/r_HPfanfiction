linkffn(The Arithmancer) features Hermione as specifically a maths genius, revolutionising arithmancy and inventing lots of new spells. The first book is quite good, second is a bit Mary-Sue but still does some interesting world building. Third one is much shorter and ends with the Statute of Secrecy becoming unsustainable and being taken down.
