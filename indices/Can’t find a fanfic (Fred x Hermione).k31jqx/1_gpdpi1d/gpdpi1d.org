Hi I know this post is from a million years ago and I don't know how I stumbled across it again but since replying to this post the first time, I've read the fic and loved it (it's one of my faves) so I was able to recognize it the second time around.

Is it this one: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15775893/chapters/36701574]]

Fred's girlfriend is Katie not Angelina but Hermione does in a way come between them because she needs Fred. I hope if you were still looking for it that this is the one!
