I prefer Vox Corporis' take on the animagus transformation.

In the first stage, which is also the longest and the most difficult, you enter into a meditative state in order to get in touch with nature and in this state, you magically identify 'tokens' (leaves, sticks, grass, hair etc) which you feel a connection to, and collect them.

Once you have sufficient tokens, you prepare a potion using them. Then, on a full moon night, a ritual is performed using the potion and the tokens in order to induce your first transformation.

Most wizards and witches fail in the first stage itself. It is hinted that ignoring your actual tokens or forcing unrelated items as tokens can have bad consequences.
