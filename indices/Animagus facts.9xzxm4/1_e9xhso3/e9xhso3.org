JKR - good writer, horrible world builder. Animagi, ability to transfigure most anything, space expansion charms - basically, she made magicals very powerful/capable with few limits to their power, but in order for her plot to work she had to ignore all that. So, we just get the idea that most magicals are lazy or incompetent.
