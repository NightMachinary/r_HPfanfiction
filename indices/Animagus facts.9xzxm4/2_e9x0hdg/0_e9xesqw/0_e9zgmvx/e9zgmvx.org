  Wait what, canonically the wand doesn't transform? Does that mean McGonagall is constantly dropping her wand when she does this? What about Skeeter and her bug animagus?! That constraint makes the transformation much more useless.

Most likely the shock of the first transformation would end up causing the person to drop their wand since the previous paragraph suggests you may loose control of yourself.
