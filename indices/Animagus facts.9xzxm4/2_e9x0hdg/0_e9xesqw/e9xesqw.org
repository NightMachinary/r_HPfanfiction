  When your transformation is complete you should find yourself physically comfortable. You are strongly advised to pick up your wand at once, and hide it in a place of safekeeping, where you will be able to find it when you regain a human form.

Wait what, canonically the wand doesn't transform? Does that mean McGonagall is constantly dropping her wand when she does this? What about Skeeter and her bug animagus?! That constraint makes the transformation much more useless.
