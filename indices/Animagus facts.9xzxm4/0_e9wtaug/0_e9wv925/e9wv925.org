I do believe it's from /Pottermore/. It's also really stupid. As I posted recently, I have a theory that it's written that way in all the books, but that's a deterrent for idiots, and the cumbersome process is actually code for the /real/ magical technique.

Which I don't imagine to be the "potion + meditation" combo that seems so prevalent in fanfiction, of course, but rather a form of wandless self-Transfiguration that requires a combination of skill at Transfiguration, and the same sort of abilities you need to successfully Apparate.

(Notifying OP since it's of interest to them as well and I don't want to post the same thing twice: [[/u/Eawen_Telemnar]] )
