  The only thing that bugs me about this is that it makes me wonder why Dumbledore isn't an animagus.

What's to say he isn't? The animagus transformation is far more useful if nobody knows you can do it (ex: Rita Skeeter, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew). I imagine that within the animagi community, "registered animagus" is said with an audible sneer on /registered/.
