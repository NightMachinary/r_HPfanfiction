I've heard this too, and it honestly hasn't made a ton of sense to me either. It seemed more like a way to make the transformation as complex as possible so as to avoid having animagi become too common.

I've thought that a better explanation would be just to keep it simple -- make it a really, really advanced Transfiguration skill (and JKR makes it clear that Transfiguration is one of the toughest subjects at Hogwarts). The only thing that bugs me about this is that it makes me wonder why Dumbledore isn't an animagus. He was a Transfiguration master, so it seems logical that if Minerva can do it (let alone the Marauders), then he should be able to as well.

Is this ever explained by JKR?
