Yeah, I remember reading something like that but I didn't know if it was canon or fanon... Then again, for something canon, it is not overly used in fanfics. And I don't really see the link between having mandrake in your mouth for a month and being a Transfiguration master like McGonagall... Seems a bit weird to me...

Thanks for the answer though ^^
