There is actually canon info on becoming an animagus, I think maybe on Potternore? It's a several stage process which involves having a mandrake in your mouth for a month and for a spell during an electrical storm? When it goes wrong you can be left permanently half animal like the woman in the hospital in ootp. Something like that. I can't remember where I read it.
