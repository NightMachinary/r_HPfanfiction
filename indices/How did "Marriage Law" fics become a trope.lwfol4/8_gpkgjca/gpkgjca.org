Like many tropes we have, I blame the other wildly popular fanfiction community, the Naruto one(of which I am part of too).

Many of the tropes we see in HP can be traced back to them, and I think, as a whole, their community is older.

-Arranged Marriages, ha! CRA(Clan Restoration Act), lol, also this was a custom that the Japanese kept for longer than most of the Western countries did, and wasn't limited to Major Houses or Royalty like Europe did after the Middle Ages, either.

-Titles? Heir Potter? I remember many fics where they brought the whole -sama thing there, and used some old feudal Japanese custom where people were addressed as Heir or Heiress, though IIRC only in very formal events, not when they meet in school.

-Naruto in fanfictions also has the habit of being given lots of surnames that end up hyphenated.

Though I think if you asked the same question there they would say it was the HP's Community "fault".

I don't think we can get a straight answer, probably got very popular with some challenges but the trope was already there, it's not like we can point at the Harry/Fleur and say it was started by Letters, even if for many it mostly was.
