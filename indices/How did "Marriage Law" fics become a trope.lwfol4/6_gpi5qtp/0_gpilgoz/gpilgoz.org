I agree that Voldemort would probably do something like this.

But most of the marriage law fics I've seen have the premise that the war is over, Voldemort lost, and now the population needs to increase and also the pure blood families need new blood because they keep having squibs and purebloods can only have one child (canon evidence- Draco is an only child). So it gets put forward by Kingsley as Minister and usually Hermione is the only one to see it for the utter madness it is. By the end she changes her mind because she luuuurves Draco now.

I much prefer your idea, that it could be used to show parallels between the death eaters and irl cults. But all too often it's presented as something reasonable, done by the good guys, to "protect wizarding society."
