I think this trope makes a lot of sense, even though I don't enjoy most of these fics. Forced and/or arranged marriages are part of our recent history, and still the custom in some cultures. Cult leaders have often ordered mass marriages of their followers, two recent examples are Isis and the Unification church in South Korea. It doesn't seem that unlikely to me that Voldemort might order such a thing.
