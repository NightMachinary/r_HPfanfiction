  Obviously doesn't work like that in real life.

Hold on there. /Forced/ to live together, maybe not, but merely arranged by someone other than the couple themselves - well, be cautious about knocking what you haven't tried. It seems plausible to me that in many cases, parents or even impersonal algorithms might achieve a pretty favourable success rate compared to the way people choose for themselves.

Especially when an arranged marriage naturally comes with the expectation that happiness will require adaptation and work. Setting realistic expectations is a good starting point.
