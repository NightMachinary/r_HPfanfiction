Ah I was thinking about relationships between canonical good w/ canonical bad guys as the other ship names you mentioned had that. So for Dracius, the only name I could think that ended in -ius of was (*shudders*) Lucius, and since both Draco and Lucius were bad I figured I missed a character's name somewhere.
