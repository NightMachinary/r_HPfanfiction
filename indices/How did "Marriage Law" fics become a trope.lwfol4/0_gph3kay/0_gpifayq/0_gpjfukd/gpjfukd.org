I've actually seen some subvert the trope this way, like Harry is forced to marry but he and the spouse just have drastically different world views and never get along, just tolerate each other, like recent divorce'es. Then there one that did even that wrong where Gabrielle accidentally vela binds her self to harry, and begins to realize it's not a story book thing, but has emotional and physical repercussions. She is willing to work with Harry to try to at least be friends. Harry for some reason comes off very juvenile and whiny, even though he is now free of the dursleys, he simply lothes having another thing in his life he can't control, and refuses to accept the bond, acting super emo. This damages the bond and makes it they have to be close to each other or Gabby could die. He is even told simply accepting the bond will alleviate this, and learning to love Gabby will fix it completely, but no he continues to emo for like ten chapters.

I had to skip to the end and the epilogue was basically they never reconcile, Harry is an asshole emo and they live stuck together with Harry hating Gabby with a passion.
