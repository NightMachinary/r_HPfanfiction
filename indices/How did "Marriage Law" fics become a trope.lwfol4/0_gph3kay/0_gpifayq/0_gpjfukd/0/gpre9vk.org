Sorry, but calling someone "emo" because they've been shackeled to a person for the rest of their life, uprooted from their home country and everyone they've ever known, and are now treated as a piece of incolvenient luggage is bullshit. And saying "he just needs to love her" is such an incredibly ignorant statement, too.

Oh yeah, Harry should have just accepted and loved her. Because love is such a simple emotion that is very easily created, not the most speculated-about emotion in all of philosophy and literature, or the /literal force of nature/ that it is in HP.

Love is like faith - you can't force it. Every couple that's divorced can attest to that. Saying that being depressed over the loss of your freedom is "being emo" is such a fucked up statement, too. It's like saying "just don't be sad lol" to a depressed person.
