I'm not talking about it being hard I'm taking about a 14 year old acting like a seven year old, yes it's a fucked situation, yes it's terrible and hard. But canon harry was not only willing but would have preferred living with a near stranger in a dilapidated house simply because he showed an iota of actual care and was friends with his father than live with the dursleys. The only reason he didn't was that Sirius was still a wanted criminal in hiding, and dumbledore wanted him to live under those protections.

A kid more grown up than most adults after everything he has faced to that point, in another unusual and unwanted situation that affects his life, who has been shown to plough ahead and deal with shit situations and make the best of them, having his desire to leave the dursleys fuffiled. And he all of a sudden hates his friends, hates his life, becomes a depressed shut-in and even after years basically suffers through the situation because then at least it's his choice. It's a product of the writing and the way the author strings the plot but he basically took canon harry, placed him in this situation, and harry went from being the kid who would face death to save a friend, face down a basalisk, fight Voldemort. To this whiny depressed over exaggerating trope of woe is me my life is the worst possible thing to ever happen to anybody ever and even though it would be an understandablly difficult road ahead, which has been my life so far, instead of facing it head on like I've been doing as it's a defining character of mine I'm going to give up and am literally going to blame everything and everyone, shut myself in and act like a war criminal in a Russian gulag rather than find a way to deal with it even though better solutions and outcomes are possible with some work.

If I had the link for you to read I guarantee you would think the same. Again it's not the story or trope itself I have a problem with, just the plot and the way harry is characterized is, what would be a good way to say it, over-exaggeratingly angsty and emo for the sake of trying to force you to emphasize with him rather than allowing it to come naturally through understanding and comprehension of being in that situation by ourself.

It's not about the story, it's about the tragedy, the universe destroying angst and loss of will to live that is stamped in your face because you have to feel bad about it to. That's not how to write a well written story, and definitely not how to convey such circumstances.
