I am not a woman, so I probably miss something somewhere, but to me forced relationship sounds like a horror, not something to be desired. The same about relationship with a bad guy ... the idea of Dramione (not mentioning Lucione, Drarry, Harrytrix or another abominations) pushes me towards puking not excited.
