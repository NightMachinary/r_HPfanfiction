I usually don't read fic that I know are based off of that trope. Mostly because I don't like them, but they are very popular. I think that it is a way for the author to get a relationship started between two characters that normally wouldn't happen. For example: Hermione/Draco.

I mean, I have read some really good Hermione/Draco fanfic, but usually the authors take their time and set up the relationship whereas with marriage law fic the two are forced to have a relationship.

I feel that the best hate/love stories are ones where the author builds up the relationship between two characters as opposed to forcing it. Which seems to be very common in marriage law fics.
