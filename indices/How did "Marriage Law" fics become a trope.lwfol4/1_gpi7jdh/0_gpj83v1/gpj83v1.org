Yes, this is the answer to where it comes from. The original WIKTT MLC of 2003. Back when we didn't know as much about Snape, and pureblood culture was even more a mystery than it still is today.

To further answer OP's questions, there is something to the "odd couples" argument. SS/HG is one of the most popular ships, and there are lots of us who enjoy MLC fics because we already like the characters and don't want to have to read 100k words for how they first got together. I like a good slow-burn just as much as the next romance reader, but I also like action, comedy, and any other way to treat MLC. I /really/ like MLC along with the Fake Relationship trope.

Pure MLC is a guilty pleasure all about power dynamics, and I don't generally recommend them outside the SS/HG ship. Lots of folks are really uncomfortable about the age gap and student/teacher aspects of the relationship, so adding in a Marriage Law muddies the waters even more and provides more drama. When the story is about how the pair who are "forced" to get married decide to use a Fake Relationship to regain some autonomy, those are the ones I like best. Especially in the SS/HG ship -- they are some of the most intelligent characters in the series, so when they team up to "outwit" the Ministry's backwards decrees, there's a lot of satisfaction in it, with or without the romance.

I've seen them done every way (serious, comedy, pwp, mystery, action, etc). I think most of them are tagged/categorized as slow burn romance, and they can be very sweet and sincere. Some are just thinly veiled dubcon PWP, which can be a little squicky. BUT that's what makes it a good trope -- there are lots of ways to treat it, but ultimately you get a good excuse for your favorite ship to spend more time together.

There are also a bunch of variants on this trope. The original MLC was a Ministry Law for boosting the population. Sometimes it's Voldy giving his DE's harems. One of my absolute favorites is the economic extortion of post-war Hogwarts providing a higher salary for married teachers: In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit by miamadwyn]], Snape and Hermione dial up the Fake Relationship to 11, and it's full of some of the best, funniest /banter/ that SS/HG has to offer.
