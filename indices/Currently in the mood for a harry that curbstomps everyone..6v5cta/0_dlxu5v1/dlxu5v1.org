[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] is probably the dumbest fic I've ever enjoyed reading. His fight with the horcrux is literally a pokemon battle. Like both of them have 6 pokemon and they fight using them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11975368/1/The-Stormreaver][The Stormreaver]] is pretty fun so far if you know a little bit about WoW (I know next to nothing). Harry gets teleported back to the HP universe for second year after 7 years as a Warlock's apprentice or something. It hasn't been a total stomp so far but all the direct conflict so far has been a slaughter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For the Love of Magic]] is alright. I kinda gave up on it after it got all smutty though. Had some interesting ideas in it though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188248/1/Dead-Man-Walking][Dead Man Walking]] I'm a sucker for dimension travel Alternate Harrys so I don't know how good this is objectively. I enjoyed it though. It's a Harry from another dimension where Voldemort took about a month to get resurrected after he got blasted in the face traveling to a universe where parents and 3 siblings or something. He's also got some sort of Pseudo-Cable thing going on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] bazillion year old master of death Harry gets summoned to canon Harry's universe to kill Voldemort and pretty much just dicks around.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12410115/1/Harry-the-Blood-Demon][Harry the Blood Demon]] is alright. He's some sort of demon that steals people shadows or something. Author also has a fun Blob/Changeling Harry fic and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12610360/1/We-Harry-Potter][one where Harry turns into a 5 headed dragon with a different Harry in every head]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2400483/1/Anarkia][Anarkia]] has him as some sort of super dupe potions genius or something who went to a special school for special people. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][Second Chance at Life]] has Harry fleeing Britain to go to a super school for super people and werewolves, alien elves, demons, vampires ect. Great fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1429871/1/The-Fourth-Power][The Fourth Power]] This fic is worth a read just because of how fucking funny it is.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7436608/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Life-Changing-Head-Injury][Harry Potter and the Life Changing Head Injury]] Greatest. Dumbledore. Ever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]] This one is the Second. Greatest. Dumbledore. Ever. Just get through the first chapter and you'll see what I mean.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11035459/1/Oblivion][Oblivion]] Harry is some god-demon-thing from the Elder Scrolls series incarnated into a human body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]] Harry makes a bargain with some devil things or whatever and gets powerful. /Really/ wish this one would update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655313/1/Something-Like-Your-Family][Something Like Your Family]] Bashy stompy fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] Crossover with Hunger Games. Fem Harry is raised over there and gets summoned for the tournament. The second task is awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019608/1/Agent-Double-O-Hex][Agent Double O Hex]] Harry is adopted by James Bond and fights his arch rivals and things.
