I do love pancakes with sugar and lemon - pretty much a dinner thing though, on shrove tuesday. Love to roll them up.

I did have american pancakes for breakfast yesterday but that's a very rare treat and it's because I'm pregnant and hangry. It's a weird kind of line in fanfic where sometimes you get instances of "well, yeah, we do sometimes do that, but it feels REALLY American."
