Did you see that expert level trolling from that American woman and her daughter on how to make hot tea? I honestly admire their dedication to uniting every Brit in fury. Every step is agony to watch, it is truly an act of war. [[https://www.tiktok.com/@jchelle36/video/6835600438771846406]]

On the whole, yes, I agree - lemon is used in some teas like Earl Grey, but this is not a common, every day tea and for simplicity I would just avoid writing it at all. I would also add that for the love of god stop getting Harry & co to have pancakes/waffles for breakfast.
