Black pudding, bacon, sausages, eggs (scrambled, poached or fried according to preference), toast or fried bread, baked beans, hash browns (not the weird American hash stuff, onion and potato fried triangle that you buy frozen). I think that's what I'd expect of a full English. You might have scrambled egg on toast, or boiled eggs with marmite soldiers (toast with butter and marmite cut in to perfect dipping size). Most people just eat toast, porridge or cereal for breakfast though. Cooked breakfast is normally a treat.
