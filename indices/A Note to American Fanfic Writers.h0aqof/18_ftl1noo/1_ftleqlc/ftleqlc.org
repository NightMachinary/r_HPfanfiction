About pancakes/waffles for breakfast, what would the UK equivalent be? It's the sort of breakfast food that every self respecting homemaker "should" be providing for their family, along with a side of bacon or sausage, eggs, and coffee. (In practice, the average parent gives up on formality and jabs a sleepy finger towards the cereal boxes when Junior asks what's for breakfast, but I digress.)

Let's say Petunia is working on her image as the perfect wife and mother, and she wants Vernon to truthfully brag to his co-workers about the breakfasts she fixes. Instead of blueberry pancakes, what does she serve?
