The weekend thing would be whats called a Full English (often referred to as a fry up), it has a number of variable options, but broadly its bacon, sausage, fried mushroom, eggs (done how you want them), fried or grilled tomato, either toast or fried bread, baked beans (which are haricot beans in a sweet tomato sauce), and sometimes black pudding or something called bubble and squeak (which is fried potato and cabbage, its a way of using up the left over veg from the previous night).

During the week the more normal substantial breakfast she might make would be a bacon roll, or maybe a bacon and egg roll. Just a bread roll, heavily buttered, with bacon, fried egg, maybe a sausage or two. Its a touch more convenient to eat quickly than a full fry up, but would still be seen as a perfectly acceptable breakfast for a hard working man.
