I wonder how such a breakfast might differ between muggles and purebloods. There are three main pressures that exert influence on the diet of the average pureblood.

1, People like the Malfoys and the Blacks would be inclined to turn their noses up at common muggle fare, so the market for wizard-only food is there.

2, Wizarding food producers would have to mince around a minefield of muggle government rules and regulations, which might make the production of certain foods unusually difficult. All foods, all production facilities, all farms, etc., are subject to stringent rules and regular inspections. Let's say you want to exploit your prodigious magical ability to breed a more efficient milk cow, or to grow crops out of season, or to grow berries the size of melons. You will have to explain yourself to government inspectors, or else you have to give up on exploiting your prodigious magical ability, or you could hide your production. Let's say you choose to hide your berry farm on Ben Nevis, for example. You might have escaped the awkward questions and risk of Azkaban, but now you're blowing all your profits on making this harsh mountain produce melon-sized berries. I imagine a number of foods have price disparities with their muggle counterparts that look really odd to a casually observing muggle.

3, There's a number of foods and recipes that are out of reach of the average muggle due to expensive ingredients, the requirement of advanced technical cooking skills, rarity of the ingredients, or (especially historically) difficulty in conveying the ingredients halfway across the globe. Wizards posses an array of abilities that could go a long way in solving a lot of those problems, which could result in some foods that muggles consider luxurious being more commonly available in the wizarding world. Once again, odd price disparities may ensue.
