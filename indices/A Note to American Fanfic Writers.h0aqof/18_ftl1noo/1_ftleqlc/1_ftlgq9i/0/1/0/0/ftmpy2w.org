Eggs Benedict/Royale is basically fancy eggs on toast and was around in the 90s but yeah I was mostly joking/ thinking of now when I said avocado toast! I agree with your other options though. I could totally imagine families like the Malfoys having a continental spread like a hotel with croissants and fresh bread and lots of fancy conserves and marmalade's and families like the weasleys having things like porridge or marmalade toast etc. Mostly I just imagine magic making things like poached eggs or perfect hard boiled eggs a lot easier and quicker to make
