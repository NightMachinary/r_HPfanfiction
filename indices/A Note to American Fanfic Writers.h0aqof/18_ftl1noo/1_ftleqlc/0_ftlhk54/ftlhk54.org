I think this idea of a great big breakfast is quite American too, pretty much everyone has toast/cereal/porridge. The big meals that Vernon might brag about would be dinner.

On weekends or after a heavy night you would probably put a lot of effort into a full English. I think traditionally if Petunia was really going for it she might also serve "eggs and soliders" which is soft boiled eggs with strips of toast to dip in, or if she was very traditional and really putting the effort in, something like a kedgeree, which is a Victorian dish made of smoked fish, rice, eggs, parsley. Very unfashionable now but I often still have it if I'm in a really old fashioned hotel. Likewise for kippers.
