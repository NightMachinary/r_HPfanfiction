Plenty of British people take lemon in tea. Not just earl grey either. Lapsang is traditionally served with lemon. It's highly likely that someone like Lucius would have lemon in his tea, as he'd be drinking a fancy tea not a builders mug of Yorkshire!

The thing the American authors do with tea that really boils my piss is when they talk about adding cream. Cream. To tea. That's, not what we mean by a "cream tea" guys.
