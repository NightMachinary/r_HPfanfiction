I suggest everyone watch Doc Browns's Proper Tea skit if they're wondering how it feels when English tea is written wrong in fanfic.

Also, when Umbridge made sickly sweet tea with a lot of milk in it in film 5, that would have been understood by the British audience as a joking slight against her character. I don't know if that was obvious to people without the passive aggressive tea culture we enjoy here.
