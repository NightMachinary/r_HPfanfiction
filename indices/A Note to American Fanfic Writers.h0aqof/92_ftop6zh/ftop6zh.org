Do you guys really have tea like that? I'm South Asian, and when I had tea in Britain for the first time, it was... fine. I'm just so used to having chai packed with spices, that it confused me. But I do agree, people should respect tea, and if the character is British, then they'll have tea the British way. What really annoys me is British characters having iced tea.
