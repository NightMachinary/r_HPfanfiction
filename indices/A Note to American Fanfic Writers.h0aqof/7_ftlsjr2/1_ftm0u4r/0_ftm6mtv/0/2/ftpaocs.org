Firstly, population matters more than land area, and historically European population (including Britain's) was quite high. As a result the population differential was not as great as you would think from looking at the countries today.

In 1900, the UK population was 39 million compared to the entire population of Africa of 140 million, or a UK:Africa population ratio of 1:3.6.

If that ratio was the same today, the population of Africa would be 239 million. But in fact it is 1.3 billion.

Secondly, even more important than population is money. And Britain had the industrial revolution on its side when it came to that.
