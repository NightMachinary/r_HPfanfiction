Dude. Your teas are so tame. Not calling them lame. Because i honestly love an english style cuppa on a rainy and windy day. Repeating myself English teas are awesome.

But tea in India? That is a whole different thing. Our teas have anywhere between 5-15 ingredients.

1.  Put water to boil
2.  add ginger.
3.  add lemon grass (a milder version. this is mostly in Mumbai and surrounding areas)
4.  add mint sprigs.
5.  add cardamom
6.  rich people will also add saffron (not rich, but just fancy people)
7.  Add Tea
8.  add sugar.
9.  add milk
10. boil for another 3-4 mins.
11. Like the OP said. Don't add lemon!

pour and drink that tea. this is the tea 1.3 billion Indians are hooked on.

Edit: Added the seventh point. Yes. I know. I forgot to add tea and the recipe for tea.
