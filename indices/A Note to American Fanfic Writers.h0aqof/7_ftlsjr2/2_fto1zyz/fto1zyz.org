We need a scene in a fanfic with Padma Patil making this tea in her common room. A crowd of Ravenclaws circled around her in the background taking notes and trying to figure out what she is making. And then freaking out when she actually drinks it. It finally ends with wild rumors about her being deathly ill and needs some weird potion regiment to survive.
