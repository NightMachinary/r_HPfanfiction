Huh, interesting - I didn't realize how big a difference in lemon grass there is!

One of the things that's really nice about masala chai is just experimenting to see what works best with everyone's personal tastes - I've seen/tried variations with star anise and peppercorn that added a slightly different twist to it, and I'm sure everyone swears by a different recipe!

For Kawha, I think the main difference is that it uses green tea, right? Though I'm not sure what variation of green tea I have access to that would be closest to the Kashmiri green tea that's traditional.
