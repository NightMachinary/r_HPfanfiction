The problem with using 'lemon grass' (as most people use in normal cooking) is that it is too strong, it can curdle the milk, in the chai. The lemon grass we get in Mumbai, is a mild one, i think. And it is used only for tea. It is sold by the name that translates to green tea.

Lemon grass for thai curry is bought from another vendor in the market and is more expensive. (if you want to try lemon grass, add it to the water, and make sure it is on a rolling boil when you add the milk, that will protect the milk and may stop it from curdling)

Masala chai with cloves is not my favorite. Cloves are a spice i use for savory items, not sweet ones, so my brain cannot accept it in tea. My frnd swears by clove infused tea as a recipe against cold induced headaches.

Kashmiri Kawha is awesome in the cold weather. especially if drunk from a clay cup. But Kawha tea is generally different from normal tea leaves. I think there are specific Kashmiri tea leaves for Kawha( I could be wrong, Google isnt being particularly helpful).
