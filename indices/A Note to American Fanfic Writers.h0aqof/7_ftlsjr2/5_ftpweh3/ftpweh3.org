Indian tea is quite nice - though the masala chai recipe I picked up has cloves instead of lemon grass.

That being said... it's great for black tea. But for good quality green teas or oolongs? Got to drink those straight.

Lower quality green teas work great with moroccan mint tea as well, and I think Kashmir has an interesting variation of masala chai that uses saffron and green tea as well (Kahwah? It's one I've been meaning to try to make)
