As an Aussie, yeah this is a little confusing. We drink tea with milk and sugar to be added to the brewed tea as you desire. Twinnings English breakfast is the standard in my household, I drink with milk and sugar my mum drinks it black (lactose-intolerant) but dad just drinks coffee, real espresso from a machine mind you.

I don't think were as fussy about it as the English but yeah, lemons not really a thing. Can't say anything about Earl Grey, mum hates it so it never crosses the door step.

For a sore throat I drink green tea with lemon and honey.

To brew and Aussie tea,

Boil water

Poor over the tea (bag or loose, up to you)

steep for as long as you desire, remove tea

add sugar if desired

add milk if desired

drink, even on 30+ days

and yeah, we have ice tea, but you buy it from the store and drink it like a soft drink/soda.
