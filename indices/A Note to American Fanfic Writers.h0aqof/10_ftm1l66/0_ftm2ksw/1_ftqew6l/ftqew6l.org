You can just make it at home.. it's not that hard to make a basic Indian chai. The one that's posted above is the "High Class" Chai. Even if you don't add the spices, but just add Ginger, it's fine. It still tastes good.

But you'll have to experiment a little. Try it on a low flame and add small amount of smashed ginger to the tea. Take a whiff and see if it smells alright. If not, add a little more.

Tell me if you want a complete recipe.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
