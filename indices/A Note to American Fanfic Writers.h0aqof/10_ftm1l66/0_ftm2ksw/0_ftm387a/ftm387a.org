It is. Trust me. I have tasted your tea( I was in Britain), and while it's good, it's a bit bland. Indian tea is like a punch of tastes in the mouth. Once you taste it, there's no going back. Do you get Indian spices in Britain easily? I know some supermarkets have them but I imagine they would be rare.
