In Indian tea, we simplify a lot. Pour some milk(only milk and heaven help you if you add water to it), add powdered tea leaves, a healthy amount of sugar(definitions of healthy vary), add ginger, clove and basically every other spice on planet Earth, boil, filter the milk to remove the tea leaves, and voila, Indian Masala Chai. I think it's probably illegal to add water to Indian tea, but some roadside stalls do it, to save milk costs, but my point still stands:

Mess with an Indian's tea and they will fuck you up. Totally understand where you are coming from, my friend, tea is sacred and should be treated as such.
