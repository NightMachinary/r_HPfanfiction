I feel like I should clarify, this post is written in an intentionally pretentious style, it's not my actual view on tea. Of course people make their tea differently and that's all a-okay, but as I've explained in a few comments, I wrote it because I felt a lot of American fanfic writers had put a lot of time and effort into giving their stories the British vibe that HP has in canon, and I think it's a shame when small points such as tea mute that effect.

I'm not a tea connoisseuse, I'm just a British girl who loves tea and wanted to lend a hand to American fanfic writers.

(Also your cousins are totally right to use loose leaf tea. It's objectively superior to teabags. Just a pain in backside.)
