Alright I just have this to say about this post. Everyone in the UK takes their tea differently. I'm an American but I lived in the Uk for a while When my dad was stationed there. I have cousins who are British, and Quite a few of them put sugar in there tea and my uncle Who is British and my dad's half brother puts lemon and honey in his tea. So there are plenty of British people that take their tea a bit differently then how you are describing. And my cousins always use looseleaf tea so I don't think your instructions are applicable to all variations of tea Preparation in the United Kingdom.

Just a sidenote I am American and I do not like tea so the above post is completely based off of what I remember my cousins drinking.
