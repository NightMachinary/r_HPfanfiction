Obviously not everyone in the UK is the same and everyone has different tastes, but OP is right that the vast majority of time if you're just having tea at home or popping round someone's home it's going to be standard English breakfast tea. It's a generally accepted fun UK debate to argue about the exact colour tea should be or whether you should leave the tea bag in or not or all of that stuff. I think people are missing the light hearted spirit OP intended.
