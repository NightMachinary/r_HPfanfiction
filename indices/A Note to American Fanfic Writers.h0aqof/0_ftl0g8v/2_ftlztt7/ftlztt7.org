I add a spoonful of honey to any hot tea I drink, and I prefer hot tea over cold tea, and I prefer tea to coffee, but I'll really drink anything.

Plane black coffee is the worst stuff in the world, to me, but if you put me in a boring room, doing paperwork, with nothing else, I'd still drink it. I'd much rather have some hot tea with honey, but I â€˜would' still drink it.
