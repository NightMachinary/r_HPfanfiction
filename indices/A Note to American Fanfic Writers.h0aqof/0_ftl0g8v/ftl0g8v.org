You and I may not like it but plenty of people make tea with /far/ too much sugar in, and it can be perfectly accurate to people's characters to include it - I can see Umbridge having multiple sugars (in the form of sugarlumps, from a little China bowl with kittens on) and so much milk the tea is practically white, for example.

And lemon is a very important part of drinking /some/ tea properly. Just not all. Milk would ruin Earl grey, but lemon is an essential part! And I can definitely see Lucius drinking Earl grey.
