I think Umbridge having so much sugar in her tea was the exact moment you could pin her as a psychopath. If I were writing about Umbridge I'd have her add the milk first, no question. She's a monster.

Hard agree on the Early Grey front, but most fanfic writers don't specify the kind of tea being drunk. If a tea isn't specified I would assume it were English Breakfast, and lemon in English Breakfast is a sin. If a writer starts knows the difference in etiquette between types of tea I would 100% assume they were British.

(As an aside, black Early Grey with honey and lemon is the best home remedy for a cold/bad day. Something about the bergamot chases all the nasties away.)
