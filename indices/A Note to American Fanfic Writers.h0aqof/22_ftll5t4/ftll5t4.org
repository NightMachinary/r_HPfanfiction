This is such a great post. I'm American, but when I visited London with my girlfriends we learned very fast how seriously people take their tea. We had afternoon tea at the Rosebery a few times and the manager there taught us all about tea and how shocked he had been when he visited the states and was exposed to sweet tea and sun tea. He seemed to feel it was his duty to make sure we understood the correct way to tea. He was hilarious and also insisted on teaching us about scones ðŸ˜‚
