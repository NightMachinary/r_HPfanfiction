This is exactly NOT where I thought this post was going but I love it XD

Being an American, I can assure you that Americans have no idea how to make tea. In fact, tea to us is the cold sweet tea on most days and it's completely disgusting. I love tea, but not Southern Sweet Tea.

Like I said, love tea, but I never put lemon in it, but I have also never put milk in it either. I see it's a common occurrence. How much milk exactly would you put in the tea? Enough to make the color turn? I do want to try it. I have English Breakfast tea and I just drink it hot with sugar.

I am guilty of putting a lot of sugar in my tea/coffee etc. I may be Umbridge.
