Just seems unnecessary for a hobby though, especially when it comes to random words like curb/kerb, aluminum/aluminium, color/colour. It's hard enough when you're writing in a setting you're not familiar with - I wrote just a few thousand words of a character in NY and found I was questioning and researching EVERYTHING, it was quite stressful being on the other side of it. As long as i can see there has at least been some effort I'm happy to let it slide - it's free content after all, and I would rather they were having fun writing it.
