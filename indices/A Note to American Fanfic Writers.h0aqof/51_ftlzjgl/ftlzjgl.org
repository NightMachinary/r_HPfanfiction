*shrug* I maintain that Tea is an aberration against nature. Liquid should be consumed in tall glasses filled to the brim with ice. Ideally plain tap water, but if someone wants filtered water or sugary syrup water, it is understandable.

Even if it is snowing out.

.... plus if I'm going to bother to do culture research about Tea drinking habits, I'm going to make the insular, 'slightly different but not quite' community NOT follow the standards. If only because then you can show horrified muggleborns who, after having to deal with Pumpkin Juice and Butterbeer, seeing Tea and thinking "Oh finally, something normal"... and its not.
