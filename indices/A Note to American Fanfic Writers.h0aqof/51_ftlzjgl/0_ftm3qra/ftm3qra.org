I liked that idea. I can see it now, muggleborns confused and amazed at seeing the magical world, get sorted and then the next morning at breakfast looking for things like orange juice, apple juice or milk, and instead being told "no everyone drinks pumpkin juice"....

So then some magical goes well you can always have tea and they ask for a cuppa and to their shock it's nothing like they are use to.
