It was a great day for Harry, he somehow got everyone mad at him for no reason in particular. He only got beat by uncle Vernon around 3 times today.

Past morning: “uncle Vernon, how do you like your tea again?”

“Just throw 3 lemons in there it'll be fine.”

In plain sight Harry did what they call a pro gamer move and enacted his plan, he threw 3 unsqueezed lemons into the cup.

Harry also added 4 spoonfuls of sugar, then added 50% hot water, 40% ice water and 10%milk

Soon after he added 2 tea bags and the proceeded to stir for 5 seconds.

“That's how you make the good stuff”

His father punished him severely
