Serious question: do you guys actually think we microwave tea over here, or is it a joke? Or somewhere in between? What's the origin of this idea/joke? Did it happen in a TV show or something, or was it just kinda like a meme?

(To my fellow yanks: nobody really does this, right? Please tell me we don't do this.)

I've seen this crop up in various reddit threads a couple times in as many days and I'm not sure I'd seen it before that, genuinely curious.
