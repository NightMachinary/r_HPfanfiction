It's not homeopathy. It's just personal experience. I do drink a ton of hot liquids and I notice that my green tea always hotter longer when the water is heated in the kettle.

So i googled the phenomenon.

Turns out it's not that microwave is incapable of heating water as hot as a kettle does. It's just that most of us don't wait for microwave to do that kind of heating. Google it yourself.

In the meanwhile I am sincerely sorry for the 'pain' caused to you by your opinion of incorrect physics being applied to a funny conversation... Truly and deeply regretful for the 'pain' I have caused.

On another tangent. Google what homeopathy is. Edit your the comment with an appropriate insult.

It's fairly annoying to reply to such an uninformed one.
