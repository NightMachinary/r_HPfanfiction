A decent kettle takes less than a minute in the UK, even a cheap one won't take more than 2 minutes. We get a much higher voltage through our mains. Tea brews better with filtered and freshly boiled water. Using a microwave makes it taste weird, it just doesn't infuse into microwaved water properly.
