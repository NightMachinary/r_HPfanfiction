Our kettles are quicker in the UK because our electric is set up differently, and there are deliberately surges in power for advert breaks for popular programmes to cater for everyone going and making a cup of tea. It has been explained to me before but I can't remember the details, I think we generally have a higher voltage though.

We also tend to have hard water so if you microwave that it can leave a weird film on the surface.
