(You got it bang on with the voltage thing. It's the power delivered to the water that heats it up, and power is the product of both current and voltage. Buuuut both our outlets deliver the same current, that means you guys have plugs twice as powerful as ours. TL;DR That means it should take us about twice as long as you to boil water in an electric kettle.)

That's not the interesting part though. The interesting part is that when I was looking up the currents across the pond, I found the thing I most wish I could show Arthur Weasley: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets]]

I just loved looking through all those pictures and charts and imagining the joy on Arthur's face when he found the pictures of the legendary Waisall plug, or of the SIX (?!?!) types of Swiss sockets. It'd be like when Harry first saw Hogwarts.
