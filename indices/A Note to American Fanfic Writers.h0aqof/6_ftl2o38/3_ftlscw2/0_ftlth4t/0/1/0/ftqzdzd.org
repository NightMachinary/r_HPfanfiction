Some places in Europe (or maybe some buildings) have these socket which cater for different types of plug on the continent. Not the more standardised ones today, but ones with loads of holes.

There was little me with my EU adaptor kit trying to work out what in the hell adaptor went on my plug to fit in. These days it's not so complex.

(As a side note: My tooth brush has a UK shaver plug and I do manage to force it into an EU plug adaptor.)
