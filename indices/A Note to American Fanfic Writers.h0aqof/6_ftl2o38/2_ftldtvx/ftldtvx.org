Nope. Just Nope. Why would you heat water in a microwave. That's what electric kettles are for. Always fresh filtered water. And loose leaf and a teapot is the best way to take tea. I have a whole selection of loose leaf at home depending on how I'm feeling. Tea bags are for convenience at work only.
