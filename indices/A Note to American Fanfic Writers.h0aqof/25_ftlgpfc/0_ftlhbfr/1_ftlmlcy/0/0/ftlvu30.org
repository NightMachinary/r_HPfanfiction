It's mostly the comments where OP is being insulting and/or hostile.

I am American, which is pretty obvious when I write on reddit. However, I do my best to properly British-ise my Harry Potter fanfiction so that it could reasonably take place in Great Britain. That said, mistakes will be made. I manage to avoid the most obvious ones (mom/mum, double quotes/single quotes, -ize/-ise, -or/-our, -er/-re, differences in cursing, arse/ass, etc etc). But I do get tripped up every once in a while, even after I send my WiP chapters to a British friend who proofreads them specifically for Americanisms that need to be changed.

Sometimes the issue isn't that the American author didn't do their due diligence when researching British culture and language. There are always some differences between the two cultures that are very minor and only rarely come up. Things that you would never think to research. You can't expect an author to research every bit of every paragraph they write.

That's why I'm not appreciating OP's attitude. There's a way to communicate that information in an instructive and humorous way without denigrating the people that work very hard on their fanfics. Even looking through the comments, apparently there are things that OP is wrong about, which makes their tone even more annoying.
