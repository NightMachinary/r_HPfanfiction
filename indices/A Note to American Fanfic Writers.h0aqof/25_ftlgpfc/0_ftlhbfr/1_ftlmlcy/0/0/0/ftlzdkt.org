There was a post on, I think [[/r/cooking][r/cooking]], about little pet peeves people had about cooking. Everyone on it, especially the OP, were so intentionally over the top with their opinions and their hills to die on, it was hilarious and everyone had a great time, it was a wonderful thread - it was designed that way. I read OP's comments in the same vein - as they also say a couple of places, a parody-of-strong-opinions kind of way.

Maybe since you're actually American yourself, there's room for you to take it personally, and maybe OP could've done a better job of not directing their post to /American/ fic writers and just drew a line between British and non-British stuff in fics?

In any case, props to you writers for the amazing content you create!

Edit: and seriously, any non-Brit writer would be guilty of adding in non-Brit things, like I'm already reading/writing in a foreign language, I'm probably not gonna remember which version of the foreign language I'm running on.
