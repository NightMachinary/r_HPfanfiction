I write 'okay' as a generational thing, so it hurts my soul when Dumbledore pops up in some random fic with a hearty "Okay, sure." Ditto McGonagall and even Snape. But I can accept it from the Trio, although for some reason I'd single out Ron as the likeliest to toss it around casually.

I once tried watching Wedding Belles because I adore Michelle Gomez, and even turning on closed caption didn't always help me make sense of it. It wasn't just the dialogue speed and heavier than normal Scottish accents than my American ear was used to. I was also constantly snatching after bits of slang and absolutely failing to parse them. Still worth watching, though.
