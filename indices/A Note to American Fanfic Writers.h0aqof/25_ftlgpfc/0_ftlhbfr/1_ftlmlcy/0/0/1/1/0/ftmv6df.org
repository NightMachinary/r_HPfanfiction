I'm glad you enjoyed it!

Honestly I don't understand colloquial slang from areas far from my own. I have friends from London who seem to speak and entirely different language from my northern self sometimes. I think most Americans would be more surprised to note that a lot of the slang used in HP isn't all that common nowadays, even though we're more familiar with it than most Americans.

There are some types of American lexicon that have wormed their way so fully into British English, I wouldn't even bat an eye (I think "okay" is the ultimate example), I only pointed out the things that I would find incredibly jarring in an otherwise impeccably British fanfic.
