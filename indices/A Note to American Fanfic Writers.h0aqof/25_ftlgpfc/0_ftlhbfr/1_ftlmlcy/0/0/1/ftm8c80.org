I don't quite see where I insulted the Americans, it wasn't my intention at all. My opinion is deliberately dramatic, which is a common comedic technique in the UK, but rest assured my actual opinion is nowhere near this militant (I don't actually believe people who put milk in first should be exiled to Australia, which I hope would be obvious!)

Perhaps this is just an instance of cultural misunderstanding, but it was nowhere my intention to insult Americans, this post was simply a (very British) comedic explanation of standard British tea making. Of course people take their tea differently, I acknowledge that in my comments, but my intention was to start a humorous thread - and in that I was successful, as many people have correctly realised I wasn't serious.

One thing I really love about Americans is how polite and friendly you all seem to be (or the ones I've met anyway) so I could see how the British sense of humour, which is much more deadpan, may come off as rude. This wasn't my intention, and I hope none of my comments read as personal attacks on anyone; my intention was quite the opposite.
