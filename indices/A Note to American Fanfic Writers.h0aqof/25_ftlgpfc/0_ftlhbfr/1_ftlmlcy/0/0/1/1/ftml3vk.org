Tea-drinking American here, and I'm not insulted at all and thoroughly enjoyed the light raillery. I have an electric kettle and no microwave, and think microwaved tea is an abomination - but on the other hand, milk in my tea is sacrilege, although I mostly drink Earl Grey or Jasmine green or something really dark and smoky like Lapsang Souchong, so milk wouldn't blend well anyway. It's not an American thing with me; I just detest milk.

So on my side, the humor (or humour) is much appreciated. I also try when writing for HP to use British spellings simply because it puts /me/ in the mood. It's a mental trick to signal my brain to shift to a slightly different vocabulary track, even though I still trip up plenty. A year or so ago I was absolutely baffled to learn that 'blocks' aren't a British unit of measure for street lengths and directions. I've been writing in this fandom for more than ten years, yet I still managed to miss this.

Also, much as I love British slang, I'm timid about using it because I'm not sufficiently familiar with regional dialects or class distinctions. Writing Snape as a Midlands lad from a mill town, for example, is daunting. Not to mention that slang from the 1970s wouldn't be the same as slang now.

Anyway, now that I've wandered far afield, I'm off to extract a bottle of iced tea from the mini-fridge because wearing these masks inside is really bloody hot work.
