I didn't read OP as hostile at all! I'm neither british nor american, but it makes me happy to see little british things in fics because it reminds me of their accents and the general vibe. I also like american fics though (not to say I can always distinguish between the two!)

Though I can imagine if brit things were things I was /intimately/ familiar with, these kinds of things would be glaringly obvious when reading, as if someone's name were mispronounced.

That aside, again, I don't understand why so many in this thread are reading OP's post as insulting or hostile, it was interesting and funny for me and I laughed out loud at a comment above highfiving the microwave.
