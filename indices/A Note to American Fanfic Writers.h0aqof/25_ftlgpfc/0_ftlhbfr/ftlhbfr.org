There is no "correct" way to drink tea. There is, however, a BRITISH way to drink tea.

I see a lot of American writers put a lot of effort into making their fic have the same British vibe as the original series, and it's a shame when that's spoilt through misunderstanding of British culture. As I said above, if you want to make a fic that's as American as American gets, be my guest, I'll probably read it and enjoy it. But if you want to keep the quintessentially British feel of Harry Potter, it's necessary to know the British way of drinking tea.
