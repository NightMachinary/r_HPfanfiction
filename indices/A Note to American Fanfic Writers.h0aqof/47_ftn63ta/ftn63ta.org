Lucius Malfoy using tea bags like some peasant?!

Preposterous!

Man, I live in Switzerland and usually we buy tea from amazon, get it delivered to Germany and then our relatives in Germany bring it to us the next time they come to visit because tea leaves here are really fucking expensive and we're cheap bitches. Nobody gonna spend 30 francs on 50 grams of tea. Because of the virus our relatives weren't able to come so now we've been drinking tea bags for months.

I've forgotten the taste of tea leaves, my asian ancestors are looking at me in disgust. Somebosy send help /I can't do this anymore/
