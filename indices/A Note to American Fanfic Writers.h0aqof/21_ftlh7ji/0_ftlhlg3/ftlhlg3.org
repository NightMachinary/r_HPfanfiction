It's not very common tbh, but it's not something anyone has strong feelings on. When I have a sore throat I love Earl Grey tea with honey and lemon, even though it's not something I have regularly. It's not decisively un-British in the way lemon in English Breakfast tea is, just not very widespread as far as I'm aware.
