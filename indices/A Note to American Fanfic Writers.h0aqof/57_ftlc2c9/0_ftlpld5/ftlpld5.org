Some people do drink it black but a splash of milk is more common. If you had a guest you would ask how they take their tea and in my experience well over half of people have the same "order" of milk, no sugar. Naturally the UK is not full of robots and there are always exceptions which is why OP is getting a kicking from people taking things way too seriously lol
