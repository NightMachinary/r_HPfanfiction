OP is a bit of an idiot who doesn't actually know how people take their tea. Lots of folk drink it black, without milk. Lots of folk take it with a tiny touch of milk. And lots of folk take it with enough milk that its white. Some folk take it black with sugar, and some take it black without sugar.

Everyone who drinks tea has their preferred way of drinking it, and the combinations people come up with are sometimes weird and wonderful.
