I like oat milk as an alternative as a fellow allergy sufferer, although most of my life I used soya. I was diagnosed at 3weeks old as allergic to dairy so I've only ever used alternatives. The last 10 years have been amazing in terms of dairy free solutions in hot drinks, not only is there more variety, but the quality of them has also increased. There was nothing worse than putting cold soya into a hot drink and having it separate on you and make your cup undrinkable.
