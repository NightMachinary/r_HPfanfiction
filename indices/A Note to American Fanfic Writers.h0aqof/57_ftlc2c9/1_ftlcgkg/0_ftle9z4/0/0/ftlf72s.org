An American lady. I worked in a turistic place, so I served A LOT of weird combinations. Some just stuck in my brain more than others.

A Russian man once ordered for lunch a capuccino with cacao + pizza with onion and tuna. I thought that the cacao was supposed to be for the cappuccino... Nope. He covered the whole onion and tuna pizza with a layer of cacao :/

De gustibus, I suppose.
