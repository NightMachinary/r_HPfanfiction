Thank you!

As a British, what do you think about the weirdest breakfast I ever served (I used to work in bar-restaurant)? A beast of Satan once asked me for: hot English tea with mint scyrup and ice cubes to cool it quickly with a large "pepperoni" pizza with ham, ketchup and mayo on it, all at 8:00 in the morning.

...As an Italian, it physically hurt me to serve that pizza. I don't know if, as a British, you feel the same way for the tea.
