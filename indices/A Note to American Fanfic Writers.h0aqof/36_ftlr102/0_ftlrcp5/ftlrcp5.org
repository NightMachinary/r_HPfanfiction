**Incoherent screaming\**

*A cream tea means tea with scones!! Not cream in tea!! AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH*

No but seriously you've stumbled across another pet peeve of mine, I have no idea how I forgot about that.

Does anyone actually put cream in tea or is it just an inter-lingual translation error?
