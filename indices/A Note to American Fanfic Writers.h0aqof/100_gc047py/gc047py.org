Just to offend the Brits, story time.

How I learned (as a southern, sweet iced tea drinking, american) that I like earl grey.-

We had no sweet tea left and I had a craving. I found some earl grey tea bags. I proceeded to make a big ol' pot, poured in an obscene amount of sugar while still hot and stirred until dissolved. Chilled. Had pretty decent sweet iced tea. Good enough until I went to Publix for the good stuff.
