Hm, but there seems to be some form of extra credit in canon:

  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

  “She'll be fine --- remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron.

  “Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...”

  He leaned forward a little. “I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point ... ?”

  Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her being sacked.

  “Expecto Patronum!”

  The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.
