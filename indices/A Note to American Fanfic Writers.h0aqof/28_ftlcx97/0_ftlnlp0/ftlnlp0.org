I think the Americanism comes in the term "extra credit" as we just wouldn't call it this, we would just say extra marks or something. It's not at all common and was clearly a choice Rowling made to highlight how super duper clever Hermione was.

We wouldn't have, say, a student going to their teacher and specifically asking for extra credit to bump up their grade or anything. That's where it feels really American.
