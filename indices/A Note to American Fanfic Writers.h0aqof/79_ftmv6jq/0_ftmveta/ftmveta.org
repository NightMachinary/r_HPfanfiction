Loose leaf tea. Basically the stuff that's in teabags, without the bag. It also tends to be higher quality than the stuff in teabags, but loose leaf tea is incredibly fiddly sometimes. You can either use a tea strainer (especially if you're making a pot of tea and pouring it into a cup) or just leave them in the bottom of your cup - which is how reading someone's tea leaves would work.
