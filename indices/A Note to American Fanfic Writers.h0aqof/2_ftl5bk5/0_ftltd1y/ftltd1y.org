I worked in a warehouse in Yorkshire and the lads would drink strong Yorkshire tea, with lots of full cream milk and two sugars, once ever hour from the second they walked in, to the second they walked out.

Thats about half a litre of milk and 16 teaspoons of sugar per day.

Very hard workers, funny guys, and we all had a bloody good time.
