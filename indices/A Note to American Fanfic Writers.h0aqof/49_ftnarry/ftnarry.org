Look, we're American. Our idea of any tea that isn't iced goes like this.

1. Fill a coffee cup with water.

2. Put that coffee cup in the microwave.

3. Chuck a bag of tea in it.

4. Forget about it for a few hours and finally remember it exists before reheating the tea.

5. Throw it in the harbor and get some proper Milo's sweet tea.
