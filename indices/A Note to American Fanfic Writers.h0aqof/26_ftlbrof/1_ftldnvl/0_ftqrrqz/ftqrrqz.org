' In Britain everyone sits two sets of exams (GCSEs and A-levels, or OWLS and NEWTS in HP)'

On the contrary, Scotland sits Standards/National 5, Highers and Advanced Highers. Coursework is a thing. Not to mention all the vocational courses in all three countries. Private schools often do iGCSEs or IB.

Hell, when I did GCSEs and A Levels (and certainly when Harry did too) coursework was a thing.

Yes, I live to cause confusion.
