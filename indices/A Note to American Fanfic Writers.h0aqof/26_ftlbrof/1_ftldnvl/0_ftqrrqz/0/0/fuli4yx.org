Yeah, I don't think Hogwarts does have coursework. I could well imagine that some ARE on offer but to other, less prestigious schools.

No worries - I always find it amusing because in theory Hogwarts should be more closely aligned to Scottish exams than English ones.

I sat what we saw as 'old' and 'new' GCSEs at the time - I did a combination of coursework and controlled coursework and the AS and A Level. Re-takes for A level were more of a thing.
