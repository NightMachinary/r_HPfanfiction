I should have clarified English schools (that was actually what I meant to type because I know Scotland and Northern Ireland have different exams, and Wales marks them differently.)

I mentioned BTECs and vocational qualifications in another comment that the original commenter appears to have deleted, but I saw no evidence of those in the HP universe.

I sat a mixture of old and new GCSEs and completely reformed A-levels. My coursework had no extra credit available (which really bugged me because my geography coursework was my lowest mark even if I did well overall.) And the new exams have no coursework in them at all if the experience of myself and my younger sister is to be believed.

I agree with your point but yeah there's no coursework in HP as far as I'm aware and never any extra credit.
