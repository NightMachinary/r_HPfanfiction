I assume they had bonus questions in the exams, but when people write about extra credit projects or forms of coursework, that's a blatant Americanism. In Britain everyone sits two sets of exams (GCSEs and A-levels, or OWLS and NEWTS in HP) and everyone sits the same exam, more or less. How you do on those exams is your final grade, end of. You can't do extra work for a teacher to boost your OWL grade, and reports from the school would be mostly based on end-of-year exams (our term for finals).

The 114% thing really baffled me when I read it, and I kind of assumed Rowling did it to add the eccentricity of Hogwarts, but the fact is that it doesn't happen in the British education system in any respect.
