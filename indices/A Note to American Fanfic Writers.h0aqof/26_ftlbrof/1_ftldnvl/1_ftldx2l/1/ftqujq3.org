Ok, so the tl;dr version of this: It is compatible with the English school system to

a) score beyond the ability of your year group on the tests given, but not to do extra assignments that lead to a higher grade.

and

b) You don't need full marks to get 100%

Bonus c) England scores for depth of learning but doesn't give extra assignments.

See, the whole GCSE/A Level thing in the English curriculum is moot before GCSEs start. These days, you are rated compared to expectations for your year. Much to the consternation of many educators you can literally go from year to year scoring the equivalent term for below average.

Before the recent reforms to the curriculum in England, you would be scored based off Curriculum Levels. Particularly in Sats exams and you can't score any higher than the level on the test. So, suppose you get 100% on the exam - you can only score a Level 5. Another school might allow some pupils to take a test that goes up to Level 6.In this case, I suspect Hermione was showing skills well beyond what you would expect the higher ability children in her year to get. So the points were not for extra work, but for greater depth.

Under the reformed system in England, children can genuinely be scored at 'working at greater depth' but that cannot be scored in comparison to the year above.

Incidentally, the GCSEs also have foundation level exams (or whatever they are called these days) where the maximum you can be graded is a C. So schools have to be very careful with borderline cases for foundation and higher exams.

With regard to GCSE/A LEVEL scoring - In England, grade boundaries are based not on how well pupils do, but how well the cohort as a whole does So, a certain percentage of pupils can get an A* (9, since they went numerical) in any given year group. As a result, 100ums percentage score points (the maximum they put down) does not mean you got 100% of the points available. So, in theory Hermione could well have scored 14% better than 100%. There's no benefit to it, but in theory Flitwick could have had the raw score and told her.
