I find it a lot less jarring than tea sacrilege, hence why it's a footnote, but Rowling doesn't refer to it as extra credit, and in fan fiction it's often done in tandem with several decisively non-British terms like "finals", "diploma" and "graduation" (which only refer to University, not high school, and are never used by Rowling in the books in any capacity). Extra credit as a concept is decisively American and imo skews the generally British feel of Harry Potter. I often find myself getting really involved in a fic and getting into the story, and finding words like that that just don't fit really drags me out of it.

Of course I can't tell anyone how to write a fic. If you want to make Harry and backwards-baseball-cap-wearing, Harley-riding quarterback who calls people "cupcake" and carries an AK-47 on the back of his varsity jacket, I wouldn't want to stop you. But if people want to imitate the British feel of the original series, then I would like to help them by pointing out pitfalls that may stop them from accomplishing that objective.
