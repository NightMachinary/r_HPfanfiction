So, I see that you are making a making a major mistake here in your complaints. You are acting as if you expect the Pureblood Aristocracy to be following muggle tea traditions. Based on some quick googling, tea didn't really start to become popular in the UK until the 1660s at the earliest, and it didn't start getting imported in commercial quantities until 1678. Additionally "afternoon tea" as a concept didn't really become popular until the 1880s. However, the Statue of Secrecy was enacted in 1692. That means that there was only a very small overlap in the Wizarding World's tea tradition and the Muggle world's traditions.

There is substantial evidence that the wizarding world has bizarre tastes (see: pumpkin juice at every meal). I don't particularly see any reason why they wouldn't have equally strange and divergent views on how tea should be taken. For all we know, they could be using pumpkin juice as a sweetener for their tea sort of like a twisted version of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_(drink][Arnold Palmer]]. While the muggleborn most likely still adhere to british traditions, the purebloods have probably developed their own complex traditions centered around tea (possibly including pumpkins). They would most likely make an attempt to not even come close to emulating what muggles would be doing, and if they find out how muggles drink their tea, they would likely deliberately try to differentiate it.

Making assumptions about tea culture in the wizarding world would require you to go back to how tea was drunk in the late 1600s to figure out their starting point, and then account for divergences caused by general wizarding oddities. Who knows what someone as eccentric as Dumbledore would put in his tea? Basically, you are trying to apply muggle standards to purebloods though, which is bound to fail.

TL;DR: Lucius Malfoy sweetens his tea with pumpkin juice, Dumbledore sweetens it with lemon sherbets.
