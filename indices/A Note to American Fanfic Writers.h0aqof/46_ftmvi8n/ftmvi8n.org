Being not British but a passionate European tea drinker, this rant made me happy :)\\
Personally I prefer my tea untampered, the only important factors to me are temperature of water and steeping time.\\
I only add milk to Indian Chai, but Chai is a different topic alltogether, as you let the tea brew with milk and additional spices already added, stirring as you are doing this on the stove.
