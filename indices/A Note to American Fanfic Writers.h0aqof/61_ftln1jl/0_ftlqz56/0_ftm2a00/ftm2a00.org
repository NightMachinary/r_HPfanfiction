  Mint tea is a thing in the UK, and if you're in an office or hotel or somewhere it will be one of the teas on offer, but I have only personally known one person who drank it with any kind of regularity.

Pukka 3 Mint is my evening beverage of choice. Can't be drinking caffeine too close to bedtime.
