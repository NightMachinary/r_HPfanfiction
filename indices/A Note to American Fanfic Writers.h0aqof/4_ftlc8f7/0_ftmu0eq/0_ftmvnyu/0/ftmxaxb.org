Because extra credit is an official thing. In all my time in school teachers never offered extra credit as an option. You either did well on the coursework/exam or you were pretty much screwed (YMMV).

But you ask about this applying to other coursework. Well, it applies the same way: Hermione is known for going well over the essay length. It's not extra credit, it's just something she does because she wants to (and the teachers let her for some reason). So I guess the principle does apply to other coursework?
