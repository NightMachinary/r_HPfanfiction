Headcanon where Dobby discovers PG Tips and tells Malfoy that teabags are an expensive alternative to tea strainers and of course Malfoy has to brag about his fancy new tea contraption. Eventually tea bags become a status symbol amongst rich purebloods and Muggleborns aren't sure if they're being trolled or if Purebloods really are that sheltered.
