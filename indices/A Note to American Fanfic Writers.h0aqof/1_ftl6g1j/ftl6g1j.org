Correct order is of course:

1. Boil the water.
2. Look throughout your dwelling and throw away all tea bags
3. Make proper tea.

I couldn't imagine Lucius Malfoy (or his elf) making tea from Tesco bags. I even think that in Hogwarts you would get good Darjeelings, Yunans, Oolongs, etc. If there is anything about at least pretended nobility of some Slytherins, could you imagine Heiress Daphne Greengrass drinking Lipton Yellow Label?
