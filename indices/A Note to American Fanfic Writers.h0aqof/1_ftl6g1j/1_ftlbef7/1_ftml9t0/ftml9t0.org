Extended pinky is a middle class thing.

While Lucius likely drinks expensive teas, and likely out of fine china, it's unlikely he follows the manners that many of us brits learn as being “upper class” as typically “upper class” manners mean “upper middle class”. As that's where the obsession with manners mostly comes from, the middle classes attempting to fit into upper class society. Things like extended pinkies (a middle class manner born from snuff (also a middle class habit)) and refusing teabags.
