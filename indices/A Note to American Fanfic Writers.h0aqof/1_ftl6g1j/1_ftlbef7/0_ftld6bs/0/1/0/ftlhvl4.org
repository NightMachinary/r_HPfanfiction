I LOVE green tea! I'll never forget the revelatory experience of having my first good quality jasmine tea ... good times, good times.

Where would you recommend getting loose leaf tea from? I live in a city so we don't have many independent tea shops like in the country. The most authentic I can find is Whittards, but it's pricey!
