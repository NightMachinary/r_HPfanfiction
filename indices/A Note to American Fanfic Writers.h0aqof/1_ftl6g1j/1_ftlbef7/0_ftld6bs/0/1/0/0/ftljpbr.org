Jasmine tea is excellent - pearl jasmine might be my favorite green tea for the smell alone!

Personally, I live in the states and pretty far away from a good tea shop - so I just use internet vendors. The tea subreddit has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01][list of vendors]] which I use as a starting point, and does include specifically UK based shops - then I just buy a small sample of one that seems interesting and see if it's any good.
