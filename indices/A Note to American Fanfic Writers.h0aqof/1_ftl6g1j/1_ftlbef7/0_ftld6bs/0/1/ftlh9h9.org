Loose tea is actually not that expensive - you can resteep good quality tea a good number of times (myself, I tend to do 4-5x). That makes it much more reasonable cost wise - and you can get a huge variety of different, and better, teas out there.

Highly recommend trying out some good green teas/oolongs - though no need to put in milk or sugar!
