Actually, not to be *that* snobbish: our Tesco (I live in Prague, Czechia, so I am not sure how much our Tesco tea compares to your Tesco teas) has rather decent store brand loose Yunnan tea (their loose Assam is rubbish), and Ahmad is supermarket tea as well, and their loose teas are quite good, although rather basic.
