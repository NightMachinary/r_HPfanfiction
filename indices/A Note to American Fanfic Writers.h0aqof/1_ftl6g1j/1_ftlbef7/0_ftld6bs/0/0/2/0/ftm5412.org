I have always wondered about that: how much is tea (in terms of Camellia sinensis) really part of the Indian culture? When I come to the Indian restaurant here in Czechia, I can get a lot of hot and tea-based drinks (masal chai, etc.), but none of them is what I understand as the black tea in the style we are talking around here (whereas Chinese restaurants give me usually Jasmine green tea without a question). I know that India is the second biggest producer of the tea in the world, but how much is just because British used India as a place to compete with the Chinese tea, and how much it is truly part of the ancient Indian culture?
