Well i myself am not an Indian so take my words with a grain of salt.

But i have been living here for 5 years.

The tea culture is pretty large, with the chai being a major thing over here, always being with milk and having several spices in it.

And even the green tea itself being popular. But my issue is, i live in the capital in a metropolitan area, so all i see is black tea which i myself do not prefer.

But for those who know where to look or are interested is tea, it can be found, i myself only developed a thirst for green tea these past few months,so i am inexperienced.

But i have seen that green tea sold around me is of average quality, but i did once have the luck to try several of Assam produce and i can say without doubt it is some of the best i have drank in my life.

Usually tea you would get in an Indian restaurant is black tea with milk which is made in a large pot with spices and sugar mixed into it.

But it is a popular past time of everyone to go to the road side tea stall to share chai, so it is deep ingrained into the culture.

Many times you can spot many company employees surrounding a small stall which is just a man with a gas cylinder who would make the chai and give it for you to drink on the street and it would be a place to enjoy the lunch break even if some would consider it (excuse my word) plebian.

I don't know if this makes sense, but i am rather uneducated in the tea culture, as i have just begun my journey as a consumer ( i have actually spent 18 years not drinking any tea)
