As a kid I really wanted to get one of those pg tips that come with a monkey toy but was always refused. To this day I am jealous whenever I go to someones house and they have one of those monkeys, sat there taunting me... On another note I really like yorkshire tea (maybe its cuz I'm from Yorkshire).
