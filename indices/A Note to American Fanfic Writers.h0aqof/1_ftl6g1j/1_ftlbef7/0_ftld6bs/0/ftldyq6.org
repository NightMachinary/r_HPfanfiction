More the expense of good tea. I had an amazing darjeeling in Dubai ages ago and I've never been able to get it out of my head.

But compared to most of the tea you find in supermarkets, Tesco tea is surprisingly good. (Although I won't deny that a proper loose tea is no less than nectar of the gods).
