Isn't is infuriating when people drink tea with so much sugar.

If I am drinking tea at a tea stall that is new to me, i ll first smell the tea. If it smells too sweet (and trust me, you can smell the excess sugar in a tea), I will return it and ask them to make me a fresh batch, no sugar is fine, one quarter of a teaspoon per glass is better...
