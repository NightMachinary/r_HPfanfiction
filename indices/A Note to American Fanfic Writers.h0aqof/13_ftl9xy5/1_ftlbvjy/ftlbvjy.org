I should probably clarify that this guide is to English Breakfast tea, which is by far the most popular form of tea and the one that, if unspecified (as it often is in fanfiction), the one I would assume people would serve me. Early Grey obeys the entire opposite rules and should always be taken black, if possible with lemon. But that's not the focus of my ire.
