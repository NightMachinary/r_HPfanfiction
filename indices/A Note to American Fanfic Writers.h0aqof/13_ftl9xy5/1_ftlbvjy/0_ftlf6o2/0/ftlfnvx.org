... You know this is a joke right? I don't give a toss how people take their tea. I'm not morally grandstanding. It's a humorous take on America misconceptions about British stereotypes. Please don't tell me to "wind my neck in" when I'm not having a go at anyone, just intending to have a light conversation about my favourite drink.

I apologise if anything I typed read in a way that seemed pretentious or offensive to you; my intention was to create a parody of a traditionally British "stuffy" voice a la Percy Weasley, not to actually cast moral judgement on people's preferences.
