Yes, having the spent the last 30 years as a dedicated tea drinker in the UK, I'm well aware of how tea works. Perhaps you should wind your neck in and consider having a cuppa to calm down? Its really not something to get worked up about. People can have their tea however they want.

I know someone who enjoys a dash of vanilla syrup in their black tea, and another who stirs their sweet, milky tea with a cinnamon stick. Neither of those is how I'd choose to take my tea, and if they gave me the mug I likely wouldn't drink it. But I'm not going to have a go at them for making their tea the way they want to drink it.
