Erm...sorry to have to point this out, but you're completely wrong.

Lemon would normally be offered with Earl Grey tea. And regarding the amount of sugar folk take...many, many people take 2 or more. You may have heard the phrase "moo and two", a very common way to describe how someone likes their tea. Or you may have heard of builders tea? Very strong, very sweet. I've known folk to take 4 or 5 sugars in the past.

And above all - the correct way to take your cup of tea is however you enjoy it. There's no point forcing yourself to drink something you don't enjoy!
