I don't add lemon to tea, though I do add honey if my tea is hot; ice is all I add to cold tea. Not all that much ice, just enough to keep it cold. I don't have a preference on the Kind of tea, Earl Grey is alright, I don't really have a favorite, I'd drink any hot tea, as long as I'm aloud to add a spoonful of honey. I prefer hot tea, but only if it's not stupid hot that day, given I have to work outside half the time, though if I'm drinking cold tea I prefer that it be sweetened. Not really sweet, just slightly more so than not sweet at all.

I also don't like normal coffee, but I will drink a latte from time to time. I probably only drink five cups of normal coffee a year, and maybe two or three dozen lattes. I prefer tea.

But, as an American, I hate to break it to you.. We don't have kettles here. They exist, but you'd be hard pressed to find even one in every four houses. So I usually microwave my water. Not my Tea, my Water. I add the tea after I have the water as hot as I want it to be. I would apologize but I'm not sorry. You do you, and I'll do me.
