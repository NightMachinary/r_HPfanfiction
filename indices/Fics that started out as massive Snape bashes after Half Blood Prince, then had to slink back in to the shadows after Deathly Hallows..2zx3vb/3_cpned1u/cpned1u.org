Not completely what you're asking, but I remember reading a Marauder fic that was written shortly before OP came out, in which the characters were spending the summer at Sirius's house with his loving/indulgent/sweet mother.

Book 5 came out and the next chapter had a note that said something like "Okay, so I screwed that up."

Also, I swear to god that I remember reading a fic in which Harry's kids were named James/Lily/Severus/Molly. I thought it was weird that the author would switch out Dumbledore's name like that, until I realized that the fic had been written in 2006, and there were all of these flame-y reviews from 2006 saying that Harry would NEVER name his kid after Snape.
