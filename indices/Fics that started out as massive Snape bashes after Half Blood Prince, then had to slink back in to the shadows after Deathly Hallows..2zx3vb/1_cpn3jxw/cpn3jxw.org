This could be expanded upon in a few different ways:

Do people like to admit when they're wrong?

In fanfiction, is following canon a virtue or a hindrance?

Do authors that engage in bashing tend to listen to criticism about characterizations?

Any of these would make excellent lead-ins for a discussion.

My own personal feeling is that there won't be many fics like the ones you're describing for one simple reason: HBP was incredibly divisive.

Anyone who wanted to write an HBP centered fic probably did so right after finishing the book. There was a /two year gap/ between publishing of HBP in July 2005 and DH in July 2007.

If you're so eager for schadenfreude I'd suggest looking for long, abandoned fics started between those dates (probably closer to 2007). One of them may have the A/N you're looking for. To be quite honest, HBP is my least favourite book of the series but /has/ inspired some of the best fanfiction from this community.

Rather curious, but there you are.
