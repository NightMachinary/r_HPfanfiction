Does /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/ itself count? The entire tone of that twist (if not the actual twist itself) was because JKR loved Alan Rickman's snarky, dark, /attractive/ Snape and afterward found the character so much more likable herself. She wrote the last book with such a loving heel-turn to give Alan Rickman a great death scene, not because it fit at all well with the previously written characterization of Snape.

I'm not saying he wasn't a complicated character from the start, but he really kicked the dog hard throughout the series. I don't buy a single act (with hand-waved back story) weighing up well against that sort of abuse. Certainly not enough to excuse the terrible epilogue name.
