I've read Full Circle before, haven't heard of the other, but I'll check it out.

I found another list of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b167ov/tomione/eik7673/][most popular rec'd fics here.]] Having read them myself, the writing style in those fics ranges from a minimum of competent to excellent, and I'm usually a stickler for good prose beyond spellcheck and punctuation. They should keep you occupied for a while if you're looking to fill up a reading list.

The plots are decent, too. All of them qualify for having a storyline outside of the standard shipfic's drawn out "will they get together?" tension.
