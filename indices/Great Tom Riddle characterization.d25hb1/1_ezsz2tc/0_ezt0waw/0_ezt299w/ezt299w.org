Do you have recs for fics with good plots?

So many of these kinds of fics focus purely on romance, which becomes same-y once you read 20 of them and the stories all run the same way.

I enjoyed linkao3(15873207) "Ink", which is similar to Renatus in certain ways - mysterious young DADA professor comes to teach at Hogwarts, and guess what, he's secretly Voldemort.

linkao3(2296544) "Lithium" is probably my favorite Tom mentors Harry fic. It's one of those fics that has a strong grasp of character and voice, and an actual plot. The romance is background slowburn, but the story focuses more on character development. Tom Riddle gets an actual, believable growth arc, and that's like a fanfic unicorn.

  Tom Riddle is not the diary, but during his more lonesome periods the line between his consciousness and the yellowed pages of the timeless journal thins until the leather cover is his body and the black ink is his tongue. In spite of his own mind's hallucinations, where every rustle of the paper feels like the fluttering of his robes, Tom Riddle is but a memory with its own will, chained. A snippet from an old newspaper futilely rewriting its own articles, never to be read.

The writing is top notch. A good present-tense story that reads so much smoother than the choppy present-tense in Renatus.
