*Pros about this fic:*

- There is a plot outside of the romance/shipping. It's an interesting plot.

- It vaguely follows the events of GoF, but has enough mystery and twists that the stations are avoided. Once the twist is revealed, there is still enough plot left to explore that the story doesn't feel like it suffers from "premature resolution". Game of Thrones is the prime example of this, where all the tension was sucked out after Season 8 Episode 3.

- Interesting character dynamics. Viktor, Hermione, and Ron can all be friends and work together without bashing and petty bickering. No one gets hit by fanon characterization, each member of the cast has reasonable motivations, and scenes with lots of characters shine as the dialogue gives each a unique voice.

.

*Cons:*

- Weird writing style. The author loves their one sentence paragraphs.

#+begin_quote
  The whole story is written sentence by sentence.

  It can be a useful tool.

  In adding tension and movement in action sequences.

  But because all the slower moments are also written this way, the pacing feels off.
#+end_quote

- Punctuation. The author uses so many commas in every sentence that reading this story feels like the wheelchair kid with asthma from /Malcolm in the Middle/ is narrating this fic to me. Throws the sentence flow right off.

#+begin_quote
  "What's worse, though, what makes him right furious at Fleur, and his parents, and Hagrid, and Riddle, and You Know fucking Who, at them, is that they could be."

  "Harry should be used to it by now- that look on her face, but it sits, uneasy, at his chest, still, because he understands it, cannot blame her for it, cannot recognise her, and yet she is still so Hermione Granger, more even, perhaps, than she ever has been."
#+end_quote

It's extremely distracting once you notice it. And once you see, you cannot unsee.
