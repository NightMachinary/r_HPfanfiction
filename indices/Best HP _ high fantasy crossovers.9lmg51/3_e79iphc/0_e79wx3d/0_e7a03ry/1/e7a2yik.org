Appreciate your thoughts, always good to see someone put the time into their argument!

Regarding good and evil, everything in game of thrones is about “good” vs “evil”. R.R. Martin did an interview I read a long time back, sadly can't find it at the moment, saying that he loved being subversive on how various themes are portrayed. So for example, a character who is good in one scene is the evil to another, constant flux.

Yes the over-riding theme, and one that if there TV show is your only exposure then may not be as obvious, is the alignment of good versus the ultimate evil. Everything else is the lead up, and let us not forget that the books are not even written yet. It will be interesting to see the divergence of the TV show storyline from that of the books.

Surely magic in LOTR is also pretty vague? Most people don't have exposure, wizards are rare, magic is more fairytale than everyday life. The children, skinchangers, he followers of the god of light etc. Some like the skinchangers are an explicit if specific use of magic, others like some of the actions by Melisandre you could say are more subtle. Don't forget that LoTR only has 5 wizards in existence. 5 magic users in the whole of history. Elves which are rarely seen, dwarfs who disappeared into their mines, hobbits who never leave the shire etc etc. Which leads into

Magical animals, if we are not counting the undead / wights then we cannot count the Nazgul, as they are also the undead. Dragons, white walkers, children of the forest, basilisk, wyverns, manticores,lizard-lion, shadowcat etc etc. Once again, less prevalent in the TV show, but instances are mentioned quick specifically in the books. As a world, middle earth is also pretty dominated by humans.

I'm not sure you can honestly say the scope is narrow for GoT, with wide ranging quests and journeys happening throughout and over large distances, pitched battles, going back to the good versus evil, we are often pushed to see one side as more good than another, yes this sometimes gets turned on its head however just because we do not question the facts we are given does not make the world change, it just shows our own limitations.

To save the world, first you must save yourselves.

The side of good must be created. This is a story about creating what good means, what does it look like? We must combat selfishness and petty ambition, no man is infallible to this. It is a story of humanity in that respect, political another, war and adventure, equality, ambition and fear. But despite this and all these themes, it is a story of good, versus evil.

We may just not have questioned ourselves enough or pushed for the answers yet. Content to let the story guide us, trick us and tease us.

The difference between high and low fantasy is not best judged by how clear the motivations are, but in the themes and topics presented within.

In this case, I stand by my original position of high fantasy.
