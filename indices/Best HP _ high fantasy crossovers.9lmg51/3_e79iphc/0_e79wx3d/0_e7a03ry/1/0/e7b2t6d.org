I've always thought of the good vs evil in high fantasy to be a more overarching theme though. That is, good vs evil is more about an external struggle rather than an internal struggle like what you're saying about characters being good in one scene and evil in another. Sure, there are high fantasies like Tolkien's where a character has an internalised struggle of good and evil (e.g., Boromir), but there is always an external cause to it. Boromir is an archetypal hero of the fantasy genre, and it's clear that he is inherently a good person (though flawed, as all good characters are). He struggles with the evil presented by the temptation of Sauron's ring, but at the core of it, he is still a good person. There is nothing like the grey moralities of characters in GoT, which are present because that is /who they are/, rather than there existing a ring of evil to corrupt and twist them into behaving in an evil way. There is no struggle of good vs evil in that sense in GoT, only heavily flawed and controversial characters, imo.

True, everything else is a lead-up to the final confrontation between humanity (good) and the White Walkers (evil). But that everything else is a dominant part of the story, most of which has absolutely no relevance to the oncoming threat of the White Walkers. GoT is more focused on the low fantasy side of things (the politics, wars, power struggle, etc.) rather than the high fantasy side of things (the White Walkers). And while I'll agree there are elements of high fantasy in GoT, I can't help but consider GoT as /predominantly/ low fantasy because such a large portion of the storyline is low fantasy.

LoTR is written about an age where magic is passing into legend, I think. But while most people in LoTR haven't had exposure to fantastical elements (though they have had plenty of exposure to orcs), they still believe in them. It's a fact to the people of LoTR that wizards exist, Hobbits exist, elves exist, magic exists, etc. They are fully aware of the existence of the fantastical, and live in a world where it is accepted, where the magical are a good chunk of the population, if not the majority. In GoT, on the other hand, magic is something most don't believe in anymore, and there are very few magical creatures/beings left.

If we're talking about GoT's geographic scope, then yeah, it's pretty wide-ranging. I was referring more to the themes and storylines, though, which are more focused on the low fantasy side of things, and the great struggle of humanity vs the White Walkers is peripheral to much of the plot up to now.

It's interesting how different our interpretations of GoT are, maybe because I expect to see a low fantasy while you expect to see a high fantasy? But I don't think the story is about 'creating what good means' and debating what does good look like. For me, GoT is simply about power, and how far people will go to acquire it.

I think the biggest point of divergence in our interpretations is probably that I place more emphasis on the journey of the story, whereas you place more emphasis on the end-game of the story, if that makes sense. Though you've convinced me that it's at least not as definitively low fantasy as I thought, so I'll retract my initial comment. But just like you stand by your opinion that GoT is a high fantasy, I stand by mine that it's a low fantasy, with elements of high fantasy.
