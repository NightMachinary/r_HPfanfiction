Huh. Interesting that you see GoT that way. Well, first off, I don't think GoT really has a good vs evil struggle. The evil is the White Walkers, I suppose, but there's no real 'good' side in GoT, more like the side that wants to survive. The closest is Daenerys, but even then she's not exactly 'good' either. Her cause certainly isn't noble; she wants to reclaim the throne, not for the people or the good of the realm, but because she believes it's her birthright, and she is therefore entitled to it. That's pretty selfish, imo. And even if you disagree with my assessment of Dany's character, it's undeniable that the good vs evil struggle is not as clear-cut as it would be expected to be in a high fantasy story.

Magic in GoT is pretty vague too, imo. There's no sorcerer like Gandalf. There's no wands, no spells, etc. What magic GoT does have tends to be very obscure and mysterious - certainly a subtler and rarer brand of magic, the kind that I would expect to see in a low fantasy setting. It hints at something magical, rather than going full-blown magic battles where people are throwing fireballs at each other.

The scale of GoT is somewhat debatable too, because the first six seasons have been of a very narrowed scope, with the exception of the Night's Watch. In other parts of Westeros, the stories are heavily focused on individual interests and the struggle for power, which doesn't fit with the 'save the world' theme most high fantasy stories have. It's only the Night's Watch (and Varys?) that show any concern for the overall state of the realm.

Then there's also the fact that GoT is dominated by humans, and has very little magical creatures, which is a pretty big part of high fantasy, I think. There's only the dragons and the White Walkers (not counting wights because well, they're dead), but theirs is such a small population that I don't think it can really be counted to considering GoT a high fantasy.
