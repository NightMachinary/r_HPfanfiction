I agree that it's definitely far more low fantasy than high fantasy, but I suggest the low fantasy take on high fantasy over it being a low fantasy purely because, while peripheral to a large part of the story, the framework of the story is more or less based on those high fantasy elements. While adjacent to the story for the majority of the series, Winter and the Long Night are likely going to be the major plot threads for the rest of the series (considering that the next book is titled The Winds of Winter, and the one after that A Dream of Spring), and it could be argued that the series is laid on the foundation of this very classically high-fantasy battle between the living and the dead. Without the looming threat The Others, the story is kind of just a lot of circuitous backstabbing interspersed with GRRM waxing poetic on the frailties of feudalism as a form of government. A lot of the plot structure surrounding characters like Jon, Stannis and The Wildlings, Asha, etc. falls apart. Plus the conflict brewing between Dany and Aegon as claimants for the Iron Throne will serve to cripple Dany's army in another Dance of Dragons, as well as increase the tension between Jon and her when it's revealed that he's actually her nephew and another possible threat to her rule, despite being the possible prophesied hero to save the world. Their interaction would be a lot less vital or interesting if Jon wasn't the designated hero of the high-fantasy section of the series and Dany wasn't the designated hero of the low-fantasy part of series. So, yeah, definitely more low fantasy than high fantasy, but the framework the story rests on IMO is very high fantasy.
