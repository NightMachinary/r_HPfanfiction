Yes, that's true. It's definitely not a classic low fantasy but a play on tropes and genres. I think that's true of many stories, that they can't be fit into one neat category. GoT is, however, more low fantasy than high fantasy, imo, with elements of the latter being mostly peripheral to a large part of the story. I've never really thought of it as a low fantasy take on a high fantasy, but I definitely see your point there, so that's food for thought.
