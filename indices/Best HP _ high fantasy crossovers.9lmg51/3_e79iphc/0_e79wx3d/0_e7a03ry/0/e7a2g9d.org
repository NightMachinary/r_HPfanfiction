ASOIAF is a bizarre series that kind of defies the general "low-high" paradigm of fantasy, because it has elements of both. In the corner of low fantasy is the fact that most of Westeros is dominated by humans (though we know other races existed prior to mankind) and the fact that magic is vague and mysterious, but it also has the high fantasy aspect of the Long Night and the prophecy surrounding it. Most low fantasy stories don't concern themselves with supernatural, cataclysmic events; the return of the White Walkers, along with the return of the prophesied hero to defeat them with a flaming sword is /very/ high fantasy. GRRM has often said that ASOIAF/GOT are a response to Tolkien, and I think I get what he's saying: essentially the story boils down to an Aragorn analogue (Jon/Dany/both depending on your viewpoint) defeating the forces of dark, but it's a more grounded take on that story, one that takes into account what [[https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/04/grrm-asks-what-was-aragorns-tax-policy/][Aragorn's tax policy might have been]], and how rulers struggle to lead both ethically and efficiently at the same time. Essentially, it's a low fantasy take on a high fantasy.
