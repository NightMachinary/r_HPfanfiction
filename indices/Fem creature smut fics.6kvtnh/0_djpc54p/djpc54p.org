I have two candidates that /almost/ qualify. In both, Harry is something beyond a wizard.

linkffa(Incubus By BlakeMD) has him as a variant of the titular creature called a choiceling with suitably ridiculous rules and powers that enable his wish-fulfillment intentions.

In [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]], Harry is an alchemically-designed crossbreed of lots of magical creatures (because Lily was just that insane) with suitably ridiculous powers to enable his wish-fulfillment intentions.
