Hmmm, that's a really hard fic to find ones similar to. Here's a really obscure one I remember [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9255377/28]].

 

Other than that check out the stories linked in this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4l2mep/lf_stories_like_deprived/]]

 

For ones where harry is a good duelist check out these two:

In this one (Part 1 of 6 part story) he grows up in an orphanage and ends up killing with accidental magic and comes to term with killing and becomes more than ok with it later on. It's actually my favorite series I've read in a while. linkffn(12867536)

Edit: Bot isnt working for last one here it is, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming]]
