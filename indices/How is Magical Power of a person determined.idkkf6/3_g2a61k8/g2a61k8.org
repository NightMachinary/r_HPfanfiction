Quick note that I agree with Taure and Notus's theories besides an additional note of my belief that there is something inherent with magical strength, similar to a phenotypic range we might see with intelligence or strength, for example, where environment factors (like study, education, and use) might have an impact on magic.

However, my main point is that I'm super disappointed this is being downvoted. Yeah, there have been a lot of posts on magical cores and why they suck. Yes, people have posted their own theories on magical power before. But this post is, at the very least, a discussion post of an issue with substance. It certainly contributes to the subreddit and is on-topic. At any rate, it contributes far more than the constant spam of request posts or silly title-only prompt posts.
