Taure wrote something up (based from canon) here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gaquik/magical_cores_or_the_limits_of_a_wizard/#fp1dc84]].

Personally, I think the three main elements of being able to cast spells are self-belief, desire, and focus. Desire can sometimes override belief (accidental magic) but it generally goes in that order. You have to believe in yourself/your abilities to perform magic, you have to want it to happen, and you have to focus on what you want. Practice/skill comes later after a spell has been done repeatedly. Everything else (knowledge, age, words/wand movements, emotional state, etc) is just a bonus. Helpful to know/have, but not strictly necessary to perform (basic) magic.

Of course, for stronger, more powerful spells you'll need knowledge (Summoning/Patronus Charm), for consistant results you'll need a calm/relaxed emotional state (or experience casting spells in different moods), magic changes as a wizard ages (the Trace), verbal spells are stronger than non-verbal (words have power), and so on.
