I think that "Inherited Magical Traits" and "Magical Power" are 2 different things that have nothing to do with each other.

Yes, the Gaunt are Parselmouth, and yes, this is an inherited trait that stuck in the family since Slytherin himself . . . but being a Parselmouth is kinda useless. Sure, being able to talk to snake is pretty cool, and if you have a basilisk nearby you can become a threat to others, but this trait does not automatically give someone a better understanding of magic, or let you use a new school of spells (Parselmagic is 100% canon).

In the same way, Tonks Metamorphmagus abilities are pretty neat, and it may even have a use in Transfiguration (if anything, constantly changing your appearance may at least help a little when you try "Self Transfiguration"), but her talents are her own, nor her family. It is not impossible for an individual to have both an inherited magical trait and be a mediocre wizard (the Gaunts kinda proved this point with their life).

In the story, the strongest wizard may be Half Blood (and in Voldemort case, his muggle father probably helped to wash generation of inbreeding), but it doesn't mean that the Half Blood are automatically stronger than the others. According to Ron, Half Blood represent the majority of the Magical World (which make sense), and most of them are average. As an example, Alberforth Dumbledore, while not a slouch, can't be compared with his brother at all, even though they have the same family and similar circunstances.

Concerning the Squibbs, canon doesn't give any information about the family of Squibbs. What are the chances for their children to be magical? Same as the wizards? Same as the Muggles? Or something in between?\\
But it's not really a revelant point since Merope is not a Squibb. As long as she was able to use a spell, she was a witch no matter how weak she was. Dumbledore said himself that Merope weak abilities probably came from her circunstances. She was abused for most of her life, which hindered her magic (like how depressed Tonk had trouble using magic in HBP). She also never received a good education (since apparently, no Gaunts had gone to Hogwarts for generation by the time Merope was around). And finally, she probably had an ill suited wand (can't see the Gaunt willing, or even being able to pay the 7 Galleons to Olivander).

My point is that Voldemort was not among the strongest because he was an Half Blood. He was among the strongest because he was an incredibly talented individual, who happened to be a Half Blood. Just like Dumbledore.
