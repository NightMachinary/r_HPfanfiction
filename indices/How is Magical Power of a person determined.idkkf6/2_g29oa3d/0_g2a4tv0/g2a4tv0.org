JK kind of contradicts herself with inheritance. She makes it clear that magical power does not come from blood but then makes the Gaunts almost squiblike and the sole inheritors (outside of India?) of the rare inherited magical trait Parselmouth. And then she goes on and makes the half blood characters the seemingly most powerful.

Just to be clear, I like your theory and I think its a large part of canon, but I am just so dang confused.
