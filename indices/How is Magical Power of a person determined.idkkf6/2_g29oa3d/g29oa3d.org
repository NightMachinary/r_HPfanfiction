It is clear that the Magical Power does not come from blood. Making it so would mean that the Blood Purist had a point.

Concerning the Magical Power, I like to compare Magic to Music. Every wizard is able to use Magic like everyone is able to do music, and yet some people are more talented than others. Practising may help an average person to become better, but a genius could learn in one hour when he took 3 days to learn. And in the end, only the people blessed with both talent and hard work are able to rise at the top.

Ancestry and environment may help a little (the child of a genius may have a little more chance to be talented even if he doesn't reach the level of his parent, and a child raised in a magical family may get a headstart compared to the muggleborn), but in the end, talent make the difference and a Muggleborn can become the best if he is talented or hardworking enough.
