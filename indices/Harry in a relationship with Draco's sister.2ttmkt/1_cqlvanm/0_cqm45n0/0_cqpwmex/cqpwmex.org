well... it's quite long... if you wouldn't mind... message me an email id to which i can send it to you.. and you can let me know... how my fanfic is. it might be too cliche or overly dramatic too. the oc may seem too mary sue-ish, but making her too ordinary would take away the charm of the character... and the "malfoy-ness", although i tried my level best to keep her in a grey area, where she does make mistakes, but you can only be able to see it in the later chapters. if you are okay with reading such a character then i'll mail you the story before i post it on fanfiction.net.
