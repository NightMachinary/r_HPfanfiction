hey there.. umm.. i actually writing a couple of stories with harry in a relationship with draco's sister premises. one set during harry's sixth year... and the other where they are all grown up.. but harry comes to know about draco's sister only later. i am halfway through finishing the first one. since i have a sketch of how i want the story to go... i hadn't uploaded it as of yet, but i am thinking of posting it soon, in a week or so, on fanfiction.net. if you are interested in reading it.. buzz me.. and i'll send you the link. i agree there aren't much stories like that... and if they do.. eventually they don't end up together and that's where the idea for the fanfic came up. my fanfic is something of a first time attempt so if you find it terrible while reading it, do give me criticism about it.
