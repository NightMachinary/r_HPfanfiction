Not really. Having never read a Harry/Draco's Sister pairing, I can't really say much, but there are some inherent issues with such a relationship.

For one, how could a member of the 'Noble House of Malfoy', daughter of one of The Dark Lord's followers, easily have a romantic relationship with Harry Potter?
