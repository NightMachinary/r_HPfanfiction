Haha it's beautiful.

Magic is about intent. Hedwig wants to be an owl. Harry does not want to give her owl body back. Ergo: Hedwig becomes owl animagus

But bc it depends on Harry's body, she becomes BLACK boy-owl and is very disgruntled about her plume lol

Alas since they are both owls now, Hedwig can coaxe Harry into swapping back using the power of therapy and some very effective psychological trick that every owl working for wizardkind learns from the nest
