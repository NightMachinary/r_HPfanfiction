If I recall correctly, there is a Harry Potter fanfiction where one of Harry's friends has a grandfather who runs a theater company. They do a couple of plays, one featuring a Triwizard Tournament which takes place at Beaubaxtons during the French Revolution and the story of the tragedy is told in great detail. I'm not sure what fic it was but I'm positive it's The Accidental Animagus.
