Armand Malfoy came to England with William the Conqueror or William I as part of the Norman Conquest. Where does it say that "Malfoy" was a title forced on to Armand or his ancestors? If it was, surely William I, who had already given him land and riches as a reward for fighting for him (and carrying out behind the scenes and unscrupulous work) would have declared that he would no longer be called "Malfoy". The House of Malfoy is proud of their name and what it represents in Magical Britain and maybe Europe as well. I think it's honestly far-fetched that Armand Malfoy would not have a brother/s at that time period who were magical and just as unscrupulous as Armand themselves.

Let's say that the adults supressed their magic because they had better control and if the children did so, they would turn into obscurials. But isn't that if they did so willingly to avoid persecution? What if the entire event had been such a bad experience for them that the trauma hampered their magical abilities. Maybe their children could be born with magic, maybe they would not. Maybe those kids would lose faith in magic altogether and pray their children aren't born magical. It could be anything that would in the end see them as children with no magical abilities being born and would then be just like the other muggles.
