I feel like people who say the Malfoy family would still have secondary branches in magical France don't fully grasp the family's namesake. People joke how they're named ‘Bad Faith', but don't seem to realise that is is not either a name associated to land or a profession like Valois and Potter are respectively. This was name forced in some way upon Armand Malfoy and - most likely - his forefathers. This was not a name they decided for themselves. The Lestrange family has a similar situation, but being ‘étrange' is very much less worthy of being kicked out of the country at the first opportunity.

Also, Louisiana and Quebec were already separated between the British and the Spanish with Louisiana becoming French again under the rule of Napoleon before they sell it to the US, if we're going with Muggle history accuracy. Children wouldn't have become Squibs in your scenario, but Obscuri, which would have definitely been recorded considering how destructive they are and how so many children would have died because of it.

But yeah, it would be cool to know what happened during the French Revolution, the Terror and Napoleon's reign. We also know the last Triwizard Tournament was held in 1792 before it was cancelled, so maybe they just didn't care like they did for the American Independence War.
