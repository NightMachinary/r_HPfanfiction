I like this, but I'm iffy on the â€˜Danton is a half-giant' thing. Maybe he was part giant, but certainly not half one, at least not in the books. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are both around twelve feet tall, the same size of the troll that almost killed Hermione in PS. Compared to that, Robert Pershing Wadlow, the tallest man in medical history, wasn't even nine feet tall (although very close).
