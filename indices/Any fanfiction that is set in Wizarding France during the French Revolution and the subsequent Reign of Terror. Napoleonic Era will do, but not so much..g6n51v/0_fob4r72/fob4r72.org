The Revolution is a fascinating piece of history - but it's so incredibly complex that it's also very difficult to do it justice in fiction. I'd be disappointed to find it oversimplified like in a lot of narratives (particularly the anglo-centric ones), or overly noble focused. (For instance, the oversimplification on Robespierre in your post would be something I wouldn't be a fan of. Same with describing the French taxation setup as "King Louis' crazy taxation laws", when it had basically nothing to do with him and /entirely/ based on the historical background of Europe in general. Basically, I'm very picky on the Revolution :P .)

I find it easier to take a few steps back and kind of draw out how it could have affected (and been affected by) the french wizarding community. I've got an AU somewhat/mostly figured out that was based on that, at least for Western Europe - where the French Revolution also had a massive wizarding impact.

In that view, I'd have the wizarding world as analogous to the real one - with wizards falling into both nobility /and/ commoners, and the French wizarding community starting off with the more noble/rich purebloods in rather firm control. The revolutionaries would thus include wizards - and, in my view, having some of the more notable ones be wizards also fits well. Danton would be a /perfect/ half-giant, for instance.

For the French magical government, much would depend on how and when it is set up. In 1790, it would likely be a fairly moderate institution. If in 1792-1794, it would be much more radical. An interesting point to decouple the magical and muggle world, however, might be with the establishment of the Consulate (when Napoleon first took power, essentially) - having a magical consul would be a lot more unique.

One of the reasons I like having the wizarding world involved in the revolution, with wizards on both sides of the cultural issues, is that it'd help establish/explain the seemingly more open French attitude towards the non-humans in canon. At least, with both Madame Maximme and Fleur being important characters and seemingly not really discriminated against due to their ancestry, or far less so than they would have likely been in Britain. That would appear to me to be a natural inclusion into the wizarding revolution.

It would also be the only way I can /really/ think of to explain why french pureblood nobility would become emigres - because with magic, it ought to be easy to hide from muggles. So if you want them to join the diaspora, you need to have wizards involved too - with all the hand wringing about breaking the statute of secrecy that'd imply. For links to the British, I would say that the Malfoys would likely have had a branch of the family in France, but the Blacks don't give me that same impression.

For the muggle world, the revolution was /the/ main political event around which everything in Europe orbited for at least 50-60 years. Why not make it the same for the Wizarding one, too? ;)
