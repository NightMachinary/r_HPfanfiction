Not specifically, other than the actual 'Knowledge is Power'. They tend to be found in the same sort of trope-genres though. I think there's a similar one with Werewolves and the search for a cure, but I can't remember the title. I'm currently resorting my bookmarks for download with Fanficfare, so I'll check through them while I'm going through and see if I can find it. Might be worth making an actual thread for it though, if you're interested in recs for it. It tends to be a rather cliche-ridden area, but there are some good fics in that whole trope-genre.
