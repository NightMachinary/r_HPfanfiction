I know the fic you are talking about but can't remember the name. Harry is a Ravenclaw. In the first chapter he is running on the rooftops of Hogwarts trying to make it back before sunset because he would be attacked. He brewed and drank a clarity potion which enhanced him. He also sold the potion not knowing that it is illegal. James was alive and almost catches him in one of his operations and he was trying to find a way to bring Sirius back.
