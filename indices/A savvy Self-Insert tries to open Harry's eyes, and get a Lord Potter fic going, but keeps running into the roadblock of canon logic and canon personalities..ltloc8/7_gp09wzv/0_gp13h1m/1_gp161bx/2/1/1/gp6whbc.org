Exactly, he was disowned by the family but the family property is entailed on the eldest child - assuming that magical societies are less sexist than muggles and don't specify eldest male heirs.

Of course, that doesn't explain how Sirius was able to leave Grimmauld Place to Harry, instead of it going to the next available heir, who is either Andromeda (if unsexist) or Draco.

So, as I see it, either the entail has run its course - this assumes that magical and muggle law has rules against perpetual trusts OR there was some sort of adoption of Harry by Sirius.
