Would have to see specifically how it is in England, but as far as I know there is no money and properties owned by a /house/, they are owned by the members of the family and each one can do whatever they want with their parts. Inheritance would work by both the decision of each person as set on their last Will and Testament if they had made one and the laws of the specific country, mostly the Will would have priority, but certain laws need to be followed depending of the country, F Ex.: in my home country neither the partner nor the children (regardless of being born in or out the wedlock) can be completely cut from the inheritance unless it is in a specific case, such as the children or partner killing the parent, so even if the testament says outright that one of them is not to inherit a part of the spoils (1/2 if I am not mistaken) will still be set aside to be divided by them.

Plus in most countries convicted criminals can still inherit even if they are serving a life-sentence, they just won't have anything to /use/ their inheritance for. If I am not mistaken there is /some/ legal proceeding to be adopted to pass some of their proprieties to their family members to administer, also some set payments to children or spouses though the convicted would have to be consulted about it. Other than that everything the person own is still theirs.
