Also reading “the international Triwizard tournament” it is great, I can barely wait for the next chapter with the so waited showdown, and they most certainly managed to strike the perfect balance between the screen-time given to political/economic plot-lines and magical-growth. Though it /did/ bother me who died last chapter, but at least it wasn't just for the shock-value, I can see where it was coming from both in and out of story.
