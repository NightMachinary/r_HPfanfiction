Nobility focused stories are /really/ not my cup of tea, but your take on it is by far much more well-thought out than the used on the majority of those stories. Plus the reference to “Albus and Harry's world trip” is always appreciated, that is one of my favorites and that take on Dumbledore is far more interesting than the same old “I am supposed to be some kind of magical genius, cunning political mastermind and ruthless manipulator, but you see, a hag scammed me out of my brain, so I will just scream all my stupid and convoluted plans which have no identifiable objective beyond being a dick at you and then be surprised when they don't work”.
