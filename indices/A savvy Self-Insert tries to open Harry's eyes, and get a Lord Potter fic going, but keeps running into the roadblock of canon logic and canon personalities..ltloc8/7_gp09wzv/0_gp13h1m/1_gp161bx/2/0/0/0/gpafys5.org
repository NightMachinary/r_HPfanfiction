I loved that one as well. I wish it would update again soon. Anyway, even if Dumbles realistically had the skills to do that, the human brain simply doesn't have the raw power to keep track of all that. I have a lot of ideas about how BMN could be set up, but I never really got into writing a story with any of them. If you want a story with a good premise and some ok politics, then Salient91's Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament is pretty good, although it is a little dry. Its absolutely massive, and even gets (slightly) into international politics in the magical world. You could PM me if you want some more of my thoughts.
