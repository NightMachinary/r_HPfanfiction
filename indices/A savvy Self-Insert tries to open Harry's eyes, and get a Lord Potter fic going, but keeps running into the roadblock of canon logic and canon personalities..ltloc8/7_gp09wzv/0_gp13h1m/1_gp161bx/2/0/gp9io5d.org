The way I understand it, in BMN Families, when the family is established, a central vault is established for the express purpose of maintaining the entire family and the lordship status. Then, each individual gets a personal vault, just like a personal debit card. When a new child is born, they get a trust vault for school and to kickstart their lives when they come of age. When any of the family dies without a designated heir, their assets are folded back into the Family Vault and their Personal Vault is closed.

Property Ownership can be attached to any Vault, such that the deed to Potter Castle or whatever is in the Potter Vault, not James' Personal Vault. A Family Vault would be nearly impossible to break into. A Key, a specific Goblin Fingerscrape Signature, a verbal password, a blood ward keyed to the family, the magical signature of the Lord's or Heir's Ring, a dragon, being down in the deepest part of the Bank, all kinds of wards and curses and traps and stuff. Meanwhile, a personal vault has much less valuable stuff in it, so it's got way fewer protections.

Now, if you say "But Vault 713 didn't have any of that, and it's got arguably the most important object in the world in it." That's because the Goblins either had no idea what they were guarding, or they knew what it was supposed to be and it was a ruse on Flamel's part, so they didn't care about the single ruby in the vault, or it was the real thing and they just couldn't tell. Then you'll say "But what about Hagrid saying 'It's about You-Know-What in Vault You-Know-Which', that was probably just a code phrase or something that Dumbledore set up. Or maybe Flamel did, told Dumbledore that keyphrase, and then told the Goblins to give the person who used it a single ruby from such-and-such vault. I mean, people knew he had the thing practically from right when he made it, and he's super old. If he can't protect the thing, then I don't see how the five-hundred-year younger Dumbledore is going to.

And on the matter of its creation, I think he either did it on accident or he was an Idiot Savant. Like, other Alchemists used it as a euphemism about doing impossible things, like "Let me go whip up a Philosopher's Stone real quick first." or something. Flamel didn't get the sarcasm, thought it was something so laughably easy nobody talked about how it was done, did it on his own to prove he wasn't a worthless Alchemist, told a friend in the community, and instantly went celebrity levels of famous.
