Not really? Like, yeah, I know this happens but never actually meet anyone to whom it had happened.

... I thought I had been clear that my HC is that the potion is unable to actually mind-control someone, only creates a humiliating infatuation and makes the behavior extremely obvious, like, talking over the person to declaim poems of undying love instead of obeying them and not even getting close to sex cause the person would just randomly grab their hand and drag them through the door. The bit about legal repercussions was more of a /okay, that really isn't going to happen even in a million years â€˜cause the potion just doesn't work that way, but if it *does/ happen through some unknowable method, well here it is*.

Plus the whole nobility thing is actually just fandom, in cannon we have no reason to believe that nobility would still have any actual power above normal citizens, even Voldemort only tackled on a Lord on his name because of the anagram, Lucius himself was never called a lord for example, he was just rich enough to bribe Fudge.
