Mine is that Ron's reaction was the most common, he was obsessed with Romilda for a bit, but that was more humiliating rather than any form of mind-control, he was in control of his actions even while focusing on Romilda and it was extremely obvious to anyone who even bothered to give him the most superficial of looks even if they didn't know him at all, kind of like being very drunk, but not quite blackout levels, you will have decision-making problems but not to the point of trying to rob a bank and those around you will probably not allow you to take any lasting compromise even while laughing at you, and even if you /did/ manage to somehow contract an unwanted responsibility while under it that responsibility would either be considered illegal and thus void (marriage for example), be grounds for *BIG* economic compensations or of exclusive responsibility of the one who gave the person the potion (so manipulative(/coughidiotcough/)!Dumbledore would end up being the one required to provide and care for Harry and Ginny's children on that kind of story without any of them having the slightest chance of accessing Harry's legendary vault of awesomeness and Gold enough to fill up an ocean).

So their only actually practical use would be for pranks with anything else backfiring horribly enough that no one would actually be stupid enough to try.
