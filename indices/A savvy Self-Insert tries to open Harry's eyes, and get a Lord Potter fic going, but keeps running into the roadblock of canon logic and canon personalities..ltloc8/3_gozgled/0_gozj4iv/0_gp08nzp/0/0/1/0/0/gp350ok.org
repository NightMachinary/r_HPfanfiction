Thus the bit about monetary compensations heavy enough that no one would be crazy enough to even try it. I was thinking something along the lines of being completely unable to afford even the barest necessities for the next oh, 20 generations as an example.

Plus we are never really shown what is the true limit of those kinds of contracts. Yes the vow could kill the person who breaks it and the goblet supposedly had some vague but assuredly menacing effects, plus Hermione's DA sheet scarred Edgecomb, but none of them actually /forced/ the person to fulfill them, only caused consequences in case they broke the agreement, Marietta could possibly have been healed later, the goblet was vague to the extreme and the oath seems to take some degree of coherent thought to be agreed upon, it's perfectly possible that the contract can be broken or survived if given enough time and assistance.

Alternatively the ministry could instead force the potion user to take another oath -if those really /have/ to be fulfilled- that turns the first one petty much null. Like, person 1 agrees to give however much money person 2 asks whenever they ask while under the potion, person 2 is then forced by the ministry to take a oath to give back all money person 1 gives them with interest whenever it is solicited, or even just never ask person 1 for money whatsoever.
