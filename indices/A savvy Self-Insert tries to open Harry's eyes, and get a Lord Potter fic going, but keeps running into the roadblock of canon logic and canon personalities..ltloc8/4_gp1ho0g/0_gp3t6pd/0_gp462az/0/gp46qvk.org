Gryffindor, Slytherin, amd Black are the most common additional Surnames, as I understand. Slytherin typically either due to the Parseltongue, or some Right of Conquest type deal from defeating Voldy, which does actually make a certain amount of sense(Conquest I mean), especially given the Traits upheld by Salazar, and his House.
