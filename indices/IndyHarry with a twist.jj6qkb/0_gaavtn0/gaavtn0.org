I see you point. I only like those types of stories if at least Harry's mind has come from the future. And within reason too.

Like. Why does he have to be the riches wizard of all time? And why does he have to be the heir/lord to basicly every ancient mythological houses? Why not just declare him king and move on? Making him merlin heir basicly means jusy that to wizards.

It's beyond ridiculous.
