There's all sorts of writing in the world, and not everyone likes every sort of writing any more than everyone likes every sort of food or movie or music. If you don't like something, don't read it.

I don't get A/B/O but it clearly does something for some people because there's so much of it out there; my response is not to read it and to gladly leave others to read and write it if it makes them happy.

There's all sorts of people. Most of them aren't you, but that's okay, because there's room in the world for everyone, and there's nothing wrong with liking some genre or disliking some genre.

If you don't like coffee shop AUs, then read something else. It's pretty simple to avoid it if you don't like that stuff.
