  Can someone explain why you like these? I always felt like these where basically original fiction but without creating characters (laziness? or writing challenge?)

Often it's not even the characters. It's literally just using the names, with maybe a bit of their temperament. People who think Harry's character is being named Harry are weird. The fact that he's a Wizard born to parents who died in a war is kinda integral to his character.

I think it's basically a way to trick people into reading (shitty) original fiction... don't really see the appeal.
