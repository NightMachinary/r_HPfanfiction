I would mostly agree with you on this, except for the fact that I'm old as far as the Twilight fandom goes, and there were one or two good ones back in the heyday, before the last book came out and everyone realized how bad the books were. There were some great Twilight fics that were actually really good and plot heavy, and there were some pretty cracky ones that were great to read for laughs. I'm not sure if they HO crossover ones are still up, but if they are I'll try to link them.

Edit: I agree with you fully on the role of fanfic though! Some of the best fics I've read were like that, but sadly some of the greatest writers haven't updated in years.
