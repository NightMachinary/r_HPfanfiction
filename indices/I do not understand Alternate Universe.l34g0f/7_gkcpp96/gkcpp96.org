First I feel hp x twilight fanfiction is the highest xover ever, yet I've yet to find any good one, though I gotta say I didn't search that much, I gave up after first few pages.

I actually like when the creators break apart the story and recreate the story from the ground up, I think it give the the creators a free reign to do anything with the characters, and it's good for us readers too as we get something new to read, I mean I love HP but it get repeated as we know what will happen.

I think every fanfiction is for all intents and purposes an alternative Universe or dimensions, with canon being the original Universe. Though it doesn't mean all of them will be good.
