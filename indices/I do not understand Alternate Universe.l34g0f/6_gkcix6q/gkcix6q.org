Those are for shipping basically, they are works entirely focused on the shipping so they strip any of the actual elements of canon. Thus the fic is mostly just the characters flirting and fucking in some mundane setting. A high school AU presumably could at least have like some other drama based on grades or football or drugs or something, but the coffee shop AU is basically shipping boiled down into it's purest form. I don't like romance so I don't read any no magic AUs personally.
