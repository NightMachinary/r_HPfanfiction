This is basically how I feel about most AU I have read. If you switch the names from Harry to Hector it would be a original story.... well write an original story. The story I wrote about in my original post was a Muggle Harry living with his parents in Forks where he met a non Vampire Edward and fell in love..... no explanation of why Harry was un Forks, was his parents were alive (which lets be real has an enormous impact on his backstory) how Edward would still be alive in 2010s if he was not a vampire and why would he live with the Cullen if he was not a vampire (where are his parents, why is he in Forks)....

I hope that by reading some of the recommendations here I will get an idea of a good AU.
