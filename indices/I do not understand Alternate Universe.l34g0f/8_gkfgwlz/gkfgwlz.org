I also don't like complete AU's that are only with character names, but I would still like a muggle AU with the same story as canon. so Harry is still with the Dursleys and he goes to a boarding school his parents went to. and he makes friends with Ron and Hermione and enemies with Draco and their chemistry teacher. the plot would have to be different of course, like maybe he is trying to find out who killed his parents. so it would be a muggle AU but still Harry Potter.

I don't like AU's where you could just replace the character names and it will stop being a fanfic. I thought maybe the authors want more clicks/reads and that's why they do that. but idk.

caffeeshops AU is a no-no. it also annoys me with other fandoms that don't have magic, the characters that know each other since childhood suddenly don't know each other. like why?
