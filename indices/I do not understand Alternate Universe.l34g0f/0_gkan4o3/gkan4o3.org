This sub gravitates pretty heavily towards a genre I like to call SFAU - serious fantasy AU - which is a pretty recent (last 10 years) phenomenon in HP fanfic.

The AUs you're talking about are the traditional AU's like coffee shop stories and college stories. These have been around since the first wave of HPFF in the 90s and are generally more character oriented - it's easier to write/understand characters when they're not tied to a magic system or specific plot line. And some people just like seeing the characters brought into their own world.
