  Harry spent 13 years in a Mirror living his life as if it were real.

Forela? I remembered it (though it has been more than a decade) as the mirror transporting him to another world, no him living in a simulation, lol.

Anyway, I don't really hate the H/Snape part much, as 1) Harry is an actual adult, and 2) This was written pre-Snape leaking the prophecy to V.
