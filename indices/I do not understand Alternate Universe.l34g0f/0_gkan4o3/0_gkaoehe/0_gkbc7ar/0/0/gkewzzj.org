Harry spent 13 years in a Mirror living his life as if it were real. When he emerges, he is a 28 year old War Mage. He disguises himself as his adult identity and gets a position teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts.

There are so many great bits of magic included in it (like wizarding tattoos) and things that have become my head canon (how it's explained that Veritaserum works).

tbh it is more like an OC/Snape fic.
