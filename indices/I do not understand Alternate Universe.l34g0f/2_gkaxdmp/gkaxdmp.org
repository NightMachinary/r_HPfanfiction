Some of it that if I want to read canon I would read the books not a canon rehash fic. AU fics offer we something different which is interesting what if James and Lily lived (also see WBWLed), or even stories like linkffn(The Odds Were Never in my favour by Antony444) which I don't know how to describe except to say it is Harry Potter but turned up to an 11 on the epic fantasy scale.
