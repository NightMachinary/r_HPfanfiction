Theoretically, the appeal is in the characters: if you have compelling characters, you should be able to put them in pretty much any situation and get an interesting, or at least enjoyable, story out of it. Now, /in my own personal experience,/ people who write muggle AUs (and, well, people who write in this fandom, in general, but that's a whole other rant) tend to change the characters until they're basically OCs who happen to share names with canon characters, so at that point, the only connection to Harry Potter is arbitrary and superficial, hence, I assume, the widespread disdain.
