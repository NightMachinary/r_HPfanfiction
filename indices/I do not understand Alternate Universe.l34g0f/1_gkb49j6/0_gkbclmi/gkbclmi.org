This right here is the answer. Fanfiction can have the characters, the world, or both.

People write stories with the characters AND the world when they want something like a continuation of a funny story in between parts, or to change some big event in the story.

They write stories with the characters but not the world when they want to explore interesting character dynamics, like romance or mentorship etc.

They write stories with the world but not the characters when they want to explore parts of the world they're interested in (American magic school, etc).
