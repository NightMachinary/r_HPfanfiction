I enjoy (writing) AUs as a sort of puzzle exercise. For example, I have a story that sort of lands as a standard HP non-magic mystery AU with definite notes picked up from Hannibal with a slight aim towards countering some of the tropes of highly imbalanced/abusive relationships that show up in protag/villain ship fics in both those fandoms. (To clarify, it's influenced by Hannibal, but not a Hannibal AU.) Half the fun of that is working out how to rework the characters to come from similar backgrounds that would make them feel similar while obviously different. So in this story, Andromeda Black ran off with Ted Tonks, which was a problem because Ted Tonks was a broke communist, not because he was a muggleborn. The aurors is a specific branch of law enforcement, the RRS, that happens to hire a lot of alumni from the same school because of networking. Bill Weasley works for banks as a security hacker. Arthur's the head of a very small government department that no one takes seriously and mostly deals with alien hoaxes, but if there /is/ ever extraterrestrial contact, he's probably going to be the most important person in the British government. Harry isn't magic and he isn't a national hero, so the Dursleys rejected his acceptance at his parents' alma mater (Hogwarts) without even telling him about it, leaving him to grow up in completely different circumstances as a teenager.

Yes, it could be original fiction with a different set of characters, but for the same reason we're all here reading fanfiction exploring the same story taken a million different ways, it's /fun/ and interesting and maybe comfortable to play with these familiar characters, and to share the reimagining with other people who enjoy these characters as well.

For writers, it can be fun to prod at different aspects of a story, making them more or less important, adding in or stripping things away. If what you like about the story is a handful of characters, then when you go to write a fanfiction with them, there's no problem putting the rest aside. On the other hand, if what you like is the world-building but you could care less about the characters or the plot, maybe you're writing a story set in the same world, but completely filled with OCs.
