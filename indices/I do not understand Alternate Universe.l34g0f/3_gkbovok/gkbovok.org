The main nonmagical AU I've read was reimagining the whole canon plot with (sometimes futuristic) technology substituted for magic. Instead of Quidditch, Harry gets into the firearms team and proves to be a natural at that. Instead of being guarded by a portrait, the Griffin dormitory has a palm scanner. I liked the cleverness of how the author made all the replacements, and especially how the kids were all a bit smarter and sneakier than canon because "Harworts" is training them as counter-intelligence agents (with a side order of possible assassination).

Also, it can be read stand-alone but is actually part of a larger series, which crosses over a bunch of stories; the canon universe is still there and made an appearance in earlier books, but this one is showing the backstory of an alternate Hermione.
