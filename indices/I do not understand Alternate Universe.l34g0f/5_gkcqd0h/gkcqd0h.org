What I don't get are all the Coffeeshop AUs and such. Like, in 99% of those stories, you could still have magic in the universe since it's character driven plot anyway, so why remove magic? Why rewrite the entire backstory when you could just have a coffeehouse in Diagon Alley. Or even Harry going to some Muggle coffee shop during his lunch hour.
