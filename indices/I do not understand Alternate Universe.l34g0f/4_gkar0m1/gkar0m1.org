I think it boils down to the fact that, if a situation is possible, someone will write about it. A lot of the time it is totally the result of a runaway imagination and if you let any preconceived notations go, it just becomes another story with a somewhat familiar character. People fell in love with the HP characters and want to try them out in different situations. It never has to make sense; it's fan fiction. AUs, more than most fan fics, take the â€˜what ifs' to extreme levels. They ARE character driven and situational. And we kinda love them for it.
