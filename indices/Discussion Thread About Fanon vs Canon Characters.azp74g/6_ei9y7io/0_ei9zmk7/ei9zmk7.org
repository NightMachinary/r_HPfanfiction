What fics have you been reading?

I'm particularly picky about portrayals of Tom in fanfic, as Voldemort is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time, and nothing rings my pet peeve bell like fanfic Tom Riddle characterized as a generic romantic loverboy, instead of the repressed, delusional psychopath that he really is.

The smirking, eyebrow-waggling, smoldering Slytherin sex god character is basically fanon Draco's archetype, and I find it weird af to see it copy-pasted over Tom Riddle of all people.
