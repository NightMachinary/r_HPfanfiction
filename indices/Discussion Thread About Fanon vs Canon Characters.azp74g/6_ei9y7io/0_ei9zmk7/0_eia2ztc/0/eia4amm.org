By "waggling" eyebrows, I mean the constant single, sarcastic eyebrow arching that a lot of Slytherins do in fanfiction when they're being smirky. Fanon Draco does it a lot, and I'm not surprised to see it show up on Fanon Tom Riddle.

There are a couple of well written fics, with good characterizations of Tom Riddle, in the ship you're looking for. I believe some of the more commonly rec'd ones are:

- Addendum: He is Also a Liar linkffn(11562871)

- Birds of a Feather linkffn(13103526)

- Choosing Grey linkffn(11722608)

None of these feel like a copy-pasted Draco, which is one of the things I look for.
