In the order they're listed. The first two are an unconventional type of relationship, which matches your description of "romance with Tom Riddle isn't a normal-type of romance". The second one goes further into developing the romance, while the last one is a more straightforward ship, but all of them have decent to excellent writing, and avoid too many annoying tropes. They also portray a more intelligent, scholarly characterization of Tom Riddle instead of the smirking sexbeast version you see in many other fics.
