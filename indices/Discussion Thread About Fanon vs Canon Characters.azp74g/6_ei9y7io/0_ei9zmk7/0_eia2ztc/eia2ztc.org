[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4052518/1/Time-Crash][Time Crash]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3566859/1/The-Three-Portals][The Three Portals]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2406786/1/Have-You-Ever][Have You Ever]] to name a few. I haven't read the whole thing as I usually skip to Tom's introduction and see if the story is worth reading (the three I mentioned aren't, with Have You Ever being in particularly bad company). I don't mind some sort of Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger romance to an extent, but romance with Tom Riddle isn't a normal-type of romance. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4630606/1/Fourier-s-Flaw][Fourier's Flaw]] handles this rather well, with a good characterization of Tom Riddle, but the story lacks in some other areas, namely that of Tom and his followers. And from what I've read, I've yet to see Tom Riddle "waggle" his eyebrows, and doesn't have sex. Perhaps this is copied and pasted from Draco's archetype because they are both Slytherin, and assuming most writers who champion a Draco/Hermione, Tom/Hermione story are female and they think all "bad guys" are alike?
