I've been on a Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger high recently, and though Tom is described as "charming" (to an extent) in the books, many authors have him smirking, grinning, and going all doe-eyed with Hermione by Chapter 5. I think authors that have him do this are missing the point in that one does not have to grin or smirk to be charming. To me, Tom's charm came from his "humble" upbringing at the orphanage, to his stellar academic record. He'd probably participate in class, showed genuine scholastic aptitude, and had a thirst for knowledge of magic. (Granted, I'm not sure how much charm he showed in Transfiguration with Professor Dumbledore.) It's hard to place Tom's character, but many authors shove him under the romance limelight just because they want him to get with Hermione. It sells both of their characters short and completely ruins Tom for me.
