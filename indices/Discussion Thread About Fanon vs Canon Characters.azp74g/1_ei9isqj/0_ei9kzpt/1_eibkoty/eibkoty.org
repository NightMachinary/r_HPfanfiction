Michael Gambon's Dumbledore was a bad interpretation of the character, at just about every turn.

It doesn't help in the slightest that they cut out massive amounts of Dumbledore's 1 on 1 monologues with Harry, from the post MoM Prophecy/Love speech, to the apparition of Dumbledore at King's Cross and about 80% of /that/ dialogue. Maybe it was a poor directors choice, or perhaps they didn't think the actors had the chops to pull off those scenes, but it drastically changes the story because of it.

No wonder people question Dumbledore's motives, since he never gets a chance in the movies to explain himself properly.
