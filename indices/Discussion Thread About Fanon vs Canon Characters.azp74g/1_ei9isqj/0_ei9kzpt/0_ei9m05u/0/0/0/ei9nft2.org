My mind suppressed that scene completely, and for good reason, lol. I watched HBP only once when it came out (as all other HP movies exept for the first two), and I remember it making me so mad! I was looking forward to seeing Voldemort's backstory onscreen, but got some really bad teenage drama instead. These additions are so bizarre and feel like the director has never seen a teenager before.
