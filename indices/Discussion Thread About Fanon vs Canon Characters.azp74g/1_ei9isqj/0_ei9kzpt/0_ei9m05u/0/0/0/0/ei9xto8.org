Half-Blood Prince could've been so much better and darker had they included more of Voldemort's backstory instead of that ridiculous attack on the Burrow by Bellatrix and Greyback. I just wonder why in the world did they include that dribble? The memory scenes in the movie were well-done (much better than Goblet of Fire and Order the Phoenix), but it was just a wasted opportunity for them not to take it. I was looking forward to seeing the Gaunts on-screen and got nothing.
