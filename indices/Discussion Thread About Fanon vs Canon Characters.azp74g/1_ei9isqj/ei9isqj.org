  I'm talking about people constantly misinterpreting and/or contradicting characters' canon personalities way too much that you start to wonder whether these people even read the books or just read fanfics.

Honestly I think they mainly read fanfics. Or follow the movies, which destroyed Ron and GInny's characters severely. This is the main reason why I think the books should be read (or listened to) before seeing the movies. Ron is my favorite character and he was nearly ruined for me. Dumbledore also gets a lot of flack but it's more tolerable for me because he's older and should know better. Hermione knowing everything is just a cop-out so the writer doesn't have to flesh out their characters or have them think.
