My biggest complaints about mischaracterization ultimately come down to one thing: Wish Fulfillment. Aka, people twisting their fanfic protagonists and bashing the antagonists, all for the sold purpose of wanking themselves off. I'm all for using writing fiction as a form of self-expression or stress-relief, and playing around with an existing sandbox to do things that you normally wouldn't be able to do IRL. But when authors go overboard with the self-indulgence, it rarely makes for good storytelling.

Wishful Fulfillment is how we have so many Indy!Harry's who are super rich, powerful, high status, attractive, and have 11 inch wands that ejaculate phoenix tears. And so many Flawless!Hermione's who are super smart, super hot, is always right in every single argument, and has a magic vagina that cures racism, whenever she wants to hook up with Death Eaters or Voldie himself. (Where she doesn't cure racism, she is Shrodinger's Pureblood, able to reveal her secret blood status whenever the plot needs it.)

Other mischaracterizations are annoying, but these two in particular, since they're most often used as protagonists, are the worst cases and the most common.
