The secret pureblood thing is the worst, because not only does it stretch my suspension of disbelief, the way the authors go about in their stories is so ridiculous. The top three pureblood families that Hermione is a secret daughter of are the Lestranges, the Blacks, and the Princes.

These are people who care about their bloodlines so much that they make magical tapestries just to track the family tree. In Crimes of Grindelwald, the Lestrange family is revealed to have their own family tapestry similar to the one in Grimmauld Place. And yet we are supposed to believe that Bellatrix and Rodolphus had a daughter that they somehow forgot about for 15 years?

This is also why I find it ridiculous that Bellatrix had Delphini in Cursed Child.
