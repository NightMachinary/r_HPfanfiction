  Wishful Fulfillment is how we have so many Indy!Harry's who are super rich, powerful, high status, attractive, and have 11 inch wands that ejaculate phoenix tears. And so many Flawless!Hermione's who are super smart, super hot, is always right in every single argument, and has a magic vagina that cures racism, whenever she wants to hook up with Death Eaters or Voldie himself. (Where she doesn't cure racism, she is Shrodinger's Pureblood, able to reveal her secret blood status whenever the plot needs it.)

Basically most of the Harry/Hermione fanfics. Let's not forget Potter-Peverell-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw etc etc etc with twenty different vaults. (Emma Watson)Hermione is never wrong either. The secret pureblood thing is also very annoying. Having a squib ancestor or being distantly related to a pureblood is okay, but other than that I'm out.
