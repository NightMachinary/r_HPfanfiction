People always complain about Death Eater Ron trope, but I've never actually seen it. There was this one fic where canon Harry and Ron end up in an alternate universe where Ron was adopted by Lucius Malfoy and is a Death Eater (at, like, 13), but other than that, I've never read a fic where Ron works for Voldemort. Usually when he is bashed, he's just presented as dumb/selfish/greedy etc.

Now I kinda want a Death Eater Ron fic.
