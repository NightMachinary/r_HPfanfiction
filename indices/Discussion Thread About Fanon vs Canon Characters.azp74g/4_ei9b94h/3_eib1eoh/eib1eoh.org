Sirius only referring to James, Remus, and himself by Marauder names, and giving Harry a Marauder nickname should be on that list, as well.

In canon, IIRC, he only goes by Padfoot because it's a convenient codename that works as a dog, and only really mentions the other Marauder names to explain who's who and why they're called that.
