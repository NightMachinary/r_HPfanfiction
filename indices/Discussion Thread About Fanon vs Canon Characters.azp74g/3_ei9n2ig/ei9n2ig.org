Luna often gets what we might call "Reverse Bashing" if she's not portrayed as a Seer (which even then can be written well--/Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ has a Luna who has visions, but they're often very vague and Luna's completely bewildered by them).

But often, Fanon takes Luna's role as a victim of bullying and exaggerates it.

In canon, Luna's schoolmates call her Loony, laugh at the way she dresses, and steal her books and clothes--but the narration never implies Luna is forced to walk around Hogwarts barefoot, so it's probably scarves and hats and whatnot.

But in Fanon, the bullying is horrifically extreme. Or if the bullying stays close to canon levels, the retaliation is often far more extreme. It turns into revenge-fueled stories.

Fanon also tends to ignore Luna's virtues--her compassion, exaggerate her quirks--anything involving the Quibbler, and disregard her faults--she's stubborn as a mule.
