Is it really 'mischaracterisation'? Fanfiction is, by definition, not canon. The whole point is to explore all different aspects of the originals, including if you changed what happened. So if Dumbledore is totally manipulative and evil, then that's just an AU in the same way that Harry being sorted in Slytherin is an AU. It's not a /mis/characterisation, it's just the characterisation in that fic.
