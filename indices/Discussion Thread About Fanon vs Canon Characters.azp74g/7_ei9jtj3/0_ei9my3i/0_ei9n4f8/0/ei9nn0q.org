Thing is, eventually there comes a point where the characters are no longer the character they're supposed to be. Then they're just OC's who look similar to canon characters.

That's not what I wanted to express though. As I said, there's a difference between deliberate and accidental, and it's pretty much the writing ability. “Misrepresentation” means the author failed to characterise them properly, which is less likely to happen with better writing ability.
