There are, but that's an issue with the fact that they're terribly written, not with changing Dumbledore's personality per se. It /is/ fanfiction, after all. You've got to be prepared for very amateur authors most of the time. I don't personally read fics with bashing like that, but once or twice I've been recommended one and moderately enjoyed it... because it was really well written.
