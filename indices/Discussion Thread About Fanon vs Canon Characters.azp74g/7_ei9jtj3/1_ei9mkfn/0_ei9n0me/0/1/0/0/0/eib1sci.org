  but I don't think it's such a stretch to say that there might have been more to Harry's placement with the Dursleys

I think this was a viable theory up until the end of Deathly Hallows, but I also think that in hindsight, it was really the end of OotP that does the bulk of the clarification. Once we gained all the information and could go back and piece things together, it now seems very unlikely that Dumbledore placed Harry at the Dursleys with anything other than his physical and mental safety in mind and it was ideal not because Harry needed to grow up abused, but because it required the least amount of personal interaction for Dumbledore (aka, I believe Dumbledore wanted to remain unemotional and apathetic towards Harry).

Dumbledore theories vary so much, so I apologize for generalizing, but I feel most theories about Dumbledore involve him needing Harry to be submissive or to "understand love" better than children who grew up in loving homes. From a psychological standpoint this has never made sense to me (because it seems like if either of those had been Dumbledore's goal, he ought to have made it his utmost priority to do precisely the opposite of placing Harry at the Dursleys), but even setting that aside, I still feel many of these theories work under the idea that Dumbledore's plan for baby Harry was the same plan for seventeen-year-old Harry. Kind of like OP says, sometimes I wonder if people even read the books because sometimes I feel like they're forgetting about whole chapters of Dumbledore dialogue. The books suggest that Dumbledore had a different plan for baby Harry that at some point stopped being the plan and then a new plan was created. The end of OotP is Dumbledore admitting that he had had an original plan for Harry, that this plan was not in Harry's personal interest, and that Dumbledore had just realized how utterly he was failing at following through with this plan.

I guess what I mean is, a reader can choose to interpret Dumbledore placing Harry at the Dursleys many different ways, but it's still one part of a larger picture of Dumbledore's character and plot arc and usually people don't bother to ensure their picture of Dumbledore is internally consistent. Many will assume the worst of his individual actions without stepping back to see if those actions make sense with each other. If it's a dislike of Dumbledore that people want, my interpretation of why he left Harry at the Dursleys does not reflect a very moral character, but it makes more sense to me because it accounts for Dumbledore's arc throughout the series, his dialogue in OotP about having failed at his plan, his dialogue in HBP about his discovery of Horcruxes and the fallibility of prophecies, and his dialogue in DH that made his "gleam of something like triumph" in GoF make sense.

I have read some very compelling arguments against Dumbledore in the past, but none that have convinced me for longer than a few minutes.
