  but I feel most theories about Dumbledore involve him needing Harry to be submissive or to "understand love" better than children who grew up in loving homes

I'd argue more along the "isolated" route. A Harry who will see the grand old Wizard as his mentor and rescuer (similar to how Voldemort might have seen Dumbledore, if he hadn't bungled that up) is much more malleable. Especially if he has no adults in his life that he can trust or that could guide him in another direction.

Also again, convenience. If Dumbledore had taken more of a personal interest in Harry's situation, he'd have to do much more work concerning security, finding an appropriate magical family, dealing with eventual political fallout etc. pp. Dumping him with the Dursleys is way easier and not contrary to his goals.

  The books suggest that Dumbledore had a different plan for baby Harry that at some point stopped being the plan and then a new plan was created.

Sure! That's irrelevant though. It's not necessary for Dumbledore to have planned for Harry to martyr himself from the beginning. He was just making sure that the prophecy child was under his ultimate control. And what is better for this cause than not involving said child in the magical world at all, housing him with muggles who despise his nature?
