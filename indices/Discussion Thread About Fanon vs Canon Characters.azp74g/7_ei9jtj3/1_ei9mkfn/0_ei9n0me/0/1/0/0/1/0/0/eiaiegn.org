Well, I mean - I don't really worry much about these things these days. If something in canon doesn't fit a story, I change it or drop it. Like how I usually have elves be servants, not slaves in my recent stories. I don't try to make all the stupid canon stuff make sense any more. That also greatly facilitates characterisation.
