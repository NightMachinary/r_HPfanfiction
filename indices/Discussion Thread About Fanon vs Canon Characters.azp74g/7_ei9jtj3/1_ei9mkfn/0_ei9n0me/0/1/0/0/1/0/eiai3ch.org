  stuff down to plot device so Harry would be miserable at home.

You brought this point up a lot in this thread. I don't find this to be a very compelling argument: We know that these things are plot-devices. Yes, the "monster in the chest" is just a plot device to bring Harry and Ginny together. So what?! It's still awful and makes no sense.

Hermione acting completely OOC in HBP? Well it's just a plot device for Harry to be isolated, gotta accept that too, no?

Asserting that these things are plot-devices is a decent observation but adds very little to this kind of discussion.
