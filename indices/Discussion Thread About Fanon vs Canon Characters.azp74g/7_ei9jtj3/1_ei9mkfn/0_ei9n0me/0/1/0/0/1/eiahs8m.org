I chalk the whole "blood protection at the Dursleys with the power of love" stuff down to plot device so Harry would be miserable at home.

I really need to write that "Sirius doesn't run after Peter but takes Harry to Dumbledore with Hagrid, and when he hears about how the blood protections will be the only way to keep Harry safe, he decides to move in with the Dursleys" Crackfic.
