Eh, fine... but I don't think it's such a stretch to say that there might have been more to Harry's placement with the Dursleys (and complete isolation) and that it - maybe - didn't just happen solely because of the wonderful blood protections. Quite the opposite in fact.

But Dumbledore defenders jump through quite a lot of mental gymnastics to make the blood protections absolutely infallible and incredible (which is also sufficiently explained by there actually being very little threat to Harry, which is also supported by the apparent incompetence of the remaining DEs), while simultaneously belittling and trivializing the viability of all other protective options, while also ignoring that Dumbledore the great Wizard should be even more resourceful than what I can come up with as a mere reader.

Obviously the placement of Harry with the Dursleys is convenient for Dumbledore in many ways. Other options might have taken a bite into his precious political capital or time.
