Not manipulative in the "Manipulative!Dumbledore" sense. He didn't send Harry to the Dursleys to break him/make himself look like a saviour later. He didn't set the Weasleys up to befriend Harry.

And he wasn't manipulative enough in canon - he should have been running rings around Fudge and Malfoy.
