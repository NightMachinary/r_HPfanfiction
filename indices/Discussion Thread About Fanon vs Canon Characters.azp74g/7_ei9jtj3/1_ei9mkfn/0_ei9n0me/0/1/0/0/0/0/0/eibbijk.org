  Also again, convenience. If Dumbledore had taken more of a personal interest in Harry's situation, he'd have to do much more work concerning security, finding an appropriate magical family, dealing with eventual political fallout etc. pp. Dumping him with the Dursleys is way easier and not contrary to his goals.

This is (mostly) what I said too. There seem to be at least one area we agree on, despite using the idea to get to different conclusions.

But why would there be political fallout? Dumbledore and the Ministry had a relatively diplomatic relationship until 1995, and we are not given any reason to think it was strained prior to that (ignoring the new FB movies anyway, and even if we included that, it was a different Ministry era and therefore still not relevant to 1981). There is no foundation to suggest that Dumbledore's placement of Harry was in any way motivated by politics. It could have been, but it just as easily might not have been and we cannot know one way or the other. Therefore I reckon we should stick with what the books give us (and trust that the books give us what we need in order to determine the answers to our questions). I do not think there is only one right interpretation, I'm only interested in internal consistency and that means accepting that there are multiple internally consistent interpretations. But inventing challenges for these characters is not something I'm interested in. If that is something you're okay with, then we might not be able to find common ground to analyze on.

  I'd argue more along the "isolated" route. A Harry who will see the grand old Wizard as his mentor and rescuer (similar to how Voldemort might have seen Dumbledore, if he hadn't bungled that up) is much more malleable. Especially if he has no adults in his life that he can trust or that could guide him in another direction.

This theory has never made sense to me either. It is dependent on the idea that Harry sees Dumbledore as his savior despite others being more present not only day-to-day but also at the moment of Harry literally being taken away from the Dursleys. Dumbledore undeniably plays a huge role in Harry's life, but he did nothing to save Harry from the Dursleys (in fact is the one that keeps putting him back there) and also does nothing outside the standard for any witch or wizard living with Muggles. I cannot see that Dumbledore ever attempted to gain credit for saving Harry, and I especially cannot see that he did so in such sufficient quantities as to convince me this was his particular goal. McGonagall signed Harry's Hogwarts letter, Hagrid picked him up from the shack and took him shopping, Hagrid invites him to Friday tea, McGonagall even signed the letter that gives Harry his broom. Dumbledore is as much a presence in Harry's life in the first four months of Harry's re-entry into the Wizarding World as he is to any other student. If Dumbledore wanted Harry to see him as his savoir, then Dumbledore was being remarkably inattentive to that goal. So inattentive, in fact, that Dumbledore didn't even attempt to have a conversation with Harry until four months after Harry enters Hogwarts, by which point being saved from the Dursleys has long since stopped being Harry's immediate concern.

Not only do I fail to see /that/ Dumbledore wanted or tried to be seen as Harry's savior, but I also fail to see /why/ Dumbledore would need to be in order to control Harry, and on top of this, I don't see why Dumbledore even require complete control over Harry in the first place. And Dumbledore never successfully gained control over Harry, in which case Dumbledore strikes out again (unless you think he did?).

  He was just making sure that the prophecy child was under his ultimate control. And what is better for this cause than not involving said child in the magical world at all, housing him with muggles who despise his nature?

A significantly better solution is to be part of Harry's life from the beginning!! And to raise Harry in individual care and support and love! Ah, I do not understand your theory on any level! You said that Dumbledore placed Harry in a manner that requires the least personal effort, but you also say he did this in an effort to eventually be seen as Harry's particular savior. In that case, what changes between Dumbledore placing Harry at the Dursleys and Harry re-entering the wizarding world? If Dumbledore wanted Harry to be neglected in order for Harry to trust him as an authority figure (and thus absolutely ignoring contemporary childhood psychology studies) and if Dumbledore /also/ fails to make any specific impression on Harry upon the kid's re-entry into the magical world, then surely /something significant/ happened within those ten years to change Dumbledore's plan. I would love to hear your explanation of what that change was, and, where possible, the canonical support for it.
