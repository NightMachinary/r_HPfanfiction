Honestly, this guy is at heart an educator, not a competent politician or even a halfway decent military strategist. He neither wants the responsibility nor to fight, and because of his half-assed measures, he left behind a mountain of shit for Harry and Co to deal with.

But he's not a bad guy, more of a failure like Bruening, Hindenburg, Hoover, or Neville Chamberlain. The real bad guys are of course Voldemort and his gang of sadistic genocidal maniacs; and the malicious incompetent failed state known as the British Ministry of Magic.
