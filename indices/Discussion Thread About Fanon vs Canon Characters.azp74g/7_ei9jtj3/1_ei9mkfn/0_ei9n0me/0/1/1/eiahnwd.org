  are you saying Dumbledore wasn't actually manipulative?
#+end_quote

If he were really of the manipulative!GreaterGood type, he would have neutralized Tom Riddle as early as in 1957.

A major reason why the war dragged for so long and cost the good guys so dearly was that Dumbledore wasn't nearly manipulative and ruthless enough.

With his power, he could have played total hardball politics after Halloween 1981 and nobody would have dared to oppose him. Yet he hadn't and actually let himself be outmaneuvered by Fudge and Malfoy. He was nowhere near as a brilliant manipulative politician should have been.

Those authors who wrote the usual manipulative!Dumbledore obviously have no idea what real manipulations are. "Sun Tzu's Art of War" and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Six_Stratagems][The 36 Stratagems]] are some of the beginner's lessons in manipulations, deceptions, strategies, and warfare.
