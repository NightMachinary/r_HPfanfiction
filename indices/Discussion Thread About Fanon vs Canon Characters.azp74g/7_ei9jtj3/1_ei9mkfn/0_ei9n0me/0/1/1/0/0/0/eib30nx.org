I do not think he was aware that he was half-assing things until later. It's always in hindsight that these things become clear to him - usually with the force of a anvil to the face. In the moment, he thinks and feels very strongly that he is doing the right thing and also that it is his responsibility to do so and that he is protecting others. I think the first main fault of many readers is to assume Dumbledore is very aware of is own subconscious thoughts. Once a reader realizes that the flaw that prevented Dumbledore from realizing Grindelwald was evil was a flaw that never really went away, Dumbledore suddenly begins to make much more sense.
