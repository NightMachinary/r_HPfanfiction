That's partially the fault of people trying to make sense of "plot device Dumbledore" - meaning, trying to explain the actions and inactions he took solely because of plot - will lead to manipulative, evil or senile (often called "not infallible") Dumbledore.

If people were more willing to say "fuck canon, my Dumbledore won't do this", they would write more stories where Dumbledore actually is a wise, good man. So, ironically, it's trying to stay true to canon that leads to this "fanon".
