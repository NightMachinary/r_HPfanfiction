  She's just so boring and just there to be there.

I think this is almost as divisive as the question of Snape's legacy. I didn't like the second half of the series, so I hope that any dislike I'd harbour for Ginny would come from /that/ instead of the myriad half-truths that make up her role in fanon. My dislike for Ginny comes from the fact that she /has/ a personality, but she's a very boring Mary-Sue. This:

  Even Rowling admitted to regretting not pairing Hermione and Harry together.

is just frankly not true. JKR said in an interview that Ron and Hermione might need some marriage counselling because of their 'fundamental incompatibility.' In regards to Harry, Jo only said that he and Hermione shared a few things when Ron was absent, not that they were perfectly suited to be in twoo wuv forever. Don't get me wrong, I /really/ like the trope of the brave hero ending up with the brainy but abrasive sidekick. But canon didn't go that way and given Jo's inability to write a coherent romance subplot I'm glad it didn't.

  Ginny as a character was essentially just a plot device for COS, with nothing else to offer beyond that.

In that book, sure. In OotP, though, she left with Harry and the others to fight wizards in the Ministry who had /decades/ of experience using lethal Dark magic and a complete lack of empathy. She wasn't a wallflower and - despite her overwhelming Mary-Sue-ness in HBP - you have to give her that.

  H/L ftw

Great, I'm glad you've got a ship you like. Mine is H/Hr, but I don't build it up by tearing down canon characters. That leads to bashing, and bashing leads to the dark side of fanfic.
