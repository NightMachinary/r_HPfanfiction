Thanks for the recs, I'll try them out! On Ginny and Harry, yeah. I don't like romance much, but when it's there I like to read about the slow progressions of how the two characters become closer and start to like each other more than before. And with a story that follows the characters as they grow up, there's so much potential for that. But I didn't get that in the books, which is why it disappointed me so much.
