We're supposed to downvote irrelevant topics, not something we disagree with. I'm new to this sub, so I don't know if this is brought up all the time, but it's still annoying to see this so downvoted.

With that out of the way, I /half/ agree with you. I wish Ginny had more presence in the books and more development. I thought her pairing with Harry was a little out of place, as she's not brought up much at all. Because she's Ron's little sister, you'd think there would be more scenes in the earlier books where she had conversations with him. Maybe it could have shown her getting over her embarrassment and learning to talk to him over the summer after second year, and after that they actually have conversations every once in a while. Maybe she expresses irritation at how Harry, Ron, and Hermione only half include her (like many younger siblings do). The fact that she had a huge crush on him in the first two books was a little annoying, but I don't mind it much. Harry and Luna is an interesting pairing, but I haven't been able to see many fanfics with them together (like I said, I'm new). All in all, I feel that there are fanfics that hold the Harry/Ginny pairing well, but in the books it's not done very well.
