Agree with all of this! There's no way Harry and Hermione would've ended up together, based on my recollection of the books. He was never physically attracted to her (describing her as bushy haired, large-toothed, shrill or bossy voiced), he lied to her (about homework, triwizard tasks, practicing occlumency), she wasn't able to handle his moods (she was always on tenterhooks or tearful when he was angry), and he /hated/ bickering, whereas Hermione was a naturally argumentative person. From the very beginning of the series, Harry and Hermione are platonic friends and nothing more; I'd even go as far to say that /Ron/ was the middle-man in their friendship a lot of the time - both seemed to have more fun when Ron was around (whether in pairs or all three of them) than they did when Ron wasn't.
