While I agree with some of it, I think it was Harry who was the middle man (sure he and Hermione argued (and she did betray him firstly the firebolt-incident, where she could have talked to him instead of being a sneaky bitch and going to a teacher (!) and secondly as far as I remember she didn't really believe him about the goblet at first (sure she didn't accuse him like Ron, but that's about it), so they are about even in the lying department (I'd like to know why it's ok for her to constantly pry him for information, the guy has a right to privacy, too - he doesn't pry about her Yule-Ball date either for example, so why is it ok for her to? Note: No, being worried about somebody doesn't give you license to pry and go behind a person's back etc.))

Still, if they both matured, I could easily see them together (they share a background and they complement each other, his "leadership" and her drive to learn, her morals and his laid back attitude, his willingness to break the rules if necessary and her adherence to the rules (and to adults...I never understand why Hermione never gets it that Harry has a hard time trusting adults after being stuck at the Dursleys...I mean didn't she notice the neglect? If so then she's pretty blind (I mean Harry didn't advertise it, but it's plain to see IMHO if you are close to him...hell, the taped glasses and oversized hand-downs are a dead give away!))
