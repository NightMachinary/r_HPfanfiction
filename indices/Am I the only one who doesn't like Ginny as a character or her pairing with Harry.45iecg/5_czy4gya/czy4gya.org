  She's just so boring and just there to be there

In the films, sure. But not in the books. She has a very strong personality in the books, implied in the earlier books and can be seen in the later ones.

  Everyone knows that if Ron had someone else then Harry would get Hermione.

Who is "everyone"?

  Even Rowling admitted to regretting not pairing Hermione and Harry together
#+end_quote

She didn't say that. She said that only in some ways Hermione and Harry were better fit in comparison to Ron and Hermione. Ginny wasn't even mentioned in that interview, and in fact, JKR later says a few days later that "Harry's love for Ginny is true".

  Ginny as a character was essentially just a plot device for COS, with nothing else to offer beyond that.

No. What about her leading the resistance movement in Hogwarts with Luna and Neville? What about her battling death eaters? What about her trying to become Harry's friend in OotP?
