Strange. I've always gotten the vibe that most fans hate Ginny.

I don't mind Ginny; I've actually grown more appreciative of her over the years. I never read HP for romance so Im indifferent to most pairings, but I'd still rather her than some blank slate OC (or Draco or Snape).

That said, I do think that Ginny's character in the books had /so much more potential/ than what we saw. Riddle's possession of her in CoS is chilling and traumatic and laid the groundwork for, imo, what could've been fascinating character development. I only wish we'd gotten to see it.
