I disagree with this so much. Ginny's awesome. She developed from a lonely little girl who got taken advantage of by an incredibly dark object to a leader of the DA and an apparently skilled dueler. I don't find someone like that boring.

The JKR thing isn't true either. She had doubts about Ron and Hermione's compatibility. Not Harry and Ginny. Unlike Ron/Hermione, she claims Harry and Ginny are perfect for each other, soulmates, and meant to be. She's called Ginny Harry's equal and his ideal match.
