Personally the only issue I have and ever will have with Ginny is that she is underdeveloped in canon. In fanfic as long as the author does enough to develop her beyond being Ron's sister who is feisty, likes Quiddich, was possessed by Riddle's diary, and has had a crush on Harry since she was a kid I am completely fine with her. However, depicting her as the one who was meant to be with Harry, while leaving her as she is in canon doesn't really make sense to me.
