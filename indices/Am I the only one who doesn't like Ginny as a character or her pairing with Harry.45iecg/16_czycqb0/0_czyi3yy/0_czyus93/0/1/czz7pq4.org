Kudos for admitting it, but that's a medium part of why you're being downvoted. Any deliberate drama can cause trouble like this.

Although I don't like canon ginny, and find most fanfiction portrayals of her wind up completely neglecting how utterly nuts she's probably going to be from having riddle in her head.

Assuming he doesn't leave debris behind, she's going to have all kinds of trust issues and constant worry about anything that thinks, even stuff normal wizards just accept mindlessly- like portraits! Additionally, she could very well try to be everything Riddle wasn't, and drive herself nuts in the process.

If he does, at best she'll have some bits of his personality mixed into hers, which could even help her, but certainly couldn't do that much for her self image.

Worst-case scenario is high overlap, with ginny almost being a good twin of riddle, quite possibly with unnatural talent for magic at her age and all kinds of nasty skills and knowledge left over from having the memories of a seventeen-year-old murderer stuck in her head at age eleven, along with, if you cared to think about it, gender identity issues mixed in.

Mind rape is just as scary as physical rape, if not more.
