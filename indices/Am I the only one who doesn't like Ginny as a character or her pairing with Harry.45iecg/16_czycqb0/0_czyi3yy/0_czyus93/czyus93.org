I think you would have gotten a better response with a bit more effort. If you'd left out inaccurate information (/Even Rowling admitted to regretting not pairing Hermione and Harry together/) and not plugged your favorite ship (/H/L ftw/), while including a discussion you'd put some time into, the voting would have been kinder. As it is now, it doesn't look like you're trying to start a meaningful discussion, but stir the pot.
