stefvh is wrong - this is a perfectly fine place for discussing the relative merits of various characters in canon. That is, after all, a very good way to explore how to write those characters differently in fanfiction.

You got downvotes for expressing an unpopular opinion, not because you expressed an opinion on something that doesn't belong here. Few of those doing that downvoting will ever admit to that, though. Instead they will rationalize away their actions by pretending that they are making an objective judgment about something more reasonable, thus preserving their self-image as fair, rational, and logical.

Appearing to do the right thing is often much more important to people than actually doing the right thing.
