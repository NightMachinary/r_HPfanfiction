I'd say they got some for expressing an unpopular opinion, but i'd also say that if i saw a thread like this on either side of the ginny love-hate factions, and i was the type to downvote threads on the OP's merits, (I'm not, since a stupid thread can have good discussion, and vice versa, so i downvote the thread if there's no value to it whatsoever), I would have.

I downvote more for objectively false statements than any divergence of fanon, and i'm self-aware enough to realize that ginny should/shouldn't be with harry is fanon. (or canon discussion, which amounts to the same thing.)
