  Even Rowling admitted to regretting not pairing Hermione and Harry together

I'll spare you the effort. Rowling never said that. She said that Ron and Hermione would have problems. She also implied that Harry and Hermione aren't suited (and it's pretty obvious from reading the books).

Is Ginny boring? Not really. I don't particularly like her, but she is certainly less boring than stuck-up Hermione, who Harry never actually enjoyed the company of, and frequently ruined his fun. Hermione lovers have no right to talk about boring personalities.

  Ginny as a character was essentially just a plot device for COS, with nothing else to offer beyond that

In the same vein you can say that Hermione was a plot device to help Harry and provide exposition (a thing that Rowling admitted to using her for).

Ginny is a wasted potential as far as I'm concerned. She could have been so much more, but Rowling just didn't bother with her. I don't hate her for playing a small part, and I don't understand why people use this argument to bash her - many important characters played a small part.
