The comparison between Ginny and Lily is really reaching, IMO. They both have red hair - and I don't even think it's the same shade. Different eye color. Different interests. (Lily sounded like the studious type while Ginny was a jock.) Different attitude. (Lily would have been scolding Ginny for hexing Smith or slamming into him on the quidditch pitch. Ginny would have hexed James for bothering a friend of hers.) Different taste in men too. (Because Harry looks like his father but does not act like him.) One comes from a large, boisterous, wizarding family. One comes from a small muggle family that birthed Petunia.

That's like saying Luna would be reminiscent of Dudley because they're both blonde.
