I'm pretty sure she wasn't a prefect. I base the 'more studious' opinion on Slughorn's description of her. While Slughorn liking Ginny began with a hex that doesn't even seem to be taught at Hogwarts, he favored Lily because she was an exceptional student.

I don't know about rule-abiding. It's true that she doesn't seem like Hermione. Slughorn even thought she was cheeky, something Hermione wouldn't dream of being with her professors. However, she still has more regard for the rules than Ginny. In SWM, all she does is pull out her wand. With Ginny, that situation would have devolved quickly because she would have hexed first and talked later.

I definitely think she was Head Girl though. I don't think using 'head girl' to refer to popularity, leadership, or skill is how Hagrid talks.
