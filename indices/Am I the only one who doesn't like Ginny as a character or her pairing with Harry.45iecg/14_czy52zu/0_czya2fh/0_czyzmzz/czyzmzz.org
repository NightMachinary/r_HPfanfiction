Exactly. Just for more clarification, Lily's hair is dark red (I'd assume aurburn), while Ginny has Weasley hair (ginger). I'm not sure about Lily being studious/rule-abiding though, I feel like that's a fanon thing. For example, Lily did magic outside of Hogwarts, she didn't care when Snape told her the Marauders went sneaking out at night (while someone like Percy or Hermione would not approve of that, Lily was all like 'why do you even care?'), and in SWM, she pulled her wand on James and Sirius, rather than threatening to dock points or call a teacher.

Also - side note - was Lily even a prefect? I know Hagrid says Lily and James were 'head boy and girl in their day!' but we know James wasn't a prefect (OotP), and some people have suggested that perhaps Hagrid meant 'head' as in 'alpha' or 'popular' or 'top of their class', since the capitalisation is 'head boy and girl' not 'Head Boy and Girl' (the way Percy's title is in PoA). And, again, Lily didn't threaten detention or docking points in SWM, which makes me wonder if she was even a prefect at the time. But I'm just rambling.
