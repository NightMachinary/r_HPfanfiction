  We don't share a personal preference, so there must be something wrong with me. Brilliant.

Where on earth did I say something was wrong with you? I was just pointing out the entire series is essentially based on a bookend, so if you consider bookends "spectacularly lazy writing", then you must dislike the entire series.

I have no idea what you have against bookends either, but that's your personal preference, and that's fine.
