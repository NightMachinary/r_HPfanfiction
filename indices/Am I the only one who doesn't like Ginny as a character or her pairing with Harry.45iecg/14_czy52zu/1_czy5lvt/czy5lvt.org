  The "little-sister of best friend" that's also somewhat reminiscent of the main character's mother is.. not very nice, I think.

I've seen this before and - while I see where you're coming from - I think she's the embodiment of far more awful tropes: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins][First Girl Wins]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds][Book Ends]]. I've always thought these particular cliches to be spectacularly lazy writing.
