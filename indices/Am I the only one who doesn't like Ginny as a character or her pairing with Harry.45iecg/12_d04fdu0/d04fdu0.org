//Shrug, for me it's always been a case of action-hero-syndrome. Ginny always felt like a character JKR put into the story so that she could put herself in Ginny's place. It's a bit creepy to be sure but the character is so... bland and unfinished that I can't think of any other example other than pure laziness. A lot of fans ascribe personality traits to Ginny that don't exist, but in reality all we know about her is that she's the magical version of a tomboy, and has a favorite spell. That's.... literally it.
