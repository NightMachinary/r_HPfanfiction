I like her from books 1 - 4. 5 and up, not so much.

I just feel she had so much more potential, and she was just thrown in our face especially in the 6th book. And she goes from being this super shy girl to massively popular/brave/gorgeous/smart/loyal/perfect...with no on-screen development.

Hard to like her when we're told she's all of the above instead of shown it. Especially compared to the other characters who we see grows and change for better or worse on screen.

She's perfect because she was created to be Harry's ultimate girl. She's not interesting on her own to me whatsoever.

I too would have wanted Harry/Hermione or Hermione/Viktor. I'm not pleased with 95% of canon pairings anyway.

Thanks fanfiction!
