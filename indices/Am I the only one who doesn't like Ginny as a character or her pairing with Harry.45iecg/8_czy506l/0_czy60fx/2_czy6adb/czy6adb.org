I agree with you. But you need to keep in mind that the series was written in Harry's POV, and most of the time color tainted. Whatever Ginny did, whether it was mocking Fleur mercilessly or making fun of Ron ruthlessly, Harry always found them funny.

Had JKR shown Ginny's heroics and suffering during that awful year 7, her character development would have been far more complete, and there would have been far fewer haters.
