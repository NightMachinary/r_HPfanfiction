IMHO the fourth book is the best-written. The Crouch subplot is worked in nearly seamlessly, the trio are totally true to what their characters have been built up to be over the first three books (especially with Ron's jealousy and avoidance of Harry in the first part), and the bittersweet ending is perfect for that point in the series.

I just think 5-7 went off the rails.
