I vacillate between rather extreme opinions of the fourth book. On one hand, I agree with you. At that point, the series still felt open-ended... almost anything was possible.

In my more cynical moments, though, I imagine JKR absolutely panicking over a lack of ideas past the third book. Then one day she watches a news report about the preparations for the 2000 Sydney Olympics and decides that Harry Potter and the Overly Convoluted Magical +Olympics+ Tournament is a good idea.
