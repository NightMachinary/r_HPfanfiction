  Whatever Ginny did, whether it was mocking Fleur mercilessly or making fun of Ron ruthlessly, Harry always found them funny.

I think the reason for this is because JKR already knew that Harry and Ginny would end up together. It would be a lot harder to convince the reader that they belong together if Harry saw her awful personality traits as being anything other than interesting or humorous. Just because Harry's thinks something doesn't make it right.

  Had JKR shown Ginny's heroics and suffering during that awful year 7, her character development would have been far more complete, and there would have been far fewer haters.

I agree and wish we could have seen a lot more of this. JKR really painted herself into a corner with the last book. She needed the reader to understand that Harry & Co felt alone in the wilderness. That meant no regular updates on Hogwarts beyond what the Marauder's Map could show. This had the unintended consequence of making the reader think that nothing important was happening away from Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Sometimes I wonder if the original series would have been a lot better if it had employed a shifting POV. Including Ginny's POV in CoS and Ron's in GoF wouldcut down on the amount of bashing those characters receive.
