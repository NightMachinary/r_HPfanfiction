Definitely! It's bizarre to see Ginny be so rude and Harry laughing along with it, when he hates the Dursleys, Dudley in particular, Draco, etc. for doing the same things. Also, he liked Fleur as a person so that whole scene just seemed weird to me. Ginny is a strong and motivated character, sure, but her rudeness, abrasiveness and downright demandingness (not a real word, I know) to be involved and included just rubbed me the wrong way.

EDIT: Also the whole "IT WAS HER THE WHOLE TIME" thing was just awfully executed. Her temper is just awful, and she reacts horribly to things, but it's played off as her Achilles Heel, she comes off as "funny" through the expense of others, and is just someone with qualities Harry used to stand up against but all of a sudden was ok. "Phlegm", pretending to vomit into her cereal because of Fleur, flouncing around in imitation, just.... no.

I agree about the Mary Sue-factor. It's not that she's portrayed as perfect, in this instance, but rather there are no consequences for her being mean or awful to people.
