To play devil's advocate here, Fleur did come into their house, allegedly treat Ginny like a child, insult (if I remember correctly) their cooking, make fun of Tonks, etc, and Molly and Ginny appeared to believe that Fleur only liked Bill because he was good-looking. If someone stayed at my house and did those things, they'd probably get on my nerves to the point that I'd mock them too.

**disclaimer: I love Fleur and I think she already gets enough hate and I'm not bashing her, I'm just trying to say that there's probably a reason Ginny - who stands up for underdogs like Neville and Luna - would poke fun at Fleur's expense
