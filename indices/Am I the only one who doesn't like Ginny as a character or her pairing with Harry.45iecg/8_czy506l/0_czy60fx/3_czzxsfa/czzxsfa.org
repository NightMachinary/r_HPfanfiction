  he lack of fallout from her more undesirable character traits is what makes her a boring character.

For a moment I thought you were writing about Hermione. She's the one who does downright evil shit and runs off scot free...

Anyway, given that Ginny didn't disfigure somebody permanently, you are really reaching with your calls for "meaningful repercussions". She is unkind to Fleur because she thinks Fleur is bad news (and is hardly alone in that assumption) and is shown wrong in the end when Fleur proves her loyalty. And this is discounting the fact that Fleur had been an arrogant snob since her introduction in book 4 and made no move on her part to win the Weasleys' acceptance either.
