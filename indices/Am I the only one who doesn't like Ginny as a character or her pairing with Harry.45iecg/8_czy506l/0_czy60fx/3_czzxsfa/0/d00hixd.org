For the record, Hermione is ruthless, but not without reason. Yes, she went behind Harry's back to have his broom confiscated, but there was a very real chance it could have been jinxed. She jinxed the signature sheet (and for good reason), predicting they might be betrayed and their safety compromised. She obliviated her own parents to keep them safe. Hermione would have done well in Slytherin.

Ginny on the other hand is petty and childish. She makes fun of Fleur for no real reason. Maybe she thinks she's taking care of Bill, but what good is pantomiming vomiting into her oatmeal bowl going to do his relationship if Fleur turns out to be a bitch?
