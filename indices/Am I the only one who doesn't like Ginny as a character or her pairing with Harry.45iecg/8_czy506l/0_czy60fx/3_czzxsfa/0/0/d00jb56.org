Very ironic that you call Ginny "petty and childish" for making fun of Fleur while extolling Hermione's virtues in the same post. Ginny was indeed petty in the way she went about her dislike of Fleur, but guess who egged her on and supported her every single step of the way?

  "It's her," said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed.\\
  "She's driving me mad."\\
  "What's she done now?" asked Hermione sympathetically.\\
  "It's the way she talks to me... you'd think I was about three!"\\
  "I know," said Hermione, dropping her voice. "She's so full of herself."

Everyone is justified in their own mind, but that's hardly an excuse. The ends hardly justify the means. Harry wanted Hermione to be safe too, perhaps he should have obliviated her and sent her packing to Australia? Because that would have been nice and dandy.

And the Marietta thing wasn't for safety, it was for revenge. The jinx kicked in only after Umbridge had heard everything she wanted to hear. Not that having a valid reason would have made it any more justifiable. That there are no repercussions for Hermione for permanently scarring a fellow student is very disturbing indeed.
