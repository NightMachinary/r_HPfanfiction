I read that analysis, but I have a problem with this:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Weasley is not a perfect Mary Sue overflowing with positive personality traits.
#+end_quote

This misrepresents what makes Mary-Sues a hallmark of amateur writing. The /lack of fallout/ from her more undesirable character traits is what makes her a boring character. In 'An Excess of Phlegm,' Ginny calls Fleur "worse than Umbridge," "full of herself," and "A cow," but is only slightly reprimanded by Molly for saying "Phlegm." Throughout the chapter, we see Fleur only as a young woman in love with excellent manners. Ginny is objectively /awful/, but suffers no meaningful repercussions for her poor behaviour.

That's boring.
