You couldn't be more wrong. Maybe you got your 'boring' impression from the movies, which I have to agree with you. But if you ever bothered to read the last three books, you would find Ginny to be a wonderful character.

Those people over there at [[/r/HPrankdown]] have done a wonderful analysis of Ginny: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/41m776/resurrecting_ginny_weasley/]]

As for "even Rowling admitted to regretting not pairing Hermione and Harry together", go reread source materials and stop repeating media misrepresentations. You should know ours are not really better than Rita Skeeter.
