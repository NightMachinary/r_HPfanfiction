Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Ginny does very little. Apart from CoS, she plays a much bigger role in the last three books, especially in DH, where she, along with Neville and Luna, lead the resistance movements against Death Eater fascists. Are you going to now argue that Luna should be removed entirely?

Ginny is one of the major characters of the Harry Potter series. She is included by JKR in the "Big Seven", along with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna and Draco. She may not be as "there" as Harry, Ron and Hermione, but she is still important, and to argue that she is no more important than say, Romilda Vane, is just not true.
