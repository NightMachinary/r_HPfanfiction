  what she supposedly does in DH

Supposedly? It is canon that Ginny broke in with Luna and Neville into Snape's office to try and steal Gryffindor's sword in order to try (somehow) to give it to Harry and co. It is canon that she, Neville and Luna were going out at night and posting graffiti "Dumbledore's Army, still recruiting". It's also canon that they were the main targets by the Death Eaters there.

From there, there's quite a bit to infer. If JKR wrote every single action that Ginny undertook in the books, they would be hundreds of pages long. What she could have done is change viewpoints each time, I think that would have endeared Ginny to more readers.

And I would argue rather that yes, it actually was important for the sake of the plot that Ginny did not stay in the Room of Requirement, not only because she was one of the leaders of Dumbledore's Army, but also relating back to her dark experiences with Voldemort in CoS. It was the battle that would end it all, do you seriously think that that does not complete Ginny's character arc?

So I do think that JKR could have improved Ginny's characterization in the books, I agree with you. But there is more than enough for the reader to determine her role in the plot as well as the elements of her character.

  Try addressing what I actually write instead of making up material to attribute to me. That's like writing fanfiction and pretending that it's canon.

You said that Ginny could be removed entirely, which is true for Romilda. I didn't say you were talking about Romilda, I was addressing your statement that Ginny is not an important character and does very little. Overall, she is a major part in the plot - just not as important as the Trio or Snape.
