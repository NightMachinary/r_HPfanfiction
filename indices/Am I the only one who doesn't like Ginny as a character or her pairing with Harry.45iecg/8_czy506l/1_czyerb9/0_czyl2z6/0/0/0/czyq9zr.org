We don't actually see what she supposedly does in DH, so that's irrelevant as far as canon goes. It should be clear that what's important is what we actually /see/ her doing, not what we might /infer/ that she /could/ be doing as we fill in all the gaps in our heads.

The "fiction" that needs to be dispelled is that whatever lovely scenes one might make up in their head about what's going on off-screen is somehow "canon." It's plausible that Ginny does all sorts of things in Hogwarts while the horcrux hunt is happening. What those might be, we don't know - and they don't seem to matter much because we aren't shown them having any substantive impact either on the hunt or in the final battle.

The very fact that none of that is shown or even related in any fashion is quite solid evidence that, whatever it might be, it isn't very important.

  Are you going to now argue that Luna should be removed entirely?

Now? Your statement only makes sense if I ever suggested that anyone be removed, which I didn't. My actual statement, which you so obviously sidestepped, is that we /could/ remove her and, after CoS, not much would change. Her effect on what we actually see is minimal at best.

If that were an error on my part, you'd be able to cite several important contributions from her that were critical to at least the plot development if not also Harry's character development. She did that obviously in CoS. One could argue that perhaps this is also true of the epilogue, since being the mother of Harry's children is important, but it's hard to see how that couldn't have been done by almost anyone else while having little to no impact on what we see happening in the epilogue. In CoS, in contrast, Ginny being someone Harry knew, being the sister of his best friend, and being Arthur's daughter were all important to the overall plot, so anyone getting the diary else would have changed some important things.

And this of course is the second issue - it's not just a question of whether her character does something "important," but whether it needs to be done /by her/. As an example, there's a big difference between Neville killing Nagini and Seamus killing Nagini, so that's a case of Neville not only doing something important, but that it's important that /he/ do it. Seamus could have been absent from the final battle without having much impact on the plot or overall story, but the same wouldn't be true for Neville.

How much such things can we say about Ginny after CoS? One that comes to mind is that she can ease Harry's fear of being possessed more easily than others. It's important that he be calmed, and it's important that she step in to say something, given her experiences. One might even be able to argue that it's important for her, as well, since this is perhaps her first opportunity to use those bad experiences for something positive.

I frankly can't think of anything else, and that one scene doesn't count for much. To continue with the comparison above, what would have changed if Ginny really had been forced to stay in the Room of Requirement during the final battle? Would the battle have gone any differently? Would we be disappointed in not seeing her complete some journey, like we would with Neville's absence? Would there be a lack of symmetry in the story, again like Neville's absence would cause? No, I don't see her being locked up safe for the battle as have much impact.

And that's in large part because so little happens with her in the previous books - which was my whole point. Very little is done /with/ Ginny, which means that Ginny has little to do. That's hardly surprising, an author can't fully develop every character, and Ginny was always going to fall somewhat short compared to others given the fact that she's a year behind. It's quite possible that any attempt to really flesh her out more and give her more critical things to do would have slowed down the pace of the books too much, making for an objectively worse story overall.

So I'm not trying to criticize JKR here. I'm just saying that I don't find Ginny to be "wonderful" and that, from the standpoint of what we actually see happening, she isn't very important for most of the series. The only way for her to become important is for fanfic writers to fill in all the gaps (and there are huge gaps where she's concerned) with their own ideas of what she might have been doing. That's what makes the HP series such fertile ground for fanfiction - so many gaps for others to take advantage of.

  to argue that she is no more important than say, Romilda Vane, is just not true

Try addressing what I actually write instead of making up material to attribute to me. That's like writing fanfiction and pretending that it's canon.
