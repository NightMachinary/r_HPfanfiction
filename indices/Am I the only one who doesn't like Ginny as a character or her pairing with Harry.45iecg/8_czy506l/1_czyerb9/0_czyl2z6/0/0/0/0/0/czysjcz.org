  Supposedly?
#+end_quote

Yes, because we hear very little about it and what we do hear doesn't have a substantive impact on things. As far as I can tell, nothing actually changes because of what they did.

Of course, it's not /implausible/ that things could have changed because of their actions, but that's the realm of fanfiction, not canon. For example, it's plausible to imagine that such actions gave other students more confidence and inspired them. It didn't have to, but it might have. Regardless, we're not /shown/ that it did, so such statements can't be used in an argument defending the proposition that she performed important actions.

#+begin_quote
  It was the battle that would end it all, do you seriously think that that does not complete Ginny's character arc?
#+end_quote

You can imagine that something changed about her, but we /see/ no evidence of it. We don't /see/ a different Ginny rising up, dispelling doubts about her, finding her confidence, proving herself to her parents, or whatever. All you've got is speculation for fanfiction. Again.

Contrast that with Neville - the timid boy of the first book stands up against Voldemort, pulls the sword out of the hat (showing that he's a true Gryffindor, in contrast with his fears in the first book), and strikes down the snake. The second boy of prophecy is the one who makes Voldemort mortal, and thus in a way kinda sorta comes close to fulfilling the prophecy himself. If you squint really hard. It had to be him who did it.

You can't point to a single thing Ginny did in the final battle that was similarly important either to the plot as a whole or to her own character because she was never developed enough as much as a character before the battle. Her relative absence for so much of the story in the first six books means that her presence at the end of the seventh doesn't make much of a difference.

In theory, it could have been different. Given her experience in CoS, it's not implausible that /some/ sort of confrontation between her and Voldemort or Malfoy could have been shown, and done in a way that really revealed how she's grown. That might have hurt pacing, but I'm just throwing this out there as an example of what we /don't/ have - an example of what would cause my own position to collapse, at least mostly.

#+begin_quote
  You said that Ginny could be removed entirely...
#+end_quote

Which is not the same as saying that she /should/ be, which is what your words suggested I said.

#+begin_quote
  ...which is true for Romilda
#+end_quote

Yes and No.

What Romilda did needed to be done by someone, but could have been done by anyone (more or less). Much of what is attributed to Ginny falls in the same category, but not everything. Unfortunately, there is very little of the latter. Anyone could have done most of what we actually see and hear about her doing without substantively affecting the story.

That's why her characterization is so lacking. Seamus could have been helping steal the sword. Susan could have helped with graffiti. What would have changed about the story in those cases? Nothing. We'd have fewer examples of Ginny being brave, but unlike Neville her bravery was never really in question, so this wouldn't impact her characterization much.

#+begin_quote
  But there is more than enough for the reader to determine her role in the plot as well as the elements of her character
#+end_quote

Funnily enough, I never said that she had no role in the plot or no elements of a character. What I have instead said is that I find her character to be "meh," that after CoS we don't see her doing a great many things, that most of what we do see isn't very important to the progression of the plot, and that most of what we see could plausibly be done by others without it having a major impact on things.

#+begin_quote
  If JKR wrote every single action that Ginny undertook in the books, they would be hundreds of pages long
#+end_quote

You mean, they weren't already? Have you seen Order of the Phoenix recently? :)

But seriously, I know what you mean and you're right... and that's an essential part of my point. There's all sorts of things that Ginny /might/ have been doing and we're not seeing it. We only see a little, not much of which is /critical/ and even less of which is critical that /she/ do. All of that is tied together. It would be hard to write a story where a character appears so little, but is still doing critical things that only they can do (outside of cases like the President or a king, naturally).

You can speculate all day about all kinds of things that she might have been doing - things that are important and which only she can do. Go for it! Others have, and they've created fanfictions in which her character isn't "meh" anymore.
