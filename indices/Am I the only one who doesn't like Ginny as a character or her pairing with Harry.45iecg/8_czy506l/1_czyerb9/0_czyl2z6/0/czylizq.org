Of course it doesn't mean flawless. I neither said nor implied that it did. So my statement stands: I don't find her wonderful. I find her "meh" at best. One of the biggest reasons is that she could be removed entirely and, except for her role in the second book, it wouldn't matter much. She does very little, and not much of that is important. She isn't very complex, doesn't have any tragic flaws to overcome, isn't inspiring, etc., etc.

And my statement about the arrogance of presuming that others cannot possibly disagree with one's subjective opinions stands as well. I certainly don't presume to think that everyone else should consider her "meh" at best (though I'd be inclined to argue that those who attach a great deal of importance to her are probably reaching beyond canon to varying degrees).
