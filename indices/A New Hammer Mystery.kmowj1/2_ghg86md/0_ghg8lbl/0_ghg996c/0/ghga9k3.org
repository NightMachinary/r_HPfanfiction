Not so much afraid of the downvotes, I read through the whole thing enjoying the first time without thinking about it and then tried to reread it again recently and realized I hated it since I had some time to process it.

What I was afraid of was being accused of either straight plagiarism (which it isn't) and/or a similar intent to HPMoR (which it also definitely isn't). I do hope you enjoy my story, though.
