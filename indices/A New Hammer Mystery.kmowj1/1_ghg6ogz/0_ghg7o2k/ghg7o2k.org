Good to know! Thank you for pointing those out.

I knew about the civilian handgun ban of 1997, but I don't have a practical expectation of what the distribution of ownership was in the UK previous of that. I also was aware the difference between the armed/unarmed police units in the UK pre-war on terror, but thank you for reiterating the point.

My actual question would be if I got that line about Class A drugs and illicit firearms correct enough for it to work in the story.

As far as the Troubles are concerned, I'm not touching any English/Irish politics. They're off to Hogwarts in a fairly quick manner and Grant's a Detective Inspector with the Yard so the fall off to magic time and magic politics is going to sidestep that whole bit.

Would you be able to give me any pointers as far as crown court procedure goes though? I've been trying to figure out if there's an equivalent to a mistrial declaration in UK/Commonwealth courts, but so far I haven't been able to find a barrister/solicitor who'll give me time of day.
