OK I have read up to chapter 5 of the first fic and have enjoyed it so far. I only have 1 britpick which is in regard to a line chapter 4 about Harry not being allowed to have a weapon, which is complete understandable as he is 11. But for your information the majority of uk police do not carry firearms unless they have been through a training program to allow them to do so. And up to 2008 only firearms officers could carry tasers.

Next point - batons:\\
up until the mid 90's most officers used wooden truncheons with batons being introduced in 1994. If harry became a policeman he could use one .However the baton is classed as an offensive weapon meaning if a civilian harry was caught in possession of it or using it could land him any where from 6 months to 4 years prison sentence.

Final point - the troubles:\\
As you are writing a fic featuring the police in 90's please stay away from the subject unless you have done your research as it is a very sensitive subject for some people and it only ended in 1998 with the good Friday agreement which happen 22 days before the battle of Hogwarts.
