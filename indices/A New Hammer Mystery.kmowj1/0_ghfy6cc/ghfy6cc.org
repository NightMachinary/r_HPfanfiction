That does sound interesting, though I did get slightly disappointed that you weren't referring to the Hammer Horror films from your title. A HP fic in the style of classic camp Gothic horror would be right up my alley. :D

"D-d-d-death Eaters? Zoinks!"

Though Film Noir Detective is also right up there too. Love that old Casablanca-Maltese Falcon vibe. :)
