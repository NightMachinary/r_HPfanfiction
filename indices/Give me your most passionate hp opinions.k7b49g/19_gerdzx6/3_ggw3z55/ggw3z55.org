My personal headcanon on Slytherin is that he distrusted the Muggleborn students. Witches and wizards are being persecuted, /aggressively/, and any connection to Muggles is a threat. The Muggle parents could use their children as unwitting inside informitants or the children could agree to be spies for their parents. The safety of the schoolchildren is the most important thing, and if Hogwarts is compromised, there's nowhere for the children to go except back to their families, who are already on the run from the Muggles & trying to keep a low profile, which is going to be that much harder when trying to hide accidental magic from the neighbours.

An over-the-top kill-with-its-eyes serpent to rat out any threat to the castle, whoever it may be, is the kind of jumping-without-looking reckless thing I would guess Godric needled him mercilessly about, except their friendship fell apart so spectacularly over it that Salazar just left. (That's also something I would've expected. One or the other.) But anyway, what Salazar probably meant by "his Heir" was like his grandson or something. Not someone born so far into the future that the entire wizarding world have managed to convince Muggles as a whole that they don't exist, and therefore in a time when the schoolchildren were under no threat of persecution by Muggles.

Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, Salazar probably didn't want to kill all the Muggleborn students, but rather incapacitate the suspicious ones for a time, and for that reason, made sure the basalisk knew not to look anyone /directly/ in the eye. Indirectly was fine as far as he was concerned. I mean, the coincidences are slightly ridiculous when you think about it. Justin Finch-Fletchley, Colin Creevey, Penelope Clearwater, Hermione Granger, and who knows who else from 1942, were /only/ petrified. Myrtle only just happened to open her stall door as the snake poked its head out, looking her dead in the eyes /by accident/. There is absolutely no way Riddle or the basalisk predicted she would poke her head out at that precise moment, meaning she died /completely by accident/. Well, not completely, as Riddle was likely /trying/ to get the Basalisk to kill the students, and getting increasingly frustrated when it refused to do more than petrify them. (This would be so funny, I wish I could hear one of their arguments.) Anyway, when someone has the gall to /break into the Chamber/, the basalisk probably thought that was a good reason to follow the order to "kill".

And the reason that the other Founders didn't like the Basalisk? Simple. /IT COULD KILL SOMEONE BY ACCIDENT/. Seriously Slytherin, how thick could you get? So anyway, that was my opinion of the basalisk. Thoughts?
