- I couldn't care less about the Marauders. I'd rather see the everyday life of Hogwarts students not in Harry's circle.

- We need more Hogwarts Founders information damn it! I just want to know why Slytherin put a Basilisk in there. If his goal is to have Muggleborns kicked out of Hogwarts, why couldn't he just put a curse on the admissions books so no Muggleborn is written down? I also want to know why the staircases move ðŸ˜‘

- There is no Light magic!
