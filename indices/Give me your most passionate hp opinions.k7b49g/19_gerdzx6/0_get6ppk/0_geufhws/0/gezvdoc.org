Not really mutually assured destruction, but the Basilisk is the medieval equivalent of a tactical nuke. Kills absolutely everything on the battlefield, way too dangerous to use unless there's no other option.

It makes absolutely zero sense to use that as a precise assassination weapon against muggleborns when any small venomous snake smuggled into the dorms at night would be just as deadly and significantly more stealthier and flexible to use.
