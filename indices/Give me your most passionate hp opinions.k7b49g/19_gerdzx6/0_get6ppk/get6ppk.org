I personally have a headcanon that Slytherin wasn't necessarily against Muggleborn as they are of magical blood, but rather against their /parents/. How many mundane parents at that time would actually consent to their children going to a magic school and learning magic? How many parents had probably condemned their own children at the stake for being "unnatural"? I personally believe that Slytherin kept the basilisk for the safety of the children in their care, only to be used if Muggles decided to storm the castle and try to kill everyone.

Another headcanon of mine is that he seemed against Muggleborns because he wanted to educate them separately because compared to children who grew up in the magical world, they lacked severely in any magical knowledge or holidays or whatever.
