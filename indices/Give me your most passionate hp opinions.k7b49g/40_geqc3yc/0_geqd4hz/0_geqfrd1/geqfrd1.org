The entirety of HBP for one. There's a lot of info dumped on Harry(and a bit on Snape). None of it would have happened if Dumbledore was perfectly healthy.

Take the way Harry died in DH, only Dumbledore is alive. None of the info dump from HBP Happened. Now harry coming back doesn't happen. He has no reason to, the headmaster is alive, he can handle Riddle now. How do you think Britain handles this?
