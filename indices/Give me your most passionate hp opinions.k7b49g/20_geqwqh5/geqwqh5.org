Most passionate? Wolfstar. Definitely. The worst thing is that it's so hard to find a fic where Remus and Sirius aren't paired or didn't have a relationship in the past. I don't believe in their friendship; a romance between those two seems impossible.

Snape's "love" for Lily isn't something we should admire. It was an obsession, and I don't think that he cared about her all that much. He idealised her in his mind, but he didn't truly care about her thoughts, worries or feelings.

Ginny is meh; as a character, I find her incredibly boring.
