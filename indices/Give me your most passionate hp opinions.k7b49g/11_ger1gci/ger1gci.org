Well, it sort of fails in the sense that I can't really write pages and pages about it, but I can't do that with anything so with that said:

Harry's still a parselmouth and due to the whole possessed by a horcrux thing, so's Ginny... and all the kids and they don't speak English at home /but none of them realised this/.

I'm also partial to the (actually related) idea that Albus really did have a thing for Delphini... and both he and Scorpius are bisexual.

Also, probably due to certain very well known fanfics (i.e. Wood for the Trees and James and Me), James Sirius Potter is the romantic lead his father and namesakes are not. However (and this is where the influence of Wood for the Trees really shines through imo) both James Sirius and Harry are deeply fascinated by and sentimental about family.

Oh... and when it comes to Harmony. These days my views are (1) Harry and Hermione have basically incompatible desires for the future and (2) Harry really doesn't enjoy confrontation, which is not true of Hermione (or Ron).

And finally... Harry Potter without Ron Weasley, isn't Harry Potter.
