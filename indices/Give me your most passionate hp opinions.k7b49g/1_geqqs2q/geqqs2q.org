Snape is a fucking bastard for how he acted after he found Sirius and Harry at the end of Book 3 and I cannot understand how everyone seemingly ignores this scene when analysing his character.

Fudge is just as bad as Umbridge, he just doesn't have enough appearances where it's shown. (See 'The ministry has to be seen doing something, Hagrid')

The Hogwarts curriculum was boring and had so much more potential.
