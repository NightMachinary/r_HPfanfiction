Too many self inserts are crappy canon rehashes except that they do absolutely everything perfectly. It's actually surprisingly hard to write a SI fic where the SI does not have perfect information about everything, their actions change the world and the plot, and actions have negative unintended consequences. The author writing such a fic has to effectively construct a character that starts as a copy of them but has character development driven by the events in the world, character development which does not happen to the author writing it. Also the author needs to construct details about the world not known to the SI character in order to have a world with more going on in it than just what the character sees. Deep respect for anyone who writes a decent SI fic.
