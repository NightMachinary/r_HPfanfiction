There should be more Self-Inserts. The most interesting part of the Harry Potter is not the story, it is the world. When I read the books as a child and re-read them now I am constantly thinking of what I would do if I went to Hogwarts. What classes would I take? What would I be good at? It's a shame that Self-Inserts are overshadowed by the millionth rehash of the plot with one minor difference. I don't even care if they're written badly. A lot of fics are written badly anyway. There should be more.
