Other comments from me:

Ron isn't a good strategist. He is good at /chess/ in particular, but we are never given any evidence in canon that this talent in strategy ever extended outside of a chess set. It is usually Hermione who does the long-term thinking and planning for them, and Harry and Hermione take turns in making on-the-spot escapes. In fact, we see him lose his head during moments where creating and implementing a good strategy would have helped them most (eg. Malfoy Manor). Ron's talent in strategy /outside/ of chess is pretty much fanon at this point.

Harry isn't a good leader. He was practically the figurehead of the DA. He is a great instructor and teacher, but he didn't envision the DA nor did he manage any of the other DA-related affairs (eg. recruitment, opsec, communication, logistics etc.) outside of the teaching aspect. And when actually given the chance to lead in the Battle of the DoM, he failed utterly.

His leadership in the Horcrux Hunt was abysmal as well. He lost control of his members, did not manage to keep up morale, lost track of his goals, and did not manage either the planning stage before the hunt or the logistics management during. He has no mind for contingencies nor did he set their SOP's.

Harry was the leader because both Dumbledore and Voldemort set him so, but he actually has no talent for it outside of brief and one-time skirmishes.
