I absolutely love Slytherin Politics in fanfiction. I love the idea of all of these (mostly) pureblood children fighting amongst themselves to be the top of the food chain. Well, not exactly fighting, but either first using politics and then moving toward duelling if it comes to that. I love the idea that in most fics, that third year is generally understood as the year when the students make their first political moves and whatever things they did the first two years are generally ignored unless it was huge. I love the idea of the Slytherin Court, and that each Hogwarts generation has a King or Queen that more or less controls the whole House. I don't care if this will never work in canon, but I am sticking by my belief that this is the most wicked thing someone's ever created.
