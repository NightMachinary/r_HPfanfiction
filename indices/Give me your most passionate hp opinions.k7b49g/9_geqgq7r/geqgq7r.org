Snape is not a Slytherin "Prince", he is not a hero, however I do not consider him a villain. He was a bitter man who refused to sympathise with anyone but himself. Furthermore, regardless of what he went through with James Potter, he should not have treated his son the way he did. He only switched sides because he didn't get what he wanted - Lily Evans. Only once he found out she was in danger (only because he told Voldemort about the prophecy in the first place) did he beg for Dumbledore's forgiveness. Additionally, when he asked Dumbledore to save Lily, he didn't care about the life of her son or husband. He was willing to sacrifice everything in the world but himself for Lily, while she was willing to sacrifice herself for her son.

Also, I don't believe he really loved Lily. He was obsessed with her. She was his only friend (because she was the only one to put up with his attitude for so long) and he didn't know how to compare the feelings he had for Lily with anything else. A point many bring up is the patronus, but a patronus can change to fit with someone else's by strong emotion. I don't think the books actually specify that the strong emotion has to specifically be genuine love for someone, correct me if I'm wrong. He could love having her around, or perhaps love how she constantly made excuses for him - or maybe it was just that he had such a strong feeling of attachment to her. His patronus did not fit with hers, it matched it completely, unlike James whose patronus was a stag. This could symbolise how James and Lily fit together perfectly, while Severus only cared that it was Lily, and not how he acted.

I don't know if any of that made sense, or if my grammar was 100% on point, but that's that.
