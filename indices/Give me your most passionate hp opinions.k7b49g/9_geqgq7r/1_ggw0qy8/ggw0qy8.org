He cared very deeply about Lily. I'm not disputing anything else you said, but if it wasn't love it was damn close. There are two other examples of people having the same form of Patronus as someone they loved, and both times it was deep and genuine.

Pottermore:

  Tonks's Patronus changed into a wolf after she fell in love with Lupin, a sure sign of true love if ever there was one.

  Harry's Patronus took the same shape as his father's.

A Patronus is a representation of your very nature. People who have a certain Patronus simply because it is the Patronus of someone else, care so deeply about that person that it has become an essential part of their nature- or, in Harry's case, shared some of the more essential traits of James Potter and, quite obviously, was his son. He had the unconditional love that comes with a parent who you know loved you, cared for you, kept you safe.

So you can say whatever you like about Severus Snape, but he loved Lily Evans. He never stopped loving her either.
