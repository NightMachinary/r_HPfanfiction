There are several pages between when Lupin cries about Dumbledore and Harry looks away, and when Tonks “pounces”. Lupin has clearly collected himself by then.

The reason she brings it up is because Fleur has just said that she doesn't care if Bill's disfigured or not, and that she loves him either way. Tonks is using that to show that they can have a relationship, and to prove to him that his condition isn't an issue.

Misrepresenting the scene as you've done really does your argument no favours
