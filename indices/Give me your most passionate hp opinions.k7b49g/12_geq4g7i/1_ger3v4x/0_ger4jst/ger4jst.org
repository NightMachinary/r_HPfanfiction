Did you read the hospital wing scene where Remus has a total breakdown, crying over Dumbledore's death, so even Harry has the sense to turn away and give him some privacy? That's when Tonks decides to pounce. She doesn't comfort Remus over this death that just hit him so hard, she literally grabs him, shakes him, and tells him she's not going to take no for an answer.
