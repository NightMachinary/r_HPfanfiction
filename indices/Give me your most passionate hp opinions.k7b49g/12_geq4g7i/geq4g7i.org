If you hit on someone “a million times” and get turned down every time, continuing to hit on that person is wrong. If you eventually manage to catch your beloved while they're crying over someone's death, and you grab and shake them and tell them that no matter how many times they say no, you'll keep pursuing them, so they might as well say yes, and in that moment of weakness they give in and stop saying no, that is not romantic. This goes double if you have a lot of power because you work in law enforcement and your beloved is a member of an oppressed group.

Canon Tonks/Remus is a well-written example of an abusive relationship.
