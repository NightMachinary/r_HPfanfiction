Today, it's Ron would definitely run off to fight a troll if Harry wasn't there because he's a Gryffindor. That's not who Ron was. As I said in the other thread, he didn't have a saving people thing and he didn't like danger; books 1-6 Ron didn't focus on people he didn't know or care about. JKR even went out of her way to use said behavior as growth with the Cattermoles and house elves.

One off the top of my head?

If that was simply a headcanon? Fine. Whatever. The idea that Ron was sticking himself in there to save Harry from Cedric faux pas is ridiculous. Ron told us he wanted to see if she was a bandwagon fan. Nevermind a big issue between Harry and Cho was that she wanted to talk about Cedric and he didn't.

There are a few more that have annoyed me, but many of those threads were deleted.
