Yes. In fan fiction, it's just Zacharias Smith, who kinda gets more hate than he deserves. It's the pushing the kids out of the way in DH thing, but it's a lot like JKR hatred for Pansy.

Hufflepuff, as a house, was awful in GoF. Ernie Macmillan gets a grace other characters don't and Justin annoyed me. Idk why but his running away from Harry in the library before he even spoke in parseltongue has always stuck with me.
