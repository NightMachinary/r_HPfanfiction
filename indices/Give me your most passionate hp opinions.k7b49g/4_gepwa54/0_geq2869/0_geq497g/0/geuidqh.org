In Chamber of secrets, I'd say it's a mix of that they were literally 12 and the heir was supposedly out for muggleborns, which Justin was. In GoF, they were showing their loyalty to Cedric, you know, the Hufflepuff Triwizard Champion. And again, they are kids. I would be surprised if 5 of those Hufflepuffs were 18. Kids, regardless of whatever a stupid hat tells you, are likely to shun what their friends shun. When everyone shuns Harry, so do they. It's more of a lack of emotional development than anything else, and that will grow naturally in time.
