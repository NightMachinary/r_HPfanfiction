I think kids tend to be assholes when adults that are meant to be responsible suddenly go blind. The teachers aren't just there to teach, they have a duty of care, not just to harry, but to all students. The bullying that happens at Hogwarts, regardless of who is involved shouldn't be happening under the watch of at least a dozen fully trained witches and wizards. I'm not excusing their behaviour, just offering a possible explanation for it.
