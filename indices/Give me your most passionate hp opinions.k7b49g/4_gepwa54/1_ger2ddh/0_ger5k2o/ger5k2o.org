Slytherins are "Death Eaters" and Ravenclaws bullied Luna. You also have James, Sirius, and the twins doing their bullying, so I kinda get why they fly under the radar, but it always annoyed me to read those GoF angst fics that have Seamus and co burning Harry's stuff while there's no mention of Ernie and co being cunts.
