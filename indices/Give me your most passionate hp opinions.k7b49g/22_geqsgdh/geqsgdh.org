I think Hermione is worshipped more than she deserves. Sure, she is knowledgable, she is a problem-solver and she is helpful, as in most of her criticisms come from a good place, but she is still criticising other people. From the get-go she is bossy and nagging, at times also controlling. She is dismissive of her friends, and Ron in particular, hence why I don't get how they're supposed to fit together. Like how she ignored his concern for his pets, she waves off his suggestions and ideas almost before he finishes speaking. She is even dismissive of the joke products that Fred and George make, and I can't see her being too happy about Ron working in the joke shop as an adult. She is constantly telling others what to do, even what to say, as she does to Ron /very/ frequently - even when it's not her place to do so. Ron doesn't need a mother - he already has one. She jumps down Ron's throat for being blunt, but has no trouble being rude to others, as we see throughout the series, and very notably in Philosopher's Stone, where she is just as blunt as Ron - at least. And don't get me started on the dozens of examples of her condescending attitude, and the impatience she shows to those who don't pick up on things as quickly as her, whether it is logical deductions outside of school or academic knowledge.

That's not even starting on her physically assaulting Ron, kidnapping a person and keeping it hostage, permanently disfiguring a teenager's face, and sending a person to manslaugher or rape by centaurs. Some of these might have deserved it, but Ron certainly did not deserve her attacking him because she couldn't control her own jealousy!

And Ron gets more hate than he deserves. He has bad sides, true; he is jealous and insecure, and he is blunt - at times rude. But people tend to view his bluntness as him being downright evil. For instance, the moment before Hermione hides in the toilets in Philosopher's Stone: He is venting his frustrations to his friend after being criticised and humiliated in class, but lots of fans forget this, and accuse him of being downright mean to Hermione for saying something he never intended her to hear. But because she cries easily, she gets the sympathy. And because Ron doesn't cry, people assume her scornful comments don't hurt him.

I'm also very sad that his strategic and planning skills, which we see on the chess table in Philosopher's Stone, is not taken advantage of more. It has so much potential.
