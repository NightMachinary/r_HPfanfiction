  Like how she ignored his concern for his pets, she waves off his suggestions and ideas almost before he finishes speaking.
#+end_quote

Is that why she was described as tearfully saying she was sorry when Crookshanks attacked Scabbers and Ron was screaming at her. Also, after Crookshanks attacked Scabbers in the boys' dormitory, she decided to shut him in the girls' dorm, so she obviously did listen to Ron.

  She is even dismissive of the joke products that Fred and George make
#+end_quote

When? All I can remember is her being mad that they were testing potentially lethal products on eleven year olds. I don't know about you, but I consider that a good thing.

  That's not even starting on her physically assaulting Ron
#+end_quote

Didn't Ron physically assault Ginny and Demelza?

  kidnapping a person and keeping it hostage, permanently disfiguring a teenager's face

Weren't Harry and Ron both gleeful in those two situations?

  He is venting his frustrations to his friend after being criticised and humiliated in class
#+end_quote

Then why is he shown to talk about Luna and Neville behind their backs? They've never done anything to him, but he calls Luna "Loony" multiple times, says Neville is pathetic more than once, and even laughs at Neville when he was jinxed by Malfoy (to be fair, every Gryffindor besides Hermione, who undid the jinx, was laughing at him, but it was still horrible to do). Honestly, Ron seems to enjoy insulting people when they can't hear.

  But because she cries easily, she gets the sympathy. And because Ron doesn't cry, people assume her scornful comments don't hurt him.
#+end_quote

Or maybe because her "insults" were unintended and she was just trying to help, while his insults were intended to put her down?

#+begin_quote
  I'm also very sad that his strategic and planning skills, which we see on the chess table in Philosopher's Stone, is not taken advantage of more. It has so much potential.
#+end_quote

Chess isn't indicative of strategic ability. There's a reason chess grandmasters aren't war generals.
