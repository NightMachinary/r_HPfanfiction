  This happens after Scabbers is believed to have been eaten.
#+end_quote

No, it wasn't. I looked through PoA, and it was after Crookshanks jumped out of her arms and started attacking Scabbers.

#+begin_quote
  But she also brings Crookshanks up at Christmastime in the first place, even after Ron asked her not to.
#+end_quote

Because it was around the start of the year when she promised to lock him in the girls' dormitory. She was sure he had learned his lesson by then. Also, why can't Ron not bring his pet? He expected Hermione to do it, so it's only fair if he keeps Scabbers in his dorm the first time Hermione brings Crookshanks out.

  Hermione says that all that Fred and George know is "flashy stuff," not "proper magic."
#+end_quote

Isn't she right though? It was in response to Harry asking why they only got 3 O.W.L.s, so saying that they only know flashy magic that has no real use isn't wrong. Knowing how to make Puking Pastilles or Ton-Tounge Toffees isn't very useful to the average person. Also, as you said, she eventually starts seeing how talented they really are.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't even hit Ginny, though in their fiercest argument they are nearly ready to start hexing one another.
#+end_quote

That is a false statement. He shoots an unknown orange spell at Ginny in HBP that missed her by an inch (because she dodged).

#+begin_quote
  I wouldn't say "gleeful" at all. Vindictive yes, but not gleeful.
#+end_quote

They still agreed whole-heartedly with her actions either way.

#+begin_quote
  I only remember Ron calling Luna "Loony" once, in Half-Blood Prince.
#+end_quote

Even though I remember Ron calling her that multiple times, I'll take your word for it. He still frequently insults her and calls her crazy behind her back anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone is mean to Luna in Order of the Phoenix, but Ron's nowhere near as bad as Hermione, who actively argues with her.
#+end_quote

I think how much Hermione and Luna actually argue is overplayed in the fandom way too much. The only time Hermione confronts Luna on her beliefs is their first meeting, and the only time Hermione insults Luna is right after their first meeting. After that, Hermione avoids the topic and they seem to become friends, with Luna comforting Hermione in HBP and Hermione being distraught at the possibility of Luna being dead. When the portrait of Phineas Nigellus calls Luna an oddity, she even defends Luna.

Ron, on the other hand, frequently implies that Luna is insane, and even snaps at her a few times in OotP. He never defends Luna, and Luna even admits that he's quite rude.

#+begin_quote
  And Ron's the only one, other than Harry, who actively compliments Luna. He sincerely enjoyed her Quidditch commentary--however funny it was.
#+end_quote

He complimented her because it was funny, not because he liked her.

#+begin_quote
  In the most notable context that he can't believe Neville got a date to the Yule Ball before he did.
#+end_quote

Oh, I forgot about that incident. It strengthens my argument, so I'm confused why you would bring it up.

#+begin_quote
  And tells Neville that he needs to start standing up for himself, planting the seed for Neville's seven-year arc.
#+end_quote

First of all, I don't think him telling him that started his arc, since he became his old self right after. What started his arc was when the Death Eaters broke out of Azkaban. Second of all, I'm unsure how this statement in first year detracts from him frequently insulting Neville afterwards.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione may have been "trying to help," but she's also showing off.
#+end_quote

How? She was telling him that he was moving his wand and pronouncing the spell the wrong way. She didn't show off until he snapped at her and challenged her to do it. She was just trying to help him. She was being bossy and overbearing about it, but that doesn't mean that she wasn't

#+begin_quote
  And Hermione's moment--the logic puzzle--really isn't terribly difficult.
#+end_quote

Ok? Did I say she was suddenly a genius because of that? I'm honestly confused.
