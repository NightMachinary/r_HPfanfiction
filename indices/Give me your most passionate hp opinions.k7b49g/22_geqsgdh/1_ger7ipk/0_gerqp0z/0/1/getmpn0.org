Her apology happens very late in the book.:

“Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers...” she sobbed. -- POA chapter 15.

There is no indication of any apology from her before then.

She brings Crookshanks into their dormitory on Christmas morning. That's the end of first term, not at the beginning of the school year. That was in the boys' dormitory. Do you mean that Ron is supposed to /not/ have Scabbers in his own dormitory?:

Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck. -- POA chapter 11

How is inventing spells and potions not doing "proper" magic? What is proper magic anyway? Only magic that comes from a book? Useful or not, not everything has to be useful. And who says humour isn't useful? Like Harry says when he gives Fred and George the money from the Tournament, "I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs." Against someone like Umbridge I daresay puking pastilles are very useful.

The fact that Harry and Ron side with Hermione against Marietta doesn't excuse Hermione's decision to put that curse on the contract. She could have chosen to find something that simply prevents them from telling, like a secrecy charm, but she chose a vindictive route.

Ron calls Luna "Loony" /twice/ on OOTP (and the latter was after he was attacked by brains and was in a weird mental state), and we also hear Harry call her that in his internal dialogue and once verbally, and Ginny and Neville also use it once.

As for Rons' attitude on Luna, pointing out that someone provides entertainment is not cruel. He's not mocking her.

The deal with Hermione correcting Ron, while good intentions and all, is unsolicited advice, and she makes herself come off as superior as a classmate who is supposed to be equal to him in status. It is not her place or responsibility to correct him, especially when he did not ask for it.

"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill."You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long." -- PS chapter 10

She is picking on him for being wroing; she is criticising him. As the OED defines criticism as "the passing unfavourable judgement; faultfinding, censure", it is not mere correction or feedback that she's giving him. Her snapping tone just further emphasises that effect. I don't blame Ron for getting defensive.

About Ron's chess skills:
