  Because it was around the start of the year when she promised to lock him in the girls' dormitory. She was sure he had learned his lesson by then. Also, why can't Ron not bring his pet? He expected Hermione to do it, so it's only fair if he keeps Scabbers in his dorm the first time Hermione brings Crookshanks out.
#+end_quote

Ron normally does keep Scabbers in his dormitory. He only started carrying him more regularly after he gets ill because he's worried about Scabbers and wants to keep an eye on him.

  Isn't she right though? It was in response to Harry asking why they only got 3 O.W.L.s, so saying that they only know flashy magic that has no real use isn't wrong. Knowing how to make Puking Pastilles or Ton-Tounge Toffees isn't very useful to the average person. Also, as you said, she eventually starts seeing how talented they really are.

Fred and George don't get good marks because they're not focused on schooling. But this isn't an indication that they /can't/ do more complex magic. It's entirely possible their poor marks are from the written exam, rather than the practical exam.

Besides which, their own joke shop aside, there's plenty of jobs that don't require specialized training.

  That is a false statement. He shoots an unknown orange spell at Ginny in HBP that missed her by an inch (because she dodged).
#+end_quote

This is a legitimate point. I had forgotten that Ron actually did throw a spell at Ginny.

I also notice you're ignoring that Hermione deliberately assaulted Ron and it wasn't in the middle of an active argument either.

She sent birds at Ron and then later physically punches him several times in /Deathly Hallows./

  I think how much Hermione and Luna actually argue is overplayed in the fandom way too much. The only time Hermione confronts Luna on her beliefs is their first meeting, and the only time Hermione insults Luna is right after their first meeting. After that, Hermione avoids the topic and they seem to become friends, with Luna comforting Hermione in HBP and Hermione being distraught at the possibility of Luna being dead. When the portrait of Phineas Nigellus calls Luna an oddity, she even defends Luna.

While the fandom probably does overplay it, Hermione and Luna argue more than once.

The first time they meet, Hermione says /The Quibbler/ is a load of rubbish and when Luna says that her father's the editor, Hermione gives the lamest, most unbelievable apology imaginable.

Outside the Herbology greenhouses, Hermione butts into Luna's conversation to say that the people who don't think Crumple-Horned Snorkacks are correct. This undermines Luna's argument that she believes Harry about Voldemort returning, and when Harry confronts Hermione on this, Hermione says that they can do /better/ than Luna.

Luna has never wronged Hermione but Hermione thinks that her value as a person is lesser.

In the Hog's Head, Hermione interrupts Luna about heliopaths, when it is completely unnecessary to do so.

Even after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Hermione has to actively stop herself from saying Crumple-Horned Snorkacks are not real when Luna mentions she and her father are going on holiday to hunt for them.

Luna had to *risk her life* before Hermione would agree to disagree.

  He complimented her because it was funny, not because he liked her.

He also says "she's grown on me, Luna. She's insane, but it's in a good way."

  First of all, I don't think him telling him that started his arc, since he became his old self right after. What started his arc was when the Death Eaters broke out of Azkaban. Second of all, I'm unsure how this statement in first year detracts from him frequently insulting Neville afterwards.
#+end_quote

Right after Ron tells Neville to stand up for himself, Neville takes on Crabbe and Goyle while Ron fights Malfoy. Neville saved Ron's neck.

And later, he stands up to Ron, Hermione and Harry. Yes, he gets shot with a Full-Body Bind, but as Dumbledore says, it takes a /lot/ of courage to stand up to our friends.

#+begin_quote
  How? She was telling him that he was moving his wand and pronouncing the spell the wrong way. She didn't show off until he snapped at her and challenged her to do it. She was just trying to help him. She was being bossy and overbearing about it, but that doesn't mean that she wasn't

Nobody else is able to cast the spell, and Hermione has already established herself as a know-it-all in several of their classes.
