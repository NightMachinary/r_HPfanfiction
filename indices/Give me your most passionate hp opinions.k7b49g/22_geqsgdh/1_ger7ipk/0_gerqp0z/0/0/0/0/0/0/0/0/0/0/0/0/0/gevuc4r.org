  So if Dumbledore says Voldemort is back--and he led the fight against Voldemort last time and was the only one Voldemort ever feared--and Lucius Malfoy's stooge Fudge says no...well, I'm willing to side with Dumbledore even if I'm stuck with the conspiracy theorist.

Most people believe that Malfoy was imperiused though, so they think he hates Voldemort

  You raise a fair point, but I knew people like Hermione in high school. They tended not to be quiet when it came to arguing and they usually started it.

I think it's unfair to compare Hermione to people like her in high school. Most people wouldn't want to defeat magical Hitler or fight the most dangerous woman in their country.

  Multiple times? I only really remember the Hospital Wing, but I do think I remember Hermione choosing her words carefully in the Three Broomsticks with Luna and Rita Skeeter.

Hermione did it multiple times in their later DA meetings and she did it in their meeting with Skeeter. Between that and the lack of insults after their first DA meeting, I think we're supposed to believe that Hermione was actually nice to Luna after the first few weeks of being in her presence.
