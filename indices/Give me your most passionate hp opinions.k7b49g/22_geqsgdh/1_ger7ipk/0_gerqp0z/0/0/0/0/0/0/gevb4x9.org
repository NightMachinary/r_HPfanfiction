  When did I say they were dumb? I just said that it's unlikely they learned all the spells everyone else did, since it's stated multiple times that they do not care about school at all. As you said, education and intelligence are separate things.
#+end_quote

I would think that they did learn everything. They just chose not to apply what they didn't need.

  Even if it scares off dozens of potential allies? It seems very short-sighted, in my opinion.
#+end_quote

When one of my other allies is Albus Dumbledore, it doesn't seem that short-sighted.

  First of all, she was being logical. Second of all, calling a fifteen year old girl a bitch isn't going to convince me you're right.
#+end_quote

And ignoring that Hermione was needlessly rude every single time the opportunity presented itself does your augment no favors either.

  No, she's just saying that people will take Harry less seriously if the girl who believes in wild conspiracy theories believes him. Like, would you vote for a flat earther who was outspoken in his belief that NASA is a fake organization and dentists are a group of supervillains taking over the world as your president, even if their policies seem more reasonable than their opponents? I know I wouldn't. That doesn't mean I would think they were less of a person.
#+end_quote

Frankly? Damn right I would too vote for that person if I agreed with their policies.

#+begin_quote
  Luna was spreading misinformation, and even if that misinformation was good for their side, it was still misinformation. JK Rowling confirmed that Luna's conspiracy theories are fake.
#+end_quote

Those conspiracy theories have a kernel of truth--we cannot trust the Ministry of Magic. It's filled with Dark wizard sympathizers.

#+begin_quote
  Just because someone mentions a situation doesn't mean that led to Neville standing up to the trio. If you're in an argument and you mention something that happened months ago to defend your position, that doesn't mean that that led to the argument.
#+end_quote

Neville himself literally brought up the argument! He's standing up for what he thinks is right, which is exactly what he was told to do so, and he's saying that!

You don't get a clearer point from Point A to Point B!

  Have you been reading what I wrote, or are you just skimming it? I said that Hermione was trying to help, and even if Ron didn't see it that way, her intention matters.
#+end_quote

The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.

She wasn't trying to /help./ She was trying to show off that she knew best and Ron should do it her way.
