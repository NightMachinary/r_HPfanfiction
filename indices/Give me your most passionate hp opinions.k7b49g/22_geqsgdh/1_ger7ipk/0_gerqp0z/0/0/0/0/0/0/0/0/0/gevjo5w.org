  When the other side is filled with people who wormed their way out of Azkaban, I won't turn away a conspiracy theorist who is willing to side with the angels.

Even if it turns away other possible people willing to side with the angels?

  I will not be called a liar. Hermione was awful to Luna. The very first thing she says to Luna is a completely insincere and unbelievable apology after Hermione insulted the Quibbler. And then she contradicts Luna, over and over again.
#+end_quote

Hermione wasn't awful to Luna. The first time she insulted Luna was an accident, so it wasn't malicious. After that, all she did was say Crumple-Horned Snorkacks aren't real, that Luna believes anything that has no evidence, and tell Neville that heliopaths aren't real. Three mcontradictions/insults over the course of a year is hardly "over and over", and you know it. You are lying by saying that Hermione was needlessly rude to Luna every time she had the opportunity.

  Hermione does not need to do this. Literally nobody thinks that Luna is right.
#+end_quote

Neville believed Luna. Hermione was right in informing him that heliopaths were real, and I honestly can't believe that you think it's wrong of her to inform Neville that he was being lied to.

  What's "Wow" about it?
#+end_quote

I wasn't trying to be offensive by saying "wow". It's just that I was genuinely surprised when you said that.

  Why the flying fuck should I vote for someone whose positions I abhor, rather than someone I do agree with?
#+end_quote

Although actions speak louder than words, words are still extremely important. I live in America, and I think seeing how the conspiracies the president spread (that Scarborough murdered an aide, that the Obama administration committed a series of a crimes against him, etc.) had such disastrous consequences made me more aware of that.

Even if you agree with the hypothetical person's policies, the insane conspiracies that they spread are extremely harmful. I would vote for another candidate, as long as I somewhat agreed to their policies, even if the other hypothetical candidate has policies I agree with more.
