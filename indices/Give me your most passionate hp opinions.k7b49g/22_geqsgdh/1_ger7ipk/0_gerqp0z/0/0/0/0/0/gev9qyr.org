  In what universe is Hermione bringing her cat into the boy's dormitory (which is against the rules as Hermione isn't supposed to be there) a need?
#+end_quote

What are you talking about? She brought Crookshanks out into the Common Room, not the boy's dormitory. I was just asking why Ron couldn't keep his rat in his dormitory for one day like Hermione did for months.

  Fred and George are far smarter than you give them credit for. (And educated means jack shit for intelligence).
#+end_quote

When did I say they were dumb? I just said that it's unlikely they learned all the spells everyone else did, since it's stated multiple times that they do not care about school at all. As you said, education and intelligence are separate things.

  Considering the government is actively opposing your friend with libel and propaganda, I would definitely take the conspiracy theorist.
#+end_quote

Even if it scares off dozens of potential allies? It seems very short-sighted, in my opinion.

  Hermione wasn't being logical. She was being a bitch.
#+end_quote

First of all, she was being logical. Second of all, calling a fifteen year old girl a bitch isn't going to convince me you're right.

  She does too think Luna's less of a person
#+end_quote

No, she's just saying that people will take Harry less seriously if the girl who believes in wild conspiracy theories believes him. Like, would you vote for a flat earther who was outspoken in his belief that NASA is a fake organization and dentists are a group of supervillains taking over the world as your president, even if their policies seem more reasonable than their opponents? I know I wouldn't. That doesn't mean I would think they were less of a person.

  Hermione said that there was no evidence of heliopaths. Luna said there were eyewitnesses, and bear in mind, the context is that Fudge is being a paranoid bastard who thinks everyone is out to get him, and is actively putting them in danger by sabotaging their education.

  Also, this is a world where Fiendfyre exists which sounds a hell of a lot like heliopaths.
#+end_quote

Luna was spreading misinformation, and even if that misinformation was good for their side, it was still misinformation. JK Rowling confirmed that Luna's conspiracy theories are fake.

  He stands up to his friends--and tells them that they're the ones who told him he needed to start standing up to people in the first place.
#+end_quote

Just because someone mentions a situation doesn't mean that led to Neville standing up to the trio. If you're in an argument and you mention something that happened months ago to defend your position, that doesn't mean that that led to the argument.

  There's a difference between helping someone and being a know-it-all.
#+end_quote

Have you been reading what I wrote, or are you just skimming it? I said that Hermione was /trying/ to help, and even if Ron didn't see it that way, her intention matters.
