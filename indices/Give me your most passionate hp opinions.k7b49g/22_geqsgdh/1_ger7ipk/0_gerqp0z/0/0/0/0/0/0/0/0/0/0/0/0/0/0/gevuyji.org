  Most people believe that Malfoy was imperiused though, so they think he hates Voldemort

Malfoy /said/ he was Imperiused, but then spent his entire adult life opposing legislation that would strengthen Muggle protection and Muggleborn rights.

  I think it's unfair to compare Hermione to people like her in high school. Most people wouldn't want to defeat magical Hitler or fight the most dangerous woman in their country.

I think it is fair, though, as Hermione is a high schooler. I wasn't saying she wasn't brave or noble. I was saying she would argue and usually start the arguments.

  Hermione did it multiple times in their later DA meetings and she did it in their meeting with Skeeter. Between that and the lack of insults after their first DA meeting, I think we're supposed to believe that Hermione was actually nice to Luna after the first few weeks of being in her presence.

Did Luna even bring up Quibbler stuff after the first few meetings? The only thing that comes to mind is Nargles in mistletoe, and she only tells Harry that, and as far as conspiracies go, Nargles are barely a blip on the radar.
