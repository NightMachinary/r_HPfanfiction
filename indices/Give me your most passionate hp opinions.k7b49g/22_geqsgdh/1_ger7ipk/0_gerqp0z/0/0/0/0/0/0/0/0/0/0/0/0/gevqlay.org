  Well, most people believed that Voldemort hadn't returned, so they didn't know there were sides. They weren't bad people or anything like that. Having a conspiracy theorist defend Harry probably just strengthened their belief that he was a liar. It would probably be better for their cause if Luna vehemently disagreed with them.

Even if people weren't aware that Voldemort hadn't returned, that's not necessarily the same thing as there not being sides.

Arthur Weasley's Muggle Protection Act was vehemently opposed by Lucius Malfoy, who had Fudge in his pocket and the school governors wrapped around his finger.

So if Dumbledore says Voldemort is back--and he led the fight against Voldemort last time and was the only one Voldemort ever feared--and Lucius Malfoy's stooge Fudge says no...well, I'm willing to side with Dumbledore even if I'm stuck with the conspiracy theorist.

That said, you're probably right that there was a majority of fence-sitters in the population.

  But afterwards, Hermione is never shown to insult Luna, so I think we should give her the benefit of the doubt and say she needed a month to get used to Luna, and she never insulted Luna again.

You raise a fair point, but I knew people like Hermione in high school. They tended not to be quiet when it came to arguing and they usually started it.

  There are multiple times where she almost says something offensive to Luna, but she always stops herself and says something nicer. Assuming that Hermione must have insulted Luna more is a bit unfair.

Multiple times? I only really remember the Hospital Wing, but I do think I remember Hermione choosing her words carefully in the Three Broomsticks with Luna and Rita Skeeter.

  I meant for there to be multiple choices, so there would be a few candidates who you mostly agreed with, but you only fully agree with the crazy candidate.

If that were the case, then yes, of course I would go with a potential third party--pun not intended.
