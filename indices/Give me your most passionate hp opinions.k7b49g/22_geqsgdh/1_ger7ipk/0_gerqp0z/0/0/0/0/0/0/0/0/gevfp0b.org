  No, it's still short-sighted.

When the other side is filled with people who wormed their way out of Azkaban, I won't turn away a conspiracy theorist who is willing to side with the angels.

  I love how you're lying straight through your teeth. She insulted Luna two or three times in OotP. Meanwhile, Ron was constantly insulting Luna.

I will *not* be called a liar.

Hermione was /awful/ to Luna.

The very first thing she says to Luna is a completely insincere and unbelievable apology after Hermione insulted the Quibbler.

And then she contradicts Luna, over and over again.

Hermione does not need to do this. Literally nobody thinks that Luna is right.

What's "Wow" about it?

Why the flying fuck should I vote for someone whose positions I abhor, rather than someone I /do/ agree with?
