  I would think that they did learn everything. They just chose not to apply what they didn't need.

They are literally said to be slackers who didn't care about learning anything but what they needed for their pranks.

  When one of my other allies is Albus Dumbledore, it doesn't seem that short-sighted.
#+end_quote

No, it's still short-sighted.

  And ignoring that Hermione was needlessly rude every single time the opportunity presented itself does your augment no favors either.
#+end_quote

I love how you're lying straight through your teeth. She insulted Luna two or three times in OotP. Meanwhile, Ron was constantly insulting Luna.

  Frankly? Damn right I would too vote for that person if I agreed with their policies.
#+end_quote

Wow.

  Those conspiracy theories have a kernel of truth--we cannot trust the Ministry of Magic. It's filled with Dark wizard sympathizers.
#+end_quote

First of all, what are you talking about? She was saying that Fudge had a secret army of fire spirits. I think you're confusing heliopaths with the Rotfang conspiracy. Second of all, misinformation is bad, whether or not it has a kernel of truth.

  Neville himself literally brought up the argument! He's standing up for what he thinks is right, which is exactly what he was told to do so, and he's saying that!
#+end_quote

Yes, that's what I said. He brought something up from months ago to defend his position. That doesn't mean it led to him standing up to the trio.

#+begin_quote
  She wasn't trying to help

How do you know that? All we know is that Ron was doing it all wrong, and she told him the correct wand movement and pronunciation. She only "showed off" and cast the spell when Ron challenged her to do it.

An integral part of Hermione's character is her need to help people, even if she goes about it the wrong way. For example, while everyone else laughed at Neville because he was jinxed, she rushed to perform the counter-jinx on him. There are multiple other scenarios where this behavior of hers becomes clearer (while everyone else avoided Neville in PoA, she helped him out, while nobody else cared about House Elves, she campaigned for them to be free, etc.)

I think you're using Ron's interpretation of her as fact, while it really isn't. He felt embarrassed because nobody wants to be told they're doing something wrong (especially eleven year olds), and he reacted aggressively in response.
