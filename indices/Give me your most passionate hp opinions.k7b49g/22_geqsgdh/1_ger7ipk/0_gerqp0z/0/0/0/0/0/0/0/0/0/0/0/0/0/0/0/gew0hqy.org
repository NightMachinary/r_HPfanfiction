  Malfoy said he was Imperiused, but then spent his entire adult life opposing legislation that would strengthen Muggle protection and Muggleborn rights.

Do most people know anything about laws and politics though? In an ideal work, they would, and would make serious, informed decisions for themselves, but most people don't. All they know is that he was Imperiused by Voldemort.

  I think it is fair, though, as Hermione is a high schooler. I wasn't saying she wasn't brave or noble. I was saying she would argue and usually start the arguments.

Yes, but since she was shown to have stopped herself multiple times from saying something mean to Luna, she probably stopped fighting with Luna.

  Did Luna even bring up Quibbler stuff after the first few meetings?

I remember her telling Hermione about the goblins being killed and she told the whole DA about Umgubular Slashkilters before Harry interrupted her.
