  When the other side is filled with demons, and everyone knows they're demons, I would still keep the conspiracy theorist.

Well, most people believed that Voldemort hadn't returned, so they didn't know there were sides. They weren't bad people or anything like that. Having a conspiracy theorist defend Harry probably just strengthened their belief that he was a liar. It would probably be better for their cause if Luna vehemently disagreed with them.

  It's not over the course of the year, it's about five weeks.

  And considering that she has to physically stop herself from saying Crumple-Horned Snorkacks aren't real when Luna brings up the holiday, I would say that it was hardly three times that they argued with one another.

But afterwards, Hermione is never shown to insult Luna, so I think we should give her the benefit of the doubt and say she needed a month to get used to Luna, and she never insulted Luna again. There are multiple times where she almost says something offensive to Luna, but she always stops herself and says something nicer. Assuming that Hermione must have insulted Luna more is a bit unfair.

  I don't disagree in a field with several choices, but if it comes down to a binary, Candidate A or Candidate B and only those choices, I would go with the one whose policies I did agree with.

I meant for there to be multiple choices, so there would be a few candidates who you mostly agreed with, but you only fully agree with the crazy candidate.
