  Even if it turns away other possible people willing to side with the angels?

When the other side is filled with demons, and everyone knows they're demons, I would still keep the conspiracy theorist.

  Hermione wasn't awful to Luna. The first time she insulted Luna was an accident, so it wasn't malicious.
#+end_quote

Saying /The Quibbler/ is full of rubbish isn't what I'd call accidental, but I'll grant that it isn't actively malicious either.

#+begin_quote
  After that, all she did was say Crumple-Horned Snorkacks aren't real, that Luna believes anything that has no evidence, and tell Neville that heliopaths aren't real. Three mcontradictions/insults over the course of a year is hardly "over and over", and you know it.
#+end_quote

It's not over the course of the year, it's about five weeks.

Hermione and Luna meet on the train, and then it's the first Herbology lesson and then it's the first weekend of October for Hogsmeade.

Arguing three times over the course of about five weeks would fall into "over and over," at least in my book.

And considering that she has to physically stop herself from saying Crumple-Horned Snorkacks aren't real when Luna brings up the holiday, I would say that it was hardly three times that they argued with one another.

#+begin_quote
  You are lying by saying that Hermione was needlessly rude to Luna every time she had the opportunity.
#+end_quote

See above. It took Hermione a very long time not to be rude to Luna.

#+begin_quote
  I wasn't trying to be offensive by saying "wow". It's just that I was genuinely surprised when you said that.
#+end_quote

I admit, I do tend to surprise people that way.

  Even if you agree with the hypothetical person's policies, the insane conspiracies that they spread are extremely harmful. I would vote for another candidate, as long as I somewhat agreed to their policies, even if the other hypothetical candidate has policies I agree with more.
#+end_quote

I don't disagree in a field with several choices, but if it comes down to a binary, Candidate A or Candidate B and /only/ those choices, I would go with the one whose policies I did agree with.
