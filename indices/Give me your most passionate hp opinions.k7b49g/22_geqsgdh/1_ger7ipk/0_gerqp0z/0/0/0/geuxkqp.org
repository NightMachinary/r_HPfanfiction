  Ron normally does keep Scabbers in his dormitory. He only started carrying him more regularly after he gets ill because he's worried about Scabbers and wants to keep an eye on him.
#+end_quote

Yes, but Hermione was catering to Ron's needs for months. Why couldn't he cater to her needs for one time?

  Fred and George don't get good marks because they're not focused on schooling. But this isn't an indication that they can't do more complex magic. It's entirely possible their poor marks are from the written exam, rather than the practical exam.
#+end_quote

That seems a bit far-fetched. If they don't care about schooling, how would they be able to cast all the spells? I think it's more likely that they only learn the magic they need for their pranks and any other magic that interests them.

#+begin_quote
  I also notice you're ignoring that Hermione deliberately assaulted Ron and it wasn't in the middle of an active argument either.
#+end_quote

I know I've been saying this a lot, but I'm really confused. Don't you know that you were the one who said she physically assaulted Ron, and I responded by saying Ron attacked Ginny? That was a rebuttal, not ignoring it.

#+begin_quote
  Outside the Herbology greenhouses, Hermione butts into Luna's conversation to say that the people who don't think Crumple-Horned Snorkacks are correct. This undermines Luna's argument that she believes Harry about Voldemort returning, and when Harry confronts Hermione on this, Hermione says that they can do better than Luna.
#+end_quote

That's what I meant when I said "first meeting", since I thought it happened on the train. Sorry for the confusion.

#+begin_quote
  Luna has never wronged Hermione but Hermione thinks that her value as a person is lesser.
#+end_quote

Wow, I think you're going a bit too far with that. If you were saying something and only the insane conspiracy theorist (who believes that the government will be taken down by a mixture of dark magic and gum disease, and various other wild conspiracies) believed in you, that would probably discredit your argument, not strengthen it. Hermione was just being logical. She didn't think that Luna was any less of a person, and it's honestly pretty weird for you to say that out of nowhere.

#+begin_quote
  In the Hog's Head, Hermione interrupts Luna about heliopaths, when it is completely unnecessary to do so.
#+end_quote

Luna was literally spreading misinformation. She was telling Neville that Fudge had a secret army full of heliopaths, and Hermione just told Neville that they don't exist.

#+begin_quote
  He also says "she's grown on me, Luna. She's insane, but it's in a good way."
#+end_quote

Is that why he insults her and implies that she is insane multiple times? No offense, but I think that you think one comment is enough to wipe away all future actions that Ron does. If instead of constantly insulting her, he treated her like a friend, this line would actually mean something. Sadly, he doesn't. Luna calls Ron "unkind" for a reason.

#+begin_quote
  And later, he stands up to Ron, Hermione and Harry. Yes, he gets shot with a Full-Body Bind, but as Dumbledore says, it takes a lot of courage to stand up to our friends.
#+end_quote

I don't think the 2 situations are related. Like, if I did one brave action months ago, that doesn't mean that it led to the courageous thing I did days ago.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody else is able to cast the spell
#+end_quote

Okay? Just because nobody else could cast the spell doesn't mean Hermione shouldn't try and help Ron.
