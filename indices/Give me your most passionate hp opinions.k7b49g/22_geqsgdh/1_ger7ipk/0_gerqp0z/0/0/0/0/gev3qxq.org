  Yes, but Hermione was catering to Ron's needs for months. Why couldn't he cater to her needs for one time?
#+end_quote

Oh, horse feathers! Ron was asking Hermione to keep her cat away from Scabbers because her cat had been attacking Scabbers.

In what universe is Hermione bringing her cat into the boy's dormitory (which is against the rules as Hermione isn't supposed to be there) a need?

That's not even mentioning Crookshanks looks "very grumpy" with the tinsel around his neck.

That is not a need.

  That seems a bit far-fetched. If they don't care about schooling, how would they be able to cast all the spells? I think it's more likely that they only learn the magic they need for their pranks and any other magic that interests them.

Multiple years of substandard teachers?

Ron even says when first describing them that Fred and George get good marks, for all their troublemaking.

They invented Shield Hats--that's the Wizard equivalent to a bulletproof vest.

Fred and George are /far/ smarter than you give them credit for.

(And educated means jack shit for intelligence).

  I know I've been saying this a lot, but I'm really confused. Don't you know that you were the one who said she physically assaulted Ron, and I responded by saying Ron attacked Ginny? That was a rebuttal, not ignoring it.
#+end_quote

That's not a rebuttal. A rebuttal would be noting a time that Ron hit Hermione.

Which never happened in canon.

  Wow, I think you're going a bit too far with that. If you were saying something and only the insane conspiracy theorist (who believes that the government will be taken down by a mixture of dark magic and gum disease, and various other wild conspiracies) believed in you, that would probably discredit your argument, not strengthen it. Hermione was just being logical. She didn't think that Luna was any less of a person, and it's honestly pretty weird for you to say that out of nowhere.
#+end_quote

Considering the government is actively opposing your friend with libel and propaganda, I would definitely take the conspiracy theorist.

It's war. Hermione can't afford to be choosy about allies. Especially when the government has aligned itself with the most prominent piece of media.

Hermione wasn't being logical. She was being a bitch.

And she said, and I quote, "Harry, you can do /better/ than her. Ginny's told me all about her. Apparently, the only way she'll believe in something if there's no evidence whatsoever."

She does too think Luna's less of a person. And it takes her a year before she gets over it.

  Luna was literally spreading misinformation. She was telling Neville that Fudge had a secret army full of heliopaths, and Hermione just told Neville that they don't exist.
#+end_quote

Hermione said that there was no evidence of heliopaths. Luna said there were eyewitnesses, and bear in mind, the context is that Fudge is being a paranoid bastard who thinks everyone is out to get him, and is actively putting them in danger by sabotaging their education.

Also, this is a world where Fiendfyre exists which sounds a hell of a lot like heliopaths.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think the 2 situations are related. Like, if I did one brave action months ago, that doesn't mean that it led to the courageous thing I did days ago.
#+end_quote

???

Less than a week after being told to start standing up to bullies, Neville stands up to bullies--his enemies--and pays a price for it.

He stands up to his friends--and tells them that they're the ones who told him he needed to start standing up to people in the first place.

In what universe could those two situations not be related?

#+begin_quote
  Okay? Just because nobody else could cast the spell doesn't mean Hermione shouldn't try and help Ron.
#+end_quote

There's a difference between helping someone and being a know-it-all.
