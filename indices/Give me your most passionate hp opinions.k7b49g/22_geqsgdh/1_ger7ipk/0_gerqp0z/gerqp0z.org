  Is that why she was described as tearfully saying she was sorry when Crookshanks attacked Scabbers and Ron was screaming at her.
#+end_quote

This happens /after/ Scabbers is believed to have been eaten. Early on, Hermione waves off Ron's concerns because Crookshanks will be sleeping in her dormitory and Scabbers will be sleeping in Ron's.

This takes place several months before the final row--after several heated arguments.

#+begin_quote
  Also, after Crookshanks attacked Scabbers in the boys' dormitory, she decided to shut him in the girls' dorm, so she obviously did listen to Ron.
#+end_quote

But she also brings Crookshanks up at Christmastime in the first place, even after Ron asked her not to.

#+begin_quote
  When? All I can remember is her being mad that they were testing potentially lethal products on eleven year olds. I don't know about you, but I consider that a good thing.
#+end_quote

In the fifth book, Hermione says that all that Fred and George know is "flashy stuff," not "proper magic."

It's not until Hermione sees the creation of daydream charms that she begins to actively praise their talents.

  Didn't Ron physically assault Ginny and Demelza?
#+end_quote

Demelza's fat lip was legitimately an accident. Ron was overzealous in his Keeping and hit her when his aim was off.

Ron doesn't hit people when he's upset. He yells. He does make Demelza cry, but he never hits her. He doesn't even hit Ginny, though in their fiercest argument they are nearly ready to start hexing one another.

  Weren't Harry and Ron both gleeful in those two situations?
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say "gleeful" at all. Vindictive yes, but not gleeful.

And bear in mind, Marietta in particular had sold them all out to Umbridge.

Ron would have had the exact same justification--his father works at the Ministry just like Marietta's mother--but he did not betray the DA.

#+begin_quote
  Then why is he shown to talk about Luna and Neville behind their backs?

  They've never done anything to him, but he calls Luna "Loony" multiple times,
#+end_quote

I only remember Ron calling Luna "Loony" once, in /Half-Blood Prince./

Everyone is mean to Luna in /Order of the Phoenix,/ but Ron's nowhere near as bad as Hermione, who actively argues with her.

And Ron's the only one, other than Harry, who actively compliments Luna. He sincerely enjoyed her Quidditch commentary--however funny it was.

#+begin_quote
  says Neville is pathetic more than once
#+end_quote

In the most notable context that he can't believe Neville got a date to the Yule Ball before he did.

#+begin_quote
  even laughs at Neville when he was jinxed by Malfoy (to be fair, every Gryffindor besides Hermione, who undid the jinx, was laughing at him, but it was still horrible to do).
#+end_quote

And tells Neville that he needs to start standing up for himself, planting the seed for Neville's seven-year arc.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe because her "insults" were unintended and she was just trying to help, while his insults were intended to put her down?
#+end_quote

Hermione may have been "trying to help," but she's also showing off.

Ron was struggling--with a mismatched, damaged wand no less--and he feels, not unreasonably, that Hermione is showing him up.

#+begin_quote
  Chess isn't indicative of strategic ability. There's a reason chess grandmasters aren't war generals.
#+end_quote

And Hermione's moment--the logic puzzle--really isn't terribly difficult.
