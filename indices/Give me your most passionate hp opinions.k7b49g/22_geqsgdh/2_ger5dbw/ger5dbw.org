I agree. Don't get me wrong I like Hermione, as she is in canon, but the worship she gets irritates me no end. I've been listening to the series again recently, and some more things that she does stand out to me as either being a bad friend to Harry or having ‘The road to hell paved with good intentions'. For example, the whole Firebolt issue in POA, she betrayed Harry's trust by going behind his back, well intentioned or no, that's still a betrayal of trust, and Harry is rightfully pissed off.

She actively puts the fear of god into the Hogwarts House Elves, by trying to make them accept clothes. Hermione is, to my mind woefully wrong about house elves, but she refuses to admit that she is wrong. I think that the House Elf situation is far more complex than simple slavery but it doesn't get discussed beyond ‘they like working'. I believe that Rowling made a misstep by both, basing the House Elves so closely on the Brownies (or Gruagaichean) of Scots Folklore, and having Hermione believe that it was almost a direct parallel to slavery. The Folklore Brownies aren't slaves and are in fact quite powerful and malevolent if they want to be, so it kind of obfuscates the point a bit.

Hermione is also really dispassionate towards Harry when he shouts down Lupin when he appears in Deathly Hallows. She whines about what he's saying, and the fact that he chased Lupin off without due consideration of why a Parent abandoning his young family, might be offensive to the Orphan whose parents sacrificed themselves for him. Harry was entirely in the right in that confrontation and hit the nail on the head, and Hermione acted like he wasn't. I do also think that Harry backs down from that position far more easily than it should be for him.
