  Hermione is, to my mind woefully wrong about house elves, but she refuses to admit that she is wrong. I think that the House Elf situation is far more complex than simple slavery but it doesn't get discussed beyond â€˜they like working'. I believe that Rowling made a misstep by both, basing the House Elves so closely on the Brownies (or Gruagaichean) of Scots Folklore, and having Hermione believe that it was almost a direct parallel to slavery. The Folklore Brownies aren't slaves and are in fact quite powerful and malevolent if they want to be, so it kind of obfuscates the point a bit.

The attitude towards literal slavery in this sub is a bit horrifying. How is the House Elf situation any more complex than regular slavery? House Elves and Brownies are very different creatures, since Brownies are free beings who just like doing work around the house and will leave and torment anyone who tries to mistreat them, while House Elves are slaves who have to be freed.
