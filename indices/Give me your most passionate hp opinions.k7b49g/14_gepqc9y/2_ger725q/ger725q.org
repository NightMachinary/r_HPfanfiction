Slytherin were badly represented imo and bullied themselves by other houses, hear me out. The first thing Harry (and I presume other students) get told about Slytherin is it's the ‘bad' house for ‘bad' people. Slytherin's constantly get told they're evil and Slytherin students get excluded by other houses BEFORE they get the chance to know them as people. It's no surprise that most Slytherins just go ‘screw it, I might as well just become what everyone says I am'.

There is good and bad in every house, but people just talk about the bad in Slytherin. You also have to remember that most Slytherin students in Harry's era are raised by or have close ties with death eaters and their ideals, which is something out of the students control. Being treated poorly by other houses mixed with their upbringing is a recipe for disaster. But if the other houses gave the individuals a chance I believe that the way a lot of Slytherins thought and acted would change massively.

The ideals Slytherins were raised on could've been disputed while they were away from home and their opinions could've changed if other houses gave them a chance and didn't judge them based off a stupid house system. Instead Slytherins largely only interacted with other Slytherins who had the same mindset, making what they believed feel right. Then the process continues when they have children, and their children have children.

This is just my opinion and outlook on it though.
