The twins were clearly not trying to kill Montague. His injuries were an accident, and they came from his choice to try to apparate out of the cabinet anyway.

And to answer the question in your other comment, Montague is also a great example of a Slytherin trying to casually murder or greviously harm a Gryffindor.
