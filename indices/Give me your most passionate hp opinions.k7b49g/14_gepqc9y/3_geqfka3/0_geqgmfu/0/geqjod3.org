lol and the Weasley twins nearly murdered Montague because he tried to take house points from them. He was seen being spoon-fed potions by Madam Pomfrey weeks after the vanishing cabinet incident. None of the Gryffindors take issue with this - in fact, when Hermione suggests telling Madam Pomfrey what happened to him in case it might help her treat him, they dismiss it out of hand.

Gryffindors and Slytherins are cruel and vicious to each other as a rule of thumb. I would consider most of your points to fall under the lines of "house rivalry" moreso than "bullying," and assume the Gryffindors in the background were giving as good as they got for the most part.
