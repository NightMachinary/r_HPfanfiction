Voldemort and Dumbledore both said that Draco's mission was to get DEs into the school and kill Dumbledore himself. I think the difference here is that Draco didn't want to actually kill Harry by pretending to be a dementor, just make him fall off the broom which we've seen can be a life threatening incident but since the staff is on hand than nobody will die. However in HBP Draco actually has to use the killing curse on Dumbledore which is a huge step from a schoolyard prank.
