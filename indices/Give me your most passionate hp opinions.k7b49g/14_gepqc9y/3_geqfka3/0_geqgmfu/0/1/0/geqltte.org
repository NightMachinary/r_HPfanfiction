lol easily the Marauders. I don't think we ever saw a 4-on-1 confrontation in the modern storyline the likes of what we saw in Snape's flashback. Also, the werewolf incident (that's two incidents that we're shown where Gryffindors nearly killed Slytherins in cold blood - three if you count Harry's sectumsempra, though that was an accident - is there ever an event depicted where a Slytherin student attempts to do life-threatening harm to a Gryffindor student?)
