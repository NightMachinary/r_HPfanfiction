In the film they show an additional scene where Snape, McGonagall and Dumbledore discuss Harry being selected for the Triwizard Tournament. They speculate that someone might have tampered with the cup. Snape suggests to let Harry compete, so they can find out who did it.

The challenges are extremely dangerous. So, for a saboteur, it would be incredibly easy to kill Harry during one of them. For some asanine reason, they don't realize this and basically deliver Harry into Voldemort's hands. They could have destroyed the cup covertly, and have one of the adults compete polyjuiced. A better solution all around.

Also, no fucking cup is worth a human life, no matter how old. If I had to choose between saving a random fourteen year old and the Mona Lisa, I'd burn the painting every time. It's the schools responsibilty to ensure the students safety.
