That's not in canon, that he'd lose magic. We don't know what the consequences of failing to compete are, we're only told:

#+begin_quote
  The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion.
#+end_quote

Granted, we aren't told that destroying the goblet will destroy the contact either. But I think Stayintheloop was making the point that they should have tried /something/.

And if Harry really is the world's only hope, all the more reason to make sure he isn't eaten by a dragon.
