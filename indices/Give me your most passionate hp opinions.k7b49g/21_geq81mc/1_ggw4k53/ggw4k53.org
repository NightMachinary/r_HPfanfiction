The contract wouldn't necessarily be broken if they destroyed the goblet. They'd hardly risk /assuming/ the goblet being destroyed would negate the contract, only to find out too late that the contract was still active. At least this way, they /know/ Harry has to compete in the Tournament, rather than /not knowing/, which would mean he has to compete anyway, which would mean they just destroyed a valuable magical artifact for nothing.
