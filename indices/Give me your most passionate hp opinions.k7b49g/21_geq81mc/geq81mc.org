Hogwarts is a terrible school full of irresponsible adults.

Think about it. McGonagall has been a teacher for more than twenty years. Sprout and Flitwick too.

Yet none of them can recognize the signs of abuse in a child. After suffering at the Dursleys his entire life, how can they not have noticed?

And how do they just allow Harry to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. Why not destroy the cup? What does it matter if it's an ancient relic, surely the life of a fourteen year old is more important?
