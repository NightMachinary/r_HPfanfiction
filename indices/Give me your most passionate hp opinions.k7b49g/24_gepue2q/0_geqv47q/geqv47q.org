He's what I call a "passive" protagonist. Until probably HBP and Hallows, Harry is almost always /reacting/ to things. He often trips into situations. He makes little real effort to take control of his own fate (there are good reasons for that, but it's still true). Things happen /to/ Harry. He's a pretty good example of a character who was just living his life until the plot hits him, but it takes him a really long time to accept that the plot is happening to him and to /do/ something about it (I think this is why Order of Phoenix was such a divisive book, where Harry is trying so hard not to be involved with all of this mess until it's utterly clear he can't just sit on his ass anymore.) Even in HBP, he's still trying to be as normal as possible. There's a reason so many fics have Harry deciding to take the reins in his own life much earlier than we see in canon.

On the same token, a bland protagonist can be a great vehicle in YA fiction to allow young readers to imagine themselves in the protagonist's place. More mature audiences just want more.
