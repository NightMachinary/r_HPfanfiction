Yes on all accounts. I'd argue that he was still just reacting to things in HBP. His shining moment of decisiveness was stalking Malfoy around. Otherwise, he just sat there, and got taught. Even in DH, he wasn't the one who did most of the prepping and planning, and a big part of his problem was that he didn't get to know Dumbledore more - once again during to his passivity.

I agree that he'd probably do alright in a romance. But then again, a romance is about making two people fit together by puzzling out their psychology. Anyone can be a hero in a romance. He'd have been terrible in an adventure where he isn't being actively hunted though.
