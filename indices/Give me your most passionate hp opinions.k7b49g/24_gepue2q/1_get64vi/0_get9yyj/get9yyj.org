Okay. See. This is what I mean about Harry being a more compelling protagonist if he just wasn't... Harry.

I'm going to argue that Harry doesn't actually have all that many Slytherin traits. He was never shown to be proud, cunning, ambitious, or self-preserving. At all. As much as the Hat says that he would do well in Slytherin, he doesn't actually have the traits for it. The most cunning thing he ever did was lie to Snape about the book (/Roonil Wazlib),/ his greatest ambition was to be a normal boy, and he has absolutely no sense of self-preservation at all.

The more I learned about Harry, the more I've come to believe that the Hat was probably just responding to Harry being vehemently against Slytherin. A Harry with more Slytherin traits is pretty much the opposite of Harry as he was written.
