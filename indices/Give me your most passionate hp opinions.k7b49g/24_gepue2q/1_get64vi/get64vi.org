I really wish that JKR would have included more of Harry's Slytherin tendencies. Like, Harry was supposed to be in Slytherin, yet he almost always acted like an immature, rash, and could sometimes be called arrogant, Gryffindor. It would have done a lot for the story had Harry used his Slytherin tendencies more often, especially in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books.
