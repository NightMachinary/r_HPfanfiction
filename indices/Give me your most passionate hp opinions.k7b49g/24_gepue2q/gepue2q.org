Harry is a really boring protagonist.

The reason there is so much Indy!Harry, OP!Harry, and Dark!Harry around is because Harry-in-canon can't be a good protagonist unless you completely change his character. He is passive, unambitious, reactive and conflict-avoidant - all of which means that if left alone, the plot wouldn't move at all.
