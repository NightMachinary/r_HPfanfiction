Dude. As daughter of Athena, Annabeth contribution was supposed to be not only in doing things but in sharing the right info. And you are forgetting a bunch of stuff.

In the bus is Annabeth's Cap what makes Percy go beyond the furies. In medusa Grover distracts Medusa and afterwards gets them the money for the train. St Louis is no victory for Percy as he doesn't defeat the bad guy but escapes falling from the arc. In Denver, Grover saves Percy and Annabeth both from a massive crash. And of course Percy was to have the bigger physical role, as stated he was the son of big three and the quest was his.

Percy didn't take Clarisse to Polyphemus island. She got there by herself and actually was her boat what saved Percy and Annabeth from drowning early on. Clarisse wasn't there for Luke, that was a side quest as Clarisse had already fulfilled her mission.

Percy might be the strongest in book 5 but strength was irrelevant at the end. At the end was Annabeth solving the puzzle what saved the day
