Book 1 - Percy did everything besides Annabeth recognizing Medusa, calculating their fall, and distracting Cerberus with a ball. Grover and Annabeth could honestly be replaced by two random people and the book would still be the same.

Book 2 - Although Clarisse was technically the hero, Percy did almost all of the work. Clarisse was just given the Golden Fleece and told to go back to camp. Even she thought Percy should have been the one to be recognized as the hero since she did nothing.

Book 3 - I honestly forgot everything about it.

Book 5 - There are a variety of heroes, but Percy is much more important than the rest, because of the Curse of Achilles, the fact that he's the best swordfighter in 300 years, and that he's the son of one of the Big Three.

I think that Percy was just so effortlessly perfect, especially compared to his love interest Annabeth. She was constantly rude in every book, she had a crush on the guy who resurrected the major antagonist, didn't tell Percy that she thought either Luke or him would die, refused to kill Luke when he offered her a chance, and had so much more that was wrong with her. Grover, his other sidekick, also had a multitude of flaws that he had. Percy, unlike his friends, was just so perfect and all of his "character development" felt so contrived in my opinion.
