Not quite. The "trio" was formed in book 1 and it was emphasized who much Percy needed them. He still faced Ares alone, as Harry faced Quirrell alone.

Book 2 was less about Percy's prowess and more about accepting Tyson. For him and Annabeth both. As well as developing Annabeth and Percy's bond. Clarisse was the hero there.

Book 3 it was about his struggles to find his place next to Thalia when the prophecy is in the horizon. As well as realizing his feelings for Annabeth. Annabeth held the weight of.the world longer than him and his big moment was just held the sky for a bit so Artemis could do everything.

Book 4 seems you have no trouble with.

Book 5 the focus is on Luke decision. There is a variety of heroes there. Clarisse gets the spotlight at a moment, then Nico. Then Thalia appears. The one who recognizes how to solve the prophecy is Annabeth. Percy is strong because of the curse he overtook, buy his part in the end is just listenening to Annabeth.

His fatal flaw was unexploited, I'll give you that's expected a conflict with Frank throughout all the second series, a decision it never came to be.
