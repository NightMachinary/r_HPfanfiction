I think Percy was too much of a Mary Sue. While Harry's friends were extremely important in their adventures, Percy practically did everything (the only book I can think of where the work was more equal was in BotL). Percy had basically no flaws, and even his fatal flaw, his intense loyalty, never really has any consequences like it does with Annabeth's hubris. He struggles with it a bit in the first book, but he eventually decides that saving the world was more important than saving his mom. Heck, Percy is even handsome enough to have an immortal titaness who's more beautiful than Aphrodite fall in love with him in a few days, while Harry is hated by everyone half of the time.
