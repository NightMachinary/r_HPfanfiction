My biggest complaint with the epilogue is it had so little to do with the series in its tone?

The series was about friendship and their interests and overcoming a dark lord.

And yet the epilogue us just about confirming ships? Why is Draco ending up with some lady no one knows ( as Astoria only is confirmed post DH and even then no one knew her from the books) a thing worthy of being included?

You find out nothing about what jobs main characters are doing or any changes that took place post war but hey Draco procreated. I harp on Draco to make a point but this is literally all the characters. Harry's romantic subplot isn't even that big. But you know what was big ? Him fighting dark wizards since he was 11 and wanting to be a auror. But you get no exploration of his job and see that he has kids.

I agree that either Draco should have gotten a redemption or Harry should have befriended a Slytherin and been very close to them. Also befriended a Hufflepuff to be very close to. He has Luna in Ravenclaw so at least 1 person from a different house.
