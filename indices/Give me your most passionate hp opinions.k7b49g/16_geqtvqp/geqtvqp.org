- The Epilogue is a travesty that could have been (and kind of /was/) by any decent fanfic writer, and was a heartbreaking end to the series.
- The decision not to give Draco a redemption archive went against the general message of hope and overcoming youthful mistakes that is present throughout.
- Harry marrying into the Weasley family was too perfect and too contrived. I like Ginny, but I don't like her with Harry at all. She went from "best friend's sister who has an awkward crush on me" to "love interest" with literally no development. She also went from Annoying sister to pretty badass without any development. I feel like Ginny pre HPB and after HPB could be different characters.
- The Cursed Child is merely officially endorsed fanfic. Only fanfic would have had the balls to make Albus and Scorpius a couple.
- "Harry is canonically straight" is always a terrible argument and completely dismisses viable alternative interpretations of canon. On Drarry specifically, there is mounds of subtext between him and Draco that could make them a viable couple. There's a reason it's the single most popular pairing in the fandom. Just because it's not to your taste or you don't like slash doesn't mean that it isn't objectively as valid a ship as /Haphne/.
