I agree. Slytherins were said to be cunning and ambitious, but Draco has shown no cunning, except for the vanishing cabinet idea, and no ambition beyond 'my father will hear about this'. Slughorn was a much better Slytherin, showing his ambition by gaining a very large web of people who owed him favours while doing very little in the meantime.
