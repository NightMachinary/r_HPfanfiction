Fair distinction (thinking back). Still, he doesn't have a lot of reason to suspect Draco other than his own bias (he's right of course, there's a reason people ignored him--not a good reason, but a reason).

And a balanced reply (like yours) is not homophobic. It's just that most of the arguments I've seen against them don't bring up Draco's canonical character as a sticking point. It's usually the "Harry is straight" argument, which, excuse me while I roll my eyes.
