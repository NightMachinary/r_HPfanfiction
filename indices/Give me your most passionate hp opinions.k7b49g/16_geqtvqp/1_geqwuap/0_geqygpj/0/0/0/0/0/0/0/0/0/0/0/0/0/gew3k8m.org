And you said you weren't going to write a novel! Jokes aside, you make a lot of good points and I agree, he was made for a redemption arc, kinda like Zuko from A:TLA. But for me, the only way I can see them coming together is either changing something in regards to choices another character - like Narcissa - makes, or as you said, giving them a few years after the final battle to realise their prejudices and make the change themselves, perhaps with the help of their childhood rival, I.e. Harry in this case.
