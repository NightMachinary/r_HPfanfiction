So TL;DR: I think that Harry and Draco are great foils for one another and are an OTP of mine, but I totally understand why you can't get past canon Draco being a snot, so if it's not your jam, that's okay too.

Haha, were you expecting a novel? Drarry is kind of an OTP of mine. I think he's a far more interesting foil for Harry than pretty much anyone else, and his character was primed for a redemption arc that ultimately wasn't given to him. That generally means I tend to prefer either canon divergent fics (if set during school) or them running into each other as adults with some space between their school days (as far as I'm concerned the Epilogue is usually firmly "not my cannon" territory). Canon Draco is absolutely a snotty, spoiled little brat with few, if any, redeeming qualities beyond loving his family. That said, there were opportunities for him to grow and change and see beyond his prejudices, he just never does in canon (which is a damn shame b/c there's such a point made of "Slytherin doesn't equal evil" and "Gryffindor doesn't equal good," and while you have Pettigrew as the example in Gryffindor, you really don't any character from Slytherin who does the same (and no, I definitely do not count Snape)). Fandom makes up for that in /abundance/.

I think my favorite fic that does this slowly is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417][survival is a talent]] Linkao3(12006417)

Don't be too overwhelmed by the wordcount. It starts in second year, so you can dip your toes in and check out the 2nd and 3rd year and see if it's an interesting take or not. It's a soulmate AU with surprisingly little focus on the soulmate aspect, and a slowly developing relationship (since they're, you know, /twelve/ at the beginning). The author really doesn't do smut, so you don't have to worry about running into any of it later either.

There is probably an argument to be made that fanon Draco (at least in slash) and canon Draco aren't really the same character, but generally speaking, good fics will show him changing, show him learning and growing in ways that, to me, generally work and make sense and tend to be much more satisfying for me as a reader. Fandom, for me, gives me the growth and development that I didn't get in canon, and I think with some growth, he and Harry actually complement one another really well. I deeply believe there are 2 main drivers of massive fandom engagement: 1) really fantastic world that is not fully explored (LOTR is king here, but HP falls into it a lot too, as does Star Wars); 2) phenomenal idea, less than phenomenal execution (Naruto, Supernatural, Harry Potter again). HP and Star Wars, two of arguably the biggest fandoms ever, hit both of these. Not all parts of them are unsuccessful, it can just take a few. But I find that where canon fails, if the idea was good enough, fandom will provide. Harry was not given a good romantic arc or (in my opinion) a partner who was a good match for him. There's obviously a massive contingent of the fandom that feels Draco fits better, and, as such, has filled that void.

That said, I do understand not being able to see past a character in canon being terrible. Tom/Harry has picked up recently as a pairing, and I just... I can't do that in any context that isn't blatantly terribly unhealthy. Tom Riddle was pretty much shown to be a sociopath from childhood canonically. I don't think there's any fixing that. I just can't get on that ship. That said, /that's my hangup/. It doesn't work /for me/, and I can explain why, but I'm not going to go trolling Tomarry fics and tell the authors they're wrong or troll readers who like the pairing. I just move on when I see it, which I think is something fandom, as a whole, needs to get better about, but this subred is particularly not great about.
