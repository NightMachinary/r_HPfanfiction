I found a wonderful fic that is very... odd... with the pairings. It says Harry/Regulus, but fear not, there is time travel. Also, I think it's more of the characters depending on one another, and it may lead to some thing more, but at the moment they are friends. I believe it is called Face Death in the Hope by LullabyKnell, and clocks in at around 270k words and is still going, slowly if steadily.
