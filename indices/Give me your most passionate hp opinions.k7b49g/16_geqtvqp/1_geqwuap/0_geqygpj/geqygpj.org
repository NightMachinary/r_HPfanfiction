He's really not glorified in the original text (in fandom, no argument). I remember watching an interview with JKR where she was kind of appalled by how popular Draco was because he was a spoiled brat who shouldn't be admired (and it's my personal opinion that her decision not to give him a redemption arc is related to not glorifying him or trying to redeem him).

Part of why protagonists and antagonists are popular pairings is because those relationships are often some of the best-developed relationships in the property. There is no single character in the series that Harry fixates on more than Draco and vice versa. Even if you hate it, that's a pretty objective truth. And that kind of fixation is a gold mine if you happen to like slash. If you don't like Draco objectively, I get that. He was a character that had potential to go in a different direction that canon ultimately took him (would have been really nice to see one serious Slytherin character actually go against the grain and grow beyond their own indoctrination, but we didn't get that. And Snape does not count given his very personal and specific motivations). But acting like it's just a "bad" ship on its face usually just reads as homophobic to me.
