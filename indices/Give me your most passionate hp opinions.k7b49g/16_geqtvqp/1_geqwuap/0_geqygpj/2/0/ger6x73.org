I didn't say it was. I said "acting like it's just a "bad" ship on its face usually just reads as homophobic to me."

As someone who has had people blow up at me for even considering that Harry may not be straight, I stand by the fact that /in my experience/ people who object most strongly to it often come across /to me/ as homophobic. I never said not liking it is homophobic. There's a pretty big divide between "Not my ship" or "just doesn't work for me" and the level of defensiveness I typically see.
