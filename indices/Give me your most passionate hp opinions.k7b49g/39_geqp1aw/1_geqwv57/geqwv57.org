Gonna have to agree to disagree with this. Just because the behavior would not have been "severe enough" for him to have been taken away, it can actually be /surprisingly difficult/ to have a child removed from an abusive situation. Especially one that doesn't leave obvious marks. I think you're undermining the massive and longterm emotional damage the kind of neglect and abuse Harry underwent can have. If your bar is "he was fed, clothed, and had a roof over his head," you've literally set it at the lowest standard of "care" there is.

I'd like to think social service would have raised eyebrows at the "bedroom" being under the stairs. With locks on the outside of it. But I don't disagree he wouldn't have been removed because putting him in the system probably wouldn't have been much better than being in the Dursleys, but that doesn't mean that their abuse wasn't significant.
