Snape is only compelling because he's an evil, miserable, creepy, obsessive, hateful, vindictive sob who's fighting on the "good" side.

Snape's fans attempt to pretend that he's misunderstood or has never done anything wrong or he's a better person than the marauders whitewash him into becoming generic brooding antihero #5467.

Canon bastard Snape is 1000 times more compelling than fanon "redeemed" snape.
