The reason I think divination is related to mind magic is that trelawny's Crystal gazing instructions (relax the conscious mind) and snape's occulemency instructions (clear your mind) seem to be rather similar if equally unhelpful.

I agree that Sybil's prophetic abilities are inherited but that they relate to divination the way a metamorphs do to transfiguration.

I think all magicals have some degree of inate skill possibly related to their ability to see things muggles can't.

Either way Ron's predictions are slot like trelawneys in that he doesn't realize he's made them or use any of the assorted paraphernalia.

It's a pity JKR didn't go in that direction as it would have done Ron some good to be naturally talented at something the others weren't.

I'm a sucker for for Luna and olivander being related.
