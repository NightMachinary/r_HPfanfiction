I agree that Divination is a legitimate and functional branch of magic, but I disagree that it's related to mind magic and that Ron, Harry, and Hermione didn't try hard enough. Which, /fair/, but I simply believe that you have to have an innate skill in Divination and that it shouldn't be offered as an elective unless students show any ability in it. I also think that Divination runs in family lines kinda like Metamorphmagi's in the Blacks and Parseltongue in the Gaunts.

Ron, for example, could be seen as one of these students with an innate skill in it. He literally predicted half the shit that happens in the books and he wasn't even trying. Imagine if he actually put the work into Divination? He may not make predictions like Telewany, who I feel has a sort of "watered-down" version of her ancestor's Divination skill, but he sure as hell shows some aptitude toward it.

Luna is another person who is often portrayed as a character skilled in Divination, but personally, I think that the Lovegoods and the Ollivanders come from the same family line and that they can actually /see/ magic, and that's what Luna sees with wrackspurts and the like.
