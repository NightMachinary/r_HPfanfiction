100% agree, I do think Dumbledore had a lot of other more pressing concerns (Grindelwald) and is still only human. I don't blame him for how he acted, it feels very appropriate for the time period.

I'm more annoyed that despite the number of times Dumbledore has picked through his memories of Tom Riddle, he doesn't ever acknowledge the possibility that he could have done anything wrong.

And Harry doesn't have any second thoughts Dumbledore's interpretation either when viewing the memory over fifty-years later. Granted, Harry was dealing with the mad man destroying the world and trying to kill him in particular, so I really don't hold that against him.

I guess because so few people knew anything about Voldemort's past, I wish someone was written to feel a closer personal connection to it (an original death eater, harry, Dumbledore)? Slughorn got pretty close, which was nice.

But a lot of this rant is probably because I think 'modern' Voldemort is pretty flat as a villain and want him rounded out somehow. His interesting backstory felt wasted to me because it was so disconnected from 90s Voldemort and how others acted around him (aside from Dumbledore and Harry calling him Tom)
