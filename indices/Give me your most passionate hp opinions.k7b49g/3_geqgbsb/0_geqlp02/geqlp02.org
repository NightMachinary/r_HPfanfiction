I think much of this can be answered by comparing to what should be done and what we actually do. You could help the poor fellow who lives on the streets or engage yourself in politics for the betterment of your society, but most people don't. We don't think that it is our business, that we are busy and that we already care for the people close to us.

It also has to be said that in earlier centuries and even today the degree of responsibility we feel to orphans and other people in general is not up to the level people imagine it to be.

Just ask yourself how attentive you are to other people's blights and how you think there might be something and you just walk on, because you tell yourself it is not your business and somebody else will care or that you made a misjudgment.

Now Dumbledore is a teacher and could or should notice something, but the key point is, that he only is a teacher. He is not the parent or guardian. Detachment is a thing.
