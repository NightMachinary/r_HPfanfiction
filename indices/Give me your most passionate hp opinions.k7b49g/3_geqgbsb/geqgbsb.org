Dumbledore fucked up during his very first meeting with Tom Riddle. It makes some amount of sense given Grindelwald and views on mental illness at the time, however Dumbledore never once seems to regret or consider that he messed up with his initial treatment of Riddle. An isolated child who grew up in a Muggle orphanage during Depression Era, then WWII, Britain was not going to be a well adjusted individual by any stretch of the imagination, let alone one who could do incredible feats of wandless magic before the age of 11.

There are numerous accounts in real life of conditions that orphans went through during those decades in Britain, and the majority of the children came out with severe, lifelong trauma.

In his assessment of Wool's orphanage, Harry thinks that the orphans 'looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place.' Mrs. Cole and her assistant were clearly overrun and overworked when Dumbledore visited. But despite being described as 'inconveniently sharp' and 'more anxious than unkind', Mrs Cole was also said to be 'no novice when it came to drinking gin'. That feels problematic to me.

After speaking to Mrs Cole, Dumbledore speaks with Riddle. Riddle is angry and scared because he believes he's being sent to an asylum and screams that he's not mad. He's desperate to prove his sanity and is excited beyond belief to put a name to his abilities. He immediately tells Dumbledore everything he can do and is relieved to know there are other people like him.

He is also a petty thief and in response, Dumbledore pretends to blow up his wardrobe and threatens him with expulsion and ministry punishment if he does anything like it ever again.

After Riddle questioned him about Hogwarts and school supplies, Dumbledore says he'll take Riddle to Diagon Alley and is declined. Instead of pulling the adult card here and going anyways to be a stabilizing, interested adult presence for the 11-year-old orphan's intro to this new world, he effectively shrugs and says he'll see him at Hogwarts.

The conversation is less than five minutes, and he asks two questions: 'How are you doing' and 'You dislike the name Tom?' That's it. That's all he asks this orphan terrified of asylums and desperate to meet/know about others like him.

While Dumbledore spoke to Mrs. cole about Riddle's history and behavior, he never actually asks Tom about any of it. Not what the orphanage is like, not what he thinks of the other children, not what he does with his time, not what happened with the rabbit. This kid is clearly messed up, due to some combination of genetics and environment, but Dumbledore walks out without hesitation.

Why is he okay with hearing about Riddle's childhood crimes second hand instead of talking to the kid? Where was any speck of sympathy or warmth for a life-long orphan, from the wizard who later touts love as the greatest power? Dumbledore claims that Tom Riddle could never and would never know love, but he certainly never offered it to Riddle.

Frequently I've seen arguments that there were plenty of other children who go through similar events and don't end up being genocidal psychopaths, which is true. However, there are also plenty who end up perpetuating the abuse, in jail for various crimes, or dead. Riddle could have easily been one of those, except he was able to muster massive amounts of power as an unloved, strange child. Even adults don't deal well with having unchecked power over others.

None of this excuses Tom Riddle's later actions by any means, however I think it is an incredibly important lens to view the character of Voldemort through. One that readers, and even Dumbledore himself, dismiss.
