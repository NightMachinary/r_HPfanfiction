There are very few characters in HP who I can honestly, without any reservations, call good. Not good as in "good character", but as in "good person".

It is usually said that Rowling's characters are "complex", "gray", "lifelike", and so on.. except if it was real life, we'd call them "failing at basic morality". You know, things like "don't abandon your friends", "don't physically attack your friends", "don't torture enemy combatants", "don't try to abandon your pregnant wife", "don't test your inventions on 11-year-olds"... Basically, the only reason most of the "good guys" can be considered such is that the other guys are even worse.

That's not to say that I hate all the characters, or that I'm trying to say that everyone was equally bad. But I've seen way too many arguments where someone was trying to judge a character they dislike by our world's standards, while ignoring the fact that the characters they are trying to defend have absolutely no moral high ground themselves.
