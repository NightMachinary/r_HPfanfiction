Ron abandoned and betrayed Harry in book 4 out of jealousy, when Harry needed him the most.The twins weren't at war when they tested most of their inventions on unwilling participants at Hogwarts. Remus didn't run from Tonks because they were at war, he ran from Tonks because he was scared he might have given their unborn child lycanthropy. These characters did questionable things that, excepting Ron perhaps, were not someone's usual thought process, I guess? While I can safely say that I will never be a werewolf, I can assume that I would never leave my wife with our unborn child, lycanthropy or no. One of my personal values is loyalty, like when Ron stood on a broken leg in front of an assumed mass murderer and said go fuck yourself. Ron then did a 180 when Harry clearly didn't like the attention of the tournament and called him a liar??? I get that he's jealous of Harry's wealth and fame, but they are best friends. Wouldn't they know each other better than that? A lot of the time the twins performed 'pranks' that could have had really bad outcomes, but it's ok because it's just a joke. Practical jokes are only ok if its harmless and fun. A cream pie to the face? No harm, it'll wash off, laughs all round. Transforming someone by slipping unknown potions in their food? Real dangerous territory here, boys. I agree with OP here, just because they are the good guys doesn't excuse all their behaviour, which we are lead to believe in the books.
