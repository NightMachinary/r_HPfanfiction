Wish we got more stories that focus on Slughorn, but he seems rather underused. Even in the Marauders Era where authors use him as a potion professor, he doesn't get that much spotlight.

He also seemed to at least not hate Muggleborns, considering what he said about Lily. (I think Harry had over reacted during then). So that was nice to see Slughorn be accepting of other people. When in canon Slytherin tends to hate on Muggleborns.
