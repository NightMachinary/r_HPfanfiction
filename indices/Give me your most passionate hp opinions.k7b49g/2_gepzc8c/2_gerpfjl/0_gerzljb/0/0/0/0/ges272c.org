I like Slughorn too, don't get me wrong. I think it is very understandable what he did. I really like nearly all the Slytherin we got a deeper look in because they are the most fleshed out characters in the series. Snape, Slughorn, Regulus - even Draco - all very good characters - but not really good persons. My point was that there was no Slytherin who was good beyond doubt. You have that in every other house but not in Slytherin.
