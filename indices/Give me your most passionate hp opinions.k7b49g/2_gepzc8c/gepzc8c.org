- Dumbledore is not a manipulative bastard who planed to use Harry Potter as weapon but a flawed human being who tried to make the best out of a shit situation

- While Snape is one of the most interesting characters in the book, nothing (really nothing) apologises Snapes unprofessional behavior or his choice to join Voldemort

- There should have been at least one truly good Slytherin (J.K planed a Slytherin Weasley, I hate that she kicked her. Every other house has good and bad people. Only Slytherin is stuck with only bad people and some bad people who did some good things in the end)
