Something that's been percolating in my mind is the fact that there was no reason to make Snape head of house AND potions professor. There just doesn't seem to be a good reason to give someone who's pretty much straight out of Hogwarts both positions.

But then again my rant would be about how Dumbledore and most adults in the series deserve years or decades in jail.
