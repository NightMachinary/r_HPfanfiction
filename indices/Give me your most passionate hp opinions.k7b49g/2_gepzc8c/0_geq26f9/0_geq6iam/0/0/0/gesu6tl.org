I like the fan theory people were discussing here a few days (weeks? IDK 2020 timescale is all warped for me), where Slughorn is SO terrified of Riddle / Voldemort for a few reasons:

1. Slughorn knows of his horcruxes. He's a bit of an ass, yes, for keeping that a secret, but there's honestly like a handful of people he could even discuss the subject with who would even know what was going on. Then you have a psychotic powerful wizard who knows that you know his secret, and well, you'd want to maybe keep that information to yourself lest the immortal psychopath finds out you snitched.

2. Slughorn is the reason Tom Riddle never made anything of himself professionally after Hogwarts. You have the Head Boy, top of his class, prodigy student and basically second-coming of Dumbledore in Tom Riddle. The kid is obviously a genius and ambitious ... so he works at some second-hand dark artifacts shop in Nocturne Alley? Well, it's because Slughorn uses his extensive network of acquaintances to blacklist the kid. Tom Riddle has no future, not in the English speaking world, so he adopts a persona, /Voldemort/, to circumvent this, and Slughorn is equally terrified.

I mean, the guy was hiding out and posed as furniture to avoid dealing with Voldemort. Dumbledore bringing Harry in was a way to convince Slughorn that "hey, we have a solution."

Regulus got cold feet and probably realized that suicide was preferable to a life of being a deranged murderer.
