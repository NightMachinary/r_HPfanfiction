  I wouldn't call Slughorn bad though. I see him as a mostly good person who was defeated by his shame.

Like I said - Slughorn is not the baddest of the bad. In terms of white to black he is more like a light grey. But my point was that every house got a true hero; one who was good all the time even if they had flaws. Hufflepuff has Cedric, Sprout and Tonks, Ravenclaw has Luna and Flitwick, Gryffindor has to much to count. Slytherin has no one who is like that.
