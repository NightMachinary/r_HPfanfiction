I can agree with Andromeda, but Regulus was not a truly good Slytherin. He collected pictures of Murder while he was a teen and wanted to be a Death Eater. He only realised what it meant when he already was one. He did the right thing in the end, sure, but before that he was all about blood purity.

Slughorn may be not the baddest bad but he was the one who helped Tom Riddle with his Horcruxes and kept it secret for over 50 years! If he had told Dumbledore what he knew, Dumbledore could have acted decades earlier. Dumbledore only figured out that Riddle had Horcruxes in 1993 - it took him 5 years to take Voldemort down after that. I don't fault him for falling into Riddles charm, but I fault Slughorn for keeping it secret.

Both Slughorn and Regulus (together with Snape, Narzissa and Draco) fall in the category of "bad Slytherins who did good later on". Not truly good.
