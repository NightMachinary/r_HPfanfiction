Hmm. It is possible, it was some time ago I read the books, although today is the first time I've heard this since then. But I saw this even in fics where Marauders or James were the protagonist, so I figured it was actual canon and not an invention by people who dislike James. In fact, this is the very reason I stopped reading Jily fics in first place.

Either way, trying to blackmail someone into a date remains an awful thing to do. And it wasn't exactly a secret that James liked Lily, which implies that he asked her out more than once.
