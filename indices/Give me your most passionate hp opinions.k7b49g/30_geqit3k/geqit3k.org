Jily is not a healthy ship in my opinion. Constantly pursuing someone with them saying no every time is not romantic, it's creepy. And I'm not saying she should've ended up with Snape instead -- sure, I like the ship, but that's in AU context. I do realize how problematic it is in canon. I always considered Lily/Remus to be the objectively most healthy ship for her when discounting OCs (we don't know what other options went to school around that time beyond Marauders or Slytherins). To be honest, I'm somewhat surprised how rare fics that pair her with someone other than James or Snape is (it's like a 25:5:1 rate for James:Snape:others)

I dislike Remadora for similar reasons, although someone else already mentioned that ship.
