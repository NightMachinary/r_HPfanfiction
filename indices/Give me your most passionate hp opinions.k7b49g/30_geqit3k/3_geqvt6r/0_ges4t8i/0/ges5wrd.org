There is a part of me that was just always rather uncomfortable with the previous hero worship, especially because it goes from hero worship to girlfriend material with no discernible growth or change (that may just be because she's not a main character so that's all off-screen). Especially given that Harry literally saved her life in the Chamber of Secrets, that seems the kind of thing that would make it worse not better. It just nags at me like a splinter under the skin. I was just never wholly convinced that wasn't an element of her attraction to him, which kind of makes the whole foundation of the relationship suspect in my mind. And if that sounds like I'm attributing maliciousness to Ginny's motivations, I don't think that at all. I just fundamentally question building a relationship together that young of such questionable foundations. I'd be a lot happier with it if they went their own ways for a few years then reconnected later, but that's pretty clearly not what happens.

That said, I'm aware it's a quibble. As I pointed out earlier, you can totally give it the benefit of the doubt and assume she had that growth off-screen, in which case Hinny is one of the only healthy romantic relationships depicted. It just felt like something Ginny and Harry /thought they should want/ rather than something they /actually wanted/, at least for me.
