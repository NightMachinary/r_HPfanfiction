I get why you find Romione unhealthy (it's one of the 3 ships I explicitly dislike, besides Remadora and Jily) but what is wrong with Hinny? I always figured the biggest problem with canon Hinny is that the romance is poorly written, not that there's anything particularly wrong with the ship itself.

For the record, my personal views on Hinny are neutral -- I don't dislike it but it's not a ship I really care for.
