You have some good points. I agree that they were most likely a lot closer in terms of friendship during school, but during the war they grew further apart. I don't think this is how most people saw it though. I generally think most people saw James and Sirius as the cool kids while Remus and Peter were seen as just normal kids who happened to be friends with them. The point I was trying to get across was that most of the actual pranking, bullying and exploring was done by James and Sirius (although the Map was definitely a group project). They were all very good friends but they weren't like a public group phenomenon where everyone admired their friendship.

I don't have a problem with people enjoying Wolfstar, but everyone is /always/ so out of character. The main reason Wolfstar doesn't work is because it ruins what is interesting about the characters to me. If Remus and Sirius are deeply in love, they will not consider the other as a potential spy for the order. Remus wouldn't have the trust issues and lack of confidence in their friendship if he was receiving constant love from Sirius. James would be a kind of a third wheel in their friendship. To me, the most important person in Sirius' life was James, which would not be true if he was with Remus. If the Snape-werewolf incident never happened and James was never born, then I could maybe see them being together.

​

And anyway, I never saw Sirius as being interested in any type of romance. If he was, it's kind of obvious who he would be in love with...

Also ill drop some quotes supporting the fact that James and Sirius were what mostly made up the "Marauders".

  “Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here --- ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!”

(double act)

  “Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course --- exceptionally bright, in fact --- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers

  “You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
#+end_quote

No mention of the rest except for "their little gang",

  “It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...”
#+end_quote

(Sirius doesn't seem very sorry for his actions does he?)

  “If it bothers you,” he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket. Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.
#+end_quote

James apparently will only listen to Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, /occasionally/ accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.
#+end_quote

Most of their mischief was only committed by James and Sirius.
