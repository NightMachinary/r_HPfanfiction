I think that the only reason James and Sirius were so successful was because they had someone to Research, Lookout, Distract, Offer Alibi's. James and Sirius had the strongest motivation and capability to prank.

But whatever, I don't care for canon because all the characters are a lot meaner than I want them to be. So here's my rec for how I imagine they could have been in a more ideal world. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24438490/chapters/58966003][Sanctuary by Cyborg Squirrel]]
