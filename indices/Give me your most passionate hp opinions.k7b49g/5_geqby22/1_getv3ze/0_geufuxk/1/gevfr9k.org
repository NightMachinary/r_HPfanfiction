You can receive constant love from somebody and still be as intensely insecure as Remus.

My own concern with Wolfstar is how Sirius canonically runs roughshod over people, including Remus, and how emotionally unhealthy their relationship would be.

I could buy that they dated briefly, then broke up after the Shrieking Shack incident.
