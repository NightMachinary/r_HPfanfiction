When it comes to canon I am hard pressed to disagree with you. There isn't much to go on and Remus and Peter changed the most since childhood (matured from loneliness and the about face of betrayal) so they could have been anything. They were definitely in on secrets and participated in most of them, Animagi and Map. James and Sirius were the extroverts and had the closest friendship. There was probably a lot of social pressure to fit in with them, and neither Remus nor Peter had much self confidence to start with. I actually think it works with when they joined the Order. James and Sirius were dedicated to each other and felt that their skill meant they had to be the brave Gryfs. Remus didn't have many options but agreed with the cause and had unique skills, however he never expected to stay close friends after high school. Peter was the opposite as he was desperate to stay friends with James and Sirius but he couldn't offer anything back. He was too scared for the war and angry that his friends left him behind. I think you are correct for how that all impacts canon, but...

When they were "Maraudering" I think they would have appeared on the outside to be all equals. When they were teens this could have been the case before they matured. So the friendship dynamic was complex but I think they all had their part in the friendship.

Wolfstar is definitely not canon but I like to read it because both characters have very gay themes. 1. a boy who disagrees with his families traditional beliefs and runs away, 2. a boy who holds a deep secret and is trying to learn that he isn't a monster and deserves love. Those are some really strong themes that work well with romance stories, just need some extra time to marinate out the internalised homophobia. The grey cloud of the ship is that you have to ignore almost everything after their Hogwarts graduation, but since I don't like canon all that much I like when it changes in Wolfstars favour.
