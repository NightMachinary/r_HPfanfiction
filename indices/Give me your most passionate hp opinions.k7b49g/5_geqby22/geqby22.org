1. Wolfstar is terrible and will never work. Remus and Sirius weren't nearly as close as most people think they were.
2. The Founders probably weren't as immensely powerful as they're often portrayed. They probably were for their time, but they would get stomped by Dumbledore and Voldemort. Most spells hadn't even been invented yet during their time.
3. Most of the "ancient pure-blood" families wouldn't be as invested in politics/ the ministry as people think. They would certainly be rich and have loads of connections, but to flaunt their wealth and power is something that would be considered nouveau riche. Old families know their worth, they would only brag behind the scenes.
4. "The Marauders" were basically mostly James and Sirius, no matter how much people want to portray them as extremely tight knit. All canon evidence points towards Remus and Peter being good friends but not equals. Remus thinking his friends would reject him if he stood up to them when they bullied Snape is very telling of their dynamic. Also notice how it was /James and Sirius/ who were "the height of cool" not all four of them.
