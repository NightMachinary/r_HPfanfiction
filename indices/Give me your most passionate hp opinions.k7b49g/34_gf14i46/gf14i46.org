This is a rant-slash-list about all the things various fanfictions get wrong (Please note that if you make it clear that this is different from canon and is what you want to do anyway, this does not apply)

As far as we can infer from the books, Vernon Dursley never hit Harry. Never. Harry was abused, yes, physically and emotionally, but there were never any beatings. Never any belts. This does not change the fact that the Dursleys should be thrown in Azkaban until they're old and grey. Just. Explain that the abuse is worse if u want to do belt scars n shit.

Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard who cared, first and foremost, for the defeat of Voldemort, and second, if you can believe it, for Harry's safety. I do not believe that he even suspected Harry was a Horcrux when he laid him at Privet Drive. (Also, who does that?!? Leaving a baby on a doorstep? At night??! Also, McGonagall?? You LEFT?!) Anyway, through Harry's first and second year at Hogwarts he slowly picks up the clues to the fact that Harry is a Horcrux. He only figures this out, however, at the end of Harry's second year when he is given the mangled diary. He is very very worried at this point. He was originally trying not to get too close to Harry in case he lost him to Voldemort (given that Voldemort believes in the prophecy), but now he is even more frantically trying not to care- and failing- because Harry actually has to die for Voldemort to ever be truly defeated. He's been robbed of any real childhood he might have had because Dumbledore put his safety above his happiness on the Things That Are Important List, and now he has to die. Then, in GoF, he finds out that Voldemort used Harry's blood. Essentially meaning that if he gives himself up, lets himself be killed, he won't have to die. He'll have a choice. So now all Dumbledore has to do is make Harry believe he has to die. He did, in fact, care about Harry's safety. He took away Harry's childhood because he figured it was better than being dead. This is why I hate fanfictions where Dumbledore Doesn't Care At All.

Amortentia, contrary to what seems to be the belief of at least half fanfiction writers, does not smell like what your crush's Amortentia smells like! I cannot tell you the amount of fanfics I've read where somebody who has a crush on Harry smells treacle tart and the woody smell of a broomstick handle in Amortentia. If you have a crush on someone, you are likely to smell their cologne/perfume/shampoo and/or another thing they smell of that attracts you. You only smell something in Amortentia if /you/ find that smell to be powerfully alluring. /You/. Not your crush. Also, Amortentia's effects are not negated by the presence of real feelings. Said feelings would probably result in less of a change in the victim's behaviour and/or mental state, but that's it. Judging by Ron's behaviour, what it does is infatuates you with the subject, which prompts you to think about the subject's positive attributes, /incessantly/. Your mind latches on to the seemingly logical conclusion that you are in love with this person, and you act - wait for it - /exactly/ as you would act if you had just figured out you were in love with this person for real. (Possibilities include (but are not limited to) pining, moping, telling friends, trying to ask them out.)

Pepper-Up Potion is used to cure colds and flu. That is all Pepper-Up Potion can be used for, unless of course somebody just wants to prank their coworker by making steam come out of their ears. Please stop using it as coffee. You have Invigoration Draught for that. Thank you.

Veritaserum can be countered with Occlumency. It also only forces the drinker to tell what they /think/ the truth is. This is why it is not used in court. Veritaserum is not infallible. Thank you.

Pensieve memories are also not infallible. There is very little reason for anyone to tamper with memories in canon, but it is possible and therefore Pensieves are not used in court.

Occlumency is the art of protecting your mind from potential invaders. Legilimency is the art of invading a mind. An Occlumens is someone who is accomplished in the art of Occlumency. A Legilimens is someone who is accomplished in the art of Legilimency. 'Legilimens' can be used as an incantation to accomplish Legilimency. There is no such incantation for Occlumency.

There are no compulsion spells whatsoever on the Gaunt Ring or the diary. There aren't. Ginny chose to write in the diary of her own accord. Also, the only reason Riddle was able to posess her was because she became emotionally invested in the diary. And yes, Dumbledore really was that stupid. He let his excitement at finding the Ressurection Stone rule his actions. There is also no reaction in Harry's scar from being close to Horcruxes. He can't tell when a Horcrux is close to him or when one has been destroyed unless he's using his eyes to determine such. There is no magic that can return a map of where fragments of a certain soul reside. If there was, Dumbledore would have used it. There is no way to remove a piece of foreign soul from a living being other than by killing it. If there was, Dumbledore would have used it.

The Dark Mark is red. The Dark Mark turns black only when someone touches it and it burns. End of story.

Voldemort does not 'hug' Draco Malfoy. That whole scene in the movie never happened. McGonagall was the one to scream "NO!". Voldemort makes a spectacle out of Neville. Harry pulls the Cloak over himself from where he is lying on the ground before the fight resumes. He does not immediately reveal that he is alive when he decides to take action again.

Severus Snape does not hug Lily Potter's body. There is no indication of any such frankly creepy behaviour in canon.

Harry survives because Voldemort used his blood to make his new body. No other reason. The whole 'it worked because of your sacrifice' thing merits Deep Thought, the result of which for me was the idea that there was some connection between Lily's sacrifice and Harry's, but essentially Voldemort turned himself into an anchor to the mortal world for Harry. The whole Master of Death thing is possible, but unlikely and (in canon) unnecessary to Harry's survival.

Regulus Black was born on June 25, 1961. Always assuming he started Hogwarts after his eleventh and before his twelfth birthday, he left Hogwarts in 1979. Judging from the comment on Regulus's death being recorded "some fifteen years ago" in 1995, Regulus died in 1980. Therefore, the latest it could have happened is December 31, 1980. Do with that what you will.

Time Turners create time loops. They allow people to go back in time to do things that /already happened/ the first time around, but that they *still need to do* because the /first/ time it happened, it was accomplished by their *future* selves coming back to when their *present* selves were, and the /second/ time it happened, it was accomplished by their *present* selves going back to when their *past* selves were. Your perception of what was happening the first time /will always/ add up with what your future self was doing in the background. ---------------------------------- It is possible that there are other types of Time Turners, or time magic in general, that can actually *change* the past rather than just /reinforcing/ the past that had already happened but that the user of the Time-Turner hadn't lived yet, but the author of any fanfiction depicting/utilising such objects should explain how they work and how they will be used, i.e. one of the following: travelling back in time & creating an alternate reality*,* travelling forward in time & going back with information that will create an alternate reality*,* travelling back in time & going back without creating an alternate reality*,* travelling forward in time & going back without creating an alternate reality with the information gathered (whether by lack of information or a simple refusal to mess with time)*,* any of the above by becoming your younger/older self*,* going forward/back in time & staying there without creating an alternate reality*,* /or/ (off topic but not really) going forward/backward in time while maintaining the circular logic of a Time Turner. There hasn't actually been a whole lot of fanfictions that got this wrong, I just wanted to point out that if anything is going to /change/ because of time travel, you need a different method than a Time-Turner.

The walls of the Triwizard maze do not, in fact, move.

There is at no point any indication in the books that the different Houses wear different coloured accents on their robes, or that they even have ties, much less different coloured ones for each House. This is undesstandable, given that shirts and ties would distinctly qualify as "Muggle clothing".

If your story takes place during Harry's Hogwarts years, you're in the '90s. Unless you want to make up imaginary developments in society, or make it clear that the Wizarding World is farther ahead than the Muggle one in terms of acceptance due to the lack of Christianity stigma, then so far only one anti-gay law has been reformed (1967) and the rest are being policed more aggressively. There is still a lot of homophobia in the '90s, so unless you want to make it very clear that it's different in the Wizarding World, or just different in your story's '90s in general, try to incorporate that lack of openly gay people into the story, with perhaps a few couples who are afraid to come out. If you want to skip ahead to when it's completely decriminalised, that would be sometime 2013. Also, any music you want to incorporate into the storyline as something the characters know should be already released at the time of the first mention in the story (unless it's an AU where one of the characters wrote it).
