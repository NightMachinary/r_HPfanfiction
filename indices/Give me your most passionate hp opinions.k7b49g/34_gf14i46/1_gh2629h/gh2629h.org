Cont.[max characters]

Severus Snape loved Lily Evans. He never stopped loving Lily Evans. You can bash him all you want, I don't care, he /was/ an evil bastard who just so happened to owe his loyalty to the side that's trying to take down the side that killed Lily Evans. He was a shit teacher who threatened to poison Neville's toad and insulted Hermione's teeth. But he loved Lily. There were plenty of Death Eaters who didn't /really/ believe in the "Cause", and he was one of them.

The Room of Requirement *cannot give its occupants food*.

Nobody calls Harry the "Chosen One" until /after/ the fight in the Department of Mysteries.

Wizards are, in fact, familiar with lifts /(honestly how you forget that there are lifts in the literal Ministry of Magic I have no idea)/ and cars /(again, the Ministry of Magic have cars)/.

/Silencio/ is a charm that silences an object, animal or person. It makes that object, animal or person incapable of making noise. It is not a warding spell that you can erect around you and your friends so that no-one can hear you. The only such spell that is ever mentioned in canon is /Muffliato/.

/Stupefy/, when cast correctly, instantly /knocks out/ the person or animal it hits. It does not freeze them in place, leave a bruise, or do anything else. It just /knocks them out/. It also does not "wear off", if somebody comes to after being hit with a Stupefy it is nothing more or less than having /come to/ after being /knocked out/. Lastly, the counter-spell for /Stupefy/ is /Rennervate/, not "Enervate".

/Petrificus Totalus/, when cast correctly and when physically possible, sticks the victim's arms to their sides and sticks their legs together. If such a task is not physically possible, it will simply freeze the victim in place. Also, it's /Petrificus Totalus/, not "Petrificus Totalis" or any other variation.

It's "Hogsmeade", not "Hogsmead".

Apparition, *no matter what species does it*, is /always/ accompanied by a loud /CRACK/. There is /no incantation/ for Apparition.

The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets opens *thus*: 1) You hiss /"open"/ in Parseltongue to the hot tap on the one sink in front of Myrtle's toilet. The sink sinks out of sight, revealing a pipe. /That is the only thing that happens to a sink in the opening of the Chamber./ 2) You slide down the pipe and get to a tunnel. You walk the length of the tunnel and come across the real door. This is a double door made of stone, decorated with two large snakes with rubies for eyes, one on each half of the door. This opens to the Parseltongue for /"open/", too. 3) Once inside the Chamber of Secrets, you see that it is decorated by pillars, and there is a giant statue of Salazar Slytherin at the back. The statue of Salazar Slytherin is dressed in long, flowing stone robes. You can barely see his head, all the way up near the ceiling, shrouded in dim light. When you say /"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four"/ in Parseltongue, his mouth opens and the basalisk comes out.

A Parselmouth is someone who can speak Parseltongue instinctively. Parseltongue is the language used to commune with snakes. Please, /please/ stop mixing them up. /Please./

Wizarding chess, contrary to what seems to be popular belief, does not have the pieces /break/ each other. They bang each other over the head, yes, they knock each other out, yes, but they do not actually reduce each other to rubble. If this was the case, it would be impossible to play more than one game with any single chess set. Once the chess piece is unconscious, the piece that knocked it out drags it off the edge of the board before returning to its square on the board. This is described at /least/ twice during the Philosopher's Stone.

To American fanfiction writers: I ask you to please try to get hold of the original versions of the books and base your language on the language used in them, or if not, to put an alert at the top of the story that it uses American English rather than British English.
