Snape is a terrible person. Evil even. He told Voldemort about the prophecy knowing that a toddler is going to be murdered. He only had a problem with it when he found out that one of the toddlers in question belonged to Lily Potter. He doesn't have a genuine change of heart and never had true regret over his past actions. If Harry Potter was born six months later and Voldemort had murderd some other infant Sanpe would still be a Death Eater.
