I don't somehow think this is the case. I highly doubt that the thought of Voldemort immediately marching up to the child's house and murdering it and its parents before it's even two years old actually even crossed his mind at all before Voldemort announced that "the boy is Harry Potter and I must kill him and his family immediately".

He probably had some vague notion of Voldemort being more wary of certain potential adversaries & being more on his guard as they grew up, but I don't think he specifically thought "this guy's gonna kill a toddler" at any point, nor do I think he would have been okay with that.

If Harry Potter was born six months later Voldemort would have attempted to kill Neville. Yes. That is true.

Somehow I don't think Snape would have followed him (willingly) for much longer once he realised what he was planning to do.

What Snape thought of todddler murder is never actually breached because his thoughts are consumed by /oh god oh god oh god please let me save Lily/
