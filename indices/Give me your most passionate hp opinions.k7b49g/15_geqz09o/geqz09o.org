1. This is mostly just cause harem fics are my thing, but there is /no way/ Hermione would /ever/ just go “yes I'm fine with being one of Harry's many wives” or some shit like that. She's a feminist, independent, and stubborn, and I just couldn't realistically see her doing that shit. Yet, with the exception of 1 possible fic, her doing the exact opposite is normal in any harem fics featuring her (ugh).

2. Ron bashing is just incredibly annoying, as it seems like people just purposely refuse to understand the complexity of his character in particular. Yes, Ron is a hothead at times, yes he is stubborn, and yes he may have the emotional range of a teaspoon. But most of the time when I see this stuff oriented at him, it's in reaction to something he did to Hermione, and people also conveniently ignore that Hermione also gave as good as she got. (Incidentally, this is also why I'm not the biggest fan of Romione, although I do think it works well enough in the canon setting.)

3. There should have been more “I went through similar shit” moments between Harry and Ginny in canon. I love their relationship, but I think if JKR had actually done proper set-up about them recovering from their shared trauma it would've worked /loads/ better. It also could've set up Harry's feelings better for her too, since while him going (from what I remember) “wow she just told me off that's hot” in OotP is hilarious, it's also a little stupid that that was what made him realize he liked her in that way.

4. Charlus and Dorea should have been James's parents. I know this is a relatively popular opinion, given that 1/2 of the fandom still operates under this fanon theory, but seriously. /Fleamont/? What the hell kind of Pureblood name -- no, scratch that, /early 1900's name/ is that? I know, JKR has other horrible names not befitting of certain time periods (/cough cough/ Jimbo fucking Blishwick /cough cough/), but Fleamont in particular just irks me to no end. Also, since the Blacks are probably related to virtually every other Pureblood, it only makes sense for them to be related to the Potters too somehow.

5. Upon reread, it's kind of obvious that there was gay subtext with Dumbledore in DH /at the very least/ and I'm tired of people saying there was not. “Closer than brothers”, hmm?? Dumbledore and Grindelwald planning to travel the world and (do world domination at the same time lol), that's not a little...on the nose? C'mon, if even Skeeter can pull enough shit about it to make it seem half-believable considering it happened /a century ago/, there's definitely something going on there.
