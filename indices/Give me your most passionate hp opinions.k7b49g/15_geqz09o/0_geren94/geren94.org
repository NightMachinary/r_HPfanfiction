Personally, I love Fleamont. I think the extended canon explanation was that it was a family name his mother insisted on, and young Fleamont arrived at Hogwarts ready to hex anyone who called him that.

In my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon][postwar fic]], Charlus and Dorea were Harry's great-grandparents, and Harry starts hearing stories from older wizards about his grandfather "Monty."

  ‘I never met your father, except perhaps when he was a baby, but I knew old Monty Potter. He gave me my first job, in fact.'

  ‘Really? What was he like? I know very little about him, except that he was successful in Potions and didn't like his given name.'

  Abbott laughed. ‘He certainly didn't. As I recall, your grandmother wanted to name your father Balthazar, after her grandfather, but Monty insisted he have an ordinary name instead. So he got his hands on a Muggle telephone directory and devised a charm to find the most common names. Then he gave your grandmother a list and said, “Pick one.”'
