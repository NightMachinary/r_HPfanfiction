-Time turners do not create alternate timelines. And no, they don't send someone to their own younger body either.

-Dumbledore has good intentions but he's a lot less good at a lot of things than he thinks he is. Very skilled at magic, teaching and to a certain degree politics, not very good at dealing with children's issues.

-The magical economy has a serious problem with intellectual property. Unlike with physical objects, magic doesn't really help a lot with writing things, and the much smaller population means both less people producing intellectual property and less people consuming so less copies sold. This means that books are crazy expensive, authors still don't make a lot of money (even star author Lockhart was now near JK Rowling rich), there's a very small number of new important works produced. The economics of the Daily Prophet are completely screwed up, no surprise its quality is shit.
