Ronald is an absolutely terrible person and character in my opinion because of his horrible character traits. And I'm tired of pretending he's not.

And first of all yes every character has flaws just like every human but as humans it's our job to work past and with those flaws to not be pieces of human garbage (like Ron).

He is shown as a lazy, irresponsible, jealous, and overall cruel person and far too many people ignore this because he's supposedly the most realistic character.

As far as I can tell he had less than ten redeeming moments in the story and that's off the top of my head.

Not only all of this but his most prominent characteristic is his jealousy something I understand he wants to outgrow his brothers shadows... But he never takes any steps to do so instead of at least try to be academically inclined or find something he's good at he fantasizes about quidditch and chess.

Now I read a story I don't remember the name sorry but it had harry going to durmstrang and it was amazing at the school he of course meets Victor crumb and we find that because Victor's real talent and real dream is to be a quidditch player professionally he is constantly working out and practicing over and over again.

And that's what ronald should be doing if he really wants to get out from his brothers not sit around doing nothing and being lazy or betraying harry because he got jealous of something harry never wanted.
