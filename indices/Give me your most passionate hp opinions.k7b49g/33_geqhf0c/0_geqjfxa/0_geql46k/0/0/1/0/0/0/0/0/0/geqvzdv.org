I do think that Ron eventually moved past his jealousy and struggles with self image. We see him achieve his own accomplishments, prefect and keeper. Then he literally plays a key role in defeating Voldemort at age 18.

Maybe it all means that even though he wanted all those things when he was 11, he grew out of it into his own person, rather than a kid that wanted to mirror his brothers.
