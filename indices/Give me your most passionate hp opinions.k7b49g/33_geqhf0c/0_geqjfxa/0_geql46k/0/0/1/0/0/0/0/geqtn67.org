Can you update me on where we learn he wants to go pro? I don't remember that.

Sure, he sees himself as quidditch captain and all that jazz in the mirror of erised but I think thats just a reflection of his insecurities. He's seen his brothers be prefect, head boy and quidditch captain, and thinks that's what he also need to be to ever compare to them. He measures his worth in his accomplishments and always sees himself coming up short.

I imagine it's not easy to feel like you're just average in a family of excelling people.
