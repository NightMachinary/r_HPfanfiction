It's a logical fallacy. I'll try my best to explain.

you made a claim that Ron didn't practice anything for quidditch before he got on the team. I presented evidence that he did. In response, you demanded evidence that he practiced quidditch at all before fifth year.

In effect it means you dismissed my evidence and demanded other evidence. You moved the goalposts to exclude my evidence.

I hope that makes some sense. I mostly meant it as a joke :)
