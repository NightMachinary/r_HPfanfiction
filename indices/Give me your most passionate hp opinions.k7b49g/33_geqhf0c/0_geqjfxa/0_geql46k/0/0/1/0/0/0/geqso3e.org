Hmm understandable but my main problem for the quidditch is we learn ronald wants to be a pro quidditch player in first year but why didn't he try out or practice the way he did in fifth year before then?

He could have been training just as hard ever since second year if he was a stickler for the rules which we know he's not he even had a best friend on the quidditch team he could practice with at any time, he also could have pulled a woods and studied the plays and formations but as far as we know he did none of that
