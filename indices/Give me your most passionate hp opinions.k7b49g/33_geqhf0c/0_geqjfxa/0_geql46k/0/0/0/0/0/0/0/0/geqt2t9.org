That depends on what you mean by them doing those things

Did I stick my nose up at people who just went home after the day and played games? No I didn't

But I did and still do stick my nose up at people who consistently get bad grades or do poorly at something yet refuse to do anything about it to improve even a little bit and I do it even more if they decide instead of doing their own mediocre work they push it off on someone else
