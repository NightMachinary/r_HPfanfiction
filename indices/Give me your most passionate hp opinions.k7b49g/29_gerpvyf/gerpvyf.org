Dumbledore isn't as evil as fan fan fiction likes to portray him as.

Snape is a complicated character. He was a bastard to kids, because he could be, but his childhood was messed up as well, I'd love more stories that deal with both.

More complex characters outside of Gryffindor. I love Slughorn's character, because he's a Slytherin, he isn't evil but he isn't completely pure either.
