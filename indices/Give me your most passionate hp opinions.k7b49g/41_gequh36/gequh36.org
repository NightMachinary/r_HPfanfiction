1. To brew Polyjuice the hair has to be given willingly. (Reason: There would be way to many cases of mistaken identity and using hair of people for nefarious reasons)
2. Dumbledore should have been thrown through the veil (Reason: Hes Evil. I could list all the things he has done but lets just say hes a terrible waste of fresh air)
3. Hogwarts is a shit school (Reason: Can't hold a teacher for shit in DADA, They employ a ghost who is on repeat, they have a dangerous killer forest but don't really do much about it, All the dark magic this from the ministry really is like book burning, Teachers support racism and bullying.)
4. The Ministry can't track magic to a fine degree like most think (Reason: There is no way they have anything at the ministry that allows them to know when magic is uses and exactly where at all times. They let purebloods do magic all summer long and I think they must put up some kind of alert ward over muggle houses for muggleborns.)
5. Wizards and witches steal food from muggles
6. House Elves are slaves
7. Hogwarts students are perverts and the teachers don't care, broom closet anyone?
