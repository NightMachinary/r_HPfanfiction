  No investigation into Cedric Diggory's death or Barty Crouch's death.

Just look how modern societies "investigate" murders by Nazis and you got your answer. Politicians use every resource they can to prevent people from believing the far-right is active, organized and murdering, and that includes shutting down or impeding investigations. The worst example of this is the German NSU murder series which was treated by blaming the victims for allegedly being involved in gang activity, while far-right terrorism was fast shut down. It only came to light when the two dudes of the trio shot each other and set their van on fire.
