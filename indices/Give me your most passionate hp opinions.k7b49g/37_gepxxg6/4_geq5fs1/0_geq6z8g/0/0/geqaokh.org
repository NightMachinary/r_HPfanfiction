My only problem with the time travel is the fact that they allowed a 13 year old, a â€˜smart' one but a 13 year old nonetheless, to have a time turner. I'd have been happier if it was established that this was a common precedent since other students managed to take the same number if subjects as Hermione. I have trouble believing, in hindsight, that the time turner was even necessary for Hermione to take all the classes in the first place. That if she wanted to, she could have taken the subjects as extracurricular Classes over lunchtime or after school. Thats what I did for my Latin and my Classical Studies classes when I was at school
