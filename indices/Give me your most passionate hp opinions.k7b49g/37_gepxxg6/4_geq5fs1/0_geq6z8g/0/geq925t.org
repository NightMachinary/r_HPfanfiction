ohhhh that makes a bit more sense. My only complaint is naming a kid after Snape. I think that's like the story being like he is good now. I think they should have just told you his story and kept Harry's feelings about him ambiguous. Let the audience draw their own conclusions.

And I dont see anything wrong with the time travel in the story I personally liked it. But alot of people get frustrated because its conviently not used again or they think time travel as a concept existing before the time turners get destroyed overcomplicates the world. Which I do sorta see where they are coming from. And some people just don't like time travel so maybe it's just that.
