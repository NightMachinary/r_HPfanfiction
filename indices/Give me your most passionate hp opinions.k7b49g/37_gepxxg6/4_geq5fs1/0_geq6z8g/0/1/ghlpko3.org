The way I choose to see Albus Severus's name is Harry's last defiance to them: Proof that their names /can/ be associated with pure, good-hearted people. A kind of a start-over for those names - a chance at being part of a new person. And less importantly, though still kind of significant, proof that even though Dumbledore manipulated him and Snape bullied him, doesn't mean he can't bear to think of them.
