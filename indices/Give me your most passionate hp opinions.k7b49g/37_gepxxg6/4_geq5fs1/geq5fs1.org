1. Harry Potter is more of a soft magic system I don't think it's bad. But considering there was alot more combat in the last few books I think more focus on combat focused magic could have been useful.

2. I do think if Harry's classmates had been more integrated with the plot things could have been better. The last book especially would be more intense since you'd be invested in so many more characters. You'd see more arcs pay off.

3. I'm not entirely sure what you mean here I usually see white washing in context of putting white actors in roles that would be better suited to someone not white.

4. Hated the ending because of Pettigrew getting away? Because of time travel? Because Lupin left?

5. No investigation was because of ministry corruption so if you hate that plot I can see why this frustrates you but I don't think it's inherently bad.

6. I actually also hate how the romance was handled

7. I mean its kind of true but they are 11. They may tire out quicker. But when you are 16 or 17...ya that's true.

8. I don't think anyone likes Umbridge

9. I basically ignore everything outside the first series.

And I agree that the fanfics are great
