JKR for all her faults didn't just copy the one ring. That's what we call a fantasy trope, and it happens quite a lot it lots of different stories not just HP. It's also a common theme throughout British and Irish folklore. Its a bit like saying that The Sword of Gryffindor was copied, because Magic Swords with similar properties and symbolic means, including but not limited to Excalibur, Caledfwlch, Caladbolg, Dyrnwyn, the Claidheamh Soluis, and Fragarach all existed first
