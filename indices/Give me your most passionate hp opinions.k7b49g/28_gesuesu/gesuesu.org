Albus Dumbledore is a fucking /asshole/.

Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but who the hell sets an orphan's wardrobe (/that holds all of his possessions/) on fire!? Doesn't matter if the fire didn't do anything, /he still set the wardrobe on fire!/

Like, who the hell gave Dumbledore the job to introduce new students to Hogwarts?
