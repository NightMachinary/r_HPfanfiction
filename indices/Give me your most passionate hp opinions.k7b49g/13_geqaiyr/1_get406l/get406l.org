I read a really cool fic that made it so that there used to be trade guilds and trade schools and Hogwarts is more of a prep school for the richer clientele rather than the other schools. This also leads to the idea that one of the reasons that the Weasleys are so poor is because they're spending so much money on tuition so that their children can get the best education possible. Which kinda makes Ron seem so shitty since he doesn't put much effort into his school work.
