- Draco needed a redemption arc in cannon. I don't even like Draco that much in concept, but you don't set up a rival-type character and develop them as much as Draco, and then not do anything with them.

- B team is best team. I love the Golden Trio, but I will always find the idea of Neville, Luna, and whoever else you want to be the third member of the B-team (often Ginny, but she seems too connected to the Golden Trio to count as true B-team material.) stepping up while the big 3 are otherwise occupied and just doing their job infinitely more fascinating.

- A Very Potter Musical. Just everything here. I think they made Voldemort a more interesting villain, though less frightening, I think that Harry's portrayal as a boy obsessed with his own fame who needs to get over that is brilliant, I think the show is by far funnier than the books, I think that the songs are fantastic, I think it's criminally underwritten for in the fanfic community, and after JK's comments about trans women, I definitely feel better about enjoying it than the books.
