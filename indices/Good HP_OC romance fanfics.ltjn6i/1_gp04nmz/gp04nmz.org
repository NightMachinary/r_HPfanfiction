linkffn(Runaway by Scriblerian) is Harry/Witch!OC. The story is pretty good but you'll have to deal with the OCs surname being Carrows instead of Carrow. Also for some reason her father is Alecto instead of Amycus while her mother is called Andromeda(?)

linkffn(Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89) is a Harry/Muggle!OC. The OC is the girl working in the cafe in the beginning of the 6th film

linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss by Ecmm) is also Harry/Muggle!OC. I didn't like it very much but it gets recommended often enough, plus there's really not all that many fics to chose from
