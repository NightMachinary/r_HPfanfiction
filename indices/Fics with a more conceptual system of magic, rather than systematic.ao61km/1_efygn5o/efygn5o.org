There's a balance to strike, too. Canon magic is a mixture of both- you have your conceptual "Power of Love" stuff (which I also really like, it's a shame when you read fics that just scoff at the idea altogether) as well as your "Wingardium Leviosa is Swish and Flick, and make sure you're saying it correctly" and the idea that some wizards are literally more powerful than others- partially through natural ability, partially through study. So any fic that wants to delve into the Harry Potter magic system in detail needs to reconcile both aspects. I like conceptual magic, but I don't like it when it essentially turns into wishcraft- that is to say, you cannot make every single magical effect happen just because you wish hard enough that it does. And I love RPGs, but outside of stories that are pretty explicit LitRPGs, fanfiction that tries to abstract away the nuances of HP magic and purely systematize everything feels even worse.

HPMOR linkffn(5782108) gets a lot of flak, but it again merges the ideas. You get some "magic is controlled by levers and hard rules setup by Atlantis" like Harry/Hermione's experiments, or Horcruxes dealing with memories rather than souls. But you also get stuff like "acorns absorb sunlight to grow, so I can use them to make a potion that 'releases' that stored energy as a flash of light."

Outside of Harry Potter magic, conceptual systems are obviously very popular in general- stuff like Type Moon/FSN magic, or A Certain Magical Index. So basically any crossover/fic that lifts ideas from FSN (and there are quite a lot, of varying quality) leans Harry Potter magic in the conceptual direction as well.

There are also a ton of fics that bring up or use magic in an interesting way, many of which 'feel' decently canon compliant, when the goal isn't actually to delineate the strict rules. Magicks of the Arcane comes to mind, linkffn(8303194)
