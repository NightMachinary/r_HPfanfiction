Dude, I've read many of your posts over the years and can absolutely guarantee you that you've put way more thought into HP's magical system than Rowling ever did. With that kind of attitude, you can 'write 30,000+ words' about practically everything.

It's not a statement about Rowling's ingenuity and the quality of the canonical magic system, it's the statement about /your/ ingenuity and the quality of /your headcanon/.

That is to say, the magic in the original books isn't /bad/ -- it's pretty good and serves it's own purpose well. But, at least in my opinion, it's not as good as people make it out to be.
