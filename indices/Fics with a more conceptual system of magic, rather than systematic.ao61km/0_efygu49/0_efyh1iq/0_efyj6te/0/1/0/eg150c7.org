Sure, but it's not utter garbage the way some people make it out to be either. Part of what made Taure's magic canon document so interesting is that you see literally hundred of posts/fics basically bashing on Rowling's magic system, whether directly or indirectly, so the defense and breakdown of the canon magic system feels unique.
