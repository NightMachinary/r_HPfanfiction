The thing is that in the case of flat earth, some external data will disrupt your system based on a neat set of observations - which hasn't really happened with Taure's headcanon document.

If you really think that, then I'm not sure you've read or understood it, as it's rather neutral in a lot of things, and investigates the magic system not only in-universe, but also how and why it works well from a writing standpoint.

I do think that Rowling had a sort of "Depth by allusion" concept in mind, even if she didn't name it that way. It is simply too often where it happens in canon, wjere we are teased some more and deeper magic, yet never get to explore it.
