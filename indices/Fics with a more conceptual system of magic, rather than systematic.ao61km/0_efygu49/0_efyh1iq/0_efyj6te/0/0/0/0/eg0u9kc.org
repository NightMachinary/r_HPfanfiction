  The thing is that in the case of flat earth, some external data will disrupt your system based on a neat set of observations - which hasn't really happened with Taure's headcanon document.

I don't think that would apply here since Achille isn't saying that Taure's document is inherently wrong in any fashion. Seems to me like he's saying Taure thought it through much more than Rowling did, and he added layers of meaning and depth that she didn't mean or have in mind.

Assuming she kept things simple and didn't outright contradict herself, it wouldn't that hard to build a deeper and more involved headcanon on the magical world.

Anyways, I think the point of the specific post you responded to was that "I've written a lot about it" isn't a meaningful way of demonstrating that JK's magical system has depth.

I'm not saying it doesn't, cause I think that's up for interpretation and isn't worth fighting each other over, but that wasn't much of a defence of it.
