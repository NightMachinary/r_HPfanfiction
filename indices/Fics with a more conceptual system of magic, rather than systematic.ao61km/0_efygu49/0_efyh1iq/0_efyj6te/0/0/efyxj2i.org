Depth and quantity are different things. I could set a random text generator to generate ten thousand pages' worth of /words/, and with a little imagination you could write a very learned study on the significance of various phrases within it, yet it would still utterly lack depth.

I think there's a very fine argument to be made that it's the same thing with the /HP/ magic system: heaps and heaps of fundamentally meaningless data.

I greatly admire your take on the magic system, you do understand. But I see it as akin to the work of that mathematician who proposed revised laws of physics coherent with the various tenets of the Flat Earth hypothesis. You can be very clever and find a compelling self-consistent system that matches the data, yes. But you won't convince me that the original source of that data (Flat Earthers; J.K. Rowling) actually had that system in mind when they came up with said data.
