Add to that Dorcas Meadows, who is killed by Voldemort himself: either she has a lot of political pull or is magically quite powerfull (Voldemort is not seen killing that much himself, he mainly sicks his DE when the target death do not have a huge meaning for him) ; either would point to an older witch.
