There is nothing in canon stating their ages, so everyone likes to group them together. It's easier than making up an entire year's worth of characters for a fanfic, and the possibilities for emotionally impactful scenes increases.

Personally, I thought Frank and Alice were a couple of years older than MWPP, Amos Diggory was closer to Molly and Arthur (maybe even older).
