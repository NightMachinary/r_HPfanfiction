That would be amusing. Harry goes all money hungry & Hermione goes Socialist.

I think there was once a fic where Harry "accepts" an inheritance/lordship and it turns out to be a shitty falling down castle in a swamp that every Potter before him had been too smart to claim cause they knew it would end up costing more money than it was worth.
