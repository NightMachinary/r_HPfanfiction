Malfoy pulled Fudge's strings, Sirius said his grandfather practically /bought/ an Order of Merlin /first class./

The Wizengamot seems to be corrupt and open to pureblood prejudices for a long time, many of the darker purebloods seem to be from old rich families.

I am not talking about fanon "Lordship" I am talking about the real world situation of rich people manipulating the government to get richer. They don't control the Ministry directly, they lobby and bribe and do all the stuff we see happen today.

Almost every government today is an oligarchy, it's just cloaked in democracy.
