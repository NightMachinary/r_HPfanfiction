Thanks! I don't mind post or pre or without Voldemort, I really just meant stories with a woman and her story as the main character, rather than as a side kick to Harry. I love The Arithmancer, and Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, but those stories revolve around Hermione helping Harry take Voldemort down.
