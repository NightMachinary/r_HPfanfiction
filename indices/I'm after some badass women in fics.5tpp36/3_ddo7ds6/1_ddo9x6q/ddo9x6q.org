Loved both the AQ series, and The Changeling. I was gutted the changeling isn't finished, because that's the Ginny I want. Loved Belial, but had trouble remembering the plot when updates came, so I'm waiting for a whole bunch of new updates, then I'll do a re-read.

I unfortunately really couldn't get into the pureblood pretense. Just isn't my thing, even though I enjoy girls pretending to be boys stories.
