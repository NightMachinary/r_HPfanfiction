I haven't read it in a while, but I think Applied Cultural Anthropology is one of the commonly recced fics for this sort of thing. linkffn(9238861) It's humour, but The Darkest Art probably fits here too. linkffn(10742358)

Otherwise, there's A Matter of House, linkffn(9498559). It's focused on Bellatrix (and to an extent, Molly) if the two were sorted into Hufflepuff.

I can think of a few others at the moment, but they're mostly strongly AU or genderbent.
