Seconded. I've seen far too many fics that have Hermione as the POV character, but then she has Harry as her primary focus and no goals outside that.

Similarly, linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) has as POV character a Ginny who's pretty effective in a civilian role, specifically philology. Unfortunately, it turns out in the end that her crush on Harry is her sole motivation for pretty much everything.
