It's an interesting idea, but doesn't feel like a very plausible one to me. Isn't Skeeter a beetle animagus? Or some kind of bug anyway? I think that was revealed at some point and knowing her, she used that form to her advantage all the time to eavesdrop in on interesting people for a story. So, surely, she'd be a super old lady by the time the books are over with all of the excitement going on in the books.
