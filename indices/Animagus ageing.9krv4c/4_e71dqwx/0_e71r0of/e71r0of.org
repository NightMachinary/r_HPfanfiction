It really appeals to me. Of course within canon it's totally implausible, but I kind of wish it had been the case (it might have stopped Pettigrew from being weird enough that he decided to live as a rat for thirteen years). I'd love to find a story where it was the case, it would definitely make me feel happier about why there are so few animagi.
