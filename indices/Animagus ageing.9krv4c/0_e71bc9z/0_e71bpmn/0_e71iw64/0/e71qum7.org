If you only become one during wartime it could be incredibly useful for escaping/spying. There's also the question of whether it might have been of more use in previous eras. In say a period where wizards are out in the open having access to powers like that could be far more useful than it is now that they are in hiding and have a magical government for clearing up people's minds.
