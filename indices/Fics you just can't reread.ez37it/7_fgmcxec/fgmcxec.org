It has happened to me with the fics I read wehn I had started reading fanfic. I actually can't even remember the names of some of them now. But when I do remember what they were about, I cringe. I've recently remembered a fic from another fandom I loved and I do know why I loved it and might even check if it has been updated, that is, if I can get over my shame lol. A lot of it has also to do with the fact that I'm no longer interested in certain things. Now I'm just waiting for my interest in HP to vanish. I don't know if I'd delete those fics from my favourites list, because then I'm bound to keep thinking about them simply because I deleted them. But I know I wouldn't reread fics that have the sort of characterization I dislike. I might read that fic once, but I just know it will be the first and last time I'm reading it.
