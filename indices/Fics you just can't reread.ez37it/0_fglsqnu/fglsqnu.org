I'd say that there are two kinds of stories you can't reread.

1. The ones which were fun, but the jokes/twists simply don't have the same kind of effect if you already know them. A lot of comedy fics suffer from this, because while they still make you smile, you aren't laughing at the punchlines anymore. Or mysteries where the tension isn't catching you anymore since you know how it will end. I'd still keep them around in your favourites, even if only for the sake of the authors (since Follows/Favs make your stories easier to find). After all, you still like the premise, you've just read that fic enough times that reading it again feels pointless.

2. The stories you can't enjoy because your tastes have changed. Maybe you've come to see a character in a new light. Maybe you have read too many examples of a trope and are now sick of it and/or the characters involved. Since you no longer enjoy reading them or are even wondering how you could ever enjoy them, I'd say removing them is fair.
