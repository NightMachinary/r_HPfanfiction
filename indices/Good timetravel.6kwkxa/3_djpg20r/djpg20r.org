linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is the best time-travel story in my opinion. fem!Harry travels 7000 years back in time. It has scenes from her return to modern times, and scenes of how she lived all that time.\\
If you haven't read it, I totally recommend it.

linkffn(Oh God Not Again! By Sarah1281) is the best fun time-travel story. It revists canon in a beautiful way, and is always good for a laugh.

If you want more recs, then please define a bit more what you want. (How do you like your Harry? What would you like the fic to focus on?)
