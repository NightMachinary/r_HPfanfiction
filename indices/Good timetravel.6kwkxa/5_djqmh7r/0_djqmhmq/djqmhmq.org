#+begin_quote
  Time travel, AU. When all that Harry Potter ever loved is taken from him, when he cannot fight alone against the tide of Voldemort's evil, he has to take his one last chance. A lonely, damaged Harry returns to his past, in order to save his future. Rated M for violence, death and trauma. Will eventually include Harry/Ginny.
