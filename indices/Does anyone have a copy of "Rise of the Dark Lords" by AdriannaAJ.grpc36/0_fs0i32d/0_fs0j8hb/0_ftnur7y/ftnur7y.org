You could also give The Wayback Machine a try for future reference. I already checked every chapter in this case and couldn't get any of them to load, but it's an archivist site aswell. And it could be in the re-packed version of the FFN download, if it was written before 2016, if you have a PC and want to sift though the hundred or so gigabytes of that, unsorted. I have the link to that, but the mods don't like it brought up, so I won't post that link here.

Please note that the only reason I brought it up is because I believe at this time that the fic could have been lost to a server side purge. The reason that the mods don't like that download is that people use it to get around Rule 6. That's not my intent. If the author was the one to delete it, and not ffn, please tell me so so I can stop giving you helpful advice.
