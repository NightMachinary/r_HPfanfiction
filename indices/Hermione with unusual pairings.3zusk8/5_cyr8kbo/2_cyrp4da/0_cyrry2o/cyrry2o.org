The Viktor fic took a few tries for me to actually get sucked in, but once it did, I enjoyed it. That Hermione is far more of an OC than anything, but I thought the story itself was good. I thought the percentages might be a good idea, because some of us who ship a certain ship might be a bit vocal about it, making it seem like there's more out there than there is!
