Hey, what do you know, something I can do! How unusual is unusual for you? I'll break this down by pairing, and include what percentage of completed fics on FFN they encompass. These are all complete, none abandoned, and should all be above 50k words. I believe *all* of these that have an age gap use time travel to eliminate that age gap, though there may be a bit of an age gap at some point before or after that time travel.
