[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6713559/1/The-Soul-Mate-Law][Hermione/Crookshanks]] - Sorry, I had to...

A slightly more serious suggestion: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5497778/1/Bookends][Hermione/Arthur]]

if you want well written fics I would suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5869599/ShayaLonnie][Shayalonnie]], so far she's completed a sirimione, a dramione and a jamione story and she's working on pairings with theo nott, remus and neville.

Aside from her own stories she also has a great list of recommended fics on her tumblr: [[http://shayalonnie.tumblr.com/fic-recs]]
