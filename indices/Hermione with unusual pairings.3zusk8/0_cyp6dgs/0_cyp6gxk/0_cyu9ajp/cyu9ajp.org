My reply to [[/u/Midnightnox]] reminded me, I forgot one of my favourite authors, even though her stories are shorter than I'd like: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/429821/sarhea]]

Hermione with Spock, Smaug (yes, the dragon), Percy, Batman, Sherlock, Salazar Slytherin, Regulus, Rabastan Lestrange, Loki. I think all of those count as unusual too ;)
