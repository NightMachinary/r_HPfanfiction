2. To add more on the advices, I think a passage or a section in the story should also suffice, whether that be a description or dialogue. Choose your best judgement I guess; try to choose one that can easily hook readers in and provide an essence of what the story is about. Try to make it short if you can.

Ex:

  /It was nothing so elegant as fucking, the first time they came together. It was teeth just a little too sharp--- against a collarbone, on the right-side curve of a jaw, drawing blood from the plushest part of a bottom lip. It was the doorframe digging into the curve his spine was making of its own volition: closer, harder, more. Two hundred pain receptors per square inch in the human body and it was nothing but background noise in the explosion, the revelation, that was Harry Potter's body against his./

3. Do whatever is best for you, honestly. For me, I prefer stories that I know are completed or about to be. I think you should have an idea of what direction your story will go and how to sufficiently get there, first and foremost.
