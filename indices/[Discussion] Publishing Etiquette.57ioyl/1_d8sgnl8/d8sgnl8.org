1. Round here is sometimes good, but most will want a description of the story and a sample of your work before committing.
2. Agree with Murven.
3. Yes, that's fine, as long as you're committing to actually finishing the story. It can be easy to run out of steam and abandon it early. Make sure you have a solid plan and enough time to provide regular updates. A brief hiatus is fine, but months between updates leaves people confused and annoyed. For example, I have a couple of chapters of my next WIP written, but I won't start posting until I know I've got more time to write as life is hectic atm.
4. I don't like authors notes and only include them when I think it's absolutely necessary - such as to clarify something that keeps coming up in reviews, or as a final "thanks for reading" on the final chapter of a big work. But everyone's different and you may prefer more regular interaction, teasing about the next chapter, asking discussion questions to prompt reviews, etc. The point is they're not required or even expected, so it's up to you.
5. I tend to aim for at least 5k, but I think as long as you're over 3k you're fine. I don't think I would ever go over 10k in a chapter or one-shot, but that's just me. As long as it feels natural and you're not just trying to pad it out for the sake of the word count.

Also, on your last point - you don't have to read more fanfic if you don't want to. I don't read much at all because I'm so picky and intolerant of nonsense. I actually think coming into it with little fanfic experience is probably better - you won't have picked up bad habits. Don't worry too much about etiquette; the fact that you care and you've made such a thoughtful post shows you'll be fine.
