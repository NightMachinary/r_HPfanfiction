1) You can ask here, you can post on sites like the DLP Forum, or you can look for a beta reader in the FFN community.

2) Tell me, in short words, whats going to happen without spoiling anything. Add Pairing if its a romance, give me a hint to the plot if its an adventure,...

3) Thats cool. If you want to uphold a regular publishing schedule, you may want to have a backlog before you post.

4) You can explain some reasoning. I sometimes use them to establish some changes. For example "Bellatrix is 5 years younger". Tidbits like that. Also a "Thanks for reading" never goes amiss. But anything over 4 lines is too much IMO. Keep it short.

5) My preferred length is somewhere around 6k. But honestly, it doesn't matter. Whatever feels good to you.
