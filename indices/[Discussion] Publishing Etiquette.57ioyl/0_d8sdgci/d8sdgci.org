2) What I look for in a description is 20 word summary of the story, it needs to convey what you(the author) think is the essence of your story. A good summery should also IMO hook a reader inn and want them to read the story. A few short words to set up the story like AU, SI, cannon compliant etc. can be added to the start/end of the summary. Like this from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][Taure]] or a shorter one from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry][R-dude]].

3) Yes. Some will not read unfinished stories, but many posts stories one chapter at a time. I think this is more of a preference from the author, you should do what feels most comfortable for you.

4) To me author notes are a way for the writer to interact with the reader a bit outside the story without destroying the submersion in the story. They should however be used sparsely and with great care, and never ever, *ever* be used to reply to reviews. A few lines at the start/end of a chapter is fine by me, some do not like them at all. That said I think they add something relevant to stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] in which Steelbadger's notes at the end of a chapter, add some context for the reader with limited knowledge of The Lord of The Rings and The Silmarillion.

5) I think in the range of 2k -15k a chapter is ok. I prefer them to be in the 5k-15k range, but I think the most important thing is for the chapter to end in an natural way. Be it a cliffhanger or a change of scenes.
