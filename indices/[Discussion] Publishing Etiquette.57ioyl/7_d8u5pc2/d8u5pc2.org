  1) Where is it best to look for someone to proof read my work? I kind of need advice on both the content of my story and the grammar/ english, which is a definite weakpoint of mine.

Finding a good beta can be difficult. When you find one treat them like the precious, delicate flower they are. Until then you can mention on your profile and author's note that you are looking for one, and use an online editing tool (I use prowritingaid but there are others) to proof your chapters. In fact, do that before you send work to your beta anyway.

  3) Is it okay to publish your story with just a couple of chapters written or should I write a few more before I start uploading them.
#+end_quote

Lots of people do that. I have always had a story finished before starting to post, but that does seem to be a minority approach in fanfiction.

  4) Author's Notes, simply what is the point? Is there such thing as a good authors note?
#+end_quote

Personally I'm not a fan; I tend to skip them when I'm reading and I keep my own to a minimum. Judging by how often I get asked a question that is already answered in my own author's notes, most readers ignore them,

  5) Word Count per chapter, i'm aiming for around 4000, while still encompassing a complete event in the story. is this fairly accurate.
#+end_quote

Sounds fine to me.

  I'm aware I need to read more fanfiction to get a better hold over the conventions/etiquette

Useful to know. Don't read fanfiction for quality - some is good but some is terrible and most is mediocre at best. Reviews/favourites are not a reliable indication of quality. It's useful to know the conventions. You will find that most of it falls into a specific set of themes and doesn't deviate much. If you're writing outside those conventions, good for you - that's where most of the good stuff is - but be aware it wll be harder to find readers. Do read and review though. When you start posting, you'll understand how precious those things are. I can't get into the mindset of fanfic writers who seem to think reviews are their own god-given right when they don't leave any themselves. Entitlement or something I suppose. Learn to give critique if you don't already do that. Learn to take it too.
