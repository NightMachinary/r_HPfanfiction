*Re.1:* fanfiction.net has an area dedicated to beta-reading, so if you are using that site you might want to check it out. Outside of things like that, it's pretty much just finding someone somewhere. I do know some literary forums do have their own beta-reader areas and stuff but the ones I am at all aware of do not dabble in beta-reading stuff that's copyrighted (though DLP might or might not have that, I haven't checked; keep in mind though that they can be quite ... brutal, so don't go to them if you aren't sufficiently sturdy).

*Re.2:* It depends on what your description is. Is it a fanfiction.net-style summary, a book-style synopsis (half to three quarters of the back page of a book, so a few times longer than what fanfiction.net offers), or maybe an actual excerpt from the story? With each of those people are looking for something else, though obviously it's always about pulling the reader in, making them interested in what you have. Just please do not use the words “what if” if it is not a part of an excerpt, as to many those words are incredibly off-putting (and they are also lazy, as you can ask the question you'd attach to that more creatively).

*Re.3:* Both are fine; if you are fine with posting it all at once then do so, and if you prefer to post as you write then do that instead. Just please, if you end up posting it chapter-by-chapter and happen to not be able to get to the end, be honest with your readers; you don't really /owe/ it to them as it is since you are writing for yourself, but there is a certain integrity in actually admitting to the people waiting for your creations that you can't or otherwise won't continue making them if it happens instead of lying to them about how it's being written (ETA: Never) and getting angry when someone suggests it to be abandoned.

*Re.4:* Yes, actually. Assuming you use them properly, “author's notes” are the fanfiction equivalent of a foreword. So many ... authors use them as a ... mentally incapacitated version of a chat channel, or even worse as something to put inside the actual chapters, so people forgot what author's notes are supposed to be about. The thing is, though, that with any story that is being published chapter-by-chapter an author's note that has its own chapter like a proper foreword will stick out and probably not in a good way (not to mention the hassle of updating something that's already uploaded), and anything longer you are trying to communicate will automatically be treated as bad by many. So while there's nothing /inherently/ wrong with author's notes, they are quite easy to mishandle if you do not know what you are doing; also, a small tip: if you are publishing chapter-by-chapter and need to include a longer author's note, instead upload it externally (as a text document, or as its own “story”, or maybe as the perpetually last chapter of the story it is a part of) and simply link to that. And another tip: never, ever, defend something you wrote in your author's note; if it's bad enough that you need to defend it then it's bad enough that it shouldn't be in the story, it's as simple as that; and if instead it is controversial then rather than /defend/ it you should /warn/ people and let them decide for themselves. And obviously, if it's not story-related then it does not belong in an author's note; if people want general-purpose words and recommendations from you they will go to your profile so things that are not needed by the story go there instead. That said, things like updating the story's rating do very much go in author's notes; whether you disclose the reason for the change or simply give a warning and let them find out is up to you, though.

A small addendum: The same problem as above (mishandling) applies to disclaimers. Though often enough used as a poor man's attempt at a joke, they should be clear and concise and serious because they do actually have a use. Namely, they are used to disavow your rights to any copyrighted stuff so that you'd be able to claim your rights to anything that is not copyrighted (which you do right after the disclaimer, optimally; never in the actual disclaimer). Obviously they also have the purpose of showing that no, you are not doing it for money and stuff, but that one is pretty much a technicality as the existence of fanfiction from the legal standpoint is weird and it all relies on a tacit agreement from the original author so if you pissed someone off enough (by openly making a profit off of copyrighted stuff, for example) that they'd send you a C&D it would not matter anyway.

*Re.5:* The rule of the thumb is to count one thousand words as 2--3 pages and aim for the desired page length when splitting chapters. As such, a few thousand words is a fine length. Page count of a few dozen pages isn't all that bad too if you /have/ to go there, but with many fanfics that have chapters of such length it is fairly clear that those chapters could have been split and only aren't because of the weird preconception that longer is always better.

*Addition:* A major “do” is “research your stuff”. Regardless of what people often put in their own fanfiction, if you want to write a story that is not a caricature for the sake of comedy then you should not do certain things with the characters which means you should research them properly instead of relying on whatever you find in the majority of fictions (a fine example is “Greater Good Dumbledore”: in fanfiction he often enough is like that, in canon he is anything /but/ that). Likewise, make sure you do your research as far as the spelling is concerned; typos and wrong capitalisation can spoil enjoyment of an otherwise good story, and with many of stories riddled with those it's clear that the issue lies not in a lack of a beta reader (though the presence of one /might have/ helped) but rather in the author blatantly not giving a single damn.
