2) summary should include at least 2 'unique selling points' of a fanfic. If the hook is too vague, that's when folks add tags to the end to let readers know what the story's about (ex. Slytherin!Harry or Casefic or Weasley!Family). If your hook doesn't include the identity of the main character or hints about the plot/genre, add some tags.

4) authors notes are for disclaimers/copyright. I know FFNet asks for an 'I don't own the original property' disclaimer. Make sure to explicitly claim the original aspects of your story (like original characters or AU situations); believe it or not, there are sites that steal and repost fanfiction on their sites for profit. Also if your update is way darker or smuttier than the previous chapters, your AN should mention that the new chapter will have some darker or more difficult themes so readers know that there's a change in theme/rating. (If you change the rating to Mature in the middle of a story, readers/subscribers won't be notified of the change.) also if your update schedule will be changing, mention that in the AN so readers know you're not abandoning the story.
