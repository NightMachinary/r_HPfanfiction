Thanks! You've been very helpful.

As for whether I should upload as I go along. I've given it a bit of thought and I've decided to only upload when I've finished. ( a long way off yet) That way I can avoid reviewers having an effect on the story which I'm not a fan of, it's also means I don't have to worry about disappointing people if I do have to take a break for whatever reason.
