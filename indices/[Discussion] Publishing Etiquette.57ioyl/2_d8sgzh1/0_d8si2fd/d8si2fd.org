One of the benefits to writing the whole story before posting is that you can edit it as a whole piece of fiction. If halfway through writing your storyline changes (which is common, if you have a good grasp on your characters they can start 'running' the story and you may find that what you planned would not be what your characters would actually do), you can go back and add foreshadowing to make the story more coherent.
