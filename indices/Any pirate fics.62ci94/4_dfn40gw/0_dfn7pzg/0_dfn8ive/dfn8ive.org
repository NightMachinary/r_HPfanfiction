Pretty good name for a hook hand kinda pirate. Although that is another thing I've always wanted, Griphook to have a shitton of various hooks he uses. Like a murder hook, a paper sorting hook (I imagine something like a paper spike), etc. I don't care if it is the same hook all the time, so long as it is referred to as thus.

Yes I know that's something weird to want. But dammit, I do want it.
