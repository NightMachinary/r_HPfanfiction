  Pirate!AU - Six months ago, Hermione wouldn't have believed that she would end up as a pirate, but now she can't imagine anything else. When the crew stumble across Captain Sirius' ex-lover, Remus, Hermione starts to doubt her place on board and at Sirius' side. That is, unless they can work something out. Written for Firefly.
