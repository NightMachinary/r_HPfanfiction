"Bone of father, god Hermione, you know that James' body hadn't fully decomposed? I had to boil the flesh off!" Ron said, dropping the bone unceremoniously into the pot. "Blood of enemy...wasn't it kind of Malfoy to donate some blood, Harry?"

"Sure was, Ron. Poor Malfoy, tripping and falling on a knife in the middle of the hallway," Harry said, in a homonculi that had been hastily conjured the trio had found out that horcruxes only preserved one's spirit and not body.

"And flesh of servant," Hermione said as she peeled some of her skin off before quickly applying dittany. "You owe me a case of butterbeers, Harry!"

"Weren't you the one that wanted to try killing me?" Harry asked indignantly.

Edit: Instead of "she peeled some of her skin off", an alternative could be "she peeled some of Dobby's skin off".

Props for a good prompt. I'd note that Hermione would probably use a more potent (magical) poison, though, as mundane venoms and poisons don't pose lethal threats to wizards. It'd probably just hurt Harry a lot.

Comments on my response for those interested in what I see as the long-term ramifications:

The poison would probably mean Harry's body becomes inhospitable for his spirit and that he'd become a spirit as well, hence the resurrection ritual. Long term, it'd probably be a disadvantage as Harry would lose his mother's sacrifice, meaning that because Voldemort and him no longer share blood and Harry's mother's sacrifice, Voldemort can kill Harry.
