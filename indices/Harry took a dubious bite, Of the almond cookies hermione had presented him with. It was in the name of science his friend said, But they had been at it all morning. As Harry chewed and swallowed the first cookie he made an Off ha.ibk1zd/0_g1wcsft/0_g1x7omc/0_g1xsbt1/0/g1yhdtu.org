Where's that from? It's not in the series. Pottermore?

Also, surviving impacts that would crack a skull - or surviving injuries that would leave people braindamaged or dead - is something that happens in almost every action movie. Few authors or directors actually care for realism in that area. See: "Knocking out enemies". Not to mention that a scorpion's sting can greatly vary in strength.
