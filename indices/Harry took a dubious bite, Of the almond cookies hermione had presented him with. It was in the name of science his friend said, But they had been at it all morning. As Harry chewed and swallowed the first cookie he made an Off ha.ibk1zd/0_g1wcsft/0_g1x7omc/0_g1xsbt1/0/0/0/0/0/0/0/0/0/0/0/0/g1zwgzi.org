  Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit --- he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.

Not all the ingredients, no. But they certainly got to take home the lionfish and belladonna. I never said that they regularly ingest poison but that accidents occur and someone would certainly have been injured. And I don't think Harry has bezoars in his potions kit or that the burrow has a potions lab complete with bezoars. And again, Harry would survive venom a muggle wouldn't.

Very impressive of Switzerland. Must have been an interesting childhood. I still think there's a different between a rifle and poisons which can be accidentally ingested far more often. In any event, the rifle comparison might still be apt, accidental gun deaths exist. A cursory search revealed gun deaths and accidents in Switzerland, even though it seems that the laws have been changed. Some wizard would have died from an ingredient accident if mundane toxins were lethal.

I've addressed the last point multiple times already.
