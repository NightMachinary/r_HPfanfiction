Living longer without becoming weak is tied to good health care. I don't actually think that potions ingredients are handled without the needed care. And with regards to ages, I point to FB's McGonagall teaching before she went to school in earlier works - JKR sucks at numbers.

And I disagree about "Falls needing to be more extreme" - if that were the case, non-magical fistfights wouldn't break wizard bones, or every wizard would be so strong that muggleborns would be detected by accidentally crushing the skulls of their playmates when play-punching them, or wrecking doors and cribs and house-hold appliances.
