I think you're quoting JKR a little selectively. In the same quote you posted, she also said:

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic.
#+end_quote

So, no, wizards aren't immune to blunt trauma. Nor are they immune to "Nonmagical accidents" - they just can heal up more easily. Falls can break their bones. That means falls can kill them.
