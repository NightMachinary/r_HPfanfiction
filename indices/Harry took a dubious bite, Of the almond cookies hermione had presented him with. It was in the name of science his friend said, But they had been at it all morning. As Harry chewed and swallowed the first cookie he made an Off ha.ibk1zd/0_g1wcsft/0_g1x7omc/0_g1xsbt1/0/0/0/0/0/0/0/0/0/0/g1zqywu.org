Look, if your only argument is that JKR is a poor writer, I'm not sure we're going to get anywhere with this debate. Extrapolating from a direct quote regarding venoms is more than fair. I think I've presented a lot of evidence for my theory.

Did you get to bring the assault rifle home with you? Did you also get to bring cyanide home with you? Were you allowed to own them? Were you allowed free access to the medicine cabinet? To synthesize compounds from toxic substances in a laboratory at 13 with only one teacher to supervise? Did you use the toxic substances you took home and owned to create other compounds on your own? I was allowed to play with acid and other toxic substances, but I sure as hell wasn't allowed to keep them to myself. And I know teenagers that tried bathing in hydrogen peroxide, eating tide pods were once a thing, and someone, somewhere, got stabbed with the lionfish spine.

I'd like to think I've nicely resolved, multiple times at that, each of your doubts about the weight of my evidence. I've provided a consistent argument and have rebutted the evidence you've presented against my theory. I've explained misinterpretations of my theory. You've presented evidence that is simply incorrect, and often a matter corrected by common-sense. To say that a 115 year that can swim and go rock-climbing is within human norms is simply ridiculous. Or that a 132 year old (115+17 though I note that Griselda Marchbanks is most likely older) existed.

Your main argument is that JKR is simply a bad writer. Aside from the issue of the maliciousness behind that statement, I've also rebutted by showing how consistent JKR is on this issue, starting with the first book to the fantastic beast films. Half the time, you don't even respond to all the evidence I detail out.

It feels like your arguments are simply an attack on the books because you don't like the idea that wizards are more resilient. If that's the case, and I know you write fics, you're more than welcome to not use those ideas. That's the beauty of fanfiction!
