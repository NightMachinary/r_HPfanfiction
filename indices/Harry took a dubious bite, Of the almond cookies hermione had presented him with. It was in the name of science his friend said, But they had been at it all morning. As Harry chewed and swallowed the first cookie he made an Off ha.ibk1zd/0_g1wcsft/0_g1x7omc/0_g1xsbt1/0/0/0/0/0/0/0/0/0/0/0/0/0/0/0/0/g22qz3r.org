Wait so you're saying that swimming and climbing with a withered hand is completely natural?

We know that they have at the very least access to lion fish spines which are potentially lethal and yet no one is ever hospitalized for distress. And given that refills are needed as well as the abundance of parts (6 snake fangs per boil cure potion), it seems that said ingredients are bought in lethal amounts.

And cyanide and scorpion venom work via similar mechanisms, namely via interference with biochemical pathways. In any event, under your view of JKR, venoms and poisons would be even more similar because they are conceptually and intuitively similar.

You went from kids can be trusted with poisons, which you drew a parallel to assault rifles, as they can with household substances which kill kids daily. Now you're saying that they only get nonlethal amounts, completely undermining your previous analogies?
