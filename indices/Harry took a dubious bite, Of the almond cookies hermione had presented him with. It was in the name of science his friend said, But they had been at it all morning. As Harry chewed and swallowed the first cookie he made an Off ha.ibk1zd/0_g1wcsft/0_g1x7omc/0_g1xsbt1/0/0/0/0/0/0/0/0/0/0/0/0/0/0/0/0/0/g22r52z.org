No, I'm saying that climbing and swimming with a withered hand doesn't mean "immune to muggle attacks/poison".

Also, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence - Harry's POV is limited; people might very well be hospitalized; after all, if there were only the incidents Harry saw, Pomfrey would be quite underworked.

And no, I'm saying just because kids could die if ingesting certain substances but don't doesn't mean they are immune to them. The idea that kids will regularly imbibe poison from potion kits is not supported by any canon information.
