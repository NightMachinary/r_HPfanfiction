"Might kill" is not the same as "would kill". And with poison, there's always the question of how much was applied. You can safely survive a minor dose, for example, while more will kill you.

The potion argument is not really convincing - at the same age the kids start at Hogwarts, I got to shoot assault rifles - under supervision. Same as the kids in potions class.

I'm just not buying the "JKR said Y, so that means X is also true" way of thinking. JKR sucks at consistent world building. Extrapolating stuff from what she introduced as a parody (Quidditch) or for jokes is on the same level as assuming wizards really shat on the floor where they stood after reading that one tweet.
