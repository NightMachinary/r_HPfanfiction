[[https://www.cdc.gov/safechild/Poisoning/index.html]] (too lazy to look up Switzerland stats, probably comparable though) - which is of course, why no one ever dies from household substances. And these are substances usually kept away from children, not given to them for them to use and get habituated to having around. Weren't you the one to say that dosage of poisons matter? Those potions ingredients and venoms certainly seem more lethal at lower dosages. Though, of course, I doubt their lethality to a wizard.

I'll repeat that saying JKR can't be trusted is a lazy and malicious argument. In any event, it clearly doesn't apply. There is no "JKR said one thing here and another thing in another case". She has been consistent on this issue from book 1, through pottermore, all the way to the fantastic beasts films. It doesn't take a physics PhD to intentionally write 115 year olds that can swim and rock climb and 132+ year olds that can walk.

Here is the link to review most of the evidence I've detailed: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ibk1zd/harry_took_a_dubious_bite_of_the_almond_cookies/g1yjr1m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]].

And of course, there's the tell-tale evidence of the venom not being able to kill a wizard. Is there a quote from JKR that contradicts this?
