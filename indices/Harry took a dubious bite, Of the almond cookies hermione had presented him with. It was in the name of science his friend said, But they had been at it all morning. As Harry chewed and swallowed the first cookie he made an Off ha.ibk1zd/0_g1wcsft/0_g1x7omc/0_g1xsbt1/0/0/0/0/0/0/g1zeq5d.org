Dogs don't live to 60, no matter how much money people spend on their health care. People still die of old age, so it's clear that healing in this regards is limited. Newt directly states that muggle physiologists are different and offers Jacob a helmet that he himself, though you may not consider that canon.

The inconsistency with numbers favors my argument. Dumbledore was originally 150. In any event, there's a clear consistency of increased ages that cannot be explained away by this argument. 12 years is also a much smaller gap than the big gap between 78 and 115.

Resiliency is not the same as strength. Bones still break yes, resiliency means that they're less likely to break and it's much harder for mundane means to kill them. And it's pretty clear, they do have to be more extreme. Harry's accident in half blood prince would be a trip to the morgue for a muggle. Again, I've seen accidents less severe where people died.

And yes, if you gave lethal poisons to 11 (very least 13) year olds to own personally and store in locations next to them, there will be accidents. Especially if they're not aware or forget some ingredient's lethal nature. As I've already stated, much older teenagers do far worse than accidentally ingest poisons, they actively do so.
