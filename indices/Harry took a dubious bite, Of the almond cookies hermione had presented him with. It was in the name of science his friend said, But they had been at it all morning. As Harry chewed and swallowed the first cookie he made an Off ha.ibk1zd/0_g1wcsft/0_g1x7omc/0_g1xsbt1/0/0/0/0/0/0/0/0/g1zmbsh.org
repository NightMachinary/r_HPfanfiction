Griselda Marchbanks, who oversaw Dumbledore's NEWTs, isn't. And I'd like to see a 115 year old do a perfect breaststroke with a dead hand. That wasn't sarcastic by the way, if I'm very wrong on the bounds of human age, I'd like to see a video of 115 year old swim through a frigid ocean and go rock climbing, all with a withered hand . Or a 115 year old do the other things Dumbledore does. So no, while people have lived to 115, it's not normal for them to live many years longer and for them to do things like swim.

Bones still break, even if they're more resilient. It's not exactly like they're that resilient in actual life anyway. I once broke my pinky toe from kicking a door, and I don't have any underlying issues and am in a healthy age range. So yes, I consider it plausible, even with increased resiliency, that a hard stomp on one's nose can break a nose. If Draco had killed Harry with that stomp or broken a stronger bone, I would most likely not hold to my theory regarding physical resiliency. In any event, it doesn't change the fact, that Harry survived something that would kill a muggle. I don't really see an inconsistency when she's consistent with increased lifespans, survivability of mundane injuries, and she's so consistent with increased resiliency that fantastic beasts shows it as well.

But most importantly, it's directly stated that wizards can shrug off poisons. JKR directly states that a venom that would kill a muggle can be comfortably survived by a wizard. Children play around with poisons for class and live. Regardless of how you interpret physical resiliency (and the implications of it such as increased age), Harry Potter would comfortably survive the cyanide. And Hermione would be better off with a magical poison.
