The studnets don't have access to all the ingredients - the trio had to steal some. So, no, I don't buy the "they regularly imbibe poison" argument. (And even if they did - the potions classroom has beozars handy, so that's not "they're immune" and more "they can be easily healed" since, again, it depends on the dose and few poisons kill you instantly.)

I got to take the assault rifle home over the summer, yes - at 15. With a stern warning "not to switch it to full-auto, like this". That's how it was handled in Switzerland in the 90s. Also, in the average household, there are a lot of toxic substances (and in far higher quantities than in a potions kit), yet we aren't immune to them.

My main argument is that if fistfights can break bones, then wizards aren't supernaturally tough. You simply cannot break bones that can resist a bludger with your fist. And growing old and in good health doesn't mean they're supernaturally tough either.
