Reread the passage more carefully. Note the difference between the phrase regarding the venom (comfortably survive) and the others, fix and cure. You seem to be selective with what you respond to as well. Falls can break bones and falls can kill wizards. I never disagreed, but it's clear the falls must be more extreme than the ones that kill muggles. After all, no muggle would survive what Harry did. Harry did, allowing his mundane broken bones to be healed.

Where's the response to Dumbledore's capabilities? To the lack of deaths from potions ingredients? To Griselda marchbanks and Dippet? To the phrase that's comfortably survive and not comfortably cure?
