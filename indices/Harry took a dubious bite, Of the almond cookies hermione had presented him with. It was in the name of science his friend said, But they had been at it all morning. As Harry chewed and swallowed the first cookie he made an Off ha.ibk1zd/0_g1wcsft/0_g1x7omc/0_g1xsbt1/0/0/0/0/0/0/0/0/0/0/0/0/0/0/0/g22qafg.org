I'm telling you again: Being able to swim and climb at any age doesn't mean you are supernaturally tough. So, please drop that argument.

We have no idea about the potion kit's doses - but it's far too reaching to state that just because kids have access to poison that they are immune to it.

And JKR never mentioned cyanide - she mentioned a Scorpion's sting. Again, extrapolating from that to an immunity to all kinds of venom and poison in all doses is reaching.
