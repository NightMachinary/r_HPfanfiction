Car crashes tend to be dangerous, even in the most gung-ho action film, yet the thought of a wizard dying to one is impossible. People don't comfortably live past 200 years either. It may very well vary, but the point is that a scorpion sting that /would/ kill a muggle would be comfortably survived by a wizard. 115 year olds with dead hands don't tend to be swimming either.

The point is that the impact wouldn't even crack a muggle's skull. It'd be an instant death. I've seen lesser blows that have led to death. The bludger would have killed a muggle on impact. It merely cracks Harry's skull and makes him fall. Corresponding injuries on a muggle (from a less-severe accident) would be fatal as well.

So yes, given that a venom that would kill a muggle won't kill a wizard and that a wizard at 115 can pull off a perfect breaststroke, Hermione would be better off with a magical poison. Or just a far more efficient, if less dramatic, killing curse or spell of choice to the back.

Edit: Additional evidence that I found with a quick comb-through the books. Lionfish spines are used as potions ingredients (GoF). Lionfish venom can be fatal, and certainly are unpleasant. They're given to 13 (Harry runs out before 4th year) year olds to use. I believe, from your previous comments I've seen, that you may excuse this away by saying that Hogwarts is simply negligent. I disagree, but in any event, I'd note that we never hear of anyone needing the hospital wing for them. Hellebore is also toxic. Aconite has been used to kill people. Belladonna as well, yet it's a school ingredient. No one dies in 7 years at Hogwarts, and some of them are 11. If my high school lab had let all teenagers free access to the chemical room, someone would have died. Hell, some of them got into the hydrogen peroxide and started (no joke) splashing around in it. They ended up with minor chemical burns.
