I haven't seen any good ones.

A gun would probably be a great weapon in the Harry Potter universe, especially if used from ambush. But narratively, that doesn't lead to entertaining fights.

Wand fights are a lot like Errol Flyn sword fights, acrobatic dodges, clever feints, last minute counters and probably some banter. Guns don't fit into that kind of fight. Bullets can't be dodged, can't be parried and tend to kill what they hit which doesn't leave much time for feints and chit chat.

Now the writer can change this interaction pretty drastically and given the soft nature of Harry Potter magic they wouldn't even damage verisimilitude but at that point, why use a gun and not a wand?

So for a Harry Potter story to have guns as the main weapon, the fights themselves can't really be a source of extended excitement. They need to be tense but very short. Less Robin Hood, more Yojimbo. Instead all the excitement and entertainment needs to happen in the lead up to the climax the planning and setup before the fight which is itself over very quickly.

Kind of like the narrative flow of the first book really. There's lot's of carefully unpicking the mystery and exciting adventure in getting to where they need to go but the actual fight with Quirrel is over in a flash.

I think it's an under explored area, there are good stories to tell but they haven't been written yet.
