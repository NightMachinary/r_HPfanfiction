In addition to seconding The Pureblood Pretense (and its wonderful sequels), I'm going to recommend linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) which is a LOTR crossover where Harry, wandless, needs to reinvent potioneering if he wants to use magic at all. Still in progress, but updates ~once a month.

Also, if you can palate abandoned fics, read Out of the Night by Raining Ink, which is canon through four, actually does the inheritance trope well, does potions well, and is overall quite excellent. Not on ffn or ao3, but you should be able to find it by searching in this subreddit.

Got nothing as far as herbology is concerned, but dang am I interested now. Let me know if you find any!
