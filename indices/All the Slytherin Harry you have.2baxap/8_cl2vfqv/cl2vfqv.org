I realize this is 2 months later but if you haven't come across this one already, I'm about to blow your mind. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] by Dethryl.

This story is really long and really good with the exception (in my opinion) of excessive Ron-bashing. Basically, Harry and Draco become friends when they first meet in Diagon Alley and it shapes the rest of Harry's Hogwarts career. Years 1-5 are already written and I'm holding out hope for 6 and 7!

Also it has many non-canon pairings!
