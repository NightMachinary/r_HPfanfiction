If you meant me, I don't know that many, but my favourites I'd have to say are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]] and

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109003/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Maw]] and

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon]]

and lastly [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1179]]

Some parts are a bit corny, particularly the last two, but I still enjoyed them.
