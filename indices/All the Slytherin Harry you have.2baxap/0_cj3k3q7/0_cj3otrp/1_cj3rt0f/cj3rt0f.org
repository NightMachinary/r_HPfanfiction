KwanLi isn't in a position to recommend it, but I am.

I dislike most Harry-centric stories, and loathe most crossovers. I love Ender's Game, and have an automatic dislike of everything that tries to copy it in some form or another.

And yet, this story is awesome in my eyes. Even if this story goes on the H/Hr route (which is a pairing I particularly hate, because in my opinion that's just about incest), the characters and premise are developed enough for it to work and still be awesome. It's up there with Applied Cultural Anthropology at the top of my "can't wait for an update" list. It succeeds where others fail: great action scenes, developed characters, a compelling plot, and most of all, no forced romance (because it's not needed, the story can stand on it's own without that particularly overused crutch).

It's a must-read, and if you don't have a problem with Harry-centric stories, this is probably the best work in progress out there.
