As the Author's note says, you don't need to know anything about the DC/Vertigo comics to catch on to what's happening with Harry. That said, familiarity may help you to appreciate the style of storytelling a bit more, as the author tries to keep things moody and atmospheric similar to Neil Gaiman's writing.
