Yea, I always felt there wasn't enough humor. Although it won't be a collection of short stories that are mostly humor based, I'm still going to have a lot of humor. I wasn't planning on Harry to be as dark as "On The Way To Greatness" but somewhere in a mix between the Harry from Slytherin Selection and WWSHD.
