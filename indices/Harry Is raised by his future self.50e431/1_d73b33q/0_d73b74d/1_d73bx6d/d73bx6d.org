I've written this. It's pretty much older Harry making sure than all the plot holes in canon work out. Such as how the Dursley's got back off the island shack in book 1, or making sure that young!harry is in the right place at the right time.

Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress and I haven't posted any of it yet. :(
