I've mused sbout it a few times. In my anthology, i have a gilmore girls/harry potter where an adult harry is thrown back in time to 1992 and moves to stars hollow anc takes in harry. It's obviously a fixfic since his future knowledge allows him to deal with things rather easily but that's all background to past!harry/lorelai.
