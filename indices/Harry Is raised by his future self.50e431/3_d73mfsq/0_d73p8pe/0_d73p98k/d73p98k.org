#+begin_quote
  No change in characters from the original trilogy. This is a continuation. Ana and Christian have endured a tumultuous year. Yet they remain strong with their love for each other and their family. Will new revelations tear them apart? Will the coming changes divide them or make them stronger. You may want to read Fifty Shades More and Fifty Shade Clarity first. This is book 3 of 3.
