The closest one I can remember is where HP & HG separately travel back in time, to try to improve the lives of their younger selves. HG winds up basically being the de facto guardian of the young HP, and HP gets adopted into being the trusted family of young HG after being found homeless in an alley. They wind up meeting each other at some point. I thought it was a nice story, but it was unfinished and I can't remember the damned name.
