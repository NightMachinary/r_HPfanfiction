Well, I do maintain that muggles would inevitably win any conflict, although not with the statute surviving.

However it doesn't have to be that: We've seen that wizarding conflicts can coincide with Muggle ones.

It would be a chance to explore how the ICW handles rouge states (any one taken over by dark wizard/dark creatures). Do they send a task force of oblivorators to maintain the statute?. Is it like international peace keeping? Do they just give up on the country and do magic at the borders to keep the information from spreading?

Maybe the statute is being held together by some Dumbledore like character.
