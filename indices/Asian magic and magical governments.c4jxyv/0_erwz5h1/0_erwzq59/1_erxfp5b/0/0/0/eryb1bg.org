I think the ICW is a bit like the UN, in that they almost never agree on something (except keeping secrecy) but if secrecy is threatened somewhere they could probably act pretty quickly and get the entire magical world to intervene.

If a country is having trouble keeping secrecy, there are probably going to be obliviators from foreign countries all around the world arriving pretty soon.
