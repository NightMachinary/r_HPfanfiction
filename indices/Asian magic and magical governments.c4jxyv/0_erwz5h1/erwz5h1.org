China: None. Fell during the revolution and the central government would never allow a semi autonomous entity to form. Leaves the magical world there in a semi-permenent state of anarchy.

Or alternatively, the magical government survives with authority based on the old Chinese emperor's. Lots of conflict with muggleborns and their patriotic ideals
