Honnestly, I would just take the world building of a martial art novel (with sects and schools), and replace the martial art by magic.

â€‹

Full separation between the Muggles and the Wizards world.\\
To maintain this separation, the Wizards integrate Muggle born children at the first sign of accidental magic. The politic of the unique child helped greatly the wizards, among the "abandonned" girls, several where in fact Muggle born girls brought to the magical world, or even boys with the parents memory charmed to think they had a girl.

Because of the full separation, witches and wizards live together in magical settlements, each settlements being auto suffisant and even having its own schools (think martial sect, or in this case magical sect). The muggleborn of each region are brought to the nearest magical settlement where they are raised together in dorms. This separation also mean that Squibbs are not brought into the Muggle world, but stay in the settlement where they represent a kind of lower class and are used to do some menial task like raising non dangerous creatures are low level herbology.

The country is governed by a concil composed of the leader of each settlements, who elect among themselves a represent to not only "preside" the concil, but also to represent them abroad.

The country does not directly discriminate against Muggleborn, yet the fact that they are raised by the settlement mean that they lack the social networking pureblood children have. A muggleborn can still achieve greatness if he has talent and find a master/ protector while in school, but most of them still have a little harder time than the pure bloods and half bloods.
