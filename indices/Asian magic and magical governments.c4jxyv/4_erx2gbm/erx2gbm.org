Old streets as Diagon equivalents (e.g. Tunxi old Street)

I've seen some fics that incorporate the idea of land spirits as a ghost/magical creature hybrids, but that's bigger in Japan based HP fics

Alternative healing (acupuncture, cupping, etc), but HP healing is quite unique already, so I don't exactly know how you'd adapt it. Maybe instead of potions, they solidify or apply them onto needles for targeted treatment or weaponization?

Perhaps a more physical dueling style (martial arts?), Or maybe they disdain it as a muggle necessity. Forms and fluidity probably bleed through though.

Schools or towns or creatures up in the mountains that use the rolling mists to hide

Some way to resolve the huge number of dialects that sound nothing alike.

Veneration of immortality and its study? Tales of immortals exist all over Chinese folklore, and emperors have often searched for its secrets

Maybe a zodiac based system somewhere? I was gonna say a school system, but 12 is kind of unwieldly. Maybe famous animagi in their history?

Even more rigid family/class system than magical Britain. Tradition, filial piety, etc. are huge there culturally, but then you also have to consider the sheer size of the population, so keeping muggleborns second class like in Britain would be ridiculous. Maybe they have them join under the banners of family in hierarchies, forming miniature courts. I just had the horrifying thought of squib eunuchs.

feng shui, yin yang, four humors, etc. deal with balance in some way. I feel like China's magic society wouldn't shun dark magic and ritualism.

Isolationist government that's more strict with the statute. Maybe they take all muggleborns away from families early on and toss them into orphan communes separate from the family courts and resources but within the magical world, encouraging them to remain subservient to the hierarchies when they grow older?

Maybe the magical community there never really got over the warring states period and have a number of fractured societies and courts that have a grudging alliance with one another?
