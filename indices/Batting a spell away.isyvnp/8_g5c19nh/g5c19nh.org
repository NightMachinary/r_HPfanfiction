In books the only ways to deflect spells are by using "Protego" or variations of it or to summon physical objects between you and the spells as Dumbledore (statues, Fawkes) and Voldemort (shield) do during the Battle of DoM. I think the idea comes from the movies where Snape just bats spells away with the tip of his wand and Voldemort does that with bare hands.
