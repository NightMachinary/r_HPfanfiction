In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][book 1]] of the Harry of El series, Flitwick reflexively demonstrates how to deflect a spell in class by wrapping magic around his wand and using it as a small pseudo-shield, a technique known as the Duelist's Shield.\\
When he sees a modified version of the technique which expands the effect to form a pseudo-sword, it takes him only a few seconds to mentally reverse-engineer it and apply it to his own wand. He then uses it to spar against the one who created the variant, as well as her three friends, in a dazzling display of why he is a Charms /Master/.

Later in the series, Hermione (with the aid of a couple of teachers) invents a jinx which uses the Duelists reflexive use of the Duelist's Shield against them. Filius is highly impressed by the sneakiness it shows.
