Unfortunately, this is an example of unclear language by JKR (though hex-deflection and fantastic beasts certainly shows the existence of spell "batting").

Deflection in this instance referred to spell blocking which totally nullifies a spell. It does not bat it towards away from the user..

  *Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. “Aaaaaaaargh!” There was a flash of light* and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.

  Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy's hex *missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him*; *Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy* */blocked/* *the jinx* and raised his wand for another ---

  “*Cruc ---*” But Snape /parried/ the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet *before he could complete it*; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendio!” Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire. “Fang's in there, yer evil --- !” Hagrid bellowed. “*Cruc ---*” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape /blocked/ the spell again. Harry could see him sneering. “No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. “You haven't got the nerve or the ability ---” “*Incarc ---*” Harry roared, but Snape /deflected/ the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.

  “*Stupe ---*” “/Blocked/ again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, /deflecting/ the curse once more. “Now come!” he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. “It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up ---”

Bolding was done to show how the spell is totally nullified, it even prevents them from being finished. Italics are to show how the language used to describe it includes deflected and parried.
