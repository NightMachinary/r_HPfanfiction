You know, I used to find fanfiction weird because all of my run-ins with it were of people writing things about /real/ people. Like, you do you, but it's a little weird that people write sexual fantasies and the like about actual people. Just keep it in your head, folks. (And I know that it's not always smut fics.)

Your comment actually reminded me that my first actual run-in with fanfiction was when I was thirteen or fourteen. I was reading a book on Wattpad and only realized that it was a fanfiction about halfway through when they mentioned One Direction performing. I was a really odd kid who knew of One Direction, had heard about two of their songs, and never cared to learn their names.
