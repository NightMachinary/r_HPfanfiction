Harry Potter fic, about 20 years ago. Let's just say that I learned a lot of very interesting things and that reading fic should not serve as anyone's sex education because I had some really wrong ideas about how sex worked thanks to reading fic (and my state's abysmal sex education program that mostly amounted to “don't have sex or you‘ll get pregnant”). Anyway, years later I realized that I'm asexual and I no longer read smutty fics out of confused curiosity.
