I was trying to find the Harry Potter books on line without having to pay for it ( I don't remember which book it was) but I do remember I didn't have any money to pay for it the actual book and I thought - If you can watch movies online for free, why not read books online for free? (I even thought it might be easier) With an extensive google/yahoo/askjeeves search I found [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. I got so excited because at first glance I thought that the fics were all written by J.K (I was a idiot, I know) Anywho, that's how I started reading fanfiction! :)
