I heard about My Immortal, so looked it up. I couldn't find it however as by that point it has been removed, but by then I had started checking out Hp fanfiction on Fanfiction.Net.

Not sure what fics interested me at first, but eventually I stumbled upon a Harry/Daphne fic and have been into that ship ever since.
