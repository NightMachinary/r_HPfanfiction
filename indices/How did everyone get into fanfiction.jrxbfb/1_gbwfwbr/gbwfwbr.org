I started in 2001 in FF.net, I think the harry potter entry had 200 pages max. I didn't knew english at all at the time, and I had an older friend translate and read to me the fics, but she never translated the smut part(I was 13). That why I now can read in english. I miss lots of fics from the old(pre-2003) FF.net. *I read the first 2 parts of Cassandra Clair fic, still remember some parts of that fic.
