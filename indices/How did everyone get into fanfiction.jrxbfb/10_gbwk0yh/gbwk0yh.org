I was 13 and had just finished watching an old 90s cartoon and was saddened that the series ended on a cliffhanger. Then I thought about some of the plotholes/character expansion the series didn't touch upon and wondered if anyone else noticed it, so I searched online and discovered FFN, circa mid-2011. After reading a ton of fanfics I decided to give writing a shot and created an account in early 2012.

I bounced from my first fandom to Winx Club, Kim Possible, Hunger Games, Star vs the Forces of Evil, some other childhood favourites then finially HP in late 2017/early 2018, which I remembered reading up to Sirius' death when I was little and chose to swear off it forever lol. The fandom is very diverse and there's (generally) something for everyone.
