There was a HP fan site where group of dozen or so people were producing extremely fast fan translations of the books as soon as the original versions came out. At the time I didn't know English and couldn't be patient when HBP came out, so while I was searching about news regarding the translation I found that fan site and the site also had a section for fanfiction. That was how I first got a clue that there was a such thing as fanfiction.

Naturally the amount of fics (and most likely their quality) were abysmal so I put fanfiction out of my mind.

It was years later I got into fanfiction, along the years I learned English and while thinking about a what-if scenario about some fandom I'm not sure about now, it popped in my head that fanfiction existed and it was possible someone else might have wondered about the same what-if and wrote about it.

After finding ffn and the sheer amount of fics there were I was sold.
