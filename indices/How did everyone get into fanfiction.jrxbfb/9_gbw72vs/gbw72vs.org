The emptiness after DH is released. I mean, well yeah the surviving characters are mentioned to be living happily(-ish) but there's simply no full-length additional content (Fantastic Beasts was only an extra book at that time) to look forward to. I /heard/ about fanfiction when some fraud publish random fanfics as "leaked DH", so I thought "meh, just hack writers?", but then I stumble upon some good enough (for me, at the time) materials like wish fulfillment fic or fan wank.

The idea that I can get /free/ reading materials that just tickle my fancy, readable on my crappy phone even when I don't have an internet connection, enough for hours or even days ensuring I never get bored even with mere ~10 MBs of download is so mindblowing I actually look forward to long trips, something I really dreaded before because either my phone will run out of battery, stuck in a blank spot, or I'd have exhausted all the songs I bring with me.

I actually prefer fanfic to stories with original settings and characters back then, since the hassle of remembering which one is which and figuring out the overarching plots force me to trudge through pages of books before the meaty plot, while fanfics got the luxury of going full plot right from the first page. Sure, /now/ I know several original writers who can write such a page-turner, but back then I can just download random fics that have enough followers and usually enjoy it well enough.

As the honeymoon phase passed, I become more selective, and rather annoyed when a fic with good start suddenly broke down in the middle. TVTropes fanfic recs was my go-to portal to find the good stuff, and later on, I stumble on this very subreddit.
