You can never be sure.

For example, on FFN some authors mark a work complete when it's actually abandoned; you get to the end and it's just unresolved. On AO3 the work might be complete but end---again unresolved---with a note that a sequel will be "coming soon" but it's been six years and nothing else was ever posted.

You pays your money and you takes your chances.
