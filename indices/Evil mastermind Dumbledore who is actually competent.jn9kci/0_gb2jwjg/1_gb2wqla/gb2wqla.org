Thank you! I skimmed through it and it seems that the plot is not entirely as I remembered it but I think that's the one I was looking for. It was a really cool story and, now that you mentioned it, so was its prequel. But then again I must have been 12 or 13 when I read it and was the first fic where Dumbledore turned out to be evil. I remember that I was really sad about it.
