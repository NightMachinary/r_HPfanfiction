Northumbrian has a lot of this. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is a good example, with Harry and Ginny and their children moving into a new neighbourhood in the countryside.

And despite sort of following canon, linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay) is almost a slice of life, because it so effectively derails and defuses the canon threats. Instead of fighting Voldemort every year, he's focused on preparing for exams, working with the "unusually shaped" students (a Sphinx, a merman, Fluffy's niece...), and discovering new fantasy novels, especially the ones about dragons.
