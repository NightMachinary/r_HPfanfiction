My best friend got me into HP fanfic. We recommend fics to each other but she has certain standards for hers (very long, complete, topic and quality don't necessarily matter) and I have certain standards for mine (preferably long, doesn't matter if complete, prefer Hermione centric, cannot stand dark fics, quality matters very much) that don't jive well with each other lol
