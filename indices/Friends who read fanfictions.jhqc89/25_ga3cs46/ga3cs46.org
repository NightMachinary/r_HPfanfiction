Mmm I have friends who read fanfictions but never in the fandom I write in. They either like their fandom more than mine or just don't like HP. I do have a few Potter head friends that I share my fanfic with and they liked it. For some reason, I felt like their reviews and comments were ten times better than the reviews I normally get, which is saying a lot bc I normally get positive reviews.

Makes me sad that some people don't like Harry Potter, but I guess I can't judge/criticize them for their personal favorites.
