Reading some of the comments here about how none of you ever told your friends you read fanfiction, im pretty sure most of you actually do have friends that read ffs, it's just that you don't know because you don't talk about it ðŸ˜‚

I know... 4 people that read fanfiction. But I only talk about it with my cousin.
