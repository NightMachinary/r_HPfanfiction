I always bring up how fascinating it is to see people grow stronger with their writing skills. And I tell them that most long fanfics are about the same size as a novel but they do it without being paid for it. That tends to make people think more openly. Then if people bring up the smut aspect I just counter with the longest going joke in porn the pizza delivery. Does that mean you shouldn't order pizza because a few pornos have been made about it? That shuts them up enough to then I can explain most fanfics are tagged so you just need to avoid key words like lemon smut etc then

Edit: spelling
