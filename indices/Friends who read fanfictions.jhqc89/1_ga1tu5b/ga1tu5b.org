I had one good friend in high school where not only we read the same fics we reviewed each other fics. I miss this!

Unfortunately when you are a certain age it's seen as a childish hobbie (some people even consider it perverted).

Now that I'm in college I am honestly embarrassed to even ask someone if they read fanfic. Like, how do you do this? I'm scared that the person might think me perverted or, worse, I think the person is LOL
