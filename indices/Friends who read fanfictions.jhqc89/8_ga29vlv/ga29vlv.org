My friends don't read any but are still cool about it. We've had some fun conversations about the history and politics of the rest of the wizarding world as background for the fic I'm working on, like, “what would the colonization of Africa look like from a Wizarding perspective?” or “how would a magical Anarchist utopia in New Zealand function?” They think it's fun to talk about but aren't really into it enough to spend time actually reading it.
