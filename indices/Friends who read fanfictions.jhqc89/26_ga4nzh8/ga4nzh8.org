Growing up my older sister and I read fanfics. Though completely different fandoms. I only read one fandom until I became an adult and someone I was working with was like wait why haven't you read an HP fanfics and I was worried because the HP books were my childhood I didn't want to ruin that. Long story short I've branched out a lot. And I have another coworker now who also likes fanfics so we talk about them a lot. Or story ideas. She thinks I should write them but I'm still unsure of myself
