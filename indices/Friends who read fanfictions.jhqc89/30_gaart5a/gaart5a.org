No-one in my immidiate circle of people reads fanfics. I have been trying to get my gf into it, but she only likes reading real hard-cover books.

My close friends and family know that i read FF, family doesn't care and my friends dont care either, but they ocasionally make fun of me for it. (That is just our humor, me and my friends all make fun of eachother so don't think that they arent my real friends cuz they make fun of me)

I play drums in a band though, and our guitarist and singer really like harry potter and the singer reads FF too! But she is mainly into slash and im really not. But still, when we had 2 gigs in one day and we were driving 400km that day, during the journey we discussed HP so much. It was really fun bonding with them.

But I would really like to have more friends to fiscuss HP FF with, but It is hard cuz I live in the "redneck" part of Finland, where if you are different, you are ridiculed.
