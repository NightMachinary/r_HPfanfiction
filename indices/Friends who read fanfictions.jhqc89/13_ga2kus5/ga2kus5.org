I have a great group of friends from college who are all into fanfic. During COVID we actually set up weekly check ins where we read each other's writing. It was great for socializing AND motivating ourselves to write!

Having fanfic friends is honestly the best. I'm not into their fandoms, generally, but that only makes it more impressive when I fall in love with the fics they write/recommend.
