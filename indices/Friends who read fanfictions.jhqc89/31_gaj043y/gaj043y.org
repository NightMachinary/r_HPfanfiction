Aww this hits close to home.

One of my ex-boyfriend is the only person that knows I read fanfics because we lived together for a year and I can't hide my addiction to it (esp since I used to reject his offer for gym/walk together to stay in reading fanfic instead lol). We've broken up for almost three years and he'd still ask me if I'm still reading the “internet story” whenever we talk from time to time, I'm mortified each time..
