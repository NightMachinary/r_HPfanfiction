Never actually discussed it to be honest. I think only two people know that I read and write, and that's only because I'm very close to them. And they aren't into it.

I know maybe two people in my class read Fanfics, and that's because they are open about it. I don't really socialise with them because our tastes differ too much to sit down and chat about it.

That and different Cliques.
