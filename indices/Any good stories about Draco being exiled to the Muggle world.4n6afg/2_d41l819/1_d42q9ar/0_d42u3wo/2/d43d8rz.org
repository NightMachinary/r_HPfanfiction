I already read this one. It was really good. I guess what I liked best about it was that (a) it was one of the first few I read, and (b) the character development of both Harry and Draco was very believable. Harry is not sure he wants to join the aurors and Draco is tired of being stupid and goes out to try and remedy that. I thought their interaction was also more believable than I've read elsewhere (They are not hostile or fawning, but interact in a way that makes sense, given their history). Are you the writer of "Here's the pencil, make it work" by any chance?
