I checked out your bookmarks and they look amazing. I already read "Stop and Stare" and it was lovely. I don't know how I missed that one by Saras Girl. How does he/she keep cranking out such consistently high quality fics? Haven't read Soupy_george yet, but I think these recs are just what the doctor ordered. Thank you very much!
