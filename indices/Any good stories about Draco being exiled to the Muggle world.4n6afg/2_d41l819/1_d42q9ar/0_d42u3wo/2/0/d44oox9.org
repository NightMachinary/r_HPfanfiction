Haha I am (weirdly) flattered because I love that fic but no I'm not the author. My ao3 profile is katelawyer86 and I have bookmarked and rec'd a lot there - [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]] - but I've never written anything. Probably because I don't have any great ideas and to write a fic I would be proud of would be a huge undertaking...

For my fav fics with the most believable characters with depth and flaws, I love the authors Soupy__george and sarasgirl. Big shout outs to The Printed Press (linkao3(1124273) and One Hundred and Sixty Nine (linkao3(1124404) from Soupy_george and pretty much everything by Sarasgirl is amazing but one of my favorites for character development is Helix. Linkao3(3114812).

I also recently loved the Draco in the Gentlewizards Club and the sequel (linkao3(2106744)) - it felt like a very similar Draco to Here's the Pencil. Also Draco in There's Always The Moon is so beautifully written. Linkao3(6264406)

Anyway I'm always up for sharing recs as I read WAY too much fic - you should definitely message me if need or have a good rec!
