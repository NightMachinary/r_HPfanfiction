I just read another Harry/Draco that I LOVED where Draco goes into exile in the muggle world to escape the war. It is part of a series by pir8fancier that starts with linkao3(192712). This series is first person Draco that relies heavily on letters he writes to Harry. The character development is great though!

What specifically did you like about the characters in "Heres the Pencil?" - I have read so much fic (especially slash but all pairings) that I could probably recommend something similar.
