This is completely different than what I normally read...but I enjoyed it and I think it was last updated in May. So that is good. I really like how reflective Draco is, to the point where he can accept he is only an average wizard. He does seem to try hard to live up to the muggle expectations especially the librarian, which is a good thing. And I would almost say completely opposite of how he is in cannon EXCEPT he was trying to live up to expectations there too, just the really horribly warped ones of his parents.
