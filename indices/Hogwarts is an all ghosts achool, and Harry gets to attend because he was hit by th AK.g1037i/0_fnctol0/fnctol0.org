"Today we will welcome Harry James Potter to our Hogwarts school of Ghosts and Poltergeists. After heated debate we have decided that getting hit by the Killing Curse qualifies one for our prestigious institution even if one survives. Welcome our school's first alive student with a huge round of applause."

Harry hadn't expected to be invited to a ghost school. He certainly had not expected for a ghost to pop into his cupboard to invite him. He nearly had a heart attack when the ghost had appeared. Uncle Vernon did have a heart attack when he saw the ghost. It did not help that the ghost was covered in blood. He gulped and stepped forward and stood before four ghosts. One was a tall man with broad shoulders whose beard and hair looked faintly like the mane of a Lion and a sword strapped to his waist. The other was a thin and short man who had a long thin beard that almost reached the ground. He wore a locket around his next and was glaring at him.

The other two were women. One was a tall women who held a book in her head and he could help but gulp at her intimidating stare. "She must have been really pretty when she was alive" he thought absently as he turned to the last person of the group. She was a plump women. She would have reminded him of Aunt Marge if not for the warm smile on her face. She looked really kind and was the first one to speak. "Welcome young one. We are here to determine in which house you fit in. We have never had to sort a person who was alive but we are sure we will find a place for you." she said in a pleasant voice. He was sure he heard a scoff filled with derision from the short man.

His suspicions were confirmed when the man opened his mouth and said; "You three can decide if you want to have him. I will not have this.. abomination in my house." He got a feeling that the insult was going to have been worse had the tall man not put his hand on the sword as a warning. "If that is what you wish Salazar then so be it. Leave before you taint this auspicious day with your foul mouth any further." The man looked about to protest but the tall man starting to unsheathe his sword and the tall lady sending a sharp glare his way stilled him and made him leave. The smile on the kind looking women's face never wavered.

"Let's begin, shall we."
