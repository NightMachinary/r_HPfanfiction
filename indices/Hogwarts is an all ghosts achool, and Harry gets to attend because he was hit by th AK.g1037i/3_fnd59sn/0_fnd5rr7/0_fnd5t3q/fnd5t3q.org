“I haven't even gotten to my best cases. “ Harvey insisted!

“Ive got one spectre that died not even five years ago! That granger girl, you know the one whose disappearance was all over the news . Went missing walking home from school and her spectre showed up a week later at home and then more regularly the public library. It's well documented she only shows up June- September since a year after her death. Rowena Grey lost her certification because she insists on playing up the spooky medium stereotype. But her daughter Myrtle is homeschooling , got expelled or something but is a confirmed medium though not yet old enough to certify. Well young Myrtle has been living at Rannoch with Grey and is insistent the granger girl is there. Poor girl complained for an hour that anytime she cried or was lonely the granger girl would show up and be a quote “insensitive know it all bookworm “ .

Stantz began looking over the case study write ups Harvey had piled in front of him “ One case doesn't really show a pattern of modern Interaction “

“I've actually got another juvenile and adult spectre in a related case that both show up in Rannoch. It was the Godric hollow murder suicide. Childhood sweethearts , have a baby at 16. At 18 the young man, Snape, had a psychotic break when he became convinced the girl Evans was sleeping with the Debby Pottery heir. He ended up killing Evans and their baby then himself. Filch recognized the spectre Snape from the news says he's been at Rannoch “teaching” for years. The juvenile spectre started haunting the Evan girls sister and her family. Arabella Figg has been trying to exorcise him for years, says it's driving that poor family insane. Well she mentions that a few years ago she thought she had finally succeeded but then he showed back up during the summer months, and it's happened twice since then.

“I've got to tell you Harvey this is all really compelling evidence. I'll be excited to see your full article when it is published , but why is it you've come to me?

“It's very simple Doctor, I've got funding. I've got Filch to agree to allow us to set up research there , he bought the old place. I've got Bones from Cambridge as an interpersonal medium and Riddle from Oxford who specializes in exorcism and how sceptres cross over. Filch will act as our senior medium and I'm bringing in Figg and Lovegood. I'm putting together a team to study their the entire school year. All I need is a credible field researcher to join. Your the best”

There was a long pause as Ray Stanz bit into his now soggy chip and chewed thoughtfully. Swallowing decisively he cracked his first smile since arriving in Perth.
