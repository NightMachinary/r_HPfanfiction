Every year readouts drop out at June and reappear in September . I've got 3 years of data, multiple testimonial from the mediums , though they aren't certified, who live in Rannoch. And I can track multiple childhood spectres In England and Scotland vanishing and reappearing from their haunts on that same schedule, all of those are confirmed by various board certified mediums. “

Stantz had stopped eating and was now intently listening. James gesticulated wildly as he spoke and when he finished speaking Ray once again began pouring over the readouts

“I don't understand how it's possible that this could have been missed. You realize Harvey how far fetched this sounds, right? The Paranormal was inducted into the hard sciences nearly two hundred years ago. We began to categorize the difference between fixed loop apparitions and capricious spectres before we had even officially became a science. Now your telling me that no one noticed all of the juvenile capricious spectres disappearing and reappearing at fixed intervals “

“It's not all of them! There are only about 280 or so, all from different areas in and around the English and Scottish areas. And they aren't from any particular time set. There are a lot of the Victorian era spectres but at least a few handfuls of more modern ones as well! I haven't worked out how or why but I've got a few theories and corroborated data . I have even tracked the Longbottom boy there !”

Stantz looked shocked . “Are you sure ?”

“Entirely ! “ Harvey stated with conviction. “ Amelia Bones out of Cambridge wrote her thesis on interspectre relations. She used the Longbottoms as a case study for family relations in the spectre world. You know elder spectre is actually 90 something years removed from the Lonbottom boy ? She died of old age in 1839 and most people put his murder somewhere in the late 1920s or early 1930s, though his uncle never did confess to anything other then accidentally dropping him out that window,. He wasn't caught until they found the body decades later. “

“As fascinating as that is how does this tie in to Rannoch”

“Oh of course! Well Amelia was trying to study them, multiple observations have made it clear that old lady Longbottom believes Neville Longbottom to be her sons only child, and the Longbottom boy allegedly calls her Gradmother. But she's got seven or so years of data showing he only appears during the summer months.”

“I see. Well, it's just the beginning but it is some pretty interesting research” Dr. Stantz began. His mind was racing, trying to recall any other cases that had similar appearance routines .

“That's just where I started Dr. Stantz! Ben Blood ended up in Rannoch with that annoying assistant of his Peeves , you know the youtuber?”

Stantz cringed noticeably at Peeves name but nodded all the same.

“ I got to talking with him as he has got his own research going on, and he pointed me in the direction of the Malfoy Murders. Victorian era ghosts, haunting the Malfoy Mansion. The family keeps trying to Exorcise them because the man has killed a bunch of their race horses. Blood thinks he recognized the juvenile spectre in Rannoch .The data seemed a little confused because of how similar the spectres all look but we can say definitively that the juvenile rarely shows up at the Manor except summers and the occasional Yule. While looking into those I ran into Lovegood, he's been looking for his daughters spectre for years. Nothing worse then a medium with a confirmed spectre loved one. Always bad all around, but he told me of the Weasley clan near his office You know one of the original evidences for the corporeal age theory? All of those infant deaths and then the wife went out in childbirth, the husband died from electrocution when trying to install one of the first telegraph systems. Once the juvenile spectres started taking on older ages they began to appear less and less, yet those with the younger appearances still showed up pretty regularly .

“Well I must say while circumstantial it is pretty compelling, those are all much older ghosts though” Stantz pointed out with a considering frown.

“I haven't even gotten to my best cases. “ Harvey insisted!
