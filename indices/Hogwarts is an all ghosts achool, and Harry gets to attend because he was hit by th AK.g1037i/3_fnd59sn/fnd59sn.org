A man in his late sixties dressed in a rumpled suit was sitting across from an excited man in his late thirties frowning at the pubs menu. “Explain to me what we are doing in Perth Mr. Harvey . “ The elder man stated seeming a little put out. He held up a hand to stop the younger man who had smiled widely at the question, and turned to a passing waitress ordering a pint and a basket of crisps. After placing his order he turned his attention back to the younger man. Harvey, who wore a grey cardigan and had neatly brushed hair didn't seem at all put off by his companions frown. Smiling widely he adjusted his glasses and began to speak . “ James please, and trust me it's worth your while Dr. Stantz. I'm sure you know there have always been rumors that the old Rannoch school was haunted , and the results were wildly inconsistent. I wasn't sure it would come to anything but few years ago I dropped by to investigate the old loch farming village.

“Yes I saw your paper on that, a prime example of a time capsule apparition town, yes? An old farming village , the whole place wiped out by a swine disease. If I recall it was only notable in that your medium reported the apparitions renamed their town hogsmede before continuing their fixed motion cycles “

“ yes yes charming place , but listen before I left the area I stopped by Rannoch, old Argus Filch lives there you know? Retired from his Oxford position as head of the Medium department and went off grid. It seemed a little odd but he had always been talking about how he missed interacting with the capricious spectres not just studying them. What Is going on there is amazing! Unprecedented ! It could totally change our understanding off how the non corporeal behave outside of fixed looped systems and how these spectres can interact despite time periods of death ”

“So you mentioned in the voicemail. And letter. And email. Though you've been very reticent sharing any evidence”

“ You've got to understand Dr. Stantz this is years worth it research and the findings are unique ! I can't just email that over, what if someone got their hands on it before I publish. Trust me I have evidence. Here, look at these readouts. Do you see anything odd with the data “

“It seems to be high level static readings, not really that different then the readouts others have got from Rannoch and not that inconsistent with such an old place with so many residents who have died . “

Dr. Ray Stantz set down the readouts as the waitress came by with his food, seemingly uninterested.

Harvey's smile only grew. “Yes and so it was Dr. Stantz, for the three weeks I was there. Until one day mid morning the readouts dropped to nearly non existent, look here. “

D. Stantz wiped his fingers absently on his pant leg before flipping between the first and second page of data. He frowned slightly flipping between the two pages. “How “ he mumbled before glancing back at James Harvey. Did you check your calibration ? Did the electrometer die ?

“That's the first thing I thought but the equipment was in perfect working order! “ James Harvey assured , his ever present grin growing. When Dr. Stantz opened his mouth to continue on his train of enquiry Mr. Harvey quickly continued. “ Believe me I checked the equipment , brought out my spare , recalibrated the spectrometer . Nothing. So I got to taking with Filch. You know his corporeal age theory right ? “

Dr. Stantz nodded his head while speaking . “Yes, of course. Those juvenile spectres when fitting in the Capricious designation will spontaneously age and occasionally cross over at unpredictable time frames and intervals. I'm not here to review basic paranormal theorem Mr. Harvey”

“ Yes well Filch first got that theory from Rannoch, but what he didn't mention at the time was that a lot of the spectres in Rannoch didn't die there ! It's a school”

“Of course it was a school”

“No Dr. Stantz I mean it's literally a school for spectre children !
