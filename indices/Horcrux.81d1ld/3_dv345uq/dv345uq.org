I think it somehow involves pregnancy and fetuses. Look at the story of Bertha Jonkins. She was kidnapped, disappeared, her body was never found, and later Voldemort had the appearance of a baby-like thing.

That ties well into the story that the editor was sick after hearing JKR's original plans for horcruxes, so he forced her to tone it down for the final product.
