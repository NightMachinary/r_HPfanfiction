I wrote a snippet once where a horcrux was actually its creator's whole soul; instead of anchoring its creator, it anchors a summoned demon or devil so they can't be destroyed or banished.

The evil in it was that as the summoner and horcrux maker (or rather horcrux giver), you'd be consigning yourself to hell or oblivion, in order to protect an agent that exists solely to bring about indiscriminate destruction and corruption, sow pain and suffering, and torture kittens.
