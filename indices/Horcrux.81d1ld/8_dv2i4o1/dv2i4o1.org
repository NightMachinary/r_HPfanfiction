Maybe, if Voldemort adapted it to be 'safer' to make more - so a smaller fragment of /his/ soul to keep him connected to it, intwined with /a sacrificial soul/ as the actual anchor?

So instead of it being self-mutilation, its soul-stealing mixed in with consigning sacrificial souls to an eternity in heck with the maker? Twisting the souls together to the point where not even death can seperate them, against their will, to keep oneself alive?
