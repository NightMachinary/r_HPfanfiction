You somewhat answered your own question. The horror of the Horcrux isn't in what the consequences to /others/ are, but in the consequences to /you/. Literally the only worse thing on Earth is the Dementor's Kiss. You're /ripping apart your own soul/, the immortal core of your self and mind, and to make it even more awful you're doing it to yourself /willingly/. It's horrible in the way a sect whose members willingly, gleefully poke out their own eyes and cut off their ears would be horrible.
