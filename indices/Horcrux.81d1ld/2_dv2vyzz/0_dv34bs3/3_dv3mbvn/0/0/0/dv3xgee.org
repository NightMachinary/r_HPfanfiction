Creating a complete Horcrux requires a cold blood murder. With Harry Riddle failed to complete this step, but still Harry became a partial Horcrux with the main property of giving Riddle immortality.

From that I conclude that a murder is not mandatory step. You still can create partial Horcruxes and be immortal without killing anyone :-)

While I respect Rowling and I just can't close my eyes on all inconsistencies in her works and interviews.
