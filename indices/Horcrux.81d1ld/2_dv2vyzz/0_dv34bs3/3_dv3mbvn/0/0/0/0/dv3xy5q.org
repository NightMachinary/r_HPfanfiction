It doesn't say anything about cold blooded murder. The books just say murder. That's it. And Voldemort does do so. He didn't fail to complete this step, because:

Voldemort did kill James and Lily --- even in cold blood.

It was also said that part of his soul was torn apart and thrown into Harry because his soul was already so unstable, meaning that it wouldn't have happened if he never created a bunch of them, meaning that it does in fact, always, require murder.
