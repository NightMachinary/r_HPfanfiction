Well if you look at it this way. From reading the scripts from the book (not the whole book) but just the section in which it happened. Sounds like Lily intervened with Riddle attempting to kill him. By do this, i suppose, she sacrificing herself caused the ultimate shield that reflected the spell back to him which caused not only killing himself but causing his soul to split. Maybe by accidental suicide can cause a Horcrux? Or maybe the combination of the suicide with lily's death caused the soul to split?
