I think the ritual, as applied to a normal, whole, healthy (as it were) soul, would be required, but by the time Voldemort tried to kill Harry he had already done it 5 times. It stands to reason that his soul was in tatters and could be torn apart much more easily, even without the full trappings of whatever ritual is normally required.

It's like trying to break a bundle of twigs in half compared to a single twig. Or removing a piece of rotted wood as opposed to healthy wood.
