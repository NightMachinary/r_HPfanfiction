If what you're telling is true, than Riddle should lose a part of his soul every time he cast AK and we know he casted it often.

It's also stated that a murder is a mandatory step. But Voldemort failed to kill Harry. It should have jeopardized the whole ritual.

Also there're deaths of James and Lily just before. Were they a part of ritual too?
