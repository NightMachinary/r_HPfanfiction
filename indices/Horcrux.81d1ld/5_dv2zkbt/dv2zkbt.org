Harry Potter magic is very conceptual. I like to think of the souls in Harry Potter as a manifestation of the “self.” In order to assure himself a means of immortality Voldemort has to willingly and purposefully diminish himself, his own sense of self. Additionally I subscribe to the belief that Voldemort as we see him in the books isn't as dangerous because of this. In his first ruse to power he was described as very charismatic and cunning, characteristics that he definitely possesses less of after he returns to a body after his first Horcrux (the diary) has been destroyed and that part of his soul lost to him.
