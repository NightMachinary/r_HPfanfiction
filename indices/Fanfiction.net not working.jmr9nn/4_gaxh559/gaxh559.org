From what I have seen these are the following issues.

1. New stories when clicked give the following error (Story Not FoundStory is unavailable for reading. (A)). *Desktop*
2. Updated stories give the following (Chapter not found). *Desktop*
3. The app I use runs into issues downloading new chapters. *App name fanfiction reader*.
4. One newly updated chapter I was able to access showed incorrect update date but the email had been sent within 30 minutes of clicking the link. Said chapter cannot be accessed anymore by the same email link. *Desktop*
5. Not all users will have these issues. I have seen reviews for chapters I could not access.

Don't know if they are working on it, the sites twitter account shows no activity since third of October.
