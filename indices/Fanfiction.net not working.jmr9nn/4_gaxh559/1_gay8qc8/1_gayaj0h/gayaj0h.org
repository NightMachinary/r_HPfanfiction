Rare chapters load fine for me only for them to bug out if I refresh the page. The working chapters allowing me to read and review on desktop. Issue is I don't see a clear pattern as to why.

The sites forum is murder to navigate and no staff have posted on twitter giving us a update about the issue.

Just downloaded the official app thanks.
