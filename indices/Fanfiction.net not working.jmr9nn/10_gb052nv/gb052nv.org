FFN has had caching issues starting near the end of July. For a long time, certain pages would sometimes show a version of the page as if it was near the end of July. This issue went away only last month-ish.

If you have an account, try logging out, or vice versa. This sometimes seemed to help (but I don't really know why).

The last few days, I've seen very weird behaviour of pages in general not loading at all, showing outdated versions, etc. Probably connected to the earlier issue.
