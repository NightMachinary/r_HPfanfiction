I can't say what would happen exactly if you were falling, but I do know that Apparition does not conserve momentum.

In HBP, we see Harry and Dumbledore Apparate between the south of England and Hogwarts (somewhere in Scotland). If momentum was conserved, the difference in rotational velocity of the Earth's surface would have been deadly.

If your momentum is already being changed, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to save yourself. However, you would have to be quite skilled and calm to be able to muster the right Deliberation and Destination while falling to your likely death.

A very large fall (say out of an aeroplane) would be a much better situation for this than falling out of a tall building. Even a fall from a 20-story building only gives you a few seconds to react, compared to the few minutes it might take to fall at terminal velocity from 35000 ft.
