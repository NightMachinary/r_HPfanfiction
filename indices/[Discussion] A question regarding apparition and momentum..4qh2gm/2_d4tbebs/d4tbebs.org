I think that we are assuming that Apparation is teleportation. Upon further thinking, I would state that Apparation is Transmigration, not teleportation. That is the key to the question you ask. Teleportation is when one person's complete being is moved to point B nearly instantaneously from point A. But we know that Apparation is not instantaneous, as there is enough time for people grab onto you as you Apparate, for there to be a knife to embed itself into your chest, and for air to displace twice. The latter is essential to notice. Since there are two pops every time a person Apparates, that means it cannot be instantaneous since two pops are heard. If it was instantaneous then only one pop would be heard. That being said, if it was teleportation, then momentum would be conserved, thus you would go splat.

Transmigration however is when something (in this case a magical being) is moved to another destination in such a way that distance is hardly a factor. This means that unlike teleportation which by definition must be instantaneous, Transmigration does not. Transmigration also would not be affected by momentum since its NOT instantaneous. It explains why people can Apparate in midstride, in midair, and why altitude does not seem to matter to the one who is Apparating.

TL:DR- Apparation is Transmigration, thus momentum does not play a factor.
