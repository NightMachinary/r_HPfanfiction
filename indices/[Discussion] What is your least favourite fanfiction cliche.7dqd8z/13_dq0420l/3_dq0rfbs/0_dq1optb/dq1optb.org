In my head-canon, they're basically illusions that at best makes a kind of uncanny valley effect that even muggles may be creeped out by. Also, they only change what you see, but nothing more.

For good disguises, what Hermione did to Ron before their Gringotts heist is more along the right direction. Someone like McGonagall could have made Ron look like Dumbledore (as picture perfect as she remembers him) if she was given half an hour.

I.e. illusions/"Glamours" are basically useless for anything more than a party trick, or to hide a pimple or two.
