I use glamours in my story to change the character's appearance in a way that makes other characters second-guess who they're looking at. I use minor changes, like adding or hiding freckles, making the face appear slightly longer or narrower, changing the shade of their hair a bit, hiding scars (very rarely do I create scars) using makeup to change the shape of the lips or eyes, or any combination of the above. The idea is that the person would look to most other characters like a familiar face that they can't quite place, but characters who are close to that person would recognise their voice and mannerisms. If I don't want close characters to recognise them, the character will consciously try to change their mannerisms and voice, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.
