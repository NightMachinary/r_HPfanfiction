Oh, I understand that completely. That's why people close to a glamoured character would almost always recognise them. A member of the general public wouldn't be so familiar with the cues given by the character's body, so would struggle a bit more with identifying them. There's also doppelgängers to consider; most people are aware that everyone has a doppelgänger out there somewhere, or a very similar looking person. If they were to see, say, Hermione in a place where nobody would expect to find her - let's say, a strip club for example - but she looked ever-so-slightly off, most people would go, “Oh, they have a Hermione Granger dancer!” rather than, “Hermione Granger is a stripper?” - At least, that's what my friends and I thought when we went to a show with a Chris Hemsworth look alike.
