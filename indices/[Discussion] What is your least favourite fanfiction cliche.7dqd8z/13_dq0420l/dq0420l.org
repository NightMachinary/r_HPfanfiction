For me it's bad fanon being taken for granted, and not even explained, as if they were known canon stuff by that point.

- Tom Riddle got away because he used someone else's wand that didnt' have a tracking charm. (Canon makes it very obvious that the Trace detects magic being done close to an underage witch/wizard.)

- Ginny Weasley went out with Micheal Corner and Dean Thomas for the sole purpose of making Harry jealous, and not because she was a rather popular teenage girl.

- Want a perfect disguise without bothering with this stupid transfiguration stuff or brewing a Polyjuice Potions? Use a Glamour charm! A perfect disguise, spelled in a heartbeat!

Along with bashing and seer!Luna (or worse, proto-seer!Luna Pandora), of course.
