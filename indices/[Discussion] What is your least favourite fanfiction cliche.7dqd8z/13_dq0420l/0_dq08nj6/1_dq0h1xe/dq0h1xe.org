I think that's always going to be a point of contention. But from my perspective, Hermione's advice was essentially advice given to Ginny to move on and stop carrying that torch for Harry, maybe he'd come around, maybe he wouldn't, but unrequited love isn't romantic or healthy.

Waiting in the wings for the boy you've liked forever to notice you isn't something you have to subject yourself to. If they're showing absolutely no romantic in you, you /should/ date other people. You don't have to exile yourself from romantic relationships.
