To be honest, it's part of my biggest pet peeve with Marauder's era / time travel fics. Frank Longbottom being the clumsy herbiology prodigy, Lily Evans being some sort of glorified Hermione copy, Pandora not-yet-Lovegood as a copy of "Luna", complete with the "Sight", Snorkacks and radish earrings; and so on and so forth.

The Debd of Time used tthe future Mrs Lovegood as an outlet for the author's "profound" rubbish, (along with claiming that she came from some matrilineal line of seer daughters who lost their mothers at the age of nine.)
