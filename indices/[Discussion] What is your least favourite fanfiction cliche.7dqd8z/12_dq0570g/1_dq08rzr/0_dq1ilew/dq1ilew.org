There's a difference between stupidity and lacking logic. A logic is simply a formal system of reasoning. There are many different types of logical systems, depending on what axioms you assume.

It is probably more accurate to say that wizards use different logic to Muggles than to say they do not have logic at all. They use a logic which makes sense to them within the norms of their world.

For example, the law of excluded middle is a feature of most logical systems (but not all). Basically this states that something can be either true or false but it cannot be both or neither. That works pretty well for us Muggles because the world /generally/ behaves like that. But for wizards such a logical rule would seem nonsensical. They interact with things that are simultaneously in two different states on a daily basis.
