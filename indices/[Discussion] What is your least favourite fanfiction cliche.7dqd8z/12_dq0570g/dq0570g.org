*Assuming an exploit*

This is more of a common /theme/ than a specific plot element. It is best illustrated by some examples:

- Magically binding agreements exist in canon but they are not used extensively to guarantee loyalty and honesty across society. Since the limitations on oaths/contracts are not explicitly explained, the author assumes that there are no limitations and wizards are just too stupid to have seen the exploit.

- Veritaserum exists in canon but is not used extensively in trials. Since its limitations are not explained (though actually they have been by JKR in interview) the author assumes that there are no limitations and wizards are just too stupid to have seen the exploit.

Basically it's where an author sees an absence of an explicit explanation in canon and assumes a plot hole rather than something that the reader just doesn't know (but which wizards do).

I think it's far more interesting worldbuilding to fill in the gaps in the reader's knowledge in ways which are consistent with the rest of the magic system and world, rather than assume that the world has huge holes in it.
