Least favorite fanfiction cliche?

Molly and Ginny were secretly giving Harry a love potion to make him love Ginny. Hermione and Ron weren't true friends of his and were just using him for his money and fame. Harry had a ton of bank accounts at Gringotts and was the lord/heir/inheritance of not only Potter, but Malfoy, Black, Slytherin ect extra.

Ice Princess/Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass. The fact that Daphne is written so much at all is pretty much a cliche since her name was mentioned what? Once in canon. But I don't see her as the Ice Princess/Ice Queen

After saving Hermione, Ginny, Gabrielle ect extra he gets to have his own harem basically.

Child Abuser James and Lily: I see them loving their son, even if he wasn't the Boy-Who-Lived and it was someone else.

The Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived plot where everyone thinks that it's Harry's sister or brother but it turns out to be Harry all along (Gasp who would have thought). I'd love to read stories where people think it's Harry through out and it actually is. Or think it's Harry and it's actually his sister or brother. Now that would be a twist.

Goblins being nice because Harry was respectful to them and used a title for them and everything. (This normally ties into the whole everyone who was good was actually out to get his fame and fortune cliche).

Cliches where the only thing that Ron and Hermione do in the stories is argue with each other and that's all they do. I get that they argued a lot in the series, but that's not all they did in the series.

One of the reasons why I dislike Harry/Hermione as a pairing is because of how fanfiction has written them together. Harry suddenly ends up super powerful or super smart, Hermione ends up being the perfect girl just so Harry doesn't end with anyone else. I think I'd enjoy the pairing more if it was written believably, but unfortunately more often then not both characters just seem so out of character. And then the whole jealousy thing that writers have to do with Ron, that really throws me off. Sure I can see him getting jealous, that's what he does; but in the end he'll be happy for his friends and would still want to be friends with them. (That's how I see it anyway if they got together).

Also cliches where every Weasley except for Fred and George and sometimes Arthur are complete jerks to Harry for his fame and money; which ties back to the earlier thing I said.
