I have the same opinion, candy with veritaserum is a completely ridiculous concept and very OOC for Dumbledore. It's also illegal and Dumbledore doesn't need to stoop that low to get information. It would also be fairly easy for someone to realize that they just spilled all their secrets due to candy. There are very specific signs of veritaserum that are easy enough to recognize.

As for why people talk with him, maybe its because they are comfortable with him? Because he is a headmaster of Hogwarts and a famous, powerful wizard? He is also a nice person and tries to get people comfortable, relaxed and makes people feel like he likes and appreciates them. There are plenty of people in real life who are really good at getting information out of people without any magic candies helping them. And when do people spill all kinds of secrets to him in canon anyways? I don't really remember any scenes where he could actually be giving people truth potions without them noticing.
