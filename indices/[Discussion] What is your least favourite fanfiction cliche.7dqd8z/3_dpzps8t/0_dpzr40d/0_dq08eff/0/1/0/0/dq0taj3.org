Exactly. I am tolerate - and sometimes write - the use of veritaserum, but only ever in such a small dose that it has little or no bearing on the outcome other than causing a character or group of characters to be wary. I mean, if someone like Lucius Malfoy was trying to come over to the light side, Dumbledore would probably be pretty wary, so I could understand him resorting to veritaserum then - although as far as I know, he didn't use it for Snape, which is a very similar situation.
