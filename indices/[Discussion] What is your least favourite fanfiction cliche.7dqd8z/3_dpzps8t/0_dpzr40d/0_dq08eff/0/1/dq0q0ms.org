I also don't like seeing Dumbledore offering candy laced with suggestion potions, however another common one is veritaserum. I was wondering where you would stand on that as it isn't so much a device for influencing a person to do something, but more a means of gathering accurate information. I know it also depends on the amount of veritaserum in the candy because I find it's just plain annoying when there's so much that the character just starts spilling their guts all over the place, but I don't mind so much when it's a small enough amount that the person feels inclined to tell the truth, but is not necessarily forced to, meaning someone with a strong enough mind would still be able to mince their words and not tell the whole truth - someone like Snape, possibly Harry, Hermione or McGonagall.
