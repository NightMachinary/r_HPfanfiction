Oh, I definitely agree that he is manipulative in canon. There is a big difference though between people who write manipulative!Dumbledore fics and those who keep him manipulative and somewhat true to canon. I just really don't like the former while the latter can be really great and well written. I feel like too many people just use him being manipulative as an excuse to make him as manipulative and/or stupid as possible to bash the crap out of him. Like all those fics where lemon candy is laced with suggestion potions (I still can't believe people actually include that detail in serious fics).

Better fics recognize that he is human and while they write him as manipulative to an extent it's not overdone, it's more on the realistic side of manipulative and its not used as an excuse to bash him. I do enjoy fics that point out canon ridiculousness in regards to his character though. linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) was a great take on the whole finding and reading the Harry Potter books trope. It really does a good job of pointing out how Dumbledores actions are kind of messed up if taken seriously. And the best part is that it doesn't read like a bashing fic, just one that makes fun a bit of canon and Dumbledore's actions without overdoing it.
