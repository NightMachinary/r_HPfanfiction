I can't stand when that happens either but thankfully I very rarely come across fics where characters act like that. I basically tend to quit reading by the first two paragraphs unless I like the writing quality, style of writing, characterizations and nothing sets off any red flags. While it severely limits the fics that I read, I also have been feeling a lot happier with what I do read. Its nice not having to deal with manipulative, complete idiot Dumbledore or other characters acting really OOC since I generally stop reading as soon as I see the first sign of that happening.
