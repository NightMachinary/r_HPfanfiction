That series is honestly incredible. The soul bond is one of the most poorly executed cliches in FF, but it works /brilliantly/ in Philosophizes' stories. And it's from such a simple turn around of the cliche too; "Instead of a relationship developing because of a soul bond, what if a soul bond develops because of the relationship?"
