Linkffn(The Debt of Time) is 154 chapters long. It describe a lot about different kinds of bonds, soul bonds included, but like you are describing the people in the bonds don't automatically know what it is. Also it is a time travel fic, so the people in the bonds realize them at completely different times. It's worth a read f you've never read it before.

It's the best representation of soul bonds I've ever read.
