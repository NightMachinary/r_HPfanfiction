I like the idea of soul-bonding. I haven't read a fic yet that has soul-bonding that didn't make me roll my eyes within an hour. So I guess I'd say it's the most disappointing cliche.

The idea that a bond creates a connection between two people is fun, but my issue is that with pretty much all of these stories there is no basis for the connection to be made, and it's almost always accidental.

What I've been looking for is something that takes two characters who actually seem to know each other in the story (meaning that it doesn't start with the soul-bonding incident) and the then the bonding happens, so it makes the connection have an eventual deeper level. If you start out with it the entire relationship being shown feels shallow from beginning to end. They automatically understand each other to the furthest extent you can know someone.

Or somethink Crack-ish where a character is in a situation mixed with hate/lust accidental connection is made where magic just senses great passion between two people and BAM soul-bond with someone you actually hate. Sounds like a nice guilty pleasure story, but it's something I haven't found.

So yeah. Soul-bonding...ehhh. :(
