Something that's used often, isn't original, and can often be irritating to see for the hundredth time.

Examples of cliches in Harry Potter fanfiction:

- Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-whateverthehell

- Love potion making Ginny & Molly

- Goblins being super nice and friendly because Harry's polite or remembered Griphook's name

- Harry becomes incredibly powerful over the summer

- Dumbledore being completely evil, stealing from Harry's vault, planning his death, blah blah blah, Greater Good
