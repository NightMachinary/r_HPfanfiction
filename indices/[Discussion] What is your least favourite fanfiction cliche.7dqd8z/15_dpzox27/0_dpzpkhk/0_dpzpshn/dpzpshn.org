Okay, thank you Autumn! :) I have never written those things in my fanfictions before. But yes I have seen them when I read other stories online. I do not like to read about love potion using at all, and I do not like Dumbledore being evil because while he kept secrets and was a very flawed person he still did very good things for people and for the world.
