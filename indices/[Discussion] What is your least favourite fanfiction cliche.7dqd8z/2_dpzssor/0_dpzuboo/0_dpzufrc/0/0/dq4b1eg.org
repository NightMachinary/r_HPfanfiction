[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Here]] is the TV Tropes page for Draco in Leather Pants (standard TVTropes warning, abandon hope all ye who enter here) and the dictionary definition of the verb Whitewashing is to "deliberately attempt to conceal unpleasant facts about (a person or organization)."

This means that to whitewash a character is to take an evil or otherwise terrible person and make them out to be the good guy, whether that's by completely ignoring all of the shit they did or trying to make it seem like they were a noble and heroic person who was forced to do that, and is still a better person than any other character despite the fact that they ordered the genocide of an entire country or committed some other war crime.

Draco in Leather Pants is whitewashing a character because they are physically attractive.
