For me it is obvious

The whole sequence of

Harry escapes "Durzkaban" > Gets a letter from gringotts about accounts > calls griphook by name, who remarks Harry is an unusual wizard and suddenly becomes ultra friendly with occasional sprouts of "feral" behavioral > inheriting half of wizarding worlds wealth and finding out why Dumbledore hid it > fake marriage contracts > Goblin healers > finding out Dumbledore "locked" his powers > removing block > suddenly becoming this 7 foot beast with 12 pack abs and magical power enough to flatten the entire world > gets to know he has a marriage contract(usually Daphne) and so on.
