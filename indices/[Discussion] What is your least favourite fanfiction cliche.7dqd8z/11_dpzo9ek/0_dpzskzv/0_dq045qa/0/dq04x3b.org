I'm sorry I don't quite understand the question you're asking. Do you want an example of a character being called out on their bullshit whilst not being bashed ?

Yeah, I do agree that most authors that bash characters tend to take a minor flaw or an action they don't agree with and dial it up to 11. An example of this: Ron was acting jealous during book 4 > Ron was disloyal > Ron becomes a death eater.
