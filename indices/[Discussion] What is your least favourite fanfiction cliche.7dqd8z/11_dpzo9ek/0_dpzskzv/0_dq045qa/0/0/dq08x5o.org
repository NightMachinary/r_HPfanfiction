Oh I see what you mean!

I remember there was one fic where Hermione was thinking about why she and Ron couldn't work and her conclusion was that after he left them in the tent she just couldn't trust him to stick around when the shit hit the fan. Which is, imo, a legit concern.

Anyway there were a lot of comments accusing the author of bashing Ron.

And I mean, I can sort of understand why Ron fans would automatically be defensive of him, because he's an easy character to bash. But there's a difference between pointing out a character's flaws and bashing them.
