  Betad by Eider Down.Severus remembered dying, bleeding out, his consciousness barely there. He remembered pain. He remembered his one last look into those green eyes, doomed as they were to join him soon in death. His heart ached, as his neck ached, as his body ached.He greeted death as a friend.Severus didn't expect to wake up. It was rather disconcerting, really. One moment he was drifting away, and the next he was aware of his body again, just as sore as before. It felt approximately the way he imagined coming back from the brink of death should feel like. Which is to say, fucking awful.Hell would have been preferable, instead he's now back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. What should he do? Can he change events for the better? Whom can he trust?Meanwhile, there's something slightly...off about his cousin Dudley. Only time will tell, but at least that's something he has plenty of now.Severus is about to find out why they say you should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus (Sevitus) you'll ever read.
