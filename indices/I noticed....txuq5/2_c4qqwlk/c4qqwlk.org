I can appreciate a fic that starts midway through like you reference, but I'm a fan of the epics... I like it when the author starts with year one. Naturally, it has to be well done and not a parrot of the books, which can be difficult to find.

I also really like various pairings. I'm a sucker for a good love story, but I'm not really partial to any specific ship. I do tend to read most Hermione pairings, though.
