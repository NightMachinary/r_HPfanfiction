Quite a number of the fics I find interesting tend to feature Harry as a girl at some stage.

A fair number of them also feature Harry with a stranger background and/or doing something completely different.

My biggest 'goddamnit man' thing is the pairings. Specifically, they happen in almost every damn fic I come across and are taken awfully seriously for no good reason. Do you know how annoying that is? Okay, so I am guilty of this indulgence too, but I would dearly love to read a fic without any pairings. Which is why I am writing one now.
