Lightning on the Wave has a brilliantly written septology (perhaps the only complete HP fanfic septology to have ever been completed?) called the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning_on_the_Wave][Sacrifices Arc.]]

The first two books are relatively short and focus on developing atmosphere and HP/Draco, but the series really takes off IMO with the third book. It's not completely dominated by HP/Draco since it features a pretty much ensemble cast, but Lightning does a fantastic job developing and justifying the perspectives of the myriad characters.

I think one of its major strengths is that it fleshes out one of the most delicately thought-out environments I've ever had the pleasure to read. It really is one of the most well-written series out there. I highly highly recommend checking it out.
