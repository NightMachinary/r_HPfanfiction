Most of my favorite fan fics have been betaed. (Hint to you aspiring writers out there.) :P

But seriously, I almost only read fics with Harry as the main character. Other then that, I am willing to try a lot of new things. I don't mind slash or het, but I think my favorite pairing is probably Harry/Draco.

I started really getting into reading fanfic after OotP came out, so I will always have a soft spot in my heart for fics that start after fifth year. So much delicious angst.

I also love AUs, especially creative ones that haven't been done before. And time travel.

As you can see, I like a lot of different things...
