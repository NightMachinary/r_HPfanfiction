My taste has evolved over the years and its getting further and further away from canon. My favorite will always be Azkaban fics. You know, Harry betrayed and sent to azkaban. Escapes or released, ignores or becomes powerful, makes up with friends or not. Or inherits the island. All good.

Then you have Dumbledore bashing which I've become fond of.
