Do you also have a secret wish that Harry's home life was actually worse so he has a reason to whine or become a complete bad-ass? Evil/Manipulative/Senile Dumbles has also become something I enjoy. I kind of wish that Harry Potter was at least a young adult's novel so that the story could have taken the dramatic turns that it has the potential to have?
