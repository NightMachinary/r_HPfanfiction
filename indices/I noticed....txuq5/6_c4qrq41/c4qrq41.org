I like short stories, stories that delve into moments of a character. I'm a big fan of minor characters (and also Draco) in the Post-Hogwarts setting, and seeing how they've been affected by the war.

I've never been too interested in the main trio just because I've already read their story and it's enough for me. I'd rather explore the other parts of JKR's world, and play with the peculiar rules and culture she's given us, because that's really what draws me in, in reading and writing fic. Some of the best original fiction-esque stories I've read are from this fandom, and people can do some crazy creative stuff with it.
