I was being sarcastic, but it's still a stupid measure. Like "stone". How much is one stone? A small pebble from the beach? A giant boulder that can crush your car? We'll never know. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

As far as essays go- it's entirely possible we were thought differently. Our school program was a bit dated and I graduated years ago. We only ever did essays in Literature. At university, we called the homework either assignments or course work and those were indeed 8- 12 pages. Though many professors didn't care about word count so tables and graphs were used liberally. I think it's best just to set a word count instead of pages (or feet) as a requirement.
