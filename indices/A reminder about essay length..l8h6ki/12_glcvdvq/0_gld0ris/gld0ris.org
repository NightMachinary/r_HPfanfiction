I wrote 8-12 pages essays in university, you can definitely have essays that are longer than 2 pages. I would also say that a good essay should try to persuade or argue something. It should be supported by facts from the text and not just be opinion.

Also, not sure if you're being sarcastic about measuring things by feet. A foot is a unit of measure that is 12 inches, not literal feet.
