8-12 pages is for an essay with a decent amount of time and research. Don't the professors give them like a week or even just a weekend usually? For a typed essay that's pretty hard. I'd say 5-6 pages is not too bad for a week though. However, I'd also say for an upper year student 8-12 pages for a handwritten essay over a week is not too unreasonable.
