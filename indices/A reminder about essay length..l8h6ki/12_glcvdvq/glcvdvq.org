4 pages seems a bit long for an essay. We were thought that essays shouldn't be longer than two pages and should be more abstract and focus on the opinions of the writer. What you are describing sounds more like a report or course work- these should be longer and focus more on the theory from class.

And anyway measuring anything in feet is stupid. Like- how do you even measure that? Is it the foot of a small child or a tall adult? Ron would have to write longer essays cause his feet are probably larger than say Hermione's. Use the metric system as every normal, sane person does.
