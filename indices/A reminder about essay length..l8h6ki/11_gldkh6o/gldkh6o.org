I think it's a perception issue. Rowling probably used feet instead of pages because it sounds just different enough (and let's be honest, Magical Britain will be on the Imperial standard for another century if not forever). Although I admit I don't know historically how parchment or papyrus was measured.

Anyway, a foot of parchment sounds very long and while most of us use 8.5x11" paper, we don't think of it in terms of measurement unless we also use legal or some other size as well. It's just a piece of paper. I know I hadn't made that connection until I saw a post pointing it out last year. Perception's everything.

They might do better to say X number of words as opposed to 2 feet; surely there's a charm or spell to count your words?
