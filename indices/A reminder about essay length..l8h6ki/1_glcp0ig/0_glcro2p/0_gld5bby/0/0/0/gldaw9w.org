Same here. I study Linguistics (with an emphasis on German and Germanic) and ancient History. I'm not surprised that our Linguistics professors put a lot of value on form, but I was kinda surprised that the professors at the faculty of History do as well. It's not a critique, I actually admire the attention to detail. Sadly I don't study at an english speaking University, so I have no idea how the Brits do it.
