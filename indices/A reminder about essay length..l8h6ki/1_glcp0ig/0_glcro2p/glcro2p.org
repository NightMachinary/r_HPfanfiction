Well that depends on the assignment. At Uni we have to write essay-like answers when we're taking our exams. Some professors give us a minimum of how many words we have to write while others give us the exact opposite. It's not that they don't want to read too many exhaustingly long essays (well that might be the reason partly), but because they want us to learn how to express ourselves with only a limited amount of space but with a need to explain a topic thoroughly. They want us to be precise with as few words as possible. That might not be entirely the reason NEWT essays aren't that long but I find that writing short essays of high quality is a rather nica challenge. And in the real world, you often do find that the quality of the written trumps the quantity (i.e. the lenght).
