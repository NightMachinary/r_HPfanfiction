  And do we know what width a HP parchment scroll would come in at?

Assuming the parchment-makers are cutting to sheet and folio sizes for writing paper common in Britain since the 16th century (at least, it may be older, but that's the earliest I could find with a quick google), 8.5 inches. They're only cutting for width, of course: length is 'however long the piece of hide is at this point' and then rolled up as a scroll.
