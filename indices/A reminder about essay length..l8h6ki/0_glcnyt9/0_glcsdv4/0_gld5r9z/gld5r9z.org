Might also struggle to find enough material on a given topic, given that some topics could have deeper implications and more advanced uses, but not something that a 2nd year student would need, or know to look for.

In my HS experience.... I remember getting plenty of "Exceeds Expectations" on Outstanding work because I'd exhausted the topic on one page, and the teacher expected four. Would drop me lower, but I'd always done my research so all the relevant information would be written down - just compressed and lacking in the usual HS off-tangent babble.

^{Got my revenge when doing medieval times in history. It was something both easy to research and with wide selection of sources. My essay made a nice 'thunk' when I went to drop it off. Because the teacher had a habit of leaving red pen all over the student's work (even if it was just an "OK" next to a paragraph}, ^{she had to read it all and check my sources - some of which were paper-only and available in select places.})
