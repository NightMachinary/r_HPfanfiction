I do want to point out that struggles are relative. If they've only ever needed to write half a foot of essay, then suddenly have to write two feet, that is to them what you suddenly needing to write eight pages would be. I remember complaining when my school cafeteria changed the chips, but schools in more deprived areas might struggle to even pay for resources.

Also, they're students and children. If my memories of being that age are even vaguely accurate, we'd've bitched about a millimetre of homework and no bullet points, nevermind a foot in a quill pen.

My main questions are to the more canon-knowledgeable people though - what essay lengths were mentioned in canon? What was Harry's point of "Fuck this shit"? And do we know what width a HP parchment scroll would come in at?
