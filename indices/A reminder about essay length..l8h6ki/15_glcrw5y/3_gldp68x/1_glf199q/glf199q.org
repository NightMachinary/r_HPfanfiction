I gotta admit, I always loved writing. Even as a child, I could sit and write for hours. But I always hated writing what other people told me to and would always end up twisting "Write something about topic X" into "Writing something vaguely around topic X/Y". I once wrote a workplace review of the ship from the first Dead Space for a piece of psychology homework asking me to discuss and illustrate the importance of a particular workplace issue we'd talked about the previous lesson (I think I chose 'clear communication').

Weirdly, one of my highest grades ever, only surpassed by the time I answered one of my university psychology exams entirely using my A-Level sociology and a quote from Freud that I never actually wrote once in the entire exam. :D

But yeah, to bring it back to your point, rather than the odd flex this apparently turned into, I was definitely one of those weird kids. :D
