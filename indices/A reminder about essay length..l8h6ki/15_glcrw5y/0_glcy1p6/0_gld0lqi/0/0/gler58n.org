U.K. schools normally run from ~9 to ~4 - so getting an hour of homework done per night on top of dinner and quidditch or other extracurricular clubs and being in bed by a reasonable 11 year old's bedtime is a lot.

I certainly never had that amount of homework until I was in the later years of school (maybe an hour a week as long as you'd finished your set work in class, up until I was in my exam years), and by then we were taking fewer subjects so had more study periods and free periods to get the homework done in.
