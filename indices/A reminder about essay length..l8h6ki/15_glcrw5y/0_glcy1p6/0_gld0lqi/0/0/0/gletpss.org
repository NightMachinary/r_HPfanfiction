Ah, yes, I completely agree. I meant more that 4-5 hours isn't "nothing". I think I was set an hour a day in secondary, but that was mainly the teachers trying to impress hard work on us. There were probably about 2 kids who actually did that much. (Not me, for sure. I don't think I did that much even with free periods.)
