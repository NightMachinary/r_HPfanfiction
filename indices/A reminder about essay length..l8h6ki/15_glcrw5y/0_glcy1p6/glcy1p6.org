Compared to Hermione, Harry had a lot of other stuff going on, Quidditch practice multiple times a week, a lot of detentions and various other things throughout the years. Aside from this, while he doesn't get top marks in everything, Harry still does well at school. Maybe if he was a normal kid and not 'the boy who lived', he would have had time to be more dedicated in his studies.
