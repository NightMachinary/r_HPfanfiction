This is what annoyed me so much in the books and fanfic. The essays aren't even that long. Like, when you look at it in retrospect, Hermione isn't some super-genius nerd, she's just someone who actually gives a half fuck about school. Actually, I was super surprised when Harry showed no interest at being anything like Hermione. He has the capacity, so why not? He didn't grow up in the wizarding world like Ron or Draco, so shouldn't he want to learn more and such? He was so happy to become part of the wizarding world but then he made no obvious sign he had any ambition to learn more about the world he should've been a part of or about his family history.

I don't know, it just never really made all that sense to me.
