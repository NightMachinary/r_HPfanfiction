flamethrower: Of a Linear Circle [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]]

The time travel happens in part three, though it's worth the wait as someone from the Founder era time travels to 1995 first. The story has a slash relationship but it's not the focus of the story.

The best fic I've read.
