Oh joy, a kindred spirit. I'm in the middle of a story that sort of wrote itself (+even though I have other stories to work on dammit+) where I focus on the relationship between the /Goblins/ and the various other races/people. This includes the French Goblins, Banshees, Leprechauns, Giants, and, of course, all sorts of wizards (aside from foreign dignitaries, Umbride, Malfoy and Dumbledore all show up).
