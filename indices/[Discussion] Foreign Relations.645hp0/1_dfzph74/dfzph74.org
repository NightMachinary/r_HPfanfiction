I think there's a lot of room for reasonable interpretation here. A wise reader not form too close an attachment to any particular headcanon (unless they want to be irked by every fic that discusses non-wizards).

Conversely, a wise author should not bash their personal headcanon over the reader's head. (Looking at you, /Prince of Slytherin/.)
