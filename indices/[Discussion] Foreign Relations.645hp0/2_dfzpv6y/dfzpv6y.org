These are all really great questions!

Dementors: According to [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/azkaban][Pottermore]] it does appear that the use of Azkaban as a prison was an attempt to 'kill two birds with one stone' forced by a corrupt minister. Attempts at reform were made, but their was no headway until Kingsley. Since Kingsley managed to remove Dementors as guards of Azkaban I imagine that wizards don't need to placate the Dementors, perhaps instead they set up a permanent specialist force to protect the Wizarding World.

Centaurs: I don't think the Ministery has much say in Centaur affairs. The only thing they do is as you say, restrict their territory, I imagine they enforce the Statue of Secrecy and not much else. Although I believe they are considered a part of 'Wizarding Britain' such that they are included in the fountain.

Goblins: In terms of passing down items, it might depend upon the Goblin. Would they all have similar views to Griphook? Griphook might be more passionate about Goblin culture. They seem to work alongside Wizards on a regular basis, which suggests they are probably the most integrated sentient being. The main issues that I could see arising involve the justice system and significant cultural differences. Goblins might have their own form of justice (or retribution) if a wizard were to kill a Goblin, would the Goblins expect to exact their own form of justice? What about a Goblin killing another Goblin? I think those issues are what the Goblin Liasion Office is intended for. I think that Goblins are a constant issue for the Ministry, more so than anything else. Goblins might be given the freedom to enact their own form of justice (do we here of Goblins-or actually any other creature in Azkaban?), but are expected to abide by the Statue of Secrecy and keep open negotiations between the Ministry.

Muggles: I think it all depends on each individual government. Some governments might be more involved with their Muggle counterparts, others might not negotiate at all.
