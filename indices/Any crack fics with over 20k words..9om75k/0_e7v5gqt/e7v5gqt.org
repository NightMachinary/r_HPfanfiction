Ooh boy. I've been planning on making a list of ALL crack fics even a little worth reading, as a reference, and this is probably the broadest request where this would fit, so let me get started. Also, I'm sorry, but it's a crack/humor list, not pure crack.

In order of downloaded fics on my ffn app, aka in no particular order, let's go: linkffn(Seventh Horcrux; Make a Wish; Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood; Reunion by Rorschach's Blot; Lovegood, Boobs Gooder; Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake; Let's do the Time Warp Again; Once upon a Freakin' time; Harry Potter and the Azkaban Parody; Bestest Birthday Ever; Where in the world is Harry Potter?; A Black Comedy; Dimension Hopping for Beginners; A Sarcastic Git's Golden Rules at Hogwarts; Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor; Harry Potter and the Freak Parade; The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton; Just a Random Tuesday; Dear Order; Fugitives of Azkaban; A Bad Week at the Wizengamot; The Original Naked Quidditch Match; Crack'd Mirror; The Horror! The Horror!; Timely Errors; Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot; Oh God Not Again!; When in doubt, Obliviate; On a train, switching tracks; The Parselmouth of Gryffindor; Weeb by Andrius; The inner eye of Harry Potter; Jackalopes and Jobberknolls; All the Dementors of Azkaban; Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion; Gryffindors never die; Harry the Hufflepuff; The Professors' Point of View; Harry Potter and the Life Changing Head Injury; Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia; In the Mind of a Scientist; The Adventures of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited; Biting the hand that feeds you; Inspected by No 13; On a Pale Horse; Messing With Time; The Evil Overlord List; Boredom is Deadly; Itachi, is that a baby?; Trolling the Toad; Best Served Cold; Harry Potter and the Uncle of Secrets; A Dramatic Reading; Full Circle; We, Harry Potter). ^{I'm} ^{sorry,} ^{ffnbot.}

Not included are: fic compilations (check out Rorschach's Blot, nonjon, BajaB and Clell) sequels to mentioned fics and fics under 20k. Also, shout out to linkffn(Wearing the Faces of Men), a spinoff crossover between Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus and Pokemon, as the MOST hilarious fic I've ever read.

Fics I've discovered since then:
