An crazy and often funny/humourus/comical fic where you ask yourself if the author was on crack while writing it. It can be a parody or just some funny fic. It doesn't need to be jokes after jokes but the behaviour of some characters, the situations and problem resolution, ... but it often is quite funny because of the sheer non-plausibility of it.

As an easy example in a fic in "Saying No", there is a fridge which has mutated and is seemingly alive. At the beginning this doesn't seem important and a funny background information or recurring joke but later it become more important and even more crazy (with an army of man-eating books).

In the classic known fic there are for example "A Black Comedy" and the Mr Black saga (beginning with Make A Wish). Both already linked on this thread.
