Not the specific one you are looking for at all, but I'm about 85% sure that not yet revealed Potter Regency Council in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council][Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council]] is essentially this. In this fic there are five AU versions of Harry that can communicate telepathically with each other across dimensions. There's also a mysterious Regency Council that is doing stuff behind the scenes, and I'm pretty sure it is made up of yet more AU Harrys, but older ones whose timestreams are not synced with the five main characters of the fic, who have already defeated their Voldemort. I could be wrong, but there are hints indicating this imo. So not really raising Harry, but they are effecting the lives of the various Harrys, at least a little.
