You could also create a server session (referenced via cookie or generated id as get-parameter) and present the user with a waiting page. That way the processing can take as long as it needs to and the user gets a quick reply instead of waiting on a perpetually loading page. You could even use ajax-polls in the background or timed page reloads coupled with a server-side redirect to the download once the processing is finished.
