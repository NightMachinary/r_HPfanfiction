So some rules/framework I thought about today could be

- Only complete fics (so there are definite endings to discuss)
- All genres, but one a week. For example Adventure fic w/1 Fantasy w/2 etc (perhaps starting in alphabetical order?)
- Discussion thread every Friday close on the Sunday with next weeks fic to be read.
- Only freely available fic forums should be used aka sites you don't have to have an account on to read stories (because it wouldn't be fair to make someone sigh-up)
- Only the most reviewed/Favorited/nominated stories and/or controversial stories (I know some sites have competitions, we could use these to make a 'to read list'?)
- No complaining that you've already read the fic of the week, (because its bound to happen) and who knows reading it from a discussion point of view might change your perception of the story.
- Don't not read a fic because you don't like the pairing/setting (it may be excruciating but reading it anyway because you might be seeing something other people are missing/not thinking about)

Ok that's all I got for now, discuss :)
