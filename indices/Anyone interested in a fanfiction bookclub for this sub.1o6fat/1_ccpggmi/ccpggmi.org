Sure, but what would the rules be? There are an awful lot of fics out there, and some of the best just happen to be either unfinished and/or abandoned.

That's not even mentioning those amongst us that write fanfiction too (such as yours truly) who would be VERY interested in getting some feedback out of this-and might decide to, you know, surreptitiously influence others into reading their own fics.

Not that I would do such a thing, mind you. My account name is the same on both reddit and ff.net, which would make any such attempt an exercise in stupidity, but it could happen.

So what rules would we use?
