Oooh A03 (what its called) is so freaking awesome as a site. It doesnt have nearly the quantity as FFN but its growing and I like that it has options like letting you download any story right into any format. For me I can browse stories and download them straight into the Kindle or Ibooks app on my ipad to read offline. Much better story searching and meta tagging and I like the overall format alot better.

Is it sad to be be fangirling all over a fanfic reading site?? Anyhow I read 3 fandoms there, Harry Potter, Avengers, and Sherlock (bbc) and have been pretty happy.
