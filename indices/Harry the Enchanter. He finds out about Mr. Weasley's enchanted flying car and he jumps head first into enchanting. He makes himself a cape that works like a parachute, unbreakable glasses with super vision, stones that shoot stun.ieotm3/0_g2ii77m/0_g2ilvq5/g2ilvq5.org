I came here to say this. The romance in that fic is kinda meh, but Shiva is the best mentor in HP fanfics, second to none. I have searched far and wide but could find no story which came even close.

And while an OP Harry fic, there is actual conflict resulting from that and his consequent decisions (trying to use runes as shortcuts for actual magic, disregard for safety standards and so on).
