So I was going to read this cause the premise sounds really good to me. But when I started it told me the pairings, plural. There is nothing I hate more than harem Harry, I also don't read anything where the pairing is the main premise. Is the harem a large part of the story or is it more of a sub plot. I could read it if the pairings are a sub plot. What would you recommend
