For decades I was an SSHG exclusive, one of the most popular pairings by far, but the rarepairs are growing on me. I'll now ship Snape with /anyone/.

As part of a festival that requires a background/past rarepair, I'm currently writing a 3-chappy where the fist chapter builds up Snoppy, the second is the breakup and building of SSHG, and the third is the tragic canon-compliant ending.

But I may have to write a fluffy Snoppy to clear out all the angst. Something slice-of-life during the 10 years before HP came to Hogwarts. The Potions Master and the Healer, taking names and kicking ass, breaking curses and relieving suffering, maybe with a little gfd/mommy kink underpinning it all.

Honestly I was a little surprised that Sev/Poppy was so rare! Most fics that feature both of them are platonic, and even those are pretty rare.
