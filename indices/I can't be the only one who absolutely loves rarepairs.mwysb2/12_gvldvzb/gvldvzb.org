I would love to see a proper post war fic, featuring Harry/Minerva. A slightly rougish and charming Adventurer! Harry, breaking through that legendary stern facade holds great appeal to me.

To be clear, I'm talking about a world where magicals live a long time, depending on their power, and Minerva is quite the powerful witch.

I Iove Maggie Smith, but I always felt she looked much too old to play McGonagall.
