You're not alone, I absolutely adore Harry/Hestia and-or Flora Carrow

Neville/Padma is another one that I would love to see more often or ever

Another one I love for Harry even in Harem and Multi pairings is Su Li, she is fertile ground for a smart quiet sweet character who perhaps feels out of place
