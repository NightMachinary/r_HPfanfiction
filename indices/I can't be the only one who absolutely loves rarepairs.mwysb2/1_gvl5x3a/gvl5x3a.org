Ron/Harry is a stupidly rare pair for how obvious it is.

Ron/Draco is weirdly rare given how common Drarry and Dramione are. I don't get the appeal of overwriting Draco thoroughly enough for any of the three to become plausible but given Faco is the single most popular character in HPFF you'd think he could get a few goes at Ron, too.
