Hogwarts School of Spellcraft & Sorcery is open to all intelligent magical species. Harry's years of magical schooling aren't just filled with the wonder of magic, but the wonder in cultural differences and commonalities.

The Statute of Secrecy is fragile, and elderly witches & wizards still remember their parents' tales of persecution 300 years ago. Hermione Granger and other muggle-born/raised work on building trust with other magicals and disproving their fears so that they can learn the deepest secrets of magic.

The Ministry of Magic is honest and resilient, but Voldemort is an utterly ruthless master of the mind arts and fighting in the shadows. Even a competent Ministry is little match for a Dark Lord who can turn anyone into his slave or sleeper agent on a whim.

Hmm, I wonder how else the setting could be reconstructed...
