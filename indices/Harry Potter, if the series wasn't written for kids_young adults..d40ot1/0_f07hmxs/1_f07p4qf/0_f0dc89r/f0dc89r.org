If creating a Horcrux, the darkest of magic, requires the taking of an innocent life, then by poetic logic, wilfully /giving/ one's life should invoke the strongest light magic. It's no wonder that when Lily Evans chose to give her life, the protection she invoked on her baby son could repel even the terrible Killing Curse.

*Philosopher's Stone*\\
An attempted robbery at Gringotts, one only thwarted by the targeted object being removed from the bank ahead of time, reveals that Voldemort, somehow, still exists despite his destruction a decade ago.\\
To prevent the Philosopher's Stone from falling into Voldemort's hands, Albus Dumbledore has the Stone brought to Hogwarts, which though it may serve as a school, is still a castle heavily fortified against invaders.\\
But Voldemort is cunning; he's managed to place a bewitched (or brainwashed) agent inside the castle walls. Now Dumbledore and his staff are racing against time, to determine whom of them is an (unwilling?) traitor before he or she can recover the Stone for their master.
