First of all, age up the cast. Have Hogwarts be more of a university/college town. Make the magical world even more isolationist. Then, strip Harry of his everyman personality and give him an injection of drive, ambition, and intelligence.

Flesh out Ron's character, especially /his/ drive and ambition to do something his brothers haven't. Hermione on the other hand does some very questionable and immoral things in canon. Expand on her borderline sociopathic behavior, and how she fights to control her more violent urges.

Now comes the plot. With a more mature story, the philosopher's stone being kept in a school makes no sense. Unless it's not Flamel's stone. Make it Dumbledore's, since we know he's engaged in alchemy in canon. Have Quirrel be competent, accomplished, and a long term Death Eater trying to steal the stone to resurrect his master.

Dumbledore is off for a summit of the ICW, so Quirrel makes his move. The traps are actually dangerous, and not easily solved riddles. Harry faces a powerful dark wizard in a duel and wins, but at some cost such as losing an eye or some fingers to the dark magic. Not to mention that the result of their duel is Quirrel dead. Explore the effect of him killing a teacher.

Continue expanding from there. Maybe the Chamber of Secrets is host to the malevolent wraith of Salazar Slytherin, awakened by Voldemort's horcrux. Prisoner would focus more heavily on the Dementors and their nature plus how they affect Hermione's sociopathic behavior. The Triwizard Tournament has Ron as the Hogwarts Champion because of his sheer ambition to exceed his family. Etc.

That's my two cents on rewriting the series as more mature.
