If you ignore select good guy incompetence and change nothing else, yeah, maybe Harry doesn't have any of his adventures. More needs to be changed/added than that.

A more competent Voldemort/Quirrell and a different chain of events could lead to Harry confronting Quirrell, no plot derived incompetence required.
