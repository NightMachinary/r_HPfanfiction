That sounds awesome but not what OP asked for. You can have "gritty" YA fiction like The Knife of Never Letting Go or stories that dont demand hilarious levels of hand waving and incompetence (His Dark Materials trilogy) but that would require a pretty heavy rework.

You'd need to start with consistent, logical world-building and then outlining your characters with motivations beyond "batshit crazy and wants to kill Harry" and by that point it's no longer "Harry Potter written for adults" its "high fantasy set in magical Britian and oh yeah there's this side character who's just a kid named Harry."
