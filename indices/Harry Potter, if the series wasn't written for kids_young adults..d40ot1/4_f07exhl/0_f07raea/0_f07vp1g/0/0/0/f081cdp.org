Maybe eliminate all plot-derived incompetence, make Voldemort a truly terrifying villain and thus develop an actual and magically realistic plot?

Personally, I'd love a fic that has the gritty realism of World War II (anyone up for a global /wizarding/ war with different cultures and agendas, folks?) where people (doesn't even have to be Harry-Potter-centric, this is an AU after all) have to grow up to lead Wizarding Britain in an actual war (and deal with the consequences).
