I read that 5 years ago or so, and if I recall correctly, wasn't it a little bit derivative? I might be thinking of a different story, but I remember extremely long-winded conversations, followed by tangents, followed by more conversations, followed by a bit of action, which would be smothered by even more long conversations and mental tangents.

Actually I just looked it up; nearly 900,000 words, 10k word chapters, and the meat of the story takes place over the course of just between 1994-1995. Yep, I recalled correctly. I put it down before it was complete, so it might get better, but personally, waiting 500k words to get to the really juicy bits is just too long to wait.
