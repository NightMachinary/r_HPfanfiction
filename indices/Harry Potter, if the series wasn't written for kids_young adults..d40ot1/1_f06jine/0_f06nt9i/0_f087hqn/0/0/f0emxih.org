I read it recently, and personally I found it to be one of the most well-written pieces of fanfic I've read. It's long, yes, however I think that added to it rather than detracting from it. It never felt like it was dragging things out or providing unecessary information, it was just that long because it needed to be in order to get across the plot and developement.

It does world-building and character developement really well, and deals with an OP Harry by keeping him far from perfect, allowing his flaws to make up for his increased power. The adults are major players, rather than relying on contrived bullshit to allow Harry to succeed they have multiple ways of attacking Voldemort. Likewise, the villians are a lot more competant than in canon, so there are still stakes and a sense of danger to the story.

Like I said before, the world-building is fantastic, it goes into detail about politics and branches of magic that both fanfics and canon are lacking. It also plays with fanon tropes and canon, providing unique (and better) spins on things that have already been done. I also felt like the emotional payoffs were done really well.

The characters who are redeemed are also done really well. Dumbledore makes up for his mistakes and is shown to have everyone's best interests at heart, just that he was trying to taje care of everything on his own. Snape and other Death Eaters aren't forgiven, but those that worked with the protagonists were able to move on with their lives.

Overall in the plot there's a lot of cause/effect, setups/payoffs, and consequences to the actions everyone takes. There's also not a lot of contrivances, and no plot holes that I picked up on. It's a pretty solid plot.
