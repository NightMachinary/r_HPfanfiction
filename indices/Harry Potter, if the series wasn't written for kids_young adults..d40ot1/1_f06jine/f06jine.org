So something like Fantastic Beasts, if you are looking for stories where an adult protagonist fights injustice and solves mysteries in the wizarding world (thus more appealing to adult audience)?

Or are you thinking about different things, like fics featuring Harry Potter as a main character but having more emphasis on how teachers, parents and other adults think and act?
