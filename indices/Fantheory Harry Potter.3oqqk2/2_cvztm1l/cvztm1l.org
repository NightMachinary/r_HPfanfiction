It leaves me confused. Your post did prompt me to check the meaning of Remus. [[http://129.74.15.137/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=remus&ending=][I checked with University of Notre Dame]] and Remus technically means /oar/, which does have connections to rowing.

 

Give [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lr7e1/internallyconsistent_reason_for_why_hp_characters/][this recent thread]] a read, it on the "overly appropriate" names of HP.
