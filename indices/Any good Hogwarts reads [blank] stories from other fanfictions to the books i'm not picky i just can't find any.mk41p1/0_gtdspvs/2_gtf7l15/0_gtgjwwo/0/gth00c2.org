Yeah, I think that sequel in particular was just a free-for-all, he basically just handed off the rights to someone and was like "have fun." Hogwarts Houses Divided had a similar situation with its sequel.

I think what he's doing now is finalizing his outlines and having people write them up a la James Patterson, as I don't think he has much time on his hands. But the plot elements for his stuff are probably all coming straight from him.
