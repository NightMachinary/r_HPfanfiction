Ahh, I didn't realize (or I just forgot, since it's been months since I read the fic) that he didn't write the sequel. I know that it has a second author listed, but I thought it was more of a two-people-writing-together sort of thing, or at least a "here is my outline, go fill in the details" arrangement. But if the original author is basically just a consultant on the sequel, it does make sense for it to be completely different.
