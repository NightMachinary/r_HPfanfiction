If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]], you should check it out for sure. It was really creepy and I was on the edge of my seat the whole ride - and was really impressed with the author's imagination.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10561940][The Lost Children]] is short, but really good. I'd love to read more fics like this, actually.

I also second The Eyes by Shadenight123 - that one /terrified/ me, although part of that was because I was house sitting at the time and the creepy story combined with a house and noises I didn't know played all sorts of tricks on my mind. But it qualifies as horror, no doubt.
