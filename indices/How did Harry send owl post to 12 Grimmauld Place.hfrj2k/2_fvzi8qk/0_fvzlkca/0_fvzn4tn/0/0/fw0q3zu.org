You're right that I wouldn't be able to perceive the property But i would know the specific points where the owls disappeared. Eg the property is actually there i just don't realize it is there. So I believe I could identify those 4 spots. Now there may or may not be any difference in those points. If there is then I send a bomb to the center of those points. If there isn't then I send a bomb to the identified point the explosion should hit the property.

The Fidelius charm is like an overpowered illusion. The property exists I just don't see it. So if i decided to launch Fiendfyre at #11 and #13 I believe it would eventually get #12 as it is physically there.
