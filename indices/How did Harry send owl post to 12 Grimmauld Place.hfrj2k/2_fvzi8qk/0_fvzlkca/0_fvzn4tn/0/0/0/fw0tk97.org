  The Fidelius charm is like an overpowered illusion. The property exists I just don't see it. So if i decided to launch Fiendfyre at #11 and #13 I believe it would eventually get #12 as it is physically there.

We don't know if that's how it works. In canon it seems more like it would be impossible to interact with the house in any way unless you know the secret.

  Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-ber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles in-side hadn't even felt anything.

From how it's described, Harry walking between 11 and 13, or casting spells between them, wouldn't be hitting an invisible house, he just wouldn't interact with #12 at all.
