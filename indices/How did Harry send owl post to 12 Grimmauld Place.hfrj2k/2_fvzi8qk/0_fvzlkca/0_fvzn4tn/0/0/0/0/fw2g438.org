I too think that the Fidelius only affects the perception of those who don't know the secret. #12 is getting air, light and sound from the regions outside the Fidelius. Thus you have at least 3 methods of attacking the people inside, aerosolized poison, high powered lasers and sonic weapons. I believe this extends to all inanimate matter in general thus cannon shells and bullets would also have no problem. If you shot a cannon from #11 to #13, I believe it would hit #12.

Another thought comes to mind: If you were standing on the edge of #11 and looking at #12 while someone casts the Fidelius, would you now see the part of #13 that had been obscured by the non-secret #12? Could you use the Fidelius this way to look through walls when spying on someone? Or hell, use this to check a safe's contents and REMOVE them since you can't interact with the wall (and ONLY the wall) but you CAN interact with the items inside the safe?

I think I just stumbled upon a plot bunny...
