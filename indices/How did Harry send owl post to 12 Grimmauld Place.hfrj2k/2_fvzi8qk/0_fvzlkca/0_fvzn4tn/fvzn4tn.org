I'm thinking mundane triangulation via owls assuming the owls can fly to the fidelius charmed property. Get three or four owls release and track the first one. Record the location where the owl disappears. Then from a different direction release the second owl record where it disappears. Repeat process with remaining owls. You have now marked the edges of the Fidelius charmed property. Then either steal, acquire, transfigure, or conjure several 1000 lb muggle bombs or 2 ton boulders and drop them in the center of the marked area and then expand outward towards the marked boundary.

There's a very high probability that the protected property would be in the exact dead center of the marked area unless the caster took steps to extend the fidelius charm in an alternative pattern. (Of course, that's why you start in the center and then work your way to the marked boundary to make sure you get it.)

The above would be the reason why you want to ensure that post owls don't have the capability to fly into a fidelius charmed property.
