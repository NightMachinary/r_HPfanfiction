Plot hole. If the Fidelius charm works as we are told the only way Hedwig could get there is if Dumbledore told her the secret verbally (let's go with Hedwig can't read). Dumbledore could have done that anytime "off camera" at school.

Otherwise all a bad guy would have to do is get a post owl and say Deliver this to james and lily potter, or Sirius Black and then track the owl to their location.
