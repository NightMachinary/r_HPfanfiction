Canon doesn't help that much as it doesn't really explain how the Fidelius charm actually works. We know that it removes the memory of the property from everyone who once knew about it. And until they are told the secret they remember nothing about the property nor can they perceive it. Now there is nothing in canon that says that the property is placed into some alternate dimension.

Now that means that the property is still physically there just those who don't know the secret can't perceive it. Now canon also didn't describe what happens if someone sends magic towards a Fidelius charmed property. Does the magic dissipate when it hits the edge of the Fidelius Charm or does it continue through the edge to the property itself.

We know that the owl makes it passed the edge we just lose all perception of the owl once it hits that edge. For that reason since the owl itself contains magic I believe you can find a way to attack the property once you are able to confirm that something is hidden there.

I think the reason we didn't see that in canon is that while the bad guys may have thought a fidelius charmed property was in the area they didn't know for sure and therefore didn't know where to attack. Combining mundane triangulation via owls gives you a specific spot where the owls disappear. Attacking from above at that specific spot or passing through that spot should be successful.

Now unless the Fidelius charm is disabled/destroyed you probably wouldn't know if your attack was successful as you still can't perceive the property.

That also gives rise to the question of if the spot looks like the junction of #11 and #13 (don't remember if they are town/row homes or single family dwellings). If I send a blasting curse at that point would the buildings at #11 and #13 show that damage or would nothing happen.

Regrettably canon doesn't tell us. Which means fanfic authors can pretty much write what they want as far as how they see the fidelius charm truly working.
