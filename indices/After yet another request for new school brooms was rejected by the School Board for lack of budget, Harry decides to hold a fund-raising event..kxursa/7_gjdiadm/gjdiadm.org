I want more stories like this! Just where all the houses get along, stop with the blood rivalries and politics.

This was great, I like how you made Draco into the one getting dunked. It makes so much sense.

Now I want a slice of life fic involving Pansy, Lavender and Parvati. There aren't as much female friends stories out there, compared to male/male or male/female friend stories.
