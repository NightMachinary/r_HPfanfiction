It's worth noting that they do actually have a hosting site called Patronus Charm, but it's not really used. Also, Scryer is theirs, which is super easy to use and find new fics with. Other than that, if you click the actual library link (not the library list), you will see the individual subforums like humor, romance, dark arts, etc.
