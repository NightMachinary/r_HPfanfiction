Spoilers for Endgame, obviously. All answers only apply to the MCU, not Marvel Comics, since you specified Stones. Infinity Gems are much more powerful and would incinerate any non-cosmic being who tried to fuck with them.

1) Wizards aren't all that more durable than humans by comic standards. It would take roughly the same amount of non-peak wizards as it would non-peak humans, which is to say way, way more than would be practical.

2) For one Stone? Not hard at all. Ronan slaps that shit on a hammer. They apparently make a replacement Tesseract, Scepter, etc. after the Endgame battle and it's not even remarked on. For all of them? Incredibly difficult. Tony Stark needs time and it still kills him and cripples Hulk, who literally has superpowers tailor-made for surviving that specific circumstance. Eitri and the dwarves, the finest craftsmen and weaponsmiths in the universe work their magic-science and it still cripples a being as powerful and durable as Thanos.

3) The Power Stone can destroy a planet in a single blow.

The Space Stone powers Captain Marvel and can open black holes and portals across the universe.

The Time Stone... well, you see how fucky that can be. Time Turners are repeatedly stated to be the most OP thing in HP, and the Time Stone are a limitless, no-downside, no-paradox version of that.

The Mind Stone powers Vision, and can warp people's alliances. Hyperpowered Imperius, except no resisting and no downsides or focus necessary.

The Soul Stone is literally alive on some level and has power over life and death and souls. Remember how everyone said Voldemort should have hidden his Horcruxes? What if he just didn't need to, because you couldn't harm his soul at all?

And then there's the Reality Stone, the most OP of them all.

None of them are able to be resisted by canon HP wizards without the wielder doing something stupid or other factors on Marvel levels of strength coming out of the woodwork.
