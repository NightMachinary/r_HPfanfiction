1. not enough to matter at least not really. Look at star lord, he held one and had issues and was part celestial, even if dormant. though I could see them using one like doctor strange for small uses.
2. not hard at all see doctor strange time stone, but this would not have full power and potential of the stones.
3. all 6 of them could wreak havoc, or be beaten.. as mortal minds and overconfidence can be taken out.
