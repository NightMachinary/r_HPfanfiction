People often conflate scale and power but I find this to be a very Muggle way of thinking, rooted in the concepts of physical law which we take for granted as part of our world view.

In truth, while HP wizards lack /scale/, within their local environments they are basically gods. They do not really defy the laws of nature by /overpowering/ them. Rather they just /completely ignore/ the laws of nature. For example, I doubt there's any amount of heat that can burn a person protected by the flame-freezing charm. The Charm is not a protective physical force counteracting the physical force of heat. Rather it is a /magic spell/ which says "heat is no longer harmful". Instead of burning you, it now tickles you. The spell's effect is not to remove or neutralise the heat, but to (very selectively) change what heat means.

If so inclined, wizards could probably have picnic on the surface of the sun. No doubt somehow there would still be an annoying bee attracted to the jam sandwiches, since that is an essential feature of all proper picnics and I can't see a little thing like the sun getting in the way of that.

For all their ability to achieve feats of scale, the Infinity Stones have an essential weakness: they are still operating within a system of physical law, albeit Marvel's alternate physics. And "magic" and physical forces are somewhat unified in the Marvel universe. For example, when you see Doctor Strange use a shield, his magic is not some entirely different kind of power which takes precedence over the physical world. It can be overcome by physical forces. From what we see, the Infinity Stones work in the same way: they are capable of extreme physical feats, but at the end of the day their power is still essentially physical.

For that reason, in a contest between a competent HP wizard and a person wielding the Infinity Stones, my money is on the HP wizard. They could probably just vanish the stones.
