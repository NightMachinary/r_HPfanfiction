  Just when fourth year couldn't get any worse, Harry must make revelations that could bring his entire world tumbling around his ears. With his friends being less than supportive, who will he turn to to make it through the toughest year of his life? Contains Mpreg. Abused!Harry. Severitus-ish. Contains mentions of rape and child abuse, but no details. Contains OC. I own nothing!
