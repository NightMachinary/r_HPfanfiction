I guarantee that if you binge read [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker, you will be full on sobbing.

Here's the summary: * What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse.

Though I have to give a shout out to [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] because I'm me, and I'll recommend whenever I can. Tears come in book 2.
