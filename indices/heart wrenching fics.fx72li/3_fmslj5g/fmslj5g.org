Linkffn(Stages of Hope) for a realistic depiction of what happens when adults drop the ball and teenagers are pushed into a war, from the POV of adults who didn't (from a different dimension). I'll especially draw attention to Harry and Hermione's argument in chapter 27 and when the full truth is revealed in chapter 29. /Stages of Hope/, I believe, should be mandatory reading for anyone who applauds books 4-7.

Linkffn(I Should Have by BreetanyaViolet) for why you should never ever ignore child abuse of any sort.

Linkao3(If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker) in which Lily and Harry survive Halloween 1981 but James does not.
