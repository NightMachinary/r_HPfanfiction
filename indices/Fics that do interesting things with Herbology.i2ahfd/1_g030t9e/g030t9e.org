I'm sorry I don't have a contribution. I just wanted to say that I feel Herbology is an underestimated subject, and I wish there was more focus on it. Some fanfic writers even forget that it's a core subject and that it's necessary to have NEWT level Herbology to become an auror (unless you're a war hero, that is)
