I've got a database of stories I've read over a number of years (mostly HP, but nowhere near all) that I started once I started reading too many stories only to recognize that I'd read them before. I started it with the idea of keeping track of stories I had no desire to either finish or re-read. I don't have a lot of problems with re-reading stories I like.

It currently has about 4000 entries, about 1/4 of which I haven't read yet, but put in because they looked intriguing.
