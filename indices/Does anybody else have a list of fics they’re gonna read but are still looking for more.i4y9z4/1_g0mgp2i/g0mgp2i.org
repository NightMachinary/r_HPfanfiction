I love ao3 for the bookmark feature because I simply tag it 'To Read' and go back over them regularly. Many are also wip where I wanted to wait until they're finished before reading them. Other work I put on my to-read-list in my fanfic Word where I document the ones I've read already, the ones I havent finished yet (boring, too long etc) those I still have to check out. It's horribly long by now.
