no. I feel like I've read everything there is that I would like to read. unless I get a new obsession with lots of new fics to read, I only read fics that are being updated, completely new, or sometime decide to reread something. occasionally I find a new fic, by requests or accident, and I read it right away. whole if it's completed.

this was much easier when I was satisfied with a simple Drarry. :)
