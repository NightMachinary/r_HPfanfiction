Well, in my story "Divided and Entwined", Hermione's Muggleborn Resistance gets military training. Harry doesn't join them until later, though. I've also written "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", where the Ron and others use enchanted military weapons to fight most of pureblood Europe, including a flying APC.
