Is that the fic where Voldemort suddenly has the ability to force somebody into an Unbreakable Vow w/o a bonder? Or is it the one where Harry has to obliviate himself so that Voldemort can't get information out of him because Voldemort is posing as a teacher and has Harry as his research assistant?
