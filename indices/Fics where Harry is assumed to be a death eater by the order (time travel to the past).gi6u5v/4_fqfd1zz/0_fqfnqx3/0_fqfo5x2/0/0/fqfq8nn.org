You were mostly right. The spell Harry uses to hide his memories is similar to, but functions differently than Obliviate in some very important ways. Harry is a TA rather than a research assistant: he doesn't help Voldemort with research, but instead mostly grades papers, monitors tests and answers student questions during office hours.
