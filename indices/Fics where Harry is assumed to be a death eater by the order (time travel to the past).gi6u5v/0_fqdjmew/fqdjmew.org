This is a pretty old fic about where Harry finds himself in an AU where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer. So yeah, the Order aren't exactly pleased to see him.

I really enjoyed it back in the day and it's kinda similar to what you're looking for.
