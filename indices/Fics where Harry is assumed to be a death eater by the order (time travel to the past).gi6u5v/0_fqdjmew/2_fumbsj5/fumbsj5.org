Mannn idk how to say this but --- this fanfiction is one of the main works that inspired Chained. Honestly, I've been in love with this work for years; I just love works where the good guys hate Harry Potter/he has to try and "prove" that he's good (as opposed to just immediately being accepted by them). The angst factor is delicious.

So --- probably one of THE most original fanfics ever (which follows this pattern):

Warrior's Heir:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4343191/1/Warrior-s-Heir]]

Summary:

Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord?

He isn't just suspected to be a Death Eater by Dumbledore/good guys... he's suspected to be the Dark Lord himself. Might not make sense rn but --- 

This fic is sOoo good. Give it a try :)
