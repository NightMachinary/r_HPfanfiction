Same here actually. I have loved and desperately searched for time travel fics in which Harry isn't just easily accepted and doesn't exactly have good relations with the supposedly Light side long before I read Chained. When done well they are sooo good.

Well, i'm definitely gonna give it a try :) But when you say that these fics inspired Chained, (I have absolutely no idea) but could they have possibly also inspired some character interaction or plot?(i'm literally just assuming here). Because if so, I would wait to read the fic after Chained has been completed so as to not (possibly) predict what might happen in Chained.

I absolutely fucking love the fact that I am hooked on to every word I read, as I've never read such interactions with those characters before. And also that I have no idea where the hell the story is gonna go.

While we are at it, (if it hasn't been clear enough already) I fucking love chained. Its been ages, but man the updates are worth the wait:)

Will give the fics a try:)
