Hi! Okay, you don't have to worry about that --- Warrior's Heir is very different from Chained plot-wise. When I said similiar, I meant in terms of relationship dynamics, where Harry has to prove himself people who hate him (like Dumbledore/McGonagall mistrust Harry, etc.). I promise, nothing that happens in WH will help you predict what happens in Chained LMAOO. Two very different stories.

And ahh wow, I love that you are enjoying Chained that really makes me happy! Sorry for the delays rip (and for the 1 month delay in responding to your comment LOL). Just know that Chained will be updating soon :)
