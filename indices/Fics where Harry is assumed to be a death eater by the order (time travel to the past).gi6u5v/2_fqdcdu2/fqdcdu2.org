Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

Its really good. Its well written and I like the characterizations of those Harry and Draco meet in the past. I ve reread this fic twice. And the best part is that the fic is complete. So no cliffhangers for a lifetime situation here.
