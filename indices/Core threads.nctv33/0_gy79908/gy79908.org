OK so I want to read core threads but in Harry's first year he offers to tie people to their wands allowing them to have perfect connections to them he does this with a group of girls but When he offers it's to a guy nearby he declined his offer even though he's his friend. does harry ever do this on any male characters or is this some weird thing that Harry never uses on any male characters to prove that he's a macho man or that it's some sort of thing to prove his straightness.
