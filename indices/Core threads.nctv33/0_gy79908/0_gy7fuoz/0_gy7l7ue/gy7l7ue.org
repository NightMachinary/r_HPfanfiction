I was reading Core Threads yesterday and actually stopped because of this issue. He doesn't want to do Terry's wand because Harry is heterosexual. In the story this is an extremely pleasurable experience and later when he is synching two more girls wands they feel as though Harry is kissing and licking them. As these are 11 year olds and the story constantly refers to the incident I found it extremely disturbing and stopped reading.
