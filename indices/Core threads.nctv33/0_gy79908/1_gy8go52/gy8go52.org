That was so weird and icky. (Also made me feel the author is a tad homophobic.)

There was another weird scene when Neville needed to reconnect with his wand and Harry used Susan as a sort of buffer/conduit. The next people he /helped/ this way were girls, and the whole process is getting more sexual each time.

So, this whole thing is really getting worse and worse.

And then I dropped it. Too many strikes.
