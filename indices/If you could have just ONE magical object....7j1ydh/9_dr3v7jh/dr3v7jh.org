Vanishing cabinets would be pretty cool - assuming I'm allowed a pair under the rules of this post?

- set one up at home and ship one to a far away country, no long haul flights

- put one at work, no commute

- put one in my parents house to subtly sneak in for free food, do laundry and occasionally turn random items upside down to spice up their retirement :)
