You're right in that life isn't a videogame. You aren't limited by game mechanics and you can't possibly break the game.\\
Which means that the kind of cheat I don't like or want to use in a videogame, if I could get them I'd take them.\\
And I think I'm justified in saying that it certainly wouldn't break the experience to me.
