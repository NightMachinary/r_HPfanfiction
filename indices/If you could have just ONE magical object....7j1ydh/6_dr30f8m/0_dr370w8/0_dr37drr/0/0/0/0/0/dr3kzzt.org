I have a job that earns me enough to afford a reasonable quality of living. I also have about fifty projects that I'd love to be working on. And a half dozen skills I'd like to cultivate. But I have a job that sucks up too much time to do what I want.

If I used the Philosopher's Stone to make enough gold to not work, that would improve my quality of life and my fun per day astronomically.

I would need to purchase a dead gold mine as cover, of course.
