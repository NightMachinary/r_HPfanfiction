Canon is not explicit, but what little evidence there is, "power" seems to be produced by reading, education, learning, etc. So power and knowledge are more-or-less the same thing.

Knowledge and skill aren't quite the same thing (knowing how to do something being able to do it well), but I think Starfox5's point is still fair. Separating knowledge of a subject, skill in a subject, and the amount of force that one can bring to bear makes sense.

It's not necessary to use the idea of a "magical core" to achieve that, but it is simple one that most readers will be immediately familiar with. You don't have to spend a lot of time explaining it, you can just use it.

It really comes down to whether or not the "power" in the magic one is writing about is "force" or "ability". In canon, a "powerful" witch or wizard isn't someone who casts an really strong curse, it's someone with a greater knowledge of magic and who can use that magic more creatively. Dumbledore's spells are more esoteric, complex, creative, etc. He doesn't pound away at Riddle with overpowered blasting hexes. Presumably, his stunner isn't stronger than Harry's. It might be more efficient or effective based on his knowledge of it, but not /stronger/ - as in, not having more energy or force behind it.

Most fanfic writers link power with force and knowledge + skill with ability. First, because it's intuitive - it's how pretty much everything else works. This makes it easier to write because you can assume a lot on the part of readers. Second, it's easier to write because trying to explain the power/ability scenario would be pretty hard if you did it with any depth (i.e., beyond saying "she read and studied a lot, thus making her a more powerful witch).
