I can see the temptation of "magical cores", in that they make magic behave like real-world resources, with limited storage capacity, discharge rates, and replenishment rates. However, some parts of the "magical core" model are downright inconsistent with canon: in particular, nobody ever, ever runs out of magic or talks about running out of magic or thinks about running out of magic. Magic is not a battery, and there is no chakra in /Harry Potter/.

Beyond that, there's some quantity that Voldemeter in the cave could measure, but it seemed like something that measured the overall "worth" of a wizard, not any underlying capacity for magic.

In the end, though, I think that inborn severe differences in "magical power" tend to, almost universally, degrade the story into which they are introduced. Vast, vast majority of the time, they are simply an unearned powerup orthogonal to the rest of the character.

Other models for why different characters have different magical capabilities --- that depend on general intelligence, personality, study and experience, mental state, all of which we know affect magic --- while partly inborn, have the important property that they integrate with the rest of the character. For example, Bellatrix's sadism gives her a powerful Cruciatus, but it also drives her to torture Hermione for information when the Imperius or Legilimency (which there is some circumstantial evidence she can do) would have worked better, and to mock Molly in the middle of a battle, which costs her her very life. Harry's stubbornness and proverbial wearing of his heart on his sleeve lets him push aside the Dementors' aura and /just think happy thoughts/, giving him an unmatched Patronus and aiding him in resisting Imperius, but it also makes him much more impulsive, easier to manipulate, and cripples his Occlumency.
