I personally do not like the concept of Magical Cores. They're too easily made into anime-like powerlevels. Also, I find them to be a bit of a boring way out.

I personally link my magic systems to the symbolic way magic worked in canon. Love, Hate, Need, Willpower, Inner Peace, Despair, Hope,... are real "things". They're factors, among others, with which (one can only assume) arithmancers would build new spells. Much like Forces or Temperature in Physics, on the most mundane level of magic, these factors work similar. One needs a certain state of mind, a symbolic act (ritual in form of words + wand-movement) to produce magic effects.

So as a first point, I'd make "purpose" a factor that differentiates a normal wizard from legends like Dumbledore or Voldemort. Someone who calls upon these powers for a reason that is more than just simple need, then his magic acts accordingly. Great purpose equals great magical feats.

Second point would be that depending on your inner self, some magic comes easier to you than other. Prime example: Bellatrix Lestrange who casts Crucio like others cast Lumos. So greater wizards and witches will always feel great emotions, worthy of epic tales. Furthermore, both bad and good emotions wield power. Love is not better than Hate, its just different in effect. While Love protects, hate destroys.

Then we have of course the fact that magic is hereditary. That gives us a hint that there is some biological part involved. I personally think that all life in the world of HP has magic in them, even muggles. Yet just very few of Earths children can use magic to its full extent. Those who can are affected by, or open for the force of magic to stream through them. But while wizards and witches can loose their ability, due to great pain or despair, muggles cannot achieve magic. (Or maybe they can, through Love and passion. Then maybe muggleborn children are the manifestation of this love. However, thats neither here nor there.). My examples for this would be 1)Merope Gaunt who fell into deepest despair when Riddle left her and 2) Neville who, away from his life with Augusta Longbottom, achieves normal skills by finding more in life than being compared to a broken father and mother. He finds purpose that doesn't drive him into sadness with the final peak when he stands next to Harry Potter in the Ministry.

So, yea... at least thats what I'm thinking while writing. The greater the purpose, the greater the mage.
