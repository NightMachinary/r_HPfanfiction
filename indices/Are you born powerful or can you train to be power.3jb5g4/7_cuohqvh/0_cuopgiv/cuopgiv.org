I don't think anyone disagrees that there are inborn personal attributes that affect ability to do magic, but I think that no "power meter" or "magical talent" distinct from personality and general intelligence are necessary to explain it. Neville, in particular, is an interesting example: he started out as a borderline squib, but through hard work and a change in attitude (and, arguably, a better fitting wand, though his improvement started before he got his wand replaced), worked himself up to the same tier as the proverbial Trio.
