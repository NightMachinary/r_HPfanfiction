There are wizards like Dumbledore or Riddle that are ridiculously more powerful than everybody else. They aren't just slightly better because they trained, they are simply far more powerful the same way Einstein was simply smarter than the average man.

Talent like that can't be achieved by training alone. Talent like that is innate. True, they have trained a lot to perfect it, but training alone can never make a normal wizard turn into a powerhouse like Dumbledore.

Magic is definitely not equally distributed. For the normal wizards/witches the difference in raw power can be compensated by skill and training, but there are certain barriers that training alone cannot overcome.
