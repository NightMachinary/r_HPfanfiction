But they aren't rediculously more powerful than everybody else... They are just more knowledgeable about various spells. If you notice nowhere in the entire book series are /any/ wizard or witch refered to as powerful. Great, yes. Greatest, yes. Better, yes. But never more powerful. Only time ever Dumbledore and Voldemort show actual magical superiority ability, is during their duel inside the Ministry of Magic. /Remember it was only the movie where Voldemort toppled the Hogwards wards./ And even during the duel they showed various big spells, but it didn't last all that long, and for all we know could every spell simply be premade spells such and Lumos. Remember, both of them are OLD, so they have had much time collecting magical knowledge and traning skills, and these two thing are what determins magical prowess. Not some imaginar inborne thing that cannon be changed, this is Harry Potter, not Naruto or Bleach.
