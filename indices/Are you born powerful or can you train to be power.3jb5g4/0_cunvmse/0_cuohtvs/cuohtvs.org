There is some evidence in canon for "magical cores". Well, most people hate the word, so let's just call it innate magic power or mana or whatever. As [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] quoted in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2a0il4/in_defense_of_magical_cores/][this thread]], the bit when Harry and Dumbledore cross the lake of inferi:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake."

  ...

  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underaged and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine."
#+end_quote

Magical power is an easy way to answer some questions like "why don't wizards use magic /all the time/" or "what determines the maximum weight you can levitate using Wingardium Leviosa".
