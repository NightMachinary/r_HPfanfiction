Correct me if I'm wrong, but the "magical core" thing is just a fanfiction concept, there's not really a hint of such a thing in the books. I don't really like it, I see magic as something that's just innate in witches and wizards, I don't think there's a special place in your body for it. I think the power of your magic depends on your emotions, your strength of will, and your grasp of the concept of what you are trying to achieve and how to achieve it magically. That last one could improve with a higher intelligence witch or wizard and also through practice. People might have different magical abilities like being a metamorphmagus or a parselmouth, but the strength of their magic starts out the same.

I also like the concept of magic being an outside force that witches and wizards have the power to tap into, rather than something that they generate. The only thing that really points to this in the books is the way prophecies happen.
