I've always thought it's a bit of both. And there's different branches of magic, too.

For an example, I'm rather smart in general (or so I like to think), and my strong subjects are language arts and music. But I suck suck suck suck at math. I can practice math and spend lots of time working on it and get better, but it will never be a subject that I excel at. Similarly, Neville is good at herbology but shitty at transfiguration. Ginny is amazing at charms. Harry rocks at DADA. Hermione isn't as good at DADA as in her other subjects. Tonks sucks at household spells.

Some people are born naturally good at most things (Hermione) or average and work to be good (Harry), and some people are born... not so great but work really really hard and get average or good (Neville).
