Please read [[/u/Taure]] [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][HeadCannon]], it goes in debth about the entire magical system recoded from the books, and all of it is based on direct quotes from the book. It debunks various theories such as magical core, and inborne talent. Quite an interesting short read that I will greatly recommend reading since you show intrest in the subject.
