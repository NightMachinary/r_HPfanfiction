I personally think having "Magical Strength" in addition to "Magical Skill" adds more variety. You can have those who rely on weaker, but perfectly cast spells, and those who have powerful but not quite as well cast spells, and both areas can be trained.

Just like a martial artist can improve both strength and skill.
