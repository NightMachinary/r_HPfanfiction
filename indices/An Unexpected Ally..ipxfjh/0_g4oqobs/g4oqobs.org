At the heat of the battle, no one noticed the waters of the Lake flashing blue, or the figure that emerged from it, carrying a sword brimming with power.

It was when Voldemort came to gloat, that he showed himself.

The assembled defenders were quiet, downtrodden when Voldemort made his announcement, and when just when Neville made to step up, an armored hand fell on his shoulder.

"The battle is not yet done." said a regal voice.

Neville turned in surprise, his eyes widening on seeing the man beside him, clad in golden plate armor, with a red cloak and carrying an ornamented sword with shining runes in the blade was a strong bearded blonde man with a golden crown in his head.

Voldemort looked surprised for a moment, his attention was also on the sword, "What's the meaning of this? Who dares defy Lord Voldemort?"

The man laughed, "/Lord/? Ha! You are no Lord. As for who I am, I am Arthur Pendragon, King of Britain, Leader of the Round Table, here to help Britain in its hour of need, and to help my old friend Merlin, who looks like he has been skipping meals." he indicated Harry.

Voldemort looked between the two, his mouth opening and closing, the Death Eaters just looked extremely confused(as did the defenders, though some seemed to be emboldened by the man's word).

"I don't know what kind of childish trick is this, but if you wish to die with him, then so be it!"

"There's no trick foul sorcerer, now surrender, or be destroyed!"

Voldemort's answer was a scream, followed by an Avada Kedavra, everyone started moving, only to stop in surprise when the man just swung his sword, the blade shining golden and deflected the curse in a single movement, before pointing it at Voldemort.

"Your dark magic is no match for Excalibur!"

In a beat the battle began, Harry jumped out of Hagrid's arms and blasted the nearest Death Eaters, while Arthur advanced towards a panicking Voldemort, whose spells were being batted away with ease and supernatural speed by the sword, the man flew away before he could be hit, but the nearest Death Eaters were not so fast and were cut down.

Arthur cut down a path until Harry, who was already in a group, "Ho! Merlin, you are still short I see, and you have Morgana's eyes for some reason."

"Huh?" was the intelligent response.

Arthur laughed and slapped him in the shoulder, "Ah, it hasn't come back I see, but it's good to see you old friend, I think this time things will work out for you, you will not be alone."

Harry was surprised by the emotion in the strangely familiar man's voice, so he just nodded.

"Good, now let's put down the rest of this rabble, and find the others." he then proceeded to slash the air, the sword shone and a half-moon made of golden energy came out of the blade, cutting the two nearest Death Eaters.

With a battlecry that reverberated through the courtyard, Arthur advanced, the Death Easters fleeing before him, and Harry followed, which felt natural, throwing spells here and there to cover for Arthur's quick and reckless advance, wait here had that come from.

Voldemort was desperate, his attack was falling apart, he was on the brink of victory, only for a legend to appear out of nowhere and rally the defenders, Potter was still alive, somehow, and now there were reports of other armored knights appearing with magic weapons and joining the fight.

He was in one of the battlements, looking down and seeing his army being defeated, two of his death eaters were guarding the entrance while he stayed here with Nagini, thinking of how to reverse the situation, or even escape.

His thoughts were interrupted by an explosion on the door, smoke engulfing his two guards, before a blue bolt emerged and went right true Nagini's cage, disintegrating the snake.

Voldemort turned to the door, wand in hand, thinking of who had the power for such a spell, a spell he did not recognize, he was surprised when a girl emerged, teenage in appearance, but it was the eyes that shocked him, piercing green like Potter's, but looking older, she had long black hair, and was dressed in black robes of a very old design, she had pale silvery wand in hand.

"So, you are what passes for a Dark Lord these days, pitiful." she glanced at the dispersing black smoke, "And using the Foul's soul anchors too, hmpf, how very original."

Voldemort was already at the end of his patience at people in medieval clothing appearing out of nowhere and mocking him. "And who are you?"

"I am the /Lady/ Morgana of Avalon, here to find my teacher and husband, though I hear you intend to do him harm."

He tried to contain the surprise in his voice, but he should've expected that.

"What? But we are on the same side, you were-are a Dark Lady."

Morgana looked disheartened for a moment, but it was quickly over, and her confident expression returned, "I see history took it's usual way of villanizing women in power, but no matter, that shall be cleared up soon, after I end you."

"I am Dark Lord Voldemort, and it won't be some teenager with delusions of grandeur who will defy me."
