Harry looked up when he heard a big explosion coming from the battlements, and he saw a dragon made of red fire, wrestling with a serpent, also made of fire.

"Ah, it appears Morgana has found him first, pity."

"Morgana?" the name rolled off his tongue, with an inflection that wasn't his.

Arthur looked at him and /waggled his eyebrows/, making Harry, once again, extremely confused.

There was another explosion, and the fire serpent dispersed, a figure cloaked in black smoke came flying.

"Ah, about time, here, take it, just give it back to me back later, as you always do."

Harry was surprised when Artur presented him with the sword, handle first.

"What?"

"Just take it and finish this, you'll know what to do."

He reluctantly touched the blade, being surprised by the feeling of power coursing to him as he grasped the handle and lifted it.

He saw Voldemort land in the middle of the larger group, covered in soot and with his robes singed. He knew what to do.

As he turned to leave, he heard himself saying, "Golden armor, Arthur, really?"

A smile came at the older man's laugh, and Harry advanced, the Death Eaters saw him and turned to fire, and with his wand in his left hand(that he hadn't even realized was there), Harry traced and complicated patter in the air, making a transparent dome appear covering the group and himself. He saw Voldemort looking around surprised, and some Death Eaters turned on their heels, only to be shocked when nothing happened.

"Kill him! Now!"

Spells flew, and Harry batted them away with wand and sword, retaliating with stunners and other spells he wasn't sure he knew, until only Voldemort was left standing.

Voldemort was looking terrified, and mouthing 'How?' over and over again. And Harry remembered, 'Power he knows not.'

Harry turned to the side(but still kept Voldemort in his peripheral vision), and saw a group of knights, with armors of various colors, joining Arthur, blades bloody. There was even one in forest green armor and with an antlered helmet, that had a hand on the king's shoulder while they looked at the battle. It warmed Harry's heart for some reason.

He turned to Voldemort, "It's over Tom."

Voldemort said nothing and started casting.

Harry moved, and Excalibur shone golden while deflecting spells, almost faster than the eye could see, before long Harry was in front of Voldemort who was about to turn and run, but Harry was faster and slashed with the blade.

Voldemort fell, his eyes open and face in an expression of surprise on his face.

Harry looked down at him, and then around, the Death Eaters who were still on their feet either surrendered or tried to run. He received a nod from Arthur and some of the other knights.

Until he heard an extremely familiar voice that made his stomach flutter, and his face warm.

"Always overdramatic in your victories aren't you?"

He looked a saw a girl with coloring similar to his own, dressed in black, and that had a smile on her face that would be called scandalous by some.

To Harry, it was comforting.

I just merged one of my plot bunnies with this, if you want something Arthur focused I can do it too.

BONUS(because I couldn't resist):

Neville was about to step forward when a feminine voice spoke from his side.

"This battle is not over yet, mage!"

He turned and his eyes widened in surprise when he saw a blonde girl, looking to be around their age, and wearing what looked to be a heavily armored dress, while carrying a golden longsword.

"What's the meaning of this? Who are you?"

"I am Artoria Pendragon, King of Knights, here to save my Master!"

Nevile opened his mouth in shock.

What?
