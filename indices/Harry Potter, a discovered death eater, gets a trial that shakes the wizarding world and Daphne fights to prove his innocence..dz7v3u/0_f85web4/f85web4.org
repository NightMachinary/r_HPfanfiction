So I can recall two fics with the premise of Harry becoming a death eater to protect his brother/family and the subsequent trial. The first is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/][one-shot]] - linkffn(5102870) . However it does not mention Moody at all.

I think you're looking for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/][The Trial]] which is +unfortunately abandoned+ on hiatus. linkffn(9276562)
