#+begin_quote
  "Children whine, Draco. You are a man now.": "Children", "you", and "man" probably should be italicized.
#+end_quote

Depends on the intended emphasis.

#+begin_quote
  "You are to treat your mother and I with respect" should be "You are to treat your mother and me with respect". Both Narcissa and Lucius are the objects of the verb "treat", and so take the objective case. (It'd probably sound better as "me and your mother", actually.) (Ditto for "ruin this wonderful excursion for your mother and I".)
#+end_quote

This one's kind of interesting. For one thing, the whole idea that 'and I' must be used for subjects is wrong. No matter how much some people want English to behave like Latin, it doesn't. However, pedants bang on about it so much that hypercorrection has become common, to the point where both 'and I' and 'and me' sound natural to me when used for objects. I kind of love that. It must piss off grammar nazis. tl;dr just because a phrase is used as an object, doesn't mean it'll necessarily take an objective form because language is complicated.

#+begin_quote
  "Lay around and mope in your room" should be "lie around and mope in your room". "Lay" is transitive, and "lie" is intransitive.
#+end_quote

Again, this is trying to impose arbitrary rules on dialogue. As a native English speaker, both sound totally normal.

#+begin_quote
  "You are going to act like you enjoy it": Technically, "as if you enjoy it" is more correct. I'd expect Draco to use "like" in his dialogue (and he does so later on--"Like I care"), but I'd expect Lucius to bother to use "as if"--and Lucius is talking, here.
#+end_quote

"as if" is no more correct than "like". However, I do agree that it sounds too informal for Lucius. I'd put "as though" in for consideration.

#+begin_quote
  ""Perfect," his mother claps" would look better as ""Perfect!" His mother claps"--it smacks more definitely of the sharpness of the sound, and doesn't accidentally imply that Narcissa is saying "Perfect" in some kind of clap-based language.
#+end_quote

To be precise, quoted text only ends in a comma when followed by a dialogue tag.
