(Background: I'm a native speaker of English, a firm believer in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription][linguistic prescriptivism]], and a longtime lover of the Latin language.)

I prefer a language to lack opportunities for confusion. Synonyms increase opportunities for confusion. If "I" and "me" become synonyms--if "lay" and "lie" become synonyms--if "compose" and "comprise" become synonyms--it becomes harder for people to understand each other. Rules imposed on a system from above may be arbitrary--but, without those rules, everything would be chaos.

Aren't you annoyed when you go to another country, see that it uses [[http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/8/85/Plugs.png/400px-Plugs.png][different electrical plugs]] from the ones in your home country, and are forced to buy an adapter so that you can charge your phone? Would you be happy if every state in the United States (or every first-level administrative division in whatever country you inhabit) had speed-limit signs in a different unit (mi/hr, km/hr, yd/min, m/s)? In these situations, when a centralized authority imposes regulations from above--however arbitrary those regulations may be--confusion and hassle are reduced.
