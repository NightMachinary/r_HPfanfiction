My archenemy!

  I prefer a language to lack opportunities for confusion. Synonyms increase opportunities for confusion. If "I" and "me" become synonyms--if "lay" and "lie" become synonyms--if "compose" and "comprise" become synonyms--it becomes harder for people to understand each other. Rules imposed on a system from above may be arbitrary--but, without those rules, everything would be chaos.

It really doesn't matter what you prefer, language always has and always will have ambiguities. Grammatical English is and will always be the language as spoken and understood by people, not some externally imposed platonic ideal. Furthermore, none of the examples you gave create difficulties in understanding. No fluent speaker is confused by "You are to treat your mother and I with respect", nor by the intransitive use of lay, nor by the conflation of compose and comprise.

The distinctions you want to preserve are so completely arbitrary, as well. English used to have a medial-distal distinction (that vs. yon), a T-V distinction (thou vs. you), locative adverbs (hence, hither, et al.). Do you think English speakers are less able to convey meaning without them? What is the one true English we should be using, Elizabethan English? The English of Chaucer? /Is þis þæt riht Englisc?/

Language changes, trying to stop it is utterly futile.
