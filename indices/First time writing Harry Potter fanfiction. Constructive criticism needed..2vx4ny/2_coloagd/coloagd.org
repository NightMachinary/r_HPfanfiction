Ho-hum... (Not necessarily in order, or complete.)

- Writing in the present tense is a dangerous decision... I'm not such an expert at English that I can describe why, but I've always preferred to read stories written in the past tense. Still, it's a minor thing.

- I feel as if there should be a lot more contractions in the narration--"it's" for "it is". The narration feels a little stilted with so few of them.

- "Only-child" shouldn't be hyphenated, I rather think.

- "Children whine, Draco. You are a man now.": "Children", "you", and "man" probably should be italicized.

- "You are to treat your mother and *I* with respect" should be "You are to treat your mother and *me* with respect". Both Narcissa and Lucius are the /objects/ of the verb "treat", and so take the /objective/ case. (It'd probably sound better as "me and your mother", actually.) (Ditto for "ruin this wonderful excursion for your mother and *I*".)

- I think it's a little dangerous to call it "beluga caviar"--the average reader will assume that you're talking about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_whale][the beluga whale]] rather than [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_(sturgeon)][the beluga sturgeon,]] and get angry at you for thinking that whales are fish. (That's certainly what /I/ did, before checking [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caviar][the Wikipedia article for caviar!]])

- "*Lay* around and mope in your room" should be "*lie* around and mope in your room". [[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/notorious/lay.htm]["Lay" is transitive, and "lie" is intransitive.]]

- "You are going to act like you enjoy it": Technically, "as if you enjoy it" is more correct. I'd expect /Draco/ to use "like" in his dialogue (and he does so later on--"Like I care"), but I'd expect /Lucius/ to bother to use "as if"--and Lucius is talking, here.

- Missing commas: "Yes father" should be "Yes, father"; "Very good then" should be "Very good, then"; "/is/ impressive though Draco" should be "/is/ impressive, though Draco"; "He mutters and" should be "He mutters, and"; "Well you are" should be "Well, you are"; "Well the captain" should be "Well, the captain"; "Draco it wasn't my intention" should be "Draco, it wasn't my intention"

- "Lucius hands Draco his wand, and the Slytherin fights the urge": They're /both/ Slytherins, though--so this word doesn't help the reader at all! Maybe "young man" would be better?

- ""Perfect," his mother claps" would look better as ""Perfect!" His mother claps"--it smacks more definitely of the sharpness of the sound, and doesn't accidentally imply that Narcissa is saying "Perfect" in some kind of clap-based language.

- "In walks Narcissa without warning, her smile fades into a frown when she sees her son.": /Either/ this should be two sentences (change the comma to a period), /or/ "fades" should be "fading". As it stands, this is a run-on.

- "He's been making a point to wear a scowl for the past few hours.": Should be /either/ "He's been making a point of wearing" /or/ "He's been making it a point to wear", I think.

- "Her voice tainted with annoyance": "Tainted" doesn't sound quite right, here. Maybe "tinged" would be better?

- "Smells like +the+ peppermint"

- ""Yes, mother," *He* says" should be ""Yes, mother," *he* says" (no capitalization) (ditto for ""I'm fine here, thanks," He mutters")

- "Looney": I personally prefer the spelling "loony", but I guess it's debatable.

- "It is you!" should probably be "It /is/ you!" (italicization for emphasis)

- "Summer time" is one word, I rather think.

Overall, though, the English is definitely above-average!
