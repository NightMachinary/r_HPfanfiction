So, I gave it a read and it's pretty interesting. The idea of the tough, strong, stubborn man getting together with the light-hearted, fairy-like, but also adorably stubborn female is an interesting and fun pairing.

I will give constructive criticism first, but be warned, I have been known for being a tad...harsh? Yeah, harsh. But in a good way, I promise. So please don't feel like I'm being a bit mean, I'm simply editing the same way I would edit my own work.

- We'll start with the basic: commas. You seem to have the concept of commas down, but there are several places where commas are used that are not needed. Example: "His wand had gone missing, and he suspects his parents have taken..." You do not need the comma before the "and" in this case; it is a complete sentence without the comma. If anything, the comma breaks up the sentence and makes it feel a tad awkward. You do not need to put a comma before "and" every single time you use it, however; you do tend to put in a comma prior to "and" in the majority of your sentences. If you're really not sure, say the sentence out loud. It can really help you determine where a comma needs to go.

- Tense. I agree with another poster in that using the present tense seems a tad awkward. I tend to stray away from using present because, despite the assumptions that it might be easier to work it, it can actually complicate things. I also recommend using past tense; it can be easier to work with, provides a bit more flexbility in sentence structure and comes across as more mature than present tense.

- "Sadly he's always had a fucked up expectation as an only child that obligates him to do everything with his parents" - the structure sounds way off here and the sentence is awkward. I assume that you're trying to tell the reader that Draco's always obliged and expected to spend every moment in his parents, so I recommend something along the lines of: "Unfortunately, as an only child, Draco was stuck with the obligation to do everything with his parents." Or something along those lines.

- "his mother shouts from outside his door" - I wouldn't really classify Narcissa as someone who shouts. I recommend using "calls" instead. Shouting doesn't really seem to suit her personality.

- "Draco yells, his face turning red with frustration"- Draco yelling at this point seems like he's really jumping the gun emotion wise. He seems more frustrated and irritated rather than peeved, so I recommend switching "yells"with "snaps."

- "...luxury cruise like this." she says, crossing..." - Either switch the period with a comma, or capitalize "she". I recommend putting a comma in place of the period and ending the sentence at "indifference". Remove the "and" and have "Draco rolls his eyes...sockets" be a new sentence.

- " "You need to adjust your attitude Draco," - put in a comma after "attitude" or remove the comma following "Draco". It can work either way.

- "Lucius inquiries" - "inquires" not "inquiries". Recommend: remove "inquiries", use "demands" or "asks".

- "Lucius' scowl deepens if at all possible" - remove "if at all possible". Unnecessary.

- "...so hostile, Draco!" his father growls" - remove the exclamation mark and replace with a comma. Lucius is growling, not shouting or making an exclamation.

- "You're coming with us..." - Maybe remove the contraction and keep it as "You are." Lucius has not used a single contraction so far and I feel like he is someone who would rarely, or never, use them. Furthermore, Lucius seems extremely aggressive, even for him. I would remove the entire section where he grabs Draco by the shirt and instead change his voice and stance, making him colder and more condescending. So perhaps try: ".. "Children whine, Draco. You are a man now," Lucius sneered, staring down at his son with a look of cold disappointment. "It is not like you will be doing anything proactive this summer and you clearly lack a sense of direction, so we have provided you with something to do. You are coming with us," his eyes hardened and his lips curled, "and you are going to act as if you enjoy it." ..." Maybe something like that, but I would not have Lucius physically touch Draco. He is a verbally abusive man, not a physically abusive one.

- "Narcissa inhales sharply. // (new paragraph) "Perfect!" His mother claps her hands together..." - Recommendation: "Narcissa inhales sharply and claps her hands together, "Perfect!" Draco flinches with irritation at the sound. "We ought to leave now then so we are not late." " - something along those lines.

- "The ship is impressive" - omit the italics on "is". Unnecessary.

- "cruise" - does not need to be italicized. The first mention was for emphasis, now it's unnecessary.

- "caviar and truffle risotto" - I feel like you just chose the most expensive things you new about and threw them together. It actually sounds quite unappetizing. You could keep it as a "truffle risotto", but I would not include caviar.

- "her voice tainted with annoyance. "You are...all week!" " - Narcissa seems a bit OOC at points. Here, she's immediately irritated. I would remove "her voice tainted with annoyance"and then have her say "Your father will not be pleased if you hide in your room for the entire trip." Narcissa will coddle him, he is her baby and she will try to protect him. I see her being more annoyed that Lucius will get pissed, rather than annoyed at Draco.

- "awkwardly sitting at the foot" - Recommendation: "sitting stiffly at the foot..."

- "giving him a smack on the leg"- much like Lucius, I don't see Narcissa as being a "hitter". I would instead focus on her facial features and posture changing, getting something like: "..."Get up, get out, and do not come back until you have fixed your poor attitude,"she snaps, turning to face him. Her lips are pursed in discontent and her eyes flash with frustration. They stare for a moment before she breathes out and turns away, shoulders sagging just the slightest. Her voice softens with disappointment and guilt, "My biggest regret is how much your father and I have spoiled you throughout the years." ..."

- "Draco's jaw is...wants to go home" - up until this point, Draco has been incredibly childish. Even more so than usual. I think that around here, especially following the scolding he just received from a mother who never once told him he was wrong, may act as a slight reality check. Especially since she states that she regrets spoiling him. Keeping Draco's aggression in there is great, but I would love to see a slight hint that his mother's words have struck a chord and he some guilt over his behaviour.

- Just curious, where are they? You mention the temperatures being cold for summer, but where is the cruise? The reason I'm asking is for being able to imagine the surroundings of the ship.

- "but Merlin knows he feels as though he's a specimen being studied under spectacles" - Recommendation: "but, for Merlin's sake, he felt like his every movement was under constant scrutiny." - something like that.

- "He reluctantly turns around, to find" - omit the comma.

- "..."Oh great," he sneers... terrible vacation" - Recommendation: Reformat as: "He blinks twice in disbelief. "Oh great," he sneers (grumbles) as he turns back to the water, "just my luck." This really is a terrible vacation."

- "why she still here" - "Why she was still here" - forgot to add "was"

- "Draco rolls his eyes and continues, finally staring her square in the face." - switch the period for a comma, as it is a continuing sentence.

All done.

Sorry if it seems like a lot, I do tend to nitpick. In some instances, I put down "Recommendation". What I mean there is that those are adjustments that I recommend, but do not necessarily need to be done. It's more like a "this is what I would do" bit rather than a "DO THIS!!!" edit. You make the final decision on whether you want to implement these recommended changes or not.

Overall, it is interesting and I'm keen to see how Draco and Luna develop their relationship. I'm especially keen to see how you characterize Luna. I do still feel that Draco's coming across as too cranky, so he's becoming a bit more annoying than expected. Narcissa, too, seems to be a tad OOC in that she is softer spoken, calmer with her emotions, and more of an enabler for Draco. Lucius, as well, is more of a cold, condescending man who lets his words and disappointment do more damage rather than physical blows. But, it is a nice start and pushes the characters to meet right off the bat.

I do very much love Luna's bird's nest. I can totally see her doing it and look forward to seeing more of her interesting outfits. I would love to see some nautical ones, like a Captain-based one, or have her dress like a mermaid.

Anyway, I believe that's it. I apologise for making this so darn long and I hope that you understand that the criticism/editing was not meant to offend or demean you in any way or form. I can't wait to see how the fic develops and I hope that I was able to provide some good constructive criticism. :)
