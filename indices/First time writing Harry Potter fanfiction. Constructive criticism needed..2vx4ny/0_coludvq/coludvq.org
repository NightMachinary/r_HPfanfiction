So, I read it.

The good

- You kept the PoV on one character (something I have some problems with)
- There Weren't any glaring spelling errors that i noticed
- The plot itself is good ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys][Bad boy]] meets [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl][Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] its a classic of the romance genre.\\
- There where /some/ good characterization of Draco (/If there is anything Draco loves more than his wealth, it's complaining./ made me smile it is so Draco)\\

The Bad

- Some OOC for characters, (Narcissa Shouting?)\\
- A lot of telling instead of showing\\
- the whole present tense thing rubs off me\\
- some contradictions\\

  - Draco can't aparate legally but, but can go get wasted in a pub?
  - There are no House Eleves to help him pack but a moment latter there are two helping his mother?
  - Draco mentioning that cruise are based on muggle stuff when he /is/ a pureblood bigot is kinda weird

The story has potential, if done correctly It all would depend on how you write Luna and her interactions with Draco.

I'm assuming this happens before Draco leaves hogwarts, where is Voldemort? if its juts an AU where he didn't exist or something? not important for the plot i guess but just a curiosity of mine.
