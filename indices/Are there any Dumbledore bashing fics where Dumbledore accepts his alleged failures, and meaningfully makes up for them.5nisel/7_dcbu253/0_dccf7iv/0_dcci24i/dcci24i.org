I agree but i think it's because everyone loves Tonks. I really wanted the Honks ship to work out in that fic and then the author springs that chapter on us.

It makes sense from a tactical viewpoint. Not using Tonks' talents in the war is straight up stupid and using her as a spy is really the only competent choice a general can make in that situation especially if Tonks is willing and even asking to do it; but that doesn't change the fact that she's a fantastic character and we as readers can't help but think that she deserves better.
