Not different from any other general. War is a dirty thing.

1. Because there's so few chances that it works is a very good reason to be serious about it and not messing around. Tonk's a soldier, she knows the risks, She's in there willingly. Moreover, where did you ever seen any garantees in a war? There are no garantees. You use all your assets as well as you can, and you hope it will be enough, and that not to many people will die. That's what a war is. If you're not ruthless, more of your people will die.

2. In a time of war. This isn't about the greater good. It's about fighting a war. If you're not going to fight it seriously, you shouldn't fight it at all.

3. Tonks is also their only metamorph. She's extremely well suited for infiltration. There are other fighters.
