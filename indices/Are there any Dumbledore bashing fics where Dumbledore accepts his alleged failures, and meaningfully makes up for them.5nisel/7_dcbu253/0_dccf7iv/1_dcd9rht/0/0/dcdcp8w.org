I'm quite a cynical person as well but I'm not going to stoop to your level and try to justify war crimes. There's a reason that all civilized nations have agreements on these things. I feel sorry for you if you feel committing war crimes is necessary in order to wage war and I couldn't disagree more.

Just so that we're clear on things this is the relevant quote from the fic:

  As I've said before, you will no doubt be required to take the Dark Mark, kill innocent people, and eventually interact with Voldemort himself.

There's no ambiguity here. Both Tonks and Dumbledore are irredeemable for taking such monstrous actions. It made me sick.

#+begin_quote
  A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility.[1] Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.[2
