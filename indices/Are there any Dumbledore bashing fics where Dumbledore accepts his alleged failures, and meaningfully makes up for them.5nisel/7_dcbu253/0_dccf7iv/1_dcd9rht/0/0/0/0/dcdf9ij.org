  Seems to me that it's the risks with every undercover mission. Dumbledore doesn't urge Tonks to do war crimes, he informs her that she might have to commit some to keep her cover.

That's utter bullshit and you know it. Most undercover missions for anything won't require you to murder innocent civilians, you probably won't have to murder anyone (I'm sure the Kremlin doesn't ask their operatives to murder an american in front of everyone to proof their loyalties).

Also it's not even a question that she will have to murder civilians and lots of them. She wants to get into the inner circle of the madman. Just murdering people is probably the least of what will be required of her (Torture, rape,...).

  There's also a reason why all of them breach these agreement more often than not.

They certainly skirt the grey areas (America with their drone war and civilian "collateral damages" for example). But I'm not so cynical to believe that there's any leader of a civilized western country who'd order his soldiers to murder innocents. No.

  Dumbledore's not Stalin.

At least Stalin deluded himself into believing that he was eradicating state/class enemies (properly dehumanizing them). Actively seeking to kill people you yourself consider to be innocent is a whole other ballgame of being sick in the head.
