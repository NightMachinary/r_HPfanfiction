  Good and Evil are unaffected by popular opinion/acceptance
#+end_quote

I just wanted to say that this is pretty far from being clearcut, or at least is very arguable. Imo good and evil are heavily influenced by popular opinion and power dynamics. Or at least, what people consider good and evil.

It's been shown that when certain figures (especially powerful ones) make their opinions known, the opinions of many people in a group actually change.

For example, before America invaded Vietnam, about 75% of the country opposed getting involved. The day after the US publicly announced it was getting involved, that number dropped to 40%. (This is from /Lies my Teacher Told Me/, I forget the original primary source citation in the book though).

What people think is heavily affected by authority figures (above, plus the Milgrand Shock Experiment), as well as their peers (forget the name, but that experiement where people would all shout the wrong answer to an easy question and the subject would begin to believe that the wrong answer was correct).

Whether or not there is some "good" and "evil" that aren't affects by people's opinions depends on your personal views (I adamantly disagree, but I think you'd agree). But you can't deny that what people /think/ "good" and "evil" mean is heavily based on society.

You don't win wars by playing nice, and (at least in my opinion) the victors have a huge say in deciding after the fact if they were "evil" or "good".
