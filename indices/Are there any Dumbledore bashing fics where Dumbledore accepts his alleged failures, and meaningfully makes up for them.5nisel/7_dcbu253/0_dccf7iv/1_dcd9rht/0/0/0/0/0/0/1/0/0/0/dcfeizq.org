  Out of curiosity, how religious are you? At least in my life, the people who believe "good" and "bad" are distinct from what people think them to be tend to be very religious (e.g. my mom's family lol).

Hm I'm from a fairly religious family, but I'm not religious at all, actually pretty anti-theist. But I studied a lot of philosophy and find moral relativism pretty reprehensible, because almost anything can be justified. I think there are strong secular arguments for a universal moral basis: Evolutionary common ground (we instinctively understand that murder is wrong, because a population that callously kills each other won't survive long) and logical arguments through rationality. From both of these I can arrive at moral judgements that I'd consider universal without invoking a higher power and you won't be able to escape responsibility by claiming that you got socialized in a certain way.

But I'm going to concede that there's certainly no consensus about this. I reject the idea though that having moral principles requires religion.

I can't really fathom though how any moral relativism doesn't immediately follow through to moral nihilism from there, because if morals are completely relative to their culture they are, in my opinion, just as meaningless as if they don't exist at all. Why even bother with the term morals if they are just a different way of describing what is socially acceptable in your particular culture? "Well, my parents are sadists and raised me that way, so I think hurting people is perfectly alright and because you are a moral relativist you are going to have to agree that I'm correct and my behaviour is perfectly moral" Seems like a pointless exercise to me.
