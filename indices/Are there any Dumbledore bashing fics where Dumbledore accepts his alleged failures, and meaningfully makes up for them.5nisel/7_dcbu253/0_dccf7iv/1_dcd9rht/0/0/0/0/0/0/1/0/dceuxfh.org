  I just wanted to say that this is pretty far from being clearcut, or at least is very arguable. Imo good and evil are heavily influenced by popular opinion and power dynamics. Or at least, what people consider good and evil.

Well duh, that's a tautology. Of course popular opinion and power dynamics device what people "consider good and evil". Certainly.

Of course my position is that good and evil are distinct from what (most) people might believe them to be. You're not really responding to my point. You are actually supporting my position by arguing that people can be brainwashed into anything (for example that war crimes might be necessary/acceptable).
