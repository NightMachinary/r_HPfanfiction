  As I've said before, you will no doubt be required to take the Dark Mark, kill innocent people, and eventually interact with Voldemort himself.

Seems to me that it's the risks with every undercover mission. Dumbledore doesn't urge Tonks to do war crimes, he informs her that she might have to commit some to keep her cover.

  There's a reason that all civilized nations have agreements on these things.

There's also a reason why all of them breach these agreement more often than not.

A soldier in a military campaign isn't an agent in an undercover mission. Tonks will have impossible dilemas to solve, situations with no good solutions and Dumbledore informs her of that fact. We're not in the case of a soldier who blows off some steam torturing or murdering civilians, here.

Now, it's easy to play holier than thou from behind a keyboard, but an agent in an undercover mission has to make the calls, even if they don't like the decisions they make.

Dumbledore's not Stalin.

Edit: Dumbledore's a politician and Tonks a soldier, none of them are going to be completely moral. But they are genuinely trying to do their best given the situation. That's why I find that a little too much to call them evil.
