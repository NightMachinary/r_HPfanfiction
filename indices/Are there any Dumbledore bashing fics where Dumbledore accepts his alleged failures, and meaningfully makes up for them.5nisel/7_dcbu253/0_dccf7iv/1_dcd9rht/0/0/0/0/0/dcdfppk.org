  At least Stalin deluded himself into believing that he was eradicating state/class enemies (properly dehumanizing them). Actively seeking to kill people you yourself consider to be innocent is a whole other ballgame of being sick in the head.

Oh, come on...

  That's utter bullshit and you know it. Most undercover missions for anything won't require you to murder innocent civilians, you probably won't have to murder anyone (I'm sure the Kremlin doesn't ask their operatives to murder an american in front of everyone to proof their loyalties).

Most undercover mission's do not take place during war time. I've been told that a lot of messy things of the sort happend during WW2 (Even some operatives that were ruthlessly sacrificed to pass up false informations, or key civilians assassinated). Even when infiltrating a gang, you never know what you're going to be asked. Some gangs ask their recruits to commit murder as an initiation (also to have dirt on their recruits). I'm sure that the cops have ways to go around that, but there's always a risk.

I wonder what the CIA operatives that are bound to have infiltrated ISIS had to do to earn their spots in the organization...
