How is he not evil?

He's asking her to kill and torture in order to gain some unclear advantage if she manages to become one of Voldys most trusted.

It seems clear to me that this is incredibly evil:

1. There's no guarantee that it will work, honestly it seems pretty improbable. She might die on a Death Eater mission, could suffer a nervous breakdown because of all the killing, could be found out by Voldemort or mess up in some unknown sort of way. Yes a good general will send soldiers to their death, but it certainly isn't necessary and doubtful that it will be helpful. Also he isn't only sending her to her death... See 2 and 3

2. Dumbledore orders/asks someone to kill and torture innocents (for the greater good). Evil!

3. Tonks is one of their best fighters. She is actively saving lives and apprehending bad guys. Now she won't do that anymore.

There's probably more arguments on why it's evil, especially because he might also be doing this in order to isolate Harry.
