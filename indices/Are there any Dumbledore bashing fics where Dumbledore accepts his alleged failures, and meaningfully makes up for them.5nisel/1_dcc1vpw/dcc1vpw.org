linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) does not have "bashing" per se, but definitely shows a Dumbledore that is cautious and used to keeping all the secrets / knowledge to himself fearing the information getting to the enemy. He's not portrayed as cruel or careless, to me the characterization was very believable, only in the face of protective!Sirius that he's forced to acknowledge that he can't win the war that way, and making amends for it / contributing his knowledge to a war council properly. Lotsa exciting Wizengamot politics and family magic stuff (a little OP!Harry though), if you can get past the HHr .

I'm no fan of HHr myself at all, but I frequently re-read this fic, it's quite enjoyable to me. Probably due to my love of Sirius...
