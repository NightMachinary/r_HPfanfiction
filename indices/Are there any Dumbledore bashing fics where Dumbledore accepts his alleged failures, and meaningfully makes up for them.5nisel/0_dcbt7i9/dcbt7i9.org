Is the whole point of bashfics. The characters aren't there to be redeemed, in any way, they're there to be made fun of for everything they do. Their very existence is an insult to the author, and they do not, /cannot/ accept that character as actually being a character. At least in the context of that story.

Because to change for the better would mean growth. It would mean that the bash-target is more than a representation of a target for the author's hate, whether it stems from 'why didn't you do anything for the person I projected myself onto' (in case of Dumbledore) or 'you embody every single one of my insecurities' (which is the common thread for Ron bashing, I've found) or any one of a thousand reasons (which does include 'someone asked me to write one and I was curious to see if I could').

A bashfic where the target accepts his faults and strives to improve beyond his faults and make up for his mistake is not, in my reckoning, a bashfic. It's just a normal story with an exaggerated premise.

EDIT: however, I would be interested to see such a fanfic.

I imagine it'd be like linkffn(Albus Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure) without the dimensional hopping.
