Dumbledore is very easy to bash. Looking back, he makes so many bad decisions that the only reasonable explanations are either gross incompetence or malicious manipulation. Leaving a toddler on the doorstep in November with just a letter?! "Hello, your sister's dead, here's another mouth to feed." Dumbledore did nothing right in the first 2 books.

It's a common problem, not just in bashfics. Few authors are good enough to write characters with any depth, most characters end up as 2-dimensional caricatures of themselves.

Ron is a lazy, jealous glutton, Dumbledore is twinkling the school to death, Harry can't fly without making spectacular dives where he pulls up /inches/ from the ground, and the Marauders are all about "cubs", "pups", "prongslet", "furry little problems", and "yes, I'm always Sirius".

Nothing changes, bashfic or not. At least not in a good way. Draco in leather pants and a pregnant Harry isn't much of an improvement. At least a Snape that collects dirty underwear from girl students is something original.

I recently read a fic with a non-stuttering Quirrell. That gave me a literary hard-on.
