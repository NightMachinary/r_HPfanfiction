I love the idea of music in magic and especially the battle bard. I tend to picture it as playing/singing songs functions as the incantation for a single complex piece of magic which require constant input. A bit like a more tuneful version of ritual chanting. An example could be animating a large number of minions or conjuring a powerful shield to protect allies. This becomes very much a group tactic, as whoever is performing is powerful, but not particularly flexible and needs to be kept safe so they can concentrate. If done well, it could do a better job than canon in showing how some magic can be difficult and taxing for the caster, rather than just have them spout out a couple of words and wave their wand about.

There is also the possibility of using music to combine the magic of multiple people. If you are just trying to do something simple, like lift something heavy, then everyone casting the same spell at it could work. However, if you are trying to cooperate for complex magic, maybe raising some powerful wards over a building, then everyone preforming the same piece together is a way of syncing up so that their magic acts as one, especially if you are using a more 'intent' magic system. Maybe certain bits of magic require a minimum number of people to do, where everyone has their own part which could play towards their specialisations and everything comes together in a whole.

You can also consider that if magical music is useful, then are their instruments designed as casting foci like wands to make this easier. If so, are they newly made to order, or old relics. Are they general power ups, or tied to particular pieces of magic, like a flute which causes its listeners to fall asleep or hallucinate, or an accordion which manipulates water.

Finally, remember that even without adding in magic, learning music takes time, and takes more time for every piece you learn. If he needs to learn a new piece for every 'spell', then you can work in some conflict from other characters telling him he is spending too much/not enough time on this compared to his other skills.
