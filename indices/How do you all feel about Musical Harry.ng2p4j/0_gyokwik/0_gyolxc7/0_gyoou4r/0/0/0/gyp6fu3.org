I figure that could be pretty useful by the time the Battle of Hogwarts comes around. If they can see it coming, and have time to prepare, they might choose some sort of empowering song the give the students confidence, or nerve before the fight. Use multiple musicians, pooling their magic together to essentially, as you said, be an enhancer.
