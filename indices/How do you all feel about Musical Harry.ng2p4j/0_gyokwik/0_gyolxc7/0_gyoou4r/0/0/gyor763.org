How about using magic not during the fight, but as a ritual sort of thing before it? It could be an esoteric/buried magic that has mostly died out but traces of it live on through superstition like nursery rhymes. And the art is discounted because it's associated with women and brushed off as an old wives tale sort of thing, but superstitious mothers still insist on singing a Song of Safety above their newborn's cradle and if a falling pot only just misses the child the next day then that's put down to accidental magic or pure coincidence.

I imagine you could use music not to achieve a specific effect but as an enhancer during a ritual or a more general bad luck curse or something.
