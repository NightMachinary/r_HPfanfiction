Interesting. I think it could work if it was along the lines of Harry using the memory of a particularly emotional/stirring/inspiring music piece to fuel his fighting.

If it's literally a case of a person singing in the middle of a firefight, not only is it a bit strange, you'd have to explain why the singer can't simply be Silencio'd/Stunned/killed to remove the benefit.
