The story is still in the work, so this hasn't been applied yet. However, I was think more along the lines of a buff. Obviously music is no match for a spell to your face. More like how the right song can put you in a certain mindset. It varies in effect depending on the song and the emotions + magical power of the caster. If a little girl sung a beautiful song, it might lift your spirits, but a powerful magic user channeling their magic into the music would be stronger.
