My take is that pretty much anything can work if it is done well.

However, with something like this it runs the risk of Harry coming off as pretentious and unlikeable if he's expressing his teenage feelings through music. As you say, pretty much all teenagers get angsty, but it doesn't make it any less irritating when it happens - the obvious example is Capslock Harry in OotP.

Also, you have to think about what sort of power music would provide. Would it be used offensively, for example? If it's played straight, it runs the risk of looking a bit ridiculous if Death Eaters are attacking and Harry fights them off by singing/guitar solo-ing at them.
