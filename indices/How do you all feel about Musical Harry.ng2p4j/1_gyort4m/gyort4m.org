I think a story about Harry playing the trombone or something could be interesting.

But I really dislike whenever a fic starts using specific songs, and especially when they start dumping lyrics into the fic. That sort of thing always makes me feel like the author is a teenager who just discovered music they like and now thinks that it is objectively the only good music.

And I get that. I was once a teenager with opinions about music that I now think are very cringey, and I'm glad that they are not preserved in a fanfic somewhere. But since I am not a teenager with the exact same musical tastes as the author, I really don't enjoy fics that are full of music.
