I understand that. Music tastes differ. I was thinking violin and he starts adding lyrics later on, perhaps. I also get how the lyrical dumps can be frustrating. I'm not planning on having Harry break out in song or sing all the time, or even much at all. But a few songs here and there? I think it can be done tastefully, do you?

And I think lyrics should be spaced out by descriptions of the melody, the emotion, the movement of the singer etc.
