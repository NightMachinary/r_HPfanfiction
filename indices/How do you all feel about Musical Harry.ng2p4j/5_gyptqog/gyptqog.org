In Tolkien's works, music is definitely a powerful kind of magic. You could take inspiration from that, although magic in LOTR and the Silmarillion is usually more subtle than in Harry Potter. I say usually, because Luthien, the daughter of a Maia (minor angel) and an elf, is able to cast down Sauron's fortress and send him fleeing back to his master, Morgoth. She also forced Morgoth to fall asleep, even though he's an immortal Vala (archangel) and the equivalent of Satan. According to Tolkien's creation myth, the Maiar and Valar created the universe by singing together, so it's definitely possible to use music to accomplish incredible feats of magic.

Anyhow, I'd suggest reading up on the Silmarillion.
