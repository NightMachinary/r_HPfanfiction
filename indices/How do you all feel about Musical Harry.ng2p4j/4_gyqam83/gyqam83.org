I think it's a cool idea and your fic looks interesting and I'll start after this comment! Now in regards to magical music:

1. I think the most important part is that it shouldn't be overpowered or battle-oriented at all. Tom Riddle was a prodigy-if casting magic through a violin was some huge advantage, he would be first chair of every orchestra.
2. Related to that, I think you'd need to develop a more robust magic system in order to accommodate it. Just my personal opinion, but music as this added elective that's slapped into a Hogwarts curriculum as relevant as the others strikes me as weird. I think it'd fit much better if there were other forms of magic in art (and in sex, rituals, blood and all sorts of non-wand mediums).
3. Related to that, I think a good exploration on how magic and music relate would be through emotions. I saw in the comments below the idea of essentially a 'battle hymn' effect. I think minor rituals like that are fine. Other ideas include: uses in high-level enchanting, an ancient culture that did all their magic through chanting and music for archaic flashy effects, dark arts rituals like giving them an earworm that drives them insane etc.
4. I don't know how much you've explored Harry's musical interest already but I think it'd be cool if it's something Lily did too. I like to see Harry connect with Lily with shared activities like that. That one's totally just a friendly suggestion!
