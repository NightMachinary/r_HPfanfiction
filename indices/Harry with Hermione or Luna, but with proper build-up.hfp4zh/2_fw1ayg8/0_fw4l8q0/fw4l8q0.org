I took a quick look. Yeah, well... that seems like it could be quite interesting, I really like the author's note in the first chapter that explains the way they view Harry and Luna. Makes a lot of sense. But... not looking for that at the moment. I'll definitely keep it in mind if I ever decide to look past such things.
