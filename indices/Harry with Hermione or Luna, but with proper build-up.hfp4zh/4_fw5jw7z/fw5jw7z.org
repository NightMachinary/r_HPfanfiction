My favourite Lunarry one-shot after Monstrous.

After Sirius dies, Harry learns at his will reading that he's not a super rich Lord Potter-Black but actually so poor he can't even afford to go to Hogwarts for his 6th year. Meanwhile, the Lovegoods are in trouble with the Death Eaters because of things in the Quibbler so Xeno has pulled Luna out of Hogwarts and left her with the Order while he goes abroad for a while.

Together in Grimmauld Place, tutored by Order members, Harry and Luna slowly get closer throughout the year until they finally get together.

And in case that's not your thing, it contains mild Ginny bashing. She's jealous of their relationship and so says some very mean things to Luna to try and get her to give up on Harry.

And here's Monstrous: linkffn(12754810)

There's a lot of moments between them before they get together but the romance between Harry/Luna is secondary and not the focus of the story. I like it mainly because of the rest.
