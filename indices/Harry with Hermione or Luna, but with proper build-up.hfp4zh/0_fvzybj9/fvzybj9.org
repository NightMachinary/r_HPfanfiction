Maybe [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]] ?

For H/Hr I find the best divergence points are either Goblet of Fire or the Tent after Ron leaves.

Fics that start earlier usually have authors who want to signal/forshadow their preferred pairing, which leads to *creepy 11 year old flirting*. Or worse.

GoF is a good point for relationship development because the characters are basically just at the 'notice the other sex' stage, so forshadowing of later relationships is less creepy. It also fits the narrative, being after the hippogriff flight and the Triwizard shenanigans.

Of course, stories based on the tent usually rely entirely on canon background with little custom build up.

For Luna, maybe Harry Potter and the Distaff side?
