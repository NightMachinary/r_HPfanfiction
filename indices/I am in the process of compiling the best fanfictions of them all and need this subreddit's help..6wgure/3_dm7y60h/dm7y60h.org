The Resonance, Revolution, and Resolution Trilogy is by far and all the best series I've ever read.

Also, one of the few I'll consider better than canon, as the writing style is more suited to my interests as well as the character development and conclusion.

Clocking in at an astounding total of 1,713,423 words, this trilogy, starting at Year six, is a whopping 629,253 words longer than the entire original series.

There is drama, romance, a ton of action and I've yet to find any plot holes or spelling errors.

Without ruining the premise or story, it's a very developed take on the Severitus challenge, where Harry grows physically, mentally, and emotionally throughout the entire series.

Also one of the few fanfic series I've read more than 5 times through.

If you haven't read it, it's definitely worth the time.
