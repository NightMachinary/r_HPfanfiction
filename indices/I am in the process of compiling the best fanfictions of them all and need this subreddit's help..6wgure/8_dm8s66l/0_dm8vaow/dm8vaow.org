That's the whole point, right now the only thing I'm doing is finding and collecting the various docs for the curated fanfiction, and creating a wiki off it, but the point of sub, is for people to discuss the fandoms they like and share what they think is an important fan fiction. Sure I could create a list and share it, but that will eventually get buried, by finding the lists, and the people who want to discuss good fanfiction, or even just look for it is the whole point of the sub.
