Like others in this thread, I feel that a sub dedicated to the best fanfics alone has many issues.

Personally, I assume it'll fail as it's just a wiki, and it shouldn't even be one, it should be a google doc as the only purpose is to get the links off the wiki. After a while, if the wiki isn't of exceptional quality, people will forget about it and the sub will fall into obscurity making all the work pointless. Basically, you need to keep the sub useful so users come back.

An example of something to actually keep the sub useful beyond a one time visit would be to make it for posting lists of fanfiction for various fandoms. I know there are a bunch of google docs filled with curated fanfiction for various fandoms floating around, probably a lot more than I personally know.
