I wish I had more stories in my favorites. My favorite list got wiped out and I've spent a year trying to relocate so much but I know I haven't found everything.

Keep in mind for my recommendations that I hate reading cannon pairings. (Those are boring to me, lol, because we already know how a canon pairing came to be from the original source material. I'm far more interested in the volatility of non-canon pairings.)

I like all of these because they're thoroughly well written and thought out. Each scene has a purpose, there is no filler. Each and every character has motivations of their own. The authors took their time to truly make something great, smart, and clever.

I'm sad I only have five to share. I need to get more reading done, apparently.
