I don't see what the point of this exercise is. This list you compile is going to be so subjective as to be utterly useless given the varied tastes on the sub.

As an example, I personally find /Stages of Hope/ and /Delenda Est/ to be tedious and amateur, yet the sub believes they're among the singular greatest accomplishments of 21st century literature for reasons I can't understand. My own list of "greats" would include a few fics by some prominent DLP authors, yet mentioning them here would be downvote magnetism (largely because Starfox and his/her posse hate hate hate DLP and downvote on that alone irrespective of post content). And, of course, someone's bound to mention MOR and stir up that shitstorm yet again...

Why not just find your own good fics and set aside any aspirations of "best fanfictions of them all"? It's a fool's errand at best.
