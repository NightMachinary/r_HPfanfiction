  I don't see what the point of this exercise is. This list you compile is going to be so subjective as to be utterly useless given the varied tastes on the sub.
#+end_quote

Same reason anyone compiles a 'best of' list of subjective things. It's helpful to people in the future. And can be a fun personal project. Not sure why you would specifically shit on somebody trying to do something that's pretty harmless.

  yet the sub believes they're among the singular greatest accomplishments of 21st century literature for reasons I can't understand.

I read this sub pretty thoroughly and I don't think I've seen anything pointing to that. Sure, they're recommended, but that's mostly because the whole "Time Travel Bellatrix" plot is /rare/ and Delenda Est is at least /competent/. Honestly, the most praise I've seen it get is "pretty good until they screw it up and go to the future."

  My own list of "greats" would include a few fics by some prominent DLP authors, yet mentioning them here would be downvote magnetism (largely because Starfox and his/her posse hate hate hate DLP and downvote on that alone irrespective of post content).

Again, haven't seen it. Also, who gives a shit about imaginary internet numbers? Just recommend what you like or don't both posting at all....
