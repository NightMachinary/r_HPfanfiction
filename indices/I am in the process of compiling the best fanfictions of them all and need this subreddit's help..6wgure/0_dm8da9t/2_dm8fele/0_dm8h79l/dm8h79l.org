DLP: Dark Lord Potter forums. Known as quite picky, some call them elitist. In general they're a community committed to Harry Potter fanfiction and giving feedback and criticism to writers posting on there as well as fanfictions posted elsewhere. They're also known for being not exactly friendly in how they criticize / telling it straight up how it is and not sugarcoating anything.

MOR: Method of Rationality. A famous / infamous fanfiction that is loved / hated by many, written by an controversial author. Its often a "beginner fanfiction", so most of the community have at some point read it (or at least began to read it).
