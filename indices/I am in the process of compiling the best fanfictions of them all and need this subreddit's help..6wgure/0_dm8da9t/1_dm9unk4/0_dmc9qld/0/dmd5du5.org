Because if you don't enforce your rules consequently, then you cannot be trusted to be objective when it concerns criticism. At least I expect the honesty to say so, not have rules you don't or only selectively enforce.

Further, not knowing (or not making) the difference between an attack on an author, and an attack on a story is pretty much disqualifying your criticism as a whole - it's just a flame, nothing constructive much less professional.

And finally, mistaking being rude for being honest is pretty much the sort of stupidity I expect immature teenagers to make, not mature people whose opinion one should respect.
