  My own list of "greats" would include a few fics by some prominent DLP authors, yet mentioning them here would be downvote magnetism (largely because Starfox and his/her posse hate hate hate DLP and downvote on that alone irrespective of post content).

You shouldn't project your own issues on others. I don't downvote stories based on their authors. Nor do I have a posse. But I do point out that [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/marriage-law-fics-with-the-law-causing-a-revolution.28242/#post-801545][using homophobic slurs in personal attacks]] is neither mature nor a sign of quality debating or criticism of a story, and a community who tolerates such things - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6vkdl9/why_do_people_down_vote_fic_requests_that_are/dm2v4q0/][and even defends it]] - [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/board-rules-and-posting-guidelines.4/][despite those breaking their own rules]] shouldn't claim that they have high standards.
