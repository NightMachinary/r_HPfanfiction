"Lumos Appolonis" Intoned the latest Bard of Bards, in a pleasant baritone, from whence began the Song of the Sun.

Ethereal music descended upon the earth like the gentlest rain, and the softest snow. The warm, golden light of perfect summer evenings and the crisp shine of a childhood's winter morning flowed across the field of battle.

The younger Sun God, lord of healing and music caressed the soul of the Nameless One, and it became one again, a perfect harmony that spelled the doom of the Dark Lord.

For next, the horns did sound, and the Celestial Legion of Olympus descended to bring the fury of the Gods to bear against the hubristic fool, who sought the immortality that was the sacred and sole birthright of the Gods.

When the fury passed, the Chosen One and his Foe were no more, save for in the distant shimmering of new stars, from whence the soul of the Bard could gaze down upon the world, victor over the dark serpent at his sidereal feet.
