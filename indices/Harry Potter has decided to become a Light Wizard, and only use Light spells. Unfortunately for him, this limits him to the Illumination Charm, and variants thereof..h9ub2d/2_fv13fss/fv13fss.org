"Lumos Sacris" Spaketh the Chosen One, and lo the Lord heard his child, Lamb of the Wizarding World, and sent forth his Angels to bring low the Dark Lord.

The Dark Lord was bound in chains of fire, and bound within the eternal and MERCIFUL Light of the Lord, and the Eaters of Death with him, and the Lord cast them out to an empty place where they were left with naught but their own terrors, to hound them for all eternity.

And the Lord beheld it, and saw that it was good. The Dark Lord had his eternal life, his followers had the eternal company of /their/ Lord that they had so longed for(and a place where those who were not magical would never infiltrate) and the Chosen One was sav√©d.

The End.
