It's been a long time since I read it, but I /think/ that Arcturus Black in /Honor Thy Blood/ might fit the bill. I'm not one for Harry/Daphne, which this story has and which annoyed me, but I recall thinking this one was okay. linkffn(12155794)

Edit: (Warning) There was also wizarding nobility/politics stuff in this one as well, but it was handled better, I thought, than many other such stories.
