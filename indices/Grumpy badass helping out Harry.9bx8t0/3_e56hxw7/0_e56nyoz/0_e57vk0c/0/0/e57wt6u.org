It's aTV series about Vampires and Werewolves with a kickass female protagonist destined to fight them, directed by Joss Whedon ( Avengers, Firefly, Cabin in the Woods).

The first season shows its age a little bit, but it's definitely in my top 5 TV shows of all time.

Not sure. I have no idea about the state of the fandom, but I think there's the usual shipping wars.
