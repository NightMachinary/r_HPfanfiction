Well canon says that, Fridwulfa left Hagrid´s Dad because she was disappointed, that Hagrid was so small and left, that´s why she also neglected Grawp, he also only remembers her as being a bad mother. Though your headcanon is really intriguing and yeah considering everything in canon, the giants behavior is more likely because of nurture than nature.
