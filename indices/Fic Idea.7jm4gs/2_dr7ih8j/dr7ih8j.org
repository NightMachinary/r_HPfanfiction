I have to agree with TE7. Any that would have oppose him at that point would have died. Besides Dumbledore of course. /elder wand/. And if Dumbledore did manage to defeat him shorty after Harry was born. I still think the story would be mostly the same. If Harry created a group of friends like James did when he went to school. He would still be the mostly admire like Cedric. And people would look at him as a leader.

On a different note, if Dumbledore failed, there would probably be another magical war.
