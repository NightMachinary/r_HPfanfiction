  Since it was prophesied that only Harry had the power to kill him nobody else could have stopped him.

Except... we don't know how prophecies work. It might be that the only reason Harry was the one to kill him was /because everyone thought he was the only person who could kill him/.

We have no idea how prophecies work, so it's really down to the individual fic author to decide.
