Copy pasting my comment from a thread earlier today:

  War would have gone on and on. Since it was prophesied that only Harry had power to kill him nobody else could have stopped him.

  Dumbledore, even with Elder wand, barely kept Voldemort at bay.

  There would have been lots and lots of deaths.
