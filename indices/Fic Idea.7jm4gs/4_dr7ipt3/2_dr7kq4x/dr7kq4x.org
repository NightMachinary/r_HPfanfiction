Since it was prophesied that only Harry had power to kill him nobody else could have stopped him.

Which is why I'm stating an interesting idea if what if Voldemort never heard the prophecy or what if it was never made. Say Severus never heard it, or a Death Eater killed Trelawney before it was made or he didn't believe in it.

Dumbledore, even with Elder wand, barely kept Voldemort at bay

Are you sure? From my memory of it Dumbledore and Voldemort were pretty even when it came to fighting, heck Dumbledore was the only one that Voldemort truly feared.

There would have been lots and lots of deaths.

And that's where fanfiction comes in, I don't expect the AU to be an Utopia for Harry and co. I still expect Voldemort and the Death Eaters to kill and hurt people who are against them, but with the bonus of James, Lily, Frank, Alice, Sirius and Remus still around it could be interesting to see the differences.
