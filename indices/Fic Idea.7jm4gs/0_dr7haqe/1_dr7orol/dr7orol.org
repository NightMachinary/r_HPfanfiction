That is IMO the more likely outcome, since Dumbledore was badly outmatched in the War despite tremendous personal power.

Perhaps Dumbledore would grow desperate and reactivate Grindelwald? There was also the possibility of Dumbledore evacuating Britain with what remained of the Order after Voldemort took over the Ministry.

As for Pettigrew, I don't see him fighting till the end for a losing cause. He would either defect or escape. Maybe in this AU, he simply chose to run away.
