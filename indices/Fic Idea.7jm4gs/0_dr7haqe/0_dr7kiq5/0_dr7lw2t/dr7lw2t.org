Except that's exactly how you phrased it. You took arbitrary events from the stories and essentially say 'if X doesn't happen Harry has a happy family with his parents and their friends' which there is literally no way of knowing.

In fact, if, say, Pettigrew isn't a spy. Then it's unlikely the Potter's go into hiding because they went into Hiding purely because Dumbledore thought someone was spying on them. Dumbledore doesn't likely get that suspicion if no one actually is spying on them.

If the Potter's don't go into hiding then there's still a war going on and from what we know of James and Sirius they likely want to fight. They're opposing a Dark Wizard that was so frightening a decade after his believed death people still won't say his name. We know that Voldemort handily beat James in, arguably, a battlefield of James's choosing.

Likely James and Sirius, and possibly even Remus and Lily, encounter Voldemort in a place where they're at even less likely to be successful.

The 'Likely Scenario' if Voldemort doesn't hear the prophecy is that the good guys lose. We're presented with a world where they are not only losing, but losing badly and have no idea how to fight. And then they only win on a miracle. Voldemort is the Detroit Lions in 2015 and Baby Harry Potter is Aaron Rodgers standing on his own 40 yard line with no time left on the clock.

Yet your scenario you immediately go into is immediately a big happy family. Harry likely only gets any semblance of a family precisely because Voldemort tries to kill him as a baby. If he doesn't, there's a very good chance that everyone you mention would be killed violently in the coming months and years.

The idea that if you change one event everything else goes to the better often ignores the context of the other events around it. And there's always a chance, and a chance that I'd argue is far greater, that the events that change would be worse.

A far more interesting idea is to (and I'm going to vomit in my mouth here because time travel as a premise is stupid) see how much better the world is precisely because only James and Lily died and having Harry contemplate if he would rather live in a world where he had parents, or a world where the Weasley's and Hermione still exist precisely because his parents died for him, playing off Great and Terrible things.

You immediately go on to say 'have all these people who are fighting a losing war in their lives' but do not present a 'what if' scenario that would logically lead to those people actually surviving said war.

And we can go even further down the rabbit hole? What happens if Snape doesn't hear the prophecy? Well Snape at twenty seems to be a coward. Even Dumbledore points out that he isn't concerned about James or Harry Potter and only with Lily. In his own screwed up psyche he sees James as the thing that's keeping Lily from him. So he likely still tries to find a way to get Voldemort to kill James so he can have a chance at Lily. Because the text literally presents his only qualm about Voldemort's actions that he will not be able to be with Lily. He literally says this to Dumbledore in fewer words. He knowingly sent Voldemort to kill James and Harry precisely because he thought Lily would survive. Through all of that he still thought he'd have a chance at Lily. And that's, well, sad and pathetic.
