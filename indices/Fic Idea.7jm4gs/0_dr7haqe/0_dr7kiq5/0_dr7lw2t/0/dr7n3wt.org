Apologies, I didn't mean to make it sound as though I expected a happy family, that was not my intention at all.

I just meant that Harry's family life would likely be better then it was at the Dursley's. I still expect James, Lily, Frank, Alice and even Sirius and Remus to fight the war, possibly even getting hurt or maybe even killed in the process.

That could actually be a interesting thing to consider. Say Lily is killed protecting some people, how would it affect the family? That is what's so great about fanfiction, you have a number of different ways it could go. Say Lily is killed but not until Harry is old enough say eleven/twelve or whatever, what kind of dynamics you could go through with Harry and James would be interesting.

Or say Sirius died protecting the Potters or just James, or Remus. The guilt that it could have on them, would be interesting to explore.

Again a lot of different things that could happen. It wouldn't be a utopia, it would still be war. But it would be interesting to see the damage it could have once say Harry is older.

But that's just my thoughts on it, I think way too much on possible scenerios, apologies if it didn't seem like I was thinking things logically or made it seem like it was a utopia because that not my intention. I just didn't want to post a long as heck paragraph on my thoughts; which I figured would be too boring to read. (As I'm doing the long as heck paragraph now).
