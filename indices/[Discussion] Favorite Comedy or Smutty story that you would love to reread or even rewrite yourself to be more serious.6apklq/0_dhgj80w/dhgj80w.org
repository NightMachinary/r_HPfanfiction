Harry, an Unspeakable and alcoholic, travels back to the years when the first war with Voldemort is heating up.

The original fic is a little thin since there aren't that many chapters, but with a premise like that, it just begs to have a serious remake. I'd love to see a cynical, fucked up Harry Potter going around in undercover Rust Cohle/Crash-style on the past, trying to take down Voldemort and his pals. Of course, if there's going to be any influence from /True Detective/, things won't end neatly or well for all the characters involved.
