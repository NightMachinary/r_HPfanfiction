In addition to the point made by [[/u/bgottfried91]] that Voldemort was able to kill Frank pre-resurrection, there's also another factor you have to consider: it is possible to create a horcrux by ordering a person's death. See: Moaning Myrtle, who was killed by the basilisk on Voldemort's orders - still enough to make the diary horcrux out of her death. So even if it was Wormtail who killed Bertha, Voldemort could probably still use that murder to make a horcrux, as it would have been on his orders.
