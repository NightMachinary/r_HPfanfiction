He was corporeal at the beginning of book 4, he was just in his tiny baby form. He kills Frank Bryce himself with an AK. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1994][The Harry Potter wiki states]] that Bertha Jorkins died a month or two before that. I don't think it's ever explicitly stated when Wormtail started the potion that gave Voldemort his form back, but it was presumably prior to their return to England?
