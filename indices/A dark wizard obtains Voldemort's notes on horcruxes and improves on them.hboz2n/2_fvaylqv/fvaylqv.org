The biggest weakness of Horcruxes for me is that after you die it takes a lot of effort to bring back your body. Voldemort despite his ability, took 14 years to regain his body.

So developing some type of automatic body recreation magic that activates when you die would be a huge upgrade.

Or just have friends that you trust to bring you back.

Another thing is to explore living Horcruxes more. Split your soul to create a clone with all your ability and knowledge. Implant a soul into another as a sleeper agent, etc
