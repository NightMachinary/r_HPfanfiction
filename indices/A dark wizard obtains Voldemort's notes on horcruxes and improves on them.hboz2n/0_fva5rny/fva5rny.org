There's a (sadly unfinished) fic which touches upon "perfect" soul extraction/binding to an object, it doesn't play a huge role but its at least a relevant subplot. I have the name somewhere... I think it had Diablo references in there somewhere, but that may also be me mixing up two similar fics.

Aha, it's linkffn(The Merging)! Amazing fic, sadly no updates in the last year.
