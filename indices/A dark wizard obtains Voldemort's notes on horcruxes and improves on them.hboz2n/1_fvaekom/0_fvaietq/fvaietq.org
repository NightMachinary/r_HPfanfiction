Less fixing the horcrux's abilities as much as just improving their usefulness, since imo the default horcruxes are kinda weak. They protect you from dying, but in a weak incorporeal form, and reconstituting yourself is a difficult and lengthy process that took voldemort a literal decade and was impossible without outside help. Imagine how terrifying a villain could be if they found a way to make it truly resurrect them, so even if you kill them theyll be back in a month at the latest, kind of like a lich's phylactery.
