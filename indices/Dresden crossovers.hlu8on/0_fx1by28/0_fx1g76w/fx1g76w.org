As I understand it, Dresden's magic is based largely on belief. There are limits, but if you believe something should happen, it will probably happen. Hence why the same spell can be used with different words and the like. I think this is also shown in Ghost Story. And if Potter's wand is damaged at all, he is largely defenceless. As to the shield issue... I understand why Dresden's might be ineffective, but why would you assume Harry's would be effective? We know they can be broken. We don't know exactly what it takes, but we do know that unforgivables can bypass them, and that while Harry was learning, a jellylegs jinx was enough to break it. So I can absolutely believe that Dresden could break it.
