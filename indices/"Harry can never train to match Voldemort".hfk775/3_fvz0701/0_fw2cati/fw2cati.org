  You're stronger with other people, Harry

In my headcanon, Harry would rally the DA and probably as many other allies as he could (from the Order of the phoenix, other students, Hogsmeade) and then face Voldemort and ask him how many people he could possibly shield against. Voldemort would never ask his Death Eaters to help him but Harry has no problems with that.

Soon Voldemort realizes that he might have been the "most powerful Dark Lord in the world" but he's still not more powerful than 300 people focus firing on him. The first 60 stunners knockback his shield, the next 60 stunners crack it, the next 60 stunners shatter it to pieces. And there's still 120 stunners left to stop his heart completely. All without any risk of friendly fire.

And THAT is the power he knows not. The ability to trust others with his life and enlist their aid. That is the "love" that Dumbledore was talking about.
