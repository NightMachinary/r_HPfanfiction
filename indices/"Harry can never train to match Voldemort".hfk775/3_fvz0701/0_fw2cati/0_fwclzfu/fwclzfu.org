If you replace 'Harry would' with 'Harry's friends would', then I could totally agree with you. Don't really think he has the self-esteem or lacks the passive suicidal ideation to actually think his friends and allies should come risk their lives with/for him. Probably see a more "Look to my coming at first light on the 5th day. At dawn, look to the East." moment where his allies appear around him and his friends tell him they all care and want to help rather than him actively bringing them along.

Either way, it'd definitely be a more Harry Potter thematic-appropriate ending than Rowling's Deus ex Dumbledore.
