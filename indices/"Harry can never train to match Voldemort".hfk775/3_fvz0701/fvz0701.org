I can't remember the fic, but one of my favourite 'reinterpretations of the Final Battle' had Harry going all out against Voldemort (after his resurrection and Neville killing Nagini) and failing badly, but holding his own until Voldemort finally knocked him down and stood over him to give some Villainous Monologue thing, which was when Ron bombarda-ed the guy in the back and Harry quickly reducto-ing Voldemort in the face when he stumbled due the spell basically being a bomb exploding right on his back.

It was a nice 'Harry is a proper hero rather than just a tool of Dumbledore's plan' moment, but grounded and restrained and fits the whole "You're stronger with other people, Harry, because they keep sacrificing themselves for you when you get into shit." theme of the actual books.
