Not trying to change your mind, but besides the satisfaction that Harry actually beating LV would have brought, what bothered me most about the ending was that it cemented Harry's status as truly lacking agency. When push came to shove, he was just doing the things that Dumbledore laid out.

And /that/ means that the tale of a plucky young orphan and his two best pals was /actually/ the story of a jaded old man who espoused a plan that was only matched in intricacy by his opponents mindlessly convoluted schemes. What an awful message.
