To each their own. Harry having a big ol' fight with Voldemort is satisfying to read in a fanfic, but with the books that were built to be about something I find themes to be more satisfying. Harry's just a regular kid throughout most of the series. Of course he lacks agency. A child coming up with a winning strategy against someone built to be the most powerful dark wizard there was is like Frodo figuring out how to beat Sauron and telling Gandalf to suck it.

If that's the way you want to see Harry Potter then that's fine, that's your right, but I disagree categorically. Dumbledore gave him a plan, a vague one at that, but Harry and co did the work, struggled and suffered against seemingly impossible odds to come out with a win.
