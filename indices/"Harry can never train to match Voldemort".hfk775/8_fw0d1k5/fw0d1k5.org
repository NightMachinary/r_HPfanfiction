It's not defeatist to assume that Harry has no chance, it's realistic. Draco disarming Dumbledore was a once in a lifetime lucky shot considering all the mitigating factors involved, namely Dumbledore was dying from a curse, hopped up on an unknown poison, and was preoccupied with keeping Harry hidden and safe. This would never happen with Voldemort.

I was fairly satisfied with the ending. It was thematically appropriate. Harry's sacrifice protected his loved ones and the villain was defeated by his own hubris and lack of empathy and love. Very storybook, which I feel was the intent.
