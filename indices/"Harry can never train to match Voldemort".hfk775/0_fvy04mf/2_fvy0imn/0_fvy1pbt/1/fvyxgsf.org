I agree. We don't really know the definition of what 'defies' means. It could be a scenario like multiple Aurors trying to fight Voldemort while James and Lily escape. That could count like defiance.

Logically, the Potters shouldn't stand a chance in a duel against him. He's meant to be a 53 to 55 year old wizard who has traveled the world extensively for knowledge of all sorts, has practiced and horned his skills beyond 99% of wizards, and the only person who is in his league happens to be a wizard with 45 years of advantage in age. Compare this with the Potters, who may have been very talented at spellwork but they're only just out of Hogwarts, with no special training, or anything of such. Longbottoms are a slighly better case seeing as they're meant to be older (Auror training takes three years, and they were celebrated Aurors so they must've already caught a lot of Dark Wizards), but it is still hard to imagine someone in their late 20s overpowering Voldemort in a duel.

I prefer to interpret the 'defiance' as just going against his wishes - declining his offer to join the Death Eaters, perhaps ruining a plan of his, escaping successfully when he wanted them dead, subduing his followers, and so on.
