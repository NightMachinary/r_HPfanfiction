Once upon a time I would have agreed the Longbottoms and Potters fought Voldemort, but I read a story on ffn which changed my perspective on "defied." I don't remember if it's a one shot or part of a larger J/L fic, but the author has a Death Eater or Voldemort demand James and Lily to join 3 different times and J/L say no.

So while it's entirely possible they fought Voldemort magically, I don't think that's the whole truth of it anymore.

I just personally find it unbelievable a 17 yr old, no matter how good he is, can take on a prodigy in his prime on a leveled playing field. Even 17 yr old TMR would get worked by middle aged Tom, Albus, and Gellert.
