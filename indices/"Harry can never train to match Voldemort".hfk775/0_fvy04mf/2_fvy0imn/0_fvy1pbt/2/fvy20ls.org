Ehhhhhh LV is hyped up though. He was terrifying because of the guerilla warfare (imperius-ing peeps, never knowing who was working for him, who you could trust). He ran from Dumbledore through most of the 1st war, so we know he isn't a magical juggernaught.

And it is canon that, as a shade, LV was confused and disoriented, so that knocks off what, 15 or so years from his 'experience'.

I'd say he capitalized on his enemies' terror, age (Dumbledore was way over the hill), and stupidity (if Harry put half as much time into learning to fight as he did Quidditch...).
