Well, Defense Against the Dark Arts isn't something you can be innately talented at like Quidditch. Much of it is about knowledge that you need to learn yourself. That said Harry is repeatedly shown to have traits that make him good at DADA ie his reflexes, quick thinking, resourcefulness and power behind his spells. That's why he was able to teach DADA even to upperclassmen.
