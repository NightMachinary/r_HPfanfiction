I think JKR said that both couples fought Voldemort or where present in a battle with Voldemort those three times.

Defied in this case means, "fought and survived".

I think that people are taking this on this like it's dragon ball and after some level of power the other guy's attacks just become useless against the other, and it's not like that.

I think it's closer to a fight in real life, yes, the more experienced guy, still not bothered by age, would certainly win more, but luck or skill could give the beginner an opening.

For example, Voldemort toys with Harry enough to give him a split second opening where he stuns/ blinds/distracts and then AKs him, that's it. I think of it like fencing, even the most experienced guy could open themselves to a well-placed riposte.

All that we know about Voldemort's fighting style(when he's not playing) comes from one serious fight we saw in it's entirety and that had him running around while Dumbledore tried to whack him like a mole or tie him up, the most effective thing he did was spam AKs like they were going out of style, while Dumbledore transfigured stuff around and used magic fire whips. Voldemort was on the defensive the whole time.

The other fight is a three on one where Voldemort couldn't really hurt the others because Harry had powered a Resist Magic 90% buff on everyone.

I like to believe if Harry was talented like Dumbledore, and practiced every day since second year like some fics have it, he would have a similar duel with Tom, just with inversed positions.
