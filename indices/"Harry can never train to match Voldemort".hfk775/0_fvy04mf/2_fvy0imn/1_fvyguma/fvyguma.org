Per JKR in 2007, one of the three defiances was refusing to join him when the Death Eaters attempted to recruit them. It takes very little to "defy" Voldemort.

  MA: What about the three times-- The thrice-defying of Voldemort?

  JKR: Of James and Lily?

  MA: Of Neville's parents. Well, James and Lily, too.

  JKR: It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.

Also, the Voldemort vs Slughorn/Kingsley/McGonagall is not really a "real" fight because the Order people were protected by Harry's sacrificial magic. Voldemort lands multiple hits on them, but the magic does nothing because of Harry's protection. So it can't really be taken as a guide - by all indications, in a real fight Voldemort would have killed all three very rapidly and moved on.
