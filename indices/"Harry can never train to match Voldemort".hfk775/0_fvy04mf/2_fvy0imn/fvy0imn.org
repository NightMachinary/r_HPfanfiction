This is a great response, but I'd like to argue against it if you don't mind :)

We see Voldemort actually fight for real twice - once against Dumbledore in the Atrium in detail, once against Slughorn/Flitwick/.... McG? during the battle of Hogwarts in very vague terms.

We do know, however, that Frank/Alice and James/Lily both fought him 3x and walked away. They were (basically) fresh out of Hogwarts at that point.

So I disagree Harry would need to be 40. He has the power already (chased away 100 Dementors in 3rd year), just needs some basic training and battle magic.
