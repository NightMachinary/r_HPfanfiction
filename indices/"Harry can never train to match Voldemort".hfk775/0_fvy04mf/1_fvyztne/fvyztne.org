I don't think he would be siring childrens if Voldemort was after his life. He becomes father only when Voldemort is dead, he even broke up with Ginny because of his quest.

I do agree on the age though, Voldemort was at the age of 45 years when he started his War, Grindelwald was born in 1882/1883 and also waited 45 years to properly start his Global Wizarding War (if Crimes of Grindelwald - 1927 - is counted as the starting point). It seems that mid 40s is when a wizard truly starts to reach his/her peak.
