When we say this we mean like a Dumbledore vs Voldemort atrium type duel. And technically canon Harry does have a one trick shot.

Harry would have to be an adult. At least mid 40s and I feel like that's very generous for canon, father of 3 Harry. I mean Voldemort waited until his mid 40s to take on Dumbledore and he was a prodigy.
