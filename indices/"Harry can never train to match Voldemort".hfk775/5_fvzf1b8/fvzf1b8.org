Voldemort leaves School in the late 40s, he appears in the Early 70's and the almost dies in 81, that's over 30 years of magical combat training and experience that Harry will never be able to catch up too, add on to this that Albus Dumbledore who's had 80 years of learning and teaching is barely able to push Voldemort back every time they fight and is unable to even capture him with the power of the Elder Wand at his disposal.
