Why does everyone want Harry to defeat Voldemort in a straight duel?

Why can't you make everyone contribute, make every key player have their moments? In real wars, tactical positioning always tops raw combat power anyway. Gallant duels will no longer be necessary if you can deliver your firepower against an unsuspecting and unprepared enemy. War is all about deception and fighting UNFAIRLY!

Make use of Tonks's metamorphus ability, make her the super infiltrator.

Make use of Dumbledore's alchemy power, and let him develop aerosolized basilisk venom.

Voldemort may have superb destructive combat power, but he had to identify a target first! In fact, like in modern Muggle warfare, any Magical target that could be identified could also be destroyed. Voldemort may be super strong in offense, but a Killing Curse cast at his unsuspecting back would still destroy his body. And his Death Eaters would be of course far far more vulnerable.

--------------

Harry of course needs to be trained, but its main purpose is not to defeat Voldemort one on one, but defeat rank and file Death Eaters and their Ministry goons with relative ease. Harry will far more likely face these scums than the big bad himself, and Harry will absolutely need to survive these encounters with high chance to complete his mission.

Not training Harry just because he wouldn't be able to defeat Voldemort in a straight duel is totally retarded.
