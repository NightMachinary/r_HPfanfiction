I doubt any of Hogwarts' staff has read Art of War. Why would any of them think to do any of this? Most wizards live completely separate from Muggles and especially Muggle warfare. Dumbledore spent years in Hogwarts teaching, probably only venturing outside rarely, and certainly not to go on a muggle battlefield or read up on muggle military tactics.
