What canon evidence can you provide beyond 'street rep' that Voldemort is that strong? Nothing in the Atrium duel (the only time we see LV 'take the gloves off') is shocking. Imaginative transfiguration wouldn't be all that technically difficult based on what classwork we see.

I guess I just don't buy the hype. Everyone is piss-their-pants scared because of the 1st war (which as I noted in another comment, was mostly hit/run, imperius/betrayal) or is Dumbledore talking him up. We see Harry do incredible magic. There's no reason to assume, if JKR were better at writing combat, that a more battle-tested/trained Harry couldn't give a legit fight against LV.
