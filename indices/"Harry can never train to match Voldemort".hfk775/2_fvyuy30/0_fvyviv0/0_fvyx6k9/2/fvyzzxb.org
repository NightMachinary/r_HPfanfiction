  Voldemort is widely known as being the most powerful Dark wizard of all time

People say Hitler is the worst of all time, when he isn't(by most statistics), he's just famous, same for Voldemort.

And remember we are talking about JKR often times lacking worldbuilding(in a done before plot way). Gellert has more feats than Voldemort just from one movie. The guy no sold thirty adult wizards, Aurors at that, like they were first-years throwing jelly legs jinxes, he then summoned that Fiendfyre/Protego Diabolica spell that had to be countered by twenty or more wizards.

Voldemort's greatest feat was blowing up a battered shield cast by three people.

Voldemort was a local terrorist at most, I doubt his merry band of rich racists could stand up to a real government, instead of the corrupt and sabotaged thing Fudge had going on.

Voldemort was doing his best to kill Dumbledore and Dumbledore was making him apparate around and spam the AK while he captured Bellatrix and shielded Harry, I am pretty sure he didn't dodge or block that AK because he knew Fawkes would just laugh it off.

Honestly, people hype him up, but I like stories where he's just a particularly powerful Dark Lord and not the bringer of the end times.
