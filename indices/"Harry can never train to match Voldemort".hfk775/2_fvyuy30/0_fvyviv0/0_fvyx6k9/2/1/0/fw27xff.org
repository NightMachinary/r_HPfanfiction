I didn't see this til now, since you were replying to someone else, but doesn't what you said - "make Voldemort a powerful dark wizard and little more" - correspond logically with canon?

We know Merlin, the Founders, Herpo the Foul, and others were incredibly powerful. Magic was everywhere in the past; despite LV's grandstanding and Dumbledore's fearmongering, even when I was reading the books (and had never touched fanfiction) I never came away thinking "Wow LV is the most powerful wizard ever!"

I'd say that to the people living through his insurrection, he is the worst, just like Pinochet was the most brutal dictator /to the people of Chile/ that he was "disappearing". If you think of it that way, the world in canon makes more sense, like how:

- the ICW waged war against Grindelwald, but ignored LV's rise (he didn't compare to GG)

- Harry is famous for surviving an AK, not necessarily killing a small-time Dark Lord

- Still no international reaction when LV took over Britain in the 2nd War

- Besides his original pureblood followers, all the Snatchers/new DEs were the wizarding equivalent of rednecks/low-born trash (LV wasn't inspiring ordinary people)

None of this is to say LV is /weak/, just that we see the HP-verse through a young boy's eyes, a boy who lives in a community that is terrified of LV. There is nothing concrete to base LV's delusions of grandeur that he's the most powerful baddie ever on.
