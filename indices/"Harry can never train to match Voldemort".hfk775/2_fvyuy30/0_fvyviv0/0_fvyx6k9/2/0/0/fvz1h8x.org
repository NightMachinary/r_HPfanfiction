Most of the combat is simplified in that it seems they are just using stunners and blasting curses, but it's pretty much all non verbal so we can't be sure.

But we do see people having a beam battle, and spamming apparition.

And Gellert parrying/shielding 20 Aurors shooting at him at the same time while dropping them one by one.

In the second movie there's more stuff, but we see Aurors capturing people mid apparition(they kind of bring them back with a spell), and a lot spell fire.

Grindelwald them summons magic blue fire that /desintegrates/ only those that are against him and then turn into three giant fire dragons that start destroying everything and chasing people, only to be stopped when Flamel gets there and has everyone that's left cast a wide area finite incataten.
