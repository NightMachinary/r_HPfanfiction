(Really enjoying this debate btw!!!) Killing Curse can't be cast silently (or at least, we never see any Unforgivable being cast that way), and it is a... (counts on fingers) 6 syllable phrase. Nobody's spamming that shit (say it 10 times fast, right now. How many times did it actually come out correctly?), no matter how great they are.

Secondly, Lockhart shows reputation is pretty meaningless in the Wizarding World.

Third, we know a majority of wizards are woefully inadequate at spellcasting (most students with OWLs at HW cannot cast a protego or expilliarmus correctly, plus the Weasley Twins say most cannot when pushing their Shield Hats). So Voldemort's strength/skill is measured against a mean that Harry already vastly surpasses - keep in mind he is more capable than the overwhelming majority of British wizards /in canon/, as a lazy jerk-off who plays chess with his buddy and spends most of his time thinking about Quidditch and girls.

Since we don't see LV vs. Bones, we don't know how that fight went. He might have barely scraped out a win for all the info we're given.

My fic will have LV get housed by Harry. All it takes is some imagination and actual preparation by Harry. Nothing outrageous, no otherworldly deities interfering (cough Hallows cough). Just actually thinking about how to kill someone and trying, instead of taking an AK to the head on the advice of your dead school teacher.
