I feel like you're ignoring some of the other feats that Voldemort had. Dueling an Elder wand wielding Dumbledore and managing to duel three Professors while they were under Harry's protection

There's nothing wrong with Harry winning unconventionally and using non-direct tactics

However your story will suck if you're making Voldemort weaker just so that Harry will curbstomp him

I have read hundreds of stories like that. Harry uses logic and unconventional tactics to kill Voldemort. The only issue is that a lot of the time they turn Voldemort into an idiotic clown

A good story would be The Many Deaths of Harry Potter. In that Harry defeated Voldemort with guerilla like tactics and by preparing weapons rather than directly dueling him
