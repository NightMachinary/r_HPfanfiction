Yes! It's even worse in the movies imo. They're just shooting lights back and forth.

My headcanon is that for a majority of Wizards using things like apparition and transfiguration in battle is too difficult so they just don't do it

I remember Harry talking about how during exams it takes like half an hour for a student to perform a transfiguration.

One of the reason why I like the duel at the ministry so much is the high level of transfiguration that was used
