You do remember Why Draco managed to disarm Albus, yes?? It had nothing to do with Draco. Albus chose to paralize Harry, instead of facing whoever was coming up the stairs.

As for Harry's training, that's by design. As far as Albus was concerned, Harry was never supposed to survive his final encounter with Riddle. So why bother training the kid properly? It's not like they had 20 years to do said training.
