While I don't necessarily disagree, to point out your Draco argument: Dumbledore was dying, knew of Narcissa's unbreakable vow, and let Draco disarm him to have the Elder wand over Snape.

So... /No/, Draco was not a weak wizard who was able to disarm and take down a powerful one with a well placed spell.
