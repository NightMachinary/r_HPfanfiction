Harry Potter and the Homecoming by BulshivekMuppet99, a 6 part series. It is... very good, but honestly left me feeling gross afterward. Worth it for one scene of badassery around the third part in which Gellert Grindlewald duels ten Death Eaters to a stand still and blocks a killing curse with blood magic.
