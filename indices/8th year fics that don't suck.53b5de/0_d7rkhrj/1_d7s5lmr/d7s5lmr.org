They are called 8th year, rather than 7th year for tagging purposes. It's so you know it's a DH (probably EWE) compliant fic set at hogwarts. Also, in these fic usually lots of kids who were 7th years the year before come back again and are "8th years" because their 7th year was too turbulent to have learned much.

7th year fics, on the other hand, tend to be AUs where Harry and friends go to hogwarts for 7th year, or canon compliant fics of what the DA was doing at hogwarts during 7th year. It's just a nice, simple way of tagging so you can filter for the fic you want.
