I don't know why the guy is being down voted but he has a point. If you fail 6th grade, and decide to redo, it won't be your 7th grade that you redo but your 6th.

Similarly because they didn't finish Year seven in the book, if they do decide to go back they will be going back for year seven of their education and not year 8 because that doesn't exist.

Year one is first grade and so on in England, Wales, NZ and Australia.

The only way that makes sense is if we are not talking in regards to education. So it would be the 'year' 8 considering in each book a year passes.

Meh, I don't care but kinda shocked by the down votes the guy received.
