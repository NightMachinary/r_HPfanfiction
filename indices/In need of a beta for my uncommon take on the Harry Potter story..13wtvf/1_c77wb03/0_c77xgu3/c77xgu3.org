You can read what I have so far at the link and I'd rather you do that because it would be better if you found out what the story was about that way. I'm pretty sure a beta is someone who reads over the story before it's posted to give input and help with editing. As for a synopsis, it's an AU story where Harry didn't go to Hogwarts and comes back when the new minister's daughter, Ginny Weasley, has been kidnapped. He brings with him new allies and a new way to fight Voldemort.
