  It was a dark and dreary night in London*,* with the last rays of sunlight having passed long ago unnoticed due to the ominous clouds advancing with the sporadic flash of lightning and rumble of thunder. This atmosphere was matched inside the Prime Minister's office*,* where he was meeting with the current Minister of Magic, Arthur Weasley. Weasley had taken office just six months prior after his predecessor had faced a no confidence vote for his lack of response to Voldemort's return a year earlier. Since taking office*,* he had taken a more aggressive stance against Voldemort by increasing the DMLE's funding and performing a shakedown at the Ministry*, a shakedown* which had successfully revealed that there were many spies among them. Unfortunately for Arthur*,* Voldemort decided to respond by going after his*[unclear pronoun reference]* family*;* just three days earlier his youngest child, his daughter Ginny*,* had been kidnapped*;* and he *[unclear pronoun reference]* was desperate to find her after those at the ministry proved useless. So desperate that he decided to look to the muggle world for help+,+*;* it was for this reason that he was currently in the muggle Prime Minister's office at the moment.

That's roughly ten grammatical corrections in just the first paragraph. I believe it's generally recommended that you proofread yourself before expecting someone else to fix all your grammar. I'd be willing to beta your story, as it seems interesting from the first paragraph... You will, however, have to correct your grammar and such to make it readable to whoever you pick to beta for you. That way, they can work on critique of content rather than grammar.
