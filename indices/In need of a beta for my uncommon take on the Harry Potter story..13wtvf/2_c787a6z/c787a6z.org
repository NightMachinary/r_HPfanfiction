In my experience in the HP fandom, an alpha helps with the story arc, character and plot development, placement of story elements, and other big picture stuff. A beta gets down to the detail work, correcting SPaG (spelling, punctuation and grammar), inconsistencies, formatting errors and so forth. Those definitions aren't carved in stone, of course. I've beta'd for about two years and I often chime in (politely) about overarching story elements you might normally ask an alpha to look at.
