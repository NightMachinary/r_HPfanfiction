It's not really a Marvel crossover but Hermione tries to form an alliance between her group and the Avengers to fight against the Death Eaters and the Voldemort-sympathic Ministry. The 'Avengers' aren't actually the Marvel ones, just wizards who read too many comics. To be more exact, undercover aurors who pretend to be rebelling muggleborn so they use the name from a comic to say 'hey look we're so muggle culture we're totally legit' and infiltrate Hermione's Muggleborn Resistance.
