Not sure if it fully fits what you look for, but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8575201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Escape-to-New-York][Harry Potter and the Escape to New York]]. It is a fic I am enjoying despite not knowing the crossover world at all, and it is almost completed.\\
The "outside society" here is the odd world from the short lived 'Beauty and the Beast' TV series.
