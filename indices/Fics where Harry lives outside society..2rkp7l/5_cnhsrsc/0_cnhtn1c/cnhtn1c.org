Gypsy Caravan is /very/ slash heavy. So much so that I actually started to skip over the more R rated scenes, and I actually like slash.

To the Waters and the Wild is gorgeously written, like everything else by Paimpont, and has a wonderful dreamlike quality. The slash is quite minor, and in fact hasn't really happened to any real extent yet because Harry is still young. I highly recommend it.
