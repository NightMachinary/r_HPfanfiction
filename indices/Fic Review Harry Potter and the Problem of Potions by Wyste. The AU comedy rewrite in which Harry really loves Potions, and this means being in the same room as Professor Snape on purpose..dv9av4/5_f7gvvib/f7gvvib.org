Agreed pretty much 100% with everything in this review, thanks for writing it!

This fic is my ultimate "comfort fic" that I default to when I'm feeling down. I've read the entire thing... 4 or 5 times, probably? It's just got a perfect blend of exactly my type of humour, great characterization (of particular note: Snape, for how close he is to his canon self, and Voldemort, for the exact opposite reason. This is my favourite version of Voldemort - he feels actually scary and less like a cartoon villain.) and some great additions to canon (like Harry and Ginny actually talking about a similar experience they had, I too wish that had happened in the books). Luna and Greg is such a crack ship but it works so well.

And agreed on struggling through the first two years - it does get easier on rereads and they have some amazingly funny lines, but the chapters are very short and glued to canon - they feel somewhat disjointed as a result.

I did not realize that this was written in such a short time, that is actually insane.
