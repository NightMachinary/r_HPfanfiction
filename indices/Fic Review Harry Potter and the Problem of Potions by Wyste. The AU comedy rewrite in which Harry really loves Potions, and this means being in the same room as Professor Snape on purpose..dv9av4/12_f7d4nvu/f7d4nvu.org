I commend your effort to write up this review. It clearly shows your enthusiasm and willingness to discuss the subject in a dedicated and structured manner. Seeing how this is Reddit for ff and not (enthusiast or) professional literature critique, I'm glad to see this being done at all.

Structurally, I'd say you could try to work on transparency, brevity, and purposefulness. How ship-building doesn't fit into characterisation or what exactly the disjunction of premise and plot is supposed to effect remains unclear to me. In general, plot summaries, especially for reviews, don't want to go into minute details. Cost efficiency in all types of writing -- which include meta discussions -- reign supreme; you should only mention plot elements beyond the general premise that serve to illustrate arguments you're trying to make (stylistics, characteristics, technical writing, etc.). Speaking of those, it is unorthodox and likely fruitless to spend the majority of a review on plot and characterisation, leaving the technical aspects of writing virtually untouched except for a lengthy paragraph about one stylistic characteristic -- its employment of humour.

Now, before you all rip into me, I want to reiterate that I'm grateful this type of post is being done at all. That being said, anything that calls itself review has to strive for more than cursory impressions neatly written down with a catchy little score underneath.

Still, just so we're clear -- I really am grateful for the time you put into this. Thank you.
