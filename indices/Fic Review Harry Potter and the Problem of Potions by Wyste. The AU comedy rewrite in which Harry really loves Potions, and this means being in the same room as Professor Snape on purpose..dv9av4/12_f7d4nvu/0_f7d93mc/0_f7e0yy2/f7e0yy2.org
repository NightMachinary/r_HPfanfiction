First of all, thank you for being very mature about your response. I wrote my original post after twelve hours of work yesterday, and I realise now that the tone was definitely a bit off. I apologise for that.

Brevity: I wouldn't go so far as to say that you should aim for a specific word count. At times, you will have more to say; sometimes you won't. That being said, you don't want to spend too much effort on one detail of your review at the cost of neglecting others. In that sense, your review should be well-rounded: For fanfiction, technical aspects, characterisation, narrative techniques, language, plot, and such should all feel like parts of a sum. It's hard to imagine one aspect dominating the others to a degree that the others are safe to be cut entirely -- unless abysmal orthography ruins the entire story or some such maybe.\\
The summary (or premise), however, is in all respects the least important bit of a review.\\
If you struggle with getting lost in details (as I do), I can share a useful technique: after finishing, aim to cut 5-10%. More often than not, you'll end up killing filler words, redundant phrases, or slightly obsolete details. But there's always something to cut -- trust me.

Transparency: I was simply referring to how you offer an overall grade, but it remains arcane how you reach this score if you don't give grades to other elements of your review (like plot).\\
You can stick to this model, but the more common approach would be to either rate every subcategory and thus derive an overall score or don't give a 'score' at all. Words can carry assessments just as well after all.

Subjectivity isn't a problem. All reviews are a matter of opinion, no matter how much professional critics insist otherwise. You should look up correspondences between leading feature writers; it's funny when they tear into one another.

I wasn't trying to say that you need to bother with an argumentative-style essay write-up. Still, logically speaking, presenting examples of humour (as you did in this one) are still arguments of your case. Really, I was just trying to make the case that you should only outline the plot and mention anything else only to illustrate a point.

I suppose the entire ship-thing is a matter of belief: I personally despise judging fics based on ships, and I don't get why people would or wouldn't read something based on characters that in 99% of all the cases don't behave like their canon counterparts anyway.\\
People put so much stock in distinguishing AUs from other types of fanfiction that they forget that ultimately any type of fanfiction is AU by definition (unless it literally retells canon) -- which includes the characters.

I haven't read very many fanfiction reviews, and it wouldn't help to point to a review of some other genre -- which would only miss the target audience and bore us all to death. I could, if you would like me to, write up my own review about one of your next projects (preferably something not overly long as I'm somewhat busy right now), and we could compare notes and see what we like with each review we end up with.\\
Just to put my money where my mouth is.
