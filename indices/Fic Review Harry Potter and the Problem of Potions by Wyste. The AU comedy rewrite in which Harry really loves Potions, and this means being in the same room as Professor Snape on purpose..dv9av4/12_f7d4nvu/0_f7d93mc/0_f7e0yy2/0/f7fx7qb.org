I don't think you've read very many fanfiction reviews because by and large they aren't done. I am curious to see an example of what you consider to be a good review though, so since you've offered, please do go ahead and write a review for my next piece. It's linked at the bottom of the post anyway, and as it happens it's under 40k. That's pretty bite-sized by fanfiction standards, so it shouldn't take up too much of your time.
