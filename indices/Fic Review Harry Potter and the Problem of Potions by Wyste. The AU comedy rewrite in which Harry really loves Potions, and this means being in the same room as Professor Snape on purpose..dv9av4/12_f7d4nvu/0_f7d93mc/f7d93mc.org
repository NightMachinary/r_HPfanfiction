My writing structure for these reviews is evolving with me for sure. You're probably right that I could do with making them more succinct. This is one is a full 500 words shorter than my last one, so I'm working on it, but I do have a habit of getting bogged down in details. Do you think a more standard short-form review would be better to run with? 1000 words or so? Less?

And in what respect do you think I should work on transparency?

In terms of arguments - I'm not going for an essay-style format here where I make an assertion and spend the rest of the review breaking down and backing up that assertion. It's only intended to be more of a gage on the quality of the story broken down by core elements, and yes, subjective to a degree to my impressions.

Sometimes I include 'shipbuilding' details in the characterisation section, but here it didn't feel like a natural segue so I gave it its own section. Mostly I just try to go into what I would want to know about a fic that I was considering reading, or what I would want to hear the opinions of others on with regards to a fic I'd already read.

I am sorry to hear that with the level of detail I go into you still consider this to be a cursory impression though. Perhaps you could provide me links to review examples you believe hit the right level of depth?
