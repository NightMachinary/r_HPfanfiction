It's an incredibly funny fic, if you like British humour.

For example, this statement caused me to giggle uncontrollably when I first read it:\\
'The trick to having a civil conversation with Draco Malfoy, he thought, was to assume Draco had only a passing relationship with the reality everyone else lived in. The reality Draco lived in meant people relaxed while talking about blood and were offended if someone suggested they weren't a natural born murderer.'

I will warn you not to bother with the sequel. There's a very large plot bomb that is dropped at the very end of /The Problem of Potions/ and unfortunately this bomb forms the backbone of the sequel. I started reading it and dropped it just a handful of chapters in because the premise was completely uninteresting.
