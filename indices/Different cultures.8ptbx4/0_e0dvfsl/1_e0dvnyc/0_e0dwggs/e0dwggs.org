I try. I certainly understand the appeal of the more mystical aspects of magic than the rote "I read it in a book" aspect.

My advice is start with The Mind Arts and probably Magicks of the Arcane, if for no other reason than they are shorter. PoS, Patron and PatS will take you a long time to work through.
