Absolutely Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, especially in the summer before 3rd year linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin).

Magicks of the Arcane has Harry and Dumbledore adventuring after 4th year to learn of new magics and information for the war with Voldemort linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane).

The Phoenix and the Serpent has Harry learning an innate quality of magic from an unexpected mentor linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent).

Wizards at War has Harry travel through dimensions to learn from the founders linkffn(Wizards at War). A bit tropey, but reasonably entertaining.

Of course The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts), but thats more through imitation of myth or creatures like dementors that he observed, as well as some advice.

Patron has Harry and Hermione traveling to various places to learn certain magics, particularly to Jamaica to learn about Voodoo based magics linkffn(Patron).
