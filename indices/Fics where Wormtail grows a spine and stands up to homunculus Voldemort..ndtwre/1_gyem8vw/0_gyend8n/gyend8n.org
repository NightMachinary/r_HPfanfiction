Well Wormtail shows some meek signs of rebellion during the first chapter when Barty Jr was still imprisoned by his dad so I would expect the turn to occur during that time rather than later on when he's completely broken. Still Voldemort had the information but in homunculus form he couldn't really move without help so he'd need to revert to his wraith form in order to get to BCJ and would still need to be careful not to be detected by Crouch Sr (who is an influential ministry official and hinted to be quite a powerful wizard) or Winky. Also Wormtail could pay his life debt by warning Harry about the TWT plot and then going into hiding since now he is wanted now by Voldemort, his former friends and the ministry.
