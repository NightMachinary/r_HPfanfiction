That would certainly change things, with Wormtail dead Crouch Jr. would have to do all his work and wouldn't be free to impersonate Moody.

How much is up to the author though.\\
They could probably still get Harry in the tournament via Crouch Sr. Though ensuring he wins would be harder.\\
Or perhaps they'd go for a different tactic, either Voldemort would be forced to use someone else's blood, which means Harry is still protected, but also means nothing ties Harry to life so he might have to due for real to destroy that horcrux in his head, or they'd have to snatch Harry at another point, perhaps on platform 9 and 3/4 or while he's shopping in diagon alley the next year.
