I think it would be great to read a fanfic where after being belittled for so long, Wormtail deliberately fucks up Voldemort's resurrection potion or general care for Voldemort's little baby homunculus form. After all, if you're relying on a “useless” “stupid” “coward” isn't it a given conclusion that such a person will make a fatal error in your care? :)
