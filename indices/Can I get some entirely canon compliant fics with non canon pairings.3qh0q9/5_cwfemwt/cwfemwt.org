linkffn(Snape's Oceans) post-epilogue, Ron dies. Is it still weird when they haven't been student/teacher for 20 years and Snape got a chance to move on from Lily? Still haven't figured it out.

linkffn(The Caretaker) post-epilogue, Snape gets released from prison and OOC Ron is a dreadful husband. And Snape and Hermione have some kind of not fully realized soul bond?

There are a few other Ron dies and Hermione discovers Snape is still alive and they get together ones, but I can't remember the titles at the moment.

If you're willing to ignore the epilogue there are quite a few more that I can add. linkffn(Post Tenebras, Lux) is in this category, but I'm linking it despite it not fulfilling your requirements perfectly because it's my favorite Snape/Hermione and the epilogue sucks anyway.
