Personally I hated how it made everything /even less magical/, forced meaningless conflicts that at times made me honestly think that “Harry” was actually Fudge under Polyjuice, made characters hand-wave things that they really should spend time investing (like the aging of Albus hand) couldn't decide what characters felt or how time-travel was supposed to work, had characters with season 8 of GoT's level of stupidity and shamelessly took a prophecy out of it's ass without any explanation whatsoever.

After I read it I actually had to re-read the books to make sure that /that/ wasn't the actual standard level of quality of the series and I had somehow missed it. Guaranteed, it is not quite “my immortal” level of bad but that is /really/ not that hight of a bar.
