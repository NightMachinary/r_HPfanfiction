Depends whether by any character you mean any 'human'/'former human' character or absolutely any intelligent/semi-intelligent character. If it's the latter than probably any of the intelligent/semi-intelligent character would be a no-go except maybe for the Veela and Winky cause she has a cute nose. If it's the former, I'll probably go with Aunt Marge because I couldn't get my dick up.
