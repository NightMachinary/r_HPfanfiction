By what we know from the books (original 7), the guys are physically similar enough, and not attractive to me, but one has only ever been a normal down-to-earth guy, living humbly and doing the best he could for his family, while the other dreamt big and, as he himself agrees, through his greatness his mistakes were proportionally greater. And he made a lot of those.
