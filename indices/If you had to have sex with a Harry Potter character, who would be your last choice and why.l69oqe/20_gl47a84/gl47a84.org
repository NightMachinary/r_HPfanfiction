Hagrid. I am female and that would never fit. Alternatively Firenze, Bane, Ronan and Magorian for the same reasons. Such case could also be made for Grawp.

Otherwise any Death Eater including Voldemort but that would be because of political reasons.

To be quite honest, I think there would be very little characters in Harry Potter that I would consider having sex with.
