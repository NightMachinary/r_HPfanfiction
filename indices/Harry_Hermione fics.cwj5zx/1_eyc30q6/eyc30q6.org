A couple of my favourites (no bashing in any of these)

*The Augurey by La-Matrona* linkffn(12310861) Postwar story: Harry adopts Delphini Riddle (nothing else taken from Cursed Child)

*Game Theory by SallyJAvery* linkffn(13135661) Murder Mystery. Very intriguing and interesting side characters.

*All Our Yesterdays by SallyJAvery* linkffn(12820671) A fantastic one shot with a twist on time travel. Think Groundhog Day mixed with a little Edge of Tomorrow.

*Simple Confessions by comicbooklovergreen* linkffn(10135987) Fluffy oneshot.

*Like this by DrSallySparrow* linkao3(9482156) Beautiful oneshot set during DH.

*Bridges by lorien829* linkffn(8541644) Fantastic postwar story with a nice little mystery.

*Come Undone by scarlet and gold* linkffn(12393868) Great postwar story from Hermione's POV.

*A Seeker's Guide to Applied Anatomy* linkffn(12334801) A beautiful oneshot.

*Fulfilling Obligations by forbiddenharmony7* linkffn(4418163) One of the most popular HHr stories. Set postwar.

*Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak* linkffn(6033933) Another HHr classic.

*That Old House by vanillaparchment* linkffn(4703843) Pure fluff and a beautiful portrayal of the ship.
