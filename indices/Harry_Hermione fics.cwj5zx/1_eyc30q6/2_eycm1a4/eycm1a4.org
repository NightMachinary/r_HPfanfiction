I am not super passionate about pairings and there are stories which I love and have almost any ship possible. So, there are some Harmony stories I like (not to be difficult, e.g., linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities), linkffn(Eventful Summer by Harry50), or linkffn(Testing Defenses by canoncansodoff) are examples), but more and more I believe they are good /despite/ being Harmony rather than /because of/ it.

[[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html]] was written in the middle of the Shipping Wars so it is rather over the top, but even if you tone it down radically, it still explains very well why some stories on this list (e.g., The Augurey) are in my opinion horrible [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cj5w7b/what_are_you_least_favorite_cliches_in_the_fandom/evbm3bb/][not only literary but also ethicaly]].
