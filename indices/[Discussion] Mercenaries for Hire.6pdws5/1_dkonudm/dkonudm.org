Don't know about the Chief Warlock position. The Wiki (which I'm sure you've already checked) doesn't say for sure.

There are probably enough fics with companies that have Marauder in the title. Same with some version of Wolf for a werewolf-based guard. Maybe something with Protego, or the variation: Protego Totalum? Really depends on what they're going to be doing, hunting death eaters, providing security, treasure hunting, bolstering the aurors, fighting the aurors...
