Wow. I haven't read any of those - except a bit of HPMOR, which I stopped for the usual reason of finding the protagonist irritating. From their first chapters, Red Knight looks very interesting, same with Men Who Are Resolved and Own Nature. Not sure about Battle School, though. Seems a bit... clunky. I'll read a bit more, see what direction the whole 'Snape leads a child-soldier training camp' theme is taken in. Thanks for the recs!
