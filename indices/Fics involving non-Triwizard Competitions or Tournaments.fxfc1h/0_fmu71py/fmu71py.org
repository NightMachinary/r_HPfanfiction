In these fics, the tournaments are significant but may not necessarily be the focus.

In the Red Knight, TimeTraveler!Ron ends up in an international dueling tournament with Fleur. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight]])

Hogwarts Battle School is pretty much all about intra-mural combat tournaments (it also has the Triwizard but there are tournaments outside of that competition). linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]])

HPMOR also has an extensive intramural combat tournament linkffn(HPMOR)

According to His Own Nature has a Gryffindor!Tom Riddle being trained by Flitwick and culminates with a Dueling Tournament. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15989558/chapters/37302626]]) Probably should read the one-shot Men Who Are Resolved first though. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15607950]])
