Oh, I meant the Alanna the Lioness books, sorry. I've already been convinced to try the fic, now I'm curious about the original material. :)

Would you say that they're still similar, at least? Not just OCs with the Harry Potter names tacked on? At lot of AUs seem to struggle with that parallel-universe-esque 'the same but different' stuff when it comes to characters, I've noticed.
