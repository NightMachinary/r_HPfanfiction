Haha, sorry! I read Allana series when I was a kid, and yes, it is awesome. She swaps places with her brother to become a knight and he a mage, and it's tough but she makes it through and becomes a totally badass.

I'd say some of them are very similar, others not so much. A lot of characters who were on the sidelines in hp are big in pureblood pretense, and personally I love it; I'd say reimagined - share some background, traits, goals, ways of thinking, but different too. I do think a lot of the characters are very very similar to their cannon counterpart, but they maybe don't have as big a role in pureblood pretense.
