I think it's awesome. It loosely follows the plot of both Alanna and HP, but things happen differently and it's got its own story going on too. Most/all of the characters are what'd I'd call “reimagined” - they're not in character, but they're not meant to be, and I love the friendships Harry forms and seeing who the characters could've been.

IMO Harry is OP for a child, which may or may not be a big issue for others, but doesn't bother me too much, because the obstacles/opponents are also powerful
