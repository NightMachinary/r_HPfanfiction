i havent read all of it, but in Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance, nocturnes are mentioned allot, its been a while so i've forgotten if their important to the plot somehow, but from what i remember, it involved conducting magic through one's wand to make notes and was seen as a sign of mastery or something
