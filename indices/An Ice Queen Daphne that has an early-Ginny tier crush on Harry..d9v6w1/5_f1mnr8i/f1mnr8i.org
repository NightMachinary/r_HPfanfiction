There is a story that starts at the end of fourth or fifth year that follows this idea. Daphne is ostracized hy Malfoy as a result of her pursuit of Harry. It starts at the end of the year, on the train. I tried to find it, but I couldn't (I didn't save it). Hoping my description can help someone else remember it.
