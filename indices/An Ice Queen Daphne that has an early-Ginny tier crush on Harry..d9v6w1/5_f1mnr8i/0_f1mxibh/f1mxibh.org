[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6311215/1/The-Lion-Tamer][The Lion Tamer by James Spookie]], book one in a completed Harry/Daphne trilogy. All in all, quite good. Well written, well paced, characters are well developed. The author doesn't get super creative with the plot, which prevents it from achieving true greatness in my opinion, as it is just a tad on the generic side. But it is evident that the author is highly competent, and that the story is very well done.

On the whole, 8/10 would read again.
