This is great, and I definietly want to read it when it's out.

Also I reading it made me think of this: "Tracey, please just help me, I need this, okay. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find another girl who a) likes girls b) I'm attracted to c) is close to the same age as me and d) is single in a school that doesn't even have 500 students?"

"...I can't say I do."

"Wait...what if she's straight, gods that'd be horrible."

"Unlikely, did you forget how she used to look at Chang?"
