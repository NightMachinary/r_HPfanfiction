  "Tracey, look."

  "What?"

  "It's her."

  "Daph..."

  "Look at her. I wonder what she's up to," she mumbled.

  "You ask that every day."

  "Yes, but doesn't she make you think? How do you think she gets her hair to be so black? Is it natural? Does she dye it in thestral blood every fortnight -”

  "This is the third time we've talked about her hair the past two weeks. Stop it. You're creeping me out."

  Daphne looked at her. "Fine then. How do I ask her out?"

  Tracey spat out her oatmeal. "What???"

  "How do I ask her out?"

  "Ask her out?

  "Yes, ask her out," Daphne said. "Hello Lily J. Potter; would you like to date me, daughter of illustrious imprisoned Death Eater Cyprus Greengrass. I have way more money than should be reasonable for an 18-year old girl, as my father left all of his properties to me, and my wealthy but positively horrid mother died of dragon pox last year. I single-handedly manage the Greengrass fortune, I am an impressionable young lady, very vulnerable to spending money on any potential girlfriends, and -"

  "Daph - what? You're into - why would you be into Lily Potter?!" Tracey asked, angrily. "You've never spoken a word to each other in your life!"

  "I once asked her for a quill in -"

  "Yes and she didn't even hear you!"

  "I did ask her." Daphne pointed out, sullenly. "And I would have you know that I have caught her looking my way when I -"

  "Yes but did she even look at you specifically, or just at the Slytherin part of the class," Tracey glared.

  "I - er,"

  "Exactly... Daph, does she even know your name?"

  "Tracey. I am the scion of -"

  "Yes, illustrious Greengrass fortune, business, clothes, bloodline, pretentiousness, so forth, and Harry Potter was raised in a mundane household, runs around with the pigs and probably plays with mud in the weekends."

  "She does not play with mud," Daphne declared, "I know that she is a highly admirable and respectable -"

  "Have you seen her after Quidditch?"

  Daphne pouted. "Shut up"

  "You just like staring at her legs when she wears Quidditch pants," Tracey murmured.

  Daphne coughed, blushing, “I do not stare.”

  Tracey looked at her silently in response.

  Daphne, increasingly embarrassed, looked down at her half-eaten breakfast. “Stop it. You're making me feel like an infatuated schoolgirl.” She pushed her food around. “I don't /stare.../”

  “Daph, you /are/ an infatuated schoolgirl.”

  Daphne wrinkled her face. “Why can't we focus on helping me ask Lily Potter out instead of ridiculing me.”

  “Daph...”

  “No, I'm serious. Every time I bring up other girls you always talk me out of it.”

  Tracey looked uncomfortable.

  Daphne continued, “I don't - I don't just like Lily Potter because of her legs, or her Quidditch pants - although I'm still curious about the thestral blood.” (Tracey groaned.) “It's for all the other things, Tracey. You read the same articles I did. You saw her last year, too. And besides, have you seen all the useless students trying to impress her? /Ernie Macmillian/? The situation is simply such that nobody else is good enough for her, other than me.”
