On the topic of names: neither James or Lily ever came across (from the admittedly little we actually know of them) like the kind of people that name their children after themselves. And it's not really a British thing to do either.

IMO, just go with Iris or whatever. It is a fairly common femharry name, sure, but it still fits both the setting in style and is a reasonable likely name to have.
