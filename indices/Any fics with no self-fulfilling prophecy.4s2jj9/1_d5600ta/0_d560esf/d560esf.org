The prophecy is a key motivation for dumbledore and voldemort, everyone else is just fighting a war according to their beliefs in a well-developed fantasy world. The stakes are still there, just not necessarily any deus ex machina to deal with it - so maybe the war never stopped, or maybe some auror got in a lucky shot and bought some time until his resurrection.
