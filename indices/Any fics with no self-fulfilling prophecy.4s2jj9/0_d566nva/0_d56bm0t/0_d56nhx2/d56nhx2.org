What if the fact that Harry and Boldemort share blood somehow gave him some affinity for Voldemort (like that blood connection gives him visions and all the benefits his scar does. Maybe it "activated" the horcrux inside of him).

That way Voldemort basically created his own worst enemy when he tried to bypass Harry's protection.
