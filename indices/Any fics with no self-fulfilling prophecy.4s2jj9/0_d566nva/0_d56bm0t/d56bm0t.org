But there's very little reason for a bunch of kids/teens to target the Dark Lord and thus drive conflict in these teen fiction plots. It's suicidal for even the average person let alone someone underage. So extreme circumstances aren't explicitly /necessary/ but they're the easy way out. Prophecy, noble birth, magical power, mental unbalances, etc. Most stories give their main character a physical/magical/social/prophetic advantage to create the conflict.

Without the prophecy, Harry would be just another person targeted by the most evil and powerful wizard alive besides Dumbledore. Once Dumbledore dies, only luck could keep Harry alive, and without prophecy/fate, luck eventually disappears.

In order to have a main character who lacks a physical/magical/social/prophetic advantage, he/she would need an /ungodly/ amount of drive, agency, and determination. This person would be the embodiment of determination in a teenager's form. Dumbledore would never assign the Horcrux Hunt to Harry Potter, a school boy; Dumbledore would give it to someone better prepared to fight. But determined!Harry would /demand/ it. He would coerce and push and ensure that /he/ is the one to face down evil. And this character might be hard to relate with.
