*mild self-promotion*

I included a dark version of this in my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]] where Voldie was offed and Lucius Malfoy became a scarily competent Big Bad. One of the "reforms" he oversaw made Blood-status legally important, but linked to education (get enough top-level marks and you'd be promoted from Muggleborn to Halfblood, Halfblood to Pureblood, Pureblood to High Pureblood etc) meaning that an intelligent-enough Muggleborn could conceivably end up socially and legally as a Pureblood and thus eligible to marry into the more traditional families/get a job that is traditionally restricted to Purebloods etc.

His explanation for why he supported this? Breeding Stock to help raise the IQ of the more traditional families.
