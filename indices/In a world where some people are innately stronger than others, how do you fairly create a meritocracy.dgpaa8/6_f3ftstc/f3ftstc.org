To put it in RPG terms.... Someone like Usain bolt was born with +15 to running while most people are born with a range from -5 to +10, and occasionally someone is born with or obtains a massive penalty, like -50, due to physical deficiency.

The problem is that the soft cap on the skill is +500.

Sure , without putting any work into it, bolt is faster than almost anyone else, but until you hit that cap of +500, hard work is going to trump natural affinity every time. Affinity only really matters at world class levels, and even massive natural disadvantage can be competitive with unmotivated lazy bum most of the time with the addition of hard work. It has to be pretty extreme for natural disadvantage to be an insurmountable barrier.
