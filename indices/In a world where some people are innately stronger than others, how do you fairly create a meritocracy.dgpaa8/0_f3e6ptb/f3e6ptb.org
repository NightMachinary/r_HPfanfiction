I think you are confusing fairness and equality.

​

In a meritocracy, fairness is defined as everyone being treated (and rewarded) based solely on their merits and not other factors. Nothing about a meritocracy ensures that everyone has equal chances. In a meritocracy, a child with mental retardation who will never get beyond the mental abilities of a 10 year old will not achieve as much as those with all their mental facilities.

In fact, you could say a meritocracy explicitly rewards special skills, even those people acquire through unfair means (such as being born with it). The entire point is the reward because of the skill instead of say, who your family was.

​

Now if you want to talk about equality, that is a whole nother issue.
