Once they're out of school there are quite a lot of jobs/careers that do not require the average witch or wizard to do great feats of magic. Ministry workers, shop keepers, home makers (although we have seen that Molly Weasley is quite magically strong) would all use minimal magic or simple and repetitive daily charms and such. Those born into privileged position would use such charms even less if they have a house elf. I don't really think it would be too different to how muggles live - some people have special training, knowledge or skills which they use in elite professions but most don't and they seem to live happy and fulfilled lives.
