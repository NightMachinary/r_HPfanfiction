I would have used a different example to crabbe if I could because not only is he pathetic as a wizard, he's also pathetic as a human being but I guess from a narrative stand point it doesn't make sense for one of the good guys to be weak. The closet we really have is Neville I guess at the start but he just had a bad wand and didn't believe in himself enough or some crock. In the real world, there are millions of people who live pay check to pay check despite working 80 weeks and generally being good people because of different barriers to their economic mobility. Say we had a family like the weasleys, desperately poor, with no links to higher society, but none of the children have the talent shown by the weasleys. How would they escape the poverty line by legitimate means. Even if someone is intelligent, if they don't have the power for simple spells they simply can't perform any practical job more competently than someone with more firepower behind them
