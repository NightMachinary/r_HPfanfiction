If they're magical, they move to the muggle world, where their magic gives them an edge that they would never have in a society where everyone has magic. This is what Merope Gaunt did. She had few magical skills and no education, but she could still get what she wanted with potions.

If they can perform minor magic, like Confundus or Divination, they can get away with a lot in a muggle job. They can run their own palm-reading/astrology business. Plenty of gullible muggles, especially business owners celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, have psychic advisors and life counselors that feed them all sorts of nonsense.

The ethics is questionable, but as long as they don't let the muggles know that magic is real, there are ways to scrape a living with a few tricks.
