  How would they escape the poverty line by legitimate means. Even if someone is intelligent, if they don't have the power for simple spells they simply can't perform any practical job more competently than someone with more firepower behind them

Like [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]] said, they can make good money off Muggles. With liberal use of memory charms, why settle for a lowly palm reading job? How about 'convincing' the board of directors of a multi-billion dollar company to pay you millions in stock options for your 'valuable consulting work'?

Or use Reparo to fix up deeply distressed real estate and flip them at market prices.

Or use Gemino curse to duplicate expensive industrial metals and sell them for decent profit. According to the Books, gold and silver can not be duplicated. But what about titanium, palladium, neodymium, and those rare earth elements that cost a lot more than gold?

Some ask what to do with all this Muggle money. Well, for starters, you can buy physical gold and silver on commodities/futures exchanges. Goblins and Wizards both take real gold. Or you can buy Muggle real estate, slap an Anti-Muggle charm on it, and it becomes a magical property! Hey, even Dursley's home can be connected to the Floo network!

Some others say that this is all illegal. Well, Ministry only cares if you throw around flashy spells in the public. They don't care what magic you do behind closed doors, and they don't care about memory charms at all. You see Wizards obliviating those poor Muggles at will in Book 4. You see Ron boasting about confunding a Muggle driving instructor in the Epilogue. Harry Potter, then the head of Magical Britain's elite police, actually finds it funny. The Trio was hunted by both Ministry and Death Eaters during Year 7 and cast all kinds of magic in Muggle areas, they were never caught. The Ministry's ability to monitor magic use in Muggle areas seems to be quite limited.

The thing, if you are smart and have decent magic, you can make yourself living in paradise.
