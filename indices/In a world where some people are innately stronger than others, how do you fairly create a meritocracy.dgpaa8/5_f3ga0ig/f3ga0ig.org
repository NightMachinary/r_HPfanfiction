I think [[/u/Taure]] basically got at it in his post -- meritocracies are inherently inequitable. They do not care about equity. In the ideal meritocratic world, people are given power and success based off of their skill; in an ideally equitable world, people are given power and respected because they exist, because everyone is inherently valuable and not worth more or less than anyone else.

So, in some ways, I guess I don't really accept the premise of your question? If you want to make the magical world equitable, the way to do it is by making things like magical skill simply not matter. If you want to make it meritocratic, you make magical skill the /only/ thing that matters. If you're trying to find the right balance between productivity and equity, well that's an ongoing discussion in the real world, isn't it? And not one that has a clear and obvious answer, either.
