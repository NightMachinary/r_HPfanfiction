Apart from that, a diverse education. Not just magic, also some math and social studies. That way even someone with zero magical talent can get a job doing paperwork at the government or for companies. Doesn't take much magic to run a shop selling floo power either, if you get it from a supplier in bulk. Or the magical equivalent of flipping burgers, although that kind of job would probably involve some spellwork. There's plenty of jobs available that don't require much magic.
