Northumbrian has written over 80 fics set post Hogwarts, and they all build on each other. Everything he wrote is headcanon for me. His writing in general is amazing, and I love his characterisations of minor characters

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is good, but the best place to start is Tales of the battle in my opinion.
