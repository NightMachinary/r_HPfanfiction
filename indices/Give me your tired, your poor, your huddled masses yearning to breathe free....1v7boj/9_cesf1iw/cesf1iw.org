This story recently took second place in the HPFanFicFanPoll Awards a few days ago in the Best Drama-Angst category, and I'm surprised to see it has so little reviews on ff.net (42 reviews for five chapters).

It's called Resonare Mortis, and should please all of those who prefer a darker side of fanfiction. The story features the characters Hermione Granger and Severus Snape, but does not pair them romantically in any way. Both are true to canon characterization, and the plot is surprisingly original.
