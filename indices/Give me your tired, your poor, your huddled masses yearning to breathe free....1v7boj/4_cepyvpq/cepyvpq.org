The Pureblooded Turncoat by me. Its very much a WIP and is on a bit of hiatus due to the sheer workload I have this year, but it's my baby and I am determined to continue (things should start getting better for me around march and then I'll have plenty of time to start writing again). It's an AU of 6th year where Draco went to Dumbledore and the order for protection when Voldemort gave him the task. It's eventually going to be Dramione, but certainly not yet (only a few chapters in, it's definitely a baby of a story). All from a Draco POV and I'm definitely trying to keep him and everyone else in character as much as I can. I would say it's a little on the sparser side in terms of reviews so I'd love more feedback! Here is the link to my fic on Dramione.org (you'll need to be a memer but signing up is pretty painless): [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=2115]]
