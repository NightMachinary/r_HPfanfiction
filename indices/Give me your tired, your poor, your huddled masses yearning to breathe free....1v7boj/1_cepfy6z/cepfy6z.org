Still working on it. It's my first fan fic, so its a little bumpy. I posted it here months ago when I only had three chapters then, but that was about it. I try to update weekly. It's AU/ M/romance/hurt&comfort and OC, so not everyone's cup of tea, but yeah... figured I would put it out there. It's Neville/ OC pairing. The OC being the twin sister of Draco, and it all takes place 6th year.
