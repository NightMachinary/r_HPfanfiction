I always thought Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] was underrated compared with his other work, perhaps because he listed the main characters as Harry and Hermione despite the story's sticking to canon pairings. It's a dark tale, not to everyone's tastes perhaps, but an underappreciated gem of the fandom.

Another underrated story is chelsyb's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053607/1/Running][Running]], a "what if" if Remus and Tonks had survived the final battle, written after the author's life had taken her to some bad places. It's not as polished as some of her work, but has a sort of raw pain and authenticity that I appreciate.
