If you like dark dystopia, sure. Perspicacity's ([[/u/__Pers]] when he posts on this sub, though he hasn't in awhile) stuff is all over the map, topically and quality-wise. /Dagger and Rose/ is angsty Harry/Fleur romance. /A Mother In Law's Love/ is ribald comedy (it begins with Harry and Molly W. in a soul bond) that turns weird. His short story /India/ was an action/thriller about Hedwig with an ending that, I'm a bit ashamed to say, made me cry. Some of the one shots in his collection are fantastic writing for fanfiction; others are subpar.

Chelseyb writes one of the best Tonks in the fandom. The story I linked is pretty short, but her [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746111/1/Harry-Potter-the-Halfblood-Auror][Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror]] is novel length and quite good (though hopefully not abandoned--last update was September).
