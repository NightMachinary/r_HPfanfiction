It's my try at an OC fic. Just a way to fiddle with bits of canon and have some fun. Each year will be more and more divergent from the books and written with an eye toward a specific genre. First year, for instance, is a more proactive heist plot. Eventually I hope to go deep into the formation of Hogwarts and address whether or not Herpo the Foul's horcrux was ever destroyed.

I understand the stigma against OC-centric stories, and if you don't want to read fine by me, just thought I'd put it out there for people to check out.
