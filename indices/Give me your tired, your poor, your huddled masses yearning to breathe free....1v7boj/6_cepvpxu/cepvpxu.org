Currently writing, actually, going through and revising as well as having a few betas pick it apart since I'm having second thoughts on some bits. I'm still in the middle of a chapter and school is starting, and I need a pick me up so that I can muddle through =(

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7070742/1/This-Once]["This Once"]] is a Viktor/Hermione romance, but with angst and suspense mixed in. "Good things always come at a price, but neither Viktor or Hermione expected their twice found love to be so hard won."

Rated M for Mature, matey. There is smut, but it's part of the plot-line. Half my battles are me quibbling over whether or not something is "romantic" or "purple prose" (BLARGHL), as well as hashing out action sequences and peoples physical movements because I'm obsessed on mapping things out and making sure everything is within continuity. Which makes my brain tingle.
