- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8374306/1/A-Serving-Extra-Large]] WIP Harry is a Half Giant on his mothers side. (mother is still Lily) It is explained well without taking too much of a leap of faith.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation]] WIP Flarry. Your run of the mill Harry thinks everyone betrays him so he runs away to Black Island.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum]] WIP Prolly the one I am most looking forward to getting updated. All the Blacks (Andromeda, Narcissa, and Sirius) move to Bulgaria. Viktor is the same age as Draco and Harry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9914932/1/Harry-s-Horses]] Awesome WIP that is prolly the most different story I have read. So far its just about Harry working with horses prior to his 3rd year.
