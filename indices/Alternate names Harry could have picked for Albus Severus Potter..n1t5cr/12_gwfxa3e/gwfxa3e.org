Sirius James Potter. Having two kids named after a husband and wife is icky.

Lily Dora Potter. Luna didn't die. Nymphadora hated her name, so Dora is a reasonable alternative.

Albus Dobby Potter. Dobby honestly deserves top billing here but alas it's too silly sounding. Cedric and Alastor are also great ideas.

For fanfic: I always felt like Harry was needlessly confrontational with Scrimgeour. I always prefer if he comes up to work as an ally. The guy did get tortured to death without giving up any info on Harry. I also like the sound of Rufus. This doesn't really work with the actual relationship they had in canon though.
