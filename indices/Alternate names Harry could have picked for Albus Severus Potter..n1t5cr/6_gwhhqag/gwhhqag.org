Alastor Regulus Potter works pretty well, two hardworking intelligent ambitious and incredibly brave men who died for what was right(hopefully allowing for less pressure to be in insert house here). It also allows formerly Albus to keep the nickname Al while honoring those that would otherwise have faded into the background. I'm also partial to the idea of Severus as a middle name to spite the Snape because if anyone he'd probably want either no one named after him or a Malfoy if we go the is Draco's godfather route(I'm currently blanking on if that's canon or fanon).
