Personally I would rename all of Harry kids, firstly dead people only get middle names, it's not fair to saddle them with the expectations of being Harry's kid /and/ sharing a name with a war hero, and secondly ditch Albus and Severus, I don't think Dumbledore ever had a personal enough relationship with Harry to justify using his name, and Snape definitely deserves no personal recognition.

My suggested names for his kids would be something like "Richard James", "Stephen Arthur" and "Alfred Sirius". First names are all British/English monarchs which appears to be one of the Weasley naming traditions, and James, Sirius and Arthur are all various father figures to Harry. I'd rename "Lily Luna" to "Jasmine Lily", honour Harry's mother and keep the plant naming convention going.
