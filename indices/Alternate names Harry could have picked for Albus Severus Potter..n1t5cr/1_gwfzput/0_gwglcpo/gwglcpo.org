I feel it also disrespects the memories of the dead. Surely it makes it harder to remember someone if you now use their name day-to-day for someone else. Now if anyone is talking about James or Lily Potter, they would have to go out of their way to remind their audience that they are talking about the old James and Lily, who died decades ago and not the pair who are alive and kicking.
