It would have been way better for them to name their kids their own unique names instead of giving all those children portmanteau names from a bunch of war heroes that died only a couple of years before they were born, and maybe reserved the middle name for honor naming.

Like Samuel James.

It would have been super cute if they'd named a girl Calla Lily. Calla is Greek for beautiful, it's a species of lily, and Calla Lily Potter could have grown up to become an herbology professor or something going by their universe name rules lol. Calla lilies also symbolize resurrection in flower language so it would have had some nice callbacks to Harry in addition to honoring his mom.
