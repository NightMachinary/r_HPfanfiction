Honestly, Severus deserves to have a Potter named after him. Simply because he would definitely loathe it, lol.

Now, being serious, I dislike most of Harry's kids names. Personally, I prefer when kids get their own names in general, rather than being named after another person. I'd leave honorifics for middle names, if they really /have/ to name their kid after someone else.

...Though if I had to choose among names of other characters, I like the sound of Albus Rubeus better than Albus Severus. But honestly, I'd have called him something like Alex or Alexander, and maybe a middle name after someone.

Lily Luna is my exception to this, it just has a really nice ring to it, at least to me.
