Literally any of these: linkffn(12542863)

Including the crackier names. /Especially/ the crackier names.

... On a more serious note, it kind of bugs me that Ginny seems to have had zero input/recognition in the naming of their children - all of them were named after people who were important to Harry, but not necessarily to Ginny.

Of the canon names, the only one I kind of like is Lily Luna. Maybe Arthur James and Sirius Frederick for the sons? That way both names are important to both parents.
