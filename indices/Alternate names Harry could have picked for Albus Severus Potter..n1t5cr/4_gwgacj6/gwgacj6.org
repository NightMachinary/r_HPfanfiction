I literally hate HATE what Harry called his children. Well, mostly.

I don't think James should have been his first name. It should have been his middle name, or sirius James could both be middle names. I think it's kind of weird having a daughter and son named after his parents, especially if they supposedly look like them?!? Maybe just a nice normal name like Gideon James Potter (a bible name, relatively normal in muggle standings but also named after Ginnys uncle and the man who's watch Harry has, unless thats fabian?!)

I despiseeeeee albus severus. I literally want to launch Canon severus into a ooze of lava. (I hate him in most fanfic too unless it's really well written mentor!Snape). It should have been something like Alfred Charlus Potter or Daniel Sirius Potter or Ethan Rubeus Potter.

I like lily's name. I think naming his only daughter after his mother is fitting. Lily Potter gave up her life and love to save her child, and it's her protection that saved him all those years. I love botanical names, and my fanon is that Lily's mother's family had a tradition of daughters named after flowers. I also think luna is sweet, as luna is both Harry and ginny friend, but she was also the only one who didn't make Harry feel self conscious and was the only one to truly instill calm within him during fifth year.

As you can see, I have strong opinions on the names of the potter children.
