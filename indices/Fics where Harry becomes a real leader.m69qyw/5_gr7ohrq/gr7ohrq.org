A goddess finds herself agreeing to send some dragons to another world thanks to a bargain she agrees to. Harry wakes up in his 5th year from a really weird dream with a purpose in not long after. Worldbuilding, magical creatures, two magical traditions merging together and a version of Albus Dumbledore that's been using a cursed wand for a long time. I made the Elder Wand worse, think the One Ring or Frostmourne for scale.
