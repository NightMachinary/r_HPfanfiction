I've never written a fanfic and I don't plan to start now, but for a while I've thought a great premise would be that "the power the dark lord knows not," is The Power of Teamwork, but /reconstructed/. The core idea is that 90% of magical warfare is intelligence, 9% is preparation, and only 1% is mechanical skill. All but the last can be done in parallel, with lots of compartmentalization. In order to defeat 50 years of experience with 5, Harry needs to get a great many irons in the fire at once, some of which may not pan out.

You could have spies, of course. People researching scrying. People experimenting with small team tactics and combat spells. People experimenting with broomstick flight in enclosed spaces. People researching the Fidelius charm and reflexive/circular application of it, and whether it can be worked around. People researching invisibility, means of detecting invisible wizards, means of masking non-visual signature, means of detecting signatures the other guy didn't think to mask. People researching muggle weapons. People researching transfigured/imperiused animals.

And at some point, you have to train at least a small squad in what has been found to work, hopefully /before/ making contact with the enemy.

Call it /make -j/.
