  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.
