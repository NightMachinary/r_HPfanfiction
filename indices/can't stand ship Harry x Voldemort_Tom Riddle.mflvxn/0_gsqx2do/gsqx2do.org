First of all, among all HPxLV/TMR stories, fics with huge age gap aren't even majority.

As for specificly those with an age gap, this relationiship usually is SUPPOSED to be unhealthy and sick. Often some obscure magic is involved (like soul magic).

Anyway, 'ship' doesn't always mean good relationships and fluffy feelings.

Fun fact: among numerous tags on ao3 for this ship there's also HP/LV/TR, which means that Voldemort and Tom two separete people and both are in relationship wih Harry.
