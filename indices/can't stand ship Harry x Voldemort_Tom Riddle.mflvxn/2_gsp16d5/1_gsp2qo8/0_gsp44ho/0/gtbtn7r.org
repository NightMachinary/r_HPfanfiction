To answer both if your questions, obsession is debatable when it comes to Snape. Where in the books does it imply he is obsessed with Lily?

As far as l know, it doesn't even imply if he loved her romantically or like a sister. His doe patrons could have formed due to his feeling of guilt.

My opinion is, if she and her husband lived, he could have moved on with his life. If there was any kind of obsession, it would have been probably because of his regret and her early death.

This is what fans have divided opinions on. That is what theories and discussions here are for. Where some see obsession, others see loyalty and passion. It's a matter of view.

Time travel stories are different, any character could be of any age. Also, it could be a father/mentor/brother/friend relationship as well.

It would be so interesting if Snape or Harry adopt young Tom Riddle, or meet him as a Hogwarts student, or as a young adult after Albania... or if 38 year old Snape meets adult Tom.
