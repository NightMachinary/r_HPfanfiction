I'm... fine with it. IF its well written. Wait, before you start hating, hear me out. Tom Riddle is an interesting character. An aloof sociopath, sure, but that makes him all the more interesting. Now, of course, the age difference. Well, yes, that would rather ruin the possibilities, since that is rather f*cked up. Obviously. On a related note, these fics are most often terribly written. HOWEVER: there are some fics, with time travel, either Harry re-doing his life, Harry travelling to Tom Riddle era, or whatever else, where it just sort of works. A great example of this would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494/chapters/313282]]. This fic is named Xerosis, and is written by Batsutousai. It's about a Harry who went through all the canon stuff, but eventually the world was destroyed by muggles, and this f*cks Harry up. So he travels back, meets Voldie, and it is written rather well. Harry is actually older than Voldemort in this one. Sadly, there aren't many good fics like this. The only good one I ever found for teen!Harry and Voldemort was /Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness/, on wattpad ([[https://www.wattpad.com/story/179650625-harry-potter-and-the-descent-into-darkness]]). This, and the sequel, /Harry Potter and the Breeding Darkness/ actually represent an interesting, realistic relationship between sane!Voldemort and Harry. The relationship stuff doesn't really even start until ch.24, and the chapters are LONG. There is smut, lemon, whatever you're going to call it included, but it is well written. I have never been able to stand the teen/kid Harry with Voldemort/Tom Riddle in any other fic though. Good Tomarry fics are really hard to find.
