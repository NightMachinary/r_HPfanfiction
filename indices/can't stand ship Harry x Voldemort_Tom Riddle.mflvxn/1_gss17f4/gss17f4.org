The first time we meet Voldemort in canon, he's a ghost, and it's not really clear how old he is. The second time, he's sixteen, and has essentially time-travelled from the nineteen forties. For fans who started reading before GoF, our clearest picture of Voldemort for a long time was a teenager that Harry-as-narrator finds handsome, who points out all the ways that he and Harry are similar.

The age gap of 54 years isn't necessary to the pairing. In addition to the canon age gap, the common senarios I've seen have been: Harry time-travels to Tom's school years; Tom time-travels to Harry's school years; Tom comes out of the diary, either in CoS as in canon, or later*; both are reincarnated to be the same age; both are born the same age for no reason; MoD Harry turns around at the train station in DH and decides to help the Voldemort-thing, either at 17 or after living a full and happy life with Ginny.

*I would love if someone wrote a fic where the events of CoS happen during Umbridge's reign of terror. I would love to see her blamed for it in the same way that Dumbledore was.
