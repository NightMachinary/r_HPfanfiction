Voldemort being old isn't something that comes to mind when I think about his character, seeing as he's an immortal dark sorcerer and all. Similar to vampire love stories.

I love Tom Riddle as a character, and he completes Harry well with their similar backgrounds of being halfbloods raised by abusive muggles.

But what I love most when I read Tomarry fanfics are the mind games. Harry having to outwit the the ultimate Slytherin to survive.

What will Tom do in retaliation for Harry's defiance? Will he torture him? Or take it out on someone close to Harry? Or will he kiss him?

Does he actually care for Harry (in fanfiction), or will Harry go dark to be with him? How will Harry's loved ones react to their bond? There's so much to explore, plus Riddle is hot ❤️.
