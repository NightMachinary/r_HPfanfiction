Exactly this!

For me a pairing intrigues me when there's so many ways it shouldn't happen. Authors have to get creative, there's lots of drama and the sprinkle of romance especially from a character no one expects it from is exciting!

I also love the mind games and banter and the power dynamic is very interesting becsuse in the ones I've read Harry begins to hold power over Voldemort too whether Voldemort intends for it or not. I like when they become equals of sorts.

Also yes Riddle is hot ❤️ The ones present time Voldemort ones that I read have him looking like an older version of Tom Riddle instead of the snake face monster so he's hot and powerful how can I resist that ❤️
