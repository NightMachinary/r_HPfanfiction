A large percentage of healthier Tomarry stories are same-age AU's either via time-travel or by having them in the same generation. More wholesome stories with the ship are Muggle AU's with essentially zero violence. The dynamics there are truly amusing to read. They play off and complement each other nicely. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these stories.

Stories with huge age gaps usually justify themselves with some kind of soul magic induced feelings which is close enough to the effects of a love potion: Voldemort finds himself to be magically and irrationally obsessed with Harry. The age gap feels irrelevant to the average reader because Voldemort almost never acts anything like his age, he barely feels human and Harry usually goes along due to a lack of options. Its like 1000 year old Arwen/Aragon in LOTR except a lot more toxic. Like the other post said, age or maturity is not a character that feels relevant to an immortal insane dark lord.

Then there are the third type of stories which try to make explicit relationships between a 60 yr old and a teenager look romantic. These are just plain disgusting and should be recognized for what they are. Nope out of them soon as you see them unless they treat the subject with the appropriate amount of horror or with a proper perspective and warnings.
