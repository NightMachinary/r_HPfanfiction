As far as Lily's protection it wouldn't work. From my understanding of it from canon, because it was Lily's protection it had to be a blood relative of her. So any alternative placements would require blood relations with Lily to be safe. In fanon, the protection is downplayed, but in canon it really did save Harry's life numerous times. It is also canon(albeit more heavily implied than said) that there were DE's that got off that would have went after him and likely killed or tortured him without the protection. It also adds conflict and drama that the very place keeping him alive, keeps him miserable. For a children's story, HP is quite dark. Perhaps that's why we still read and enjoy it and fanfics of it as adults.
