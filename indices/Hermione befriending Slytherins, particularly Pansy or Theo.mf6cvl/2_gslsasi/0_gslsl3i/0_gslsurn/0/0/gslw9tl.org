  Hermione Granger knows who she is. She is a Gryffindor. She is a Muggleborn. She is Afro-Arab. She is English. She is a Muslimah. She is a good friend. She is smart. She is an activist. She is things that she will never say out loud.Hermione Granger knows who she is. The problem: No one else does.1. Not her friends.2. Not her parents.3. Not even her. Not yet.  (this is the unlearning. the miseducation. minute by minute)

  When her search for a potion to combat her nightmares brings Hermione to the lavender fields in Provence, France, she's rather shocked to recognise the mysterious witch living there.

  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  Hermione has a pregnant adopted sister, parents who don't believe she's bisexual, and a crush the size of the Great Lake on Pansy Parkinson. Taking Pansy up on her offer to be Hermione's fake date to her parents' Christmas dinner could solve at least one of those problems...but it could also make everything worse.

  Millicent Bulstrode has seemed out of sorts every since coming back for the repeat seventh year. Hermione noticed and put two and two together when she disappeared from classes and meals over the full moon.

  Hermione knows working herself into the ground isn't a healthy coping mechanism, but right now it's the only one she's got. When deliberate intervention forces her to work with one of her old schoolmates, will things fall into place, or will they just fall apart?

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.
