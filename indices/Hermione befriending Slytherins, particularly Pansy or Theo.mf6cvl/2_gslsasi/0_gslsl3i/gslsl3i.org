Either/both i just like dynamic of little 11 year old hermione ending up with these slytherins with outdated beliefs and pulling her "well we're not having any of that nonsense" spiel

Or hermione post war befriending/romancing slytherins and teaching them that their ideals were wrong

Edit: nope, not a problem!
