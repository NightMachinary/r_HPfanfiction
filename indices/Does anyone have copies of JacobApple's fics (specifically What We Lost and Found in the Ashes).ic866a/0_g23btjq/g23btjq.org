For those who don't know, JacobApples seems to be reorganising their HP fics to an archive profile so they can get a fresh start and move on to other fandoms and projects. It says on their profile summary thingy.

Apparently new FFNet profiles are limited to two new stories a day, so they're going to be taking some time to reupload all their old Harry Potter stories to the 'JacobApples' profile, while their new stuff will go on the AppoApples profiles.
