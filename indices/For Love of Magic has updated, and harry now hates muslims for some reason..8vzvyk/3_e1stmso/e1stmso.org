let's be honest, the author has a big bias against muslim AND africa. Harry, in his fic, describe Africa as a "sub optimaly cultured" continent, magic is, if we believe the author, despised in this continent. I'm not african but even I know that "magic" has some real ties in Africa. Witchcraft is a thing, and sorcerer were often respected. America and Europe burned witches in middle ages, America burned half of the middle east since the WW2 but it's africa and the muslim that are all (so 1.5 to 2 billions people yeah) garbage.

The author is a racist, no need to hide it.
