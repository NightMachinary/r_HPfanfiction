It's a really problematic fic for a lot of reasons (borderline misogyny, extremist views of all types, occasional nonsense, unnuanced reactions by side characters) but despite all its flaws, I've really enjoyed it up until this point. Some of the sex is really fun and original, some of the side characters are genuinely intriguing, the world building, when it makes sense, is fantastic in the original sense of the word--- the fic has a lot of depth and a lot of great qualities. The shape of the plot is dynamic and it never fails to entertain.

But this just disgusts me. Monkeys and human garbage? It doesn't matter who the group is, that's just unconscionable. That's not hatred of a religion, that's straight up racism. This is the sort of person who would've joined he Nazi or the Klu Klux Clan, because he sees an entire culture of people as not only inhuman, but repulsive.

It's super unfortunate. I hope later in life he realizes his views were extremely ignorant and matures. Until then, I can't bear to be around it.
