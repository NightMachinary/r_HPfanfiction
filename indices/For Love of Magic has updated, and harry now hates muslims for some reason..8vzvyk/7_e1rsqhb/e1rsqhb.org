Skimmed the chapter to find the part you were talking about. I was a tentative follower of the story (tentative because it is a bit of a problematic fic, but I found the premise interesting anyway), but now I'm done with it.

I think the biggest problem is that the author hasn't done anything within the story to suggest that Harry could be wrong. He frames Harry's thoughts, no matter how extreme and controversial, as undeniably correct. Even if they are only Harry's opinions and not the author's, they weren't dealt with with much grace, if any.
