Personally I don't care if it's the authors views or not, the characters opinions in the latest chapter are completely in character. Harry in this story has been a piece of shit all the way through, this isn't a random rant out of character, and so I don't mind it. If it came out of nowhere and made no sense in the context of the characters and story it would be bizzare, but this fits.

If you suddenly have a problem with this just because it mentions islam specifically that's a problem on your end, not sure why you're getting so worked up by this. Especially with all the other shit the character has said and done throughout the story.

I enjoy this story, and I will likely continue to do so, whether or not I agree with the character/authors opinions has no bearing on my enjoyment of the story as long as it doesn't derail the plot or start causing characters to act against their already established character, which this hasn't.

If you're only just now realising that the Harry in this story holds these views you haven't been paying attention. If you don't like it unfollow and move on.
