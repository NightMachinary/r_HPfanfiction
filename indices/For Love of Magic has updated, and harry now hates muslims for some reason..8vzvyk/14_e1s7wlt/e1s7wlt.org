I actually quite enjoyed this, reading it through a lense of "Harry is a shitty person, I don't condone his viewpoint but this is fun so I'll read it anyway"

But when this chapter came out, I just couldn't ignore the blatant anti-muslim and misogynistic overtones. Like, it's okay if you want to have Harry being a piece of shit, but the way it's framed, like he's completely right- fuck, I can't do it.
