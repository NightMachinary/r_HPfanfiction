Quite honestly, it does not seem that you know what the Alt-Right is. You could have called it right, or even far right and you wouldn't have been wrong, but hating Islam has no connection to the Alt-Right. After the Alt-Right split into multiple different groups those who stayed in the Alt Right were Nazis. Nazis and muslim Extremists actually often worked together, as has been seen countless times during the Second World War. They share similar world views, thus Nazis/Alt-Right have a strong favorable bias towards muslims. (of course especialy towards extreme ones) The hate on muslims in the right mostly comes from part of the establishment republicans (Ben Shapiro etc.), the new right (also jokingly called alt-lite) and identitarian movements in europe. Finaly, as the Alt Right actually is a group of Nazis, it is highly offensive towards the author, no matter what his believes are. To say that a religion/a belief system is shit is something different from asking for mass genozide, a Nationalist-Sozialist state and the end of freedom of speech as well as the murder of every homosexual, communist and disabled person on the planet. I personaly believe that no one should in their fanfiction try to cramp their political views down ones throat, but neither do I believe in name calling and stating wrong facts. If you have read this far, I thank you.
