There are lots of unapologetic self-insert power-wank harem fics. It's unusual for the author to take the additional step of having Harry rant about their pet social and political issues. "Partially Kissed Hero" is famous for it, as was "Knowledge is Power". But "For Love of Magic" joined that club ages ago - pretty sure Harry has had rants about feminism before.
