Yeah he went full fascist and started talking about how men and women are inherently different, and how men are biologically designed to rule over submissive child-bearing females. Noodlehammer literally wrote the sentences, "some form of marriage and the basic family unit is the foundation upon which a strong society is built", and "[feminism] permits and even encourages ruinous levels of narcissistic selfishness in women"

He then ramped it up by having Harry openly talk about how some people are born naturally superior to others, and it is necessary for them to seize control of national industries and rule with an iron boot to ensure the survival of society Like, it's always been pretty obvious, but he just made it explicit.

That's not even counting the obvious racism and hatred of all non-white minorities. Or, "knuckle-dragging subhumans", as he once called them.

Hey FYI, If you disagree with me calling this fascism, I understand, but I encourage you to read Umberto Eco's [[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/][Ur Fascism]], one of the most influential works in the modern academic study of fascist ideology. The way I'm using the term isn't the catch-all for authoritarianism that's normally used, and I ecnourage /everyone/ to read at least his [[http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html][bulleted list]] from the essay as to what constitutes fascism. It'll only take 5 minutes, I promise. It gives me at least a lot of insight into understanding many political events and movements, both modern and historical

I'm super open to having a conversation over whether FLoM's Harry is a fascist or not, because I think it's a very debatable issue, but only in good faith, and with the understanding that "fascism" has a much more nuanced meaning then "authoritarian and violent government". I know it's often used that way in the news, but fuck those people for ruining a perfectly valid academic term to describe anyone and anything they don't like, from Theresa May to Bernie Sanders to Vladimir Putin to Greenpeace.
