I think it's pretty expected of him, as he said he hates monotheistic religions and it's inevitable his bias would be predisposed towards Islam, due to the current situation.

By his own words he says he has no contact with the outside world, describes himself as fat and so on. He is your typical neckbeard and could easily fit in on [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]

It's pretty evident he has nihilistic beliefs as shown right from the beginning of the story, and his depiction of Harry is how he wished his life was. With no one to tell him otherwise and only the internet at his disposal, he's clearly been infected with right wing propaganda, and it is easy to be infected with both far right and far left propaganda.

Instead of being angry or disgusted with him, I honestly pity him. We should look at disenfranchised people like this on the fringes of society and instead of pushing them further into nihilism, we should try pulling them out of it.
