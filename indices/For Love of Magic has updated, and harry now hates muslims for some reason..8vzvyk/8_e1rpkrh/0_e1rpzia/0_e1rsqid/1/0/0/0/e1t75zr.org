I made a statement providing at least some sources.

You made a statement as some internet anonymous without anything. It's up to you to provide facts that support your statement.

But I'll help you with it a little. I looked into the latest [[https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-2018-tesat-2018][EUROPEAN UNION TERRORISM SITUATION AND TREND REPORT 2018 (TESAT 2018)]].

It's indeed true that most terrorists are not muslims or Islam followers. But (quotes from the report):

#+begin_quote
  In recent years there has been an increase in the frequency of jihadist attacks, but a decrease in the sophistication of their preparation and execution. Jihadist attacks, however, cause more deaths and casualties than any other terrorist attacks.
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  Recent attacks prove jihadist terrorists' preference for attacking people rather than other targets provoking less of an emotional response from the general public, such as damage to premises or loss of capital.
#+end_quote

It shows that even if number of Islam related attacks is not big they are more dangerous for civilians than others.
