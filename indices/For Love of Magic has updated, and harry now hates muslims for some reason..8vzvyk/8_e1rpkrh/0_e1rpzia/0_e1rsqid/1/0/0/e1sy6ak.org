No it isn't, but if that's the only news you're consuming then you should be aware of the fact that you're painting yourself into being uneducated fully about a topic. Try consuming other news.\\
Also, if you agree you may be wrong but are using the state of news as an excuse for your ignorance then you're just trying to avoid responsibility for your words.\\
You chose to make the statement " but the most terrorists are Islam followers" even though /this is untrue/ and incredibly discriminatory and harmful. You just fed into the racism machine and tried to say "oh it's not my fault, I didn't come up with it". No shit, but you still went ahead and propagated it didn't you?
