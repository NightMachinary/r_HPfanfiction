You're a moron if you believe the idea that only those who are Muslim or who follow Islam are capable of being terrorists and you've been drinking at the well of post-9/11 propaganda.\\
Between 2001 and 2017, more people were killed by white men (right wing ones) than Islamists. Our white, right-wing terrorists outnumber our "Islamic" terrorists 2:1.\\
Even our "Islamic" terrorists are American-born and raised. The San Bernadino shooter was decried as a Muslim attacker but in fact was only half Pakistani and was raised here. The Boston Marathon bombers were Chechen, but raised here. You sound ignorant when you try to pin something all on one group, but if you're going to pin it on just one then you really chose wrong.
