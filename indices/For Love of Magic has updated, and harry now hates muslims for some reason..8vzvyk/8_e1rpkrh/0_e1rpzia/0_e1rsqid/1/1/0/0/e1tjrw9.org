I was talking about Europe. And if we are going with US numbers, the majority of murders are carried out by black men against other black men, but no one in America cares about Black on Black crime.

And it is obviously purely coincidental that countries with a very small Muslim population like Poland have no terror whilst rape and murder are becoming more and more common in Germany and France.
