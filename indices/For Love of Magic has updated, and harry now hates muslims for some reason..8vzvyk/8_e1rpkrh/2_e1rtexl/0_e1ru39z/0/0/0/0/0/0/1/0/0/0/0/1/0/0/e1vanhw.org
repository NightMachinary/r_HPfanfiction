Seems to me like we are quite lucky that the reaction of wizards and witches to being hunted was the Statute of Secrecy and not a full-scale war against muggles. They could have won easily if they were ruthless enough. There are dozens of ways for a wizard or witch (damn it isn't there some term that includes both genders?) to control a muggle leader, from simple threats to love potions and the Imperius. Probably wouldn't be hard to kill off most muggles within a few decades, or at least throw their societies into total chaos.

In other words, I don't think that offending an advanced species by killing their members is a good idea, no matter if they sometimes do things we consider crimes.
