That sounds reasonable actually, although I refuse to apply any physical laws outside physics ;)

In that case I wonder if the muggles would still be able to defend against a takeover, they might have grown complacent in the centuries since they had to fight against wizardkind...

On the other hand, if muggles are able to deal with wizards like that, then they /could/ probably just punish those who do "evil" instead of fighting a war of extermination against all of wizardkind...
