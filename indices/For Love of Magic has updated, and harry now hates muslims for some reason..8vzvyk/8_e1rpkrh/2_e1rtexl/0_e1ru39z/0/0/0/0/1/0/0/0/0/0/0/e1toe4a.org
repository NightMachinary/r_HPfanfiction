I'm not talking about respecting the religions as a whole. I have no issue with what you're saying. The issue I have is that someone shouldn't lack respect for a religion because of what a few nutjobs have done. And that's all I've been trying to say.

Read the Bible/Qoran and decide that you don't like either? Great, you do that. See an act of religiously motivated terrorism and decide you don't like that religion or people who associate with it? No. That's not ok. At the end of the day, judging people because of the actions of others that /you/ associate them with is not a fair way to judge people.
