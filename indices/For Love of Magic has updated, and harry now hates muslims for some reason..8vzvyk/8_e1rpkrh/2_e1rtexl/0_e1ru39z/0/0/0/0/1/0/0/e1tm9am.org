But who has the right to decide who is Christian/Muslim and who isn't? In my previous example, the followers who break away will simply stop calling themselves Catholic, not Christian. There is no single authority for any Abrahamic religion due to how big they are, so us sane Christians/Muslims have no choice on who gets lumped in the same category as us. It's not Christianity or Islam that is the problem, it's the nutjobs who the rest of us have to break away from. Example, ISIS and the KKK. There's nothing we can do to stop them from calling themselves Christian/Muslim, hence why there are so many sects of each religion.
