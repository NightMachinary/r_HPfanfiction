I mean, you're missing the point here. The disagreements exist without even changing the text. Changing it won't stop the disagreements.

For example, I'm a 16th century pope. I decide that hating homosexuals is wrong. I remove those passages from the bible. Half my followers disagree and break away from Catholicism and keep hating homosexuals. Is it still /my/ religion's fault that homosexuals are treated badly? No, of course not.

At the end of the day all Abrahamic religions preach love and acceptance. They also preach problematic things, but no more so than one would be exposed to by browsing reddit. Hateful people will find hate on those texts, regardless of what else is in it, and if they can't then they'll just find other texts to fuel their hate or just foregoreading entirely.

Just because religion has been used as a hateful tool in the past doesn't mean that's all it is. You can kill someone with Wingardium Leviosa, that doesn't make it dark magic.
