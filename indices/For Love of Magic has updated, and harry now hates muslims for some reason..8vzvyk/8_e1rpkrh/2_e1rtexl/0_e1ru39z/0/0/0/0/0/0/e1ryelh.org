So how about making rape illegal instead of making being a witch/wizard illegal? And I think in those times, nobody would fault a husband for killing his wife's rapist, no matter if the rapist was a wizard or not (as long as the rapist didn't happen to be a nobleman).

Killing all known witches and wizards just because they /might/ do bad things without anyone knowing is kinda like killing all men because they might rape. It's just not rational. Like, killing a witch that uses her powers to heal the muggles in her village doesn't make any sense in terms of protecting the muggles. Those witches and wizards who /actually/ harm muggles are likely those who don't get found out anyways.

So maybe in the beginning the main reason for "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" was because whoever wrote it had some really bad experience with witches and couldn't imagine there being any good ones, so in their eyes it made sense to kill them all. But at some point, people started believing in what was written without asking questions, and at some point the rationale for killing witches changed from "we believe they hurt us and we can't defend ourselves otherwise" to "God's word says they consort with the devil and that we need to kill them for that", and that is definitely more religion than anything else.
