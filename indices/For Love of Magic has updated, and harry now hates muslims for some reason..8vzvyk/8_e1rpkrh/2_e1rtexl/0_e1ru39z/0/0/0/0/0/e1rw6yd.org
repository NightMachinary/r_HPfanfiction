An action isn't a crime if the law doesn't say otherwise.

Almost any set of worlds can be used to justify aggressibe actions.

The problem is that people don't have (or don't see) any other ways of dealing with their problems except aggression. Everything else (including religion) is secondary.

Like here you are totally ignoring that non magical people didn't have any other ways of dealing with wizards and witches aggression except killing them.

This is primary thing. When a wizard was repeatedly raping non magical women their husbands and brothers didn't have any other ways of stopping him except killing.
