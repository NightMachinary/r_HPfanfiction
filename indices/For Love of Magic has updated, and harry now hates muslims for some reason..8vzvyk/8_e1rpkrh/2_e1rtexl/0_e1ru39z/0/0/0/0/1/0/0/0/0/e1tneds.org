  Or they might call themselves something else. But a more visible split would help with stopping people from lumping all Muslims into one group.

What more do you want from them? They go around saying how this is not what the believe in, they condemn the radical groups and point out how they are not the same, and yet that isn't enough?

  Protestants don't get blamed for the sins of the Catholic Church, after all.
#+end_quote

And this creates a hypocrisy which brings us to the crux of the issue. Protestants are not lumped in with Catholics because, in the West, people are aware of the distinction. Yet in the two sentences before you want a more visible split to differentiate. The reality is that distinctions in the Muslim world /do/ exist just as prevalently as that between Protestants and Catholics. If you think there needs to be more visible split then you are simply not doing enough to find out about the splits, because they are apparent and people are trying to raise awareness about it every day.

Your point about Protestants and Catholics simply shows that the real issue is /ignorance/, not the labels. People would stop lumping all religious people into the same category if they weren't /ignorant/.
