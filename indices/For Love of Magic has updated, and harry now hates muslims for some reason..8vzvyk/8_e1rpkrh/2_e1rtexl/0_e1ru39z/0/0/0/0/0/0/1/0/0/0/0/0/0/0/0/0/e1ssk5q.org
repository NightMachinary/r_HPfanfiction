Doesn't change the fact that it's shit and stupid. If you can hide from the muggles, you can control them as well. And that was Europe - only an idiot would assume that the entire magical world, especially countries where wizards were on top of the social structures, would go into hiding because some hicks in northern Europe wanted to hunt witches. If the European wizards were as strong as to force everyone else to hide as well just because of that, they could have easily dealt with the European muggles.
