Such a split would help with battling ignorance among the general public. As far as I am concerned, I would require a lot more from any religion to respect it.

As long as neither catholics nor protestants renounce the Old Testament and its evil, mass-murdering god as not part of their faith by cutting it out of the Bible and state that you can go to heaven without having to follow Jesus, I won't consider any of them as deserving respect. Same for the violent passages in the qoran. I don't care if you're part of the Sufis, Shi'a or Sunni until you find the backbone to edit the qoran.

I don't give a damn whether or not it's not meant literally - if a party policy has some stuff about defending slavery in it, I expect the party members to delete that shit, not tell me that's only in there because of tradition but they don't actually mean it. And I certainly hold a holy book to at least the same standard I hold party policies.
