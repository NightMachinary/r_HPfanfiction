Rowling needed to separate mundane and magical worlds and so she introduced the Statute of Secrecy without creating a proper history of it.

All we can do is speculate.

Personally I like the Newton's 3rd Law:

#+begin_quote
  To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.
#+end_quote

For me it means that mundane world (in Europe it's most likely Church) has something to oppose wizards and witches. The confrontation between them led to a bloody war (including the Witch Hunt) and as result the Statute was introduced as sort of agreement in order to not destroy each other completely or to avoid more causalities.

Magical community is very small and corrupted. They didn't want to think that mere muggles forced them to hide and therefore they rewrote their history erasing all mentions of their shame.
