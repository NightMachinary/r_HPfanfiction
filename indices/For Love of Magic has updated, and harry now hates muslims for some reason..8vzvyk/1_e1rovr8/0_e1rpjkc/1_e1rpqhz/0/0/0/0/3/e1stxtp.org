  What is happening all around Europe that we're blaming Muslims on exactly?
#+end_quote

It is not about single acts, it is about collective actions, like not giving a single shit about women's rights or freedom of speech (as soon as you say something critical about Islam or Turkey). The majority of Muslims in Germany are antisemitic, something that won't win you any popularity contests here either. Then there are the countless crimes committed by members of that religion, which are not related to it directly but to the culture which developed in Muslim countries. I mean stuff like honour killings if the girl is "impure". Add to that the general unwillingness of many Muslim 3rd generation immigrants to integrate into society (still keeping their Turkish passport, overall negative behaviour in public places) and you have your fair share of reasons.

TL;DR: It is not as much about the religion as about a significant amount of its followers who do fucked-up stuff with blurry lines between religion, culture and nationality. People from Muslim countries are leading the German crime statistics in all areas besides crimes against property.
