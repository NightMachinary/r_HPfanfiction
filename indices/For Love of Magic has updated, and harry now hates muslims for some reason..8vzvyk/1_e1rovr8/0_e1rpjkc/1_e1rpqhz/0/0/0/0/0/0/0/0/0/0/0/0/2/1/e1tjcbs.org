The most Muslims and Christians don't follow their books by word as you don't follow all practices from your history books.

Religions change with the world and societies similar to how laws change with time.

You also deny cultural, historical and economical contexts like they don't exists and your values are the only universal values that have right to exist.

But when you're talking about yourself you immediately remember past and present good things about your culture.

It's hypocrite. But especially it feels wrong if you take into account that with all your "high moral values" your culture will start dying out soon (with birth rate 1.54 per woman).
