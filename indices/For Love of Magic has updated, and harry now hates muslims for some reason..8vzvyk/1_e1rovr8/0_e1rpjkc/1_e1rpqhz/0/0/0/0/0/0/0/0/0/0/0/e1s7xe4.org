I can blame all Muslims (and all Christians) for considering a book as the word of god that contains very violent passages in a positive light. Quite honestly "it's in our holy book, but it's not meant that way" doesn't cut it. For Christians: Anyone who says they worship a god who massacred Egyptian children to punish their parents cannot claim he's a good person.

Either edit that holy book, or write a new one. But the "it shouldn't be interpreted like that" excuse isn't working.
