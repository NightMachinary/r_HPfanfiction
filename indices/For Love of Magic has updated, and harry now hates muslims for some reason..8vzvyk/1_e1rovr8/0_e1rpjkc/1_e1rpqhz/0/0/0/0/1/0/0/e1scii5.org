Well, yes, we take risks every day. We must accept some risk in order to function. And sometimes the distinctions we draw are arbitrary. Although, I'm not sure that it is at all arbitrary to say that I prefer to visit countries where the law prohibits people from carrying around deadly weapons on their person, or requires basic competency and screening before they can purchase them, etc.

Afterall, driving my car is, given my life circumstances, a necessity. So, I am prepared to mitigate what risk I can (ex. defensive driving, maintain my vehicle, snow tires in winter, etc.) and accept the rest. It is not as if I can give up my employment, or purchasing groceries, or become a hermit, etc. because I don't want to drive. But visiting the US isn't a necessity. There are plenty of other places to visit. One might even say nicer places. And, I hesitate to make this political, but as a Canadian, I really couldn't visit the US right now anyway if it was avoidable. It just wouldn't be right.
