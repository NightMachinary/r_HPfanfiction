See, you need to remember the good and bad things in the past and present - and then do something about the bad things. Religion is notably bad about the later. Just check the history of the catholic church with regards to child abuse by priests.

And fuck cultural contexts. That "argument" fails the Nazi test. It was debunked in the NÃ¼rnberg Trials. There are universal human rights, and if your culture doesn't respect them, your culture is wrong.
