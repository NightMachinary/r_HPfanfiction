These people use Islam as a scapegoat. Most of them, anyway. I'm pretty sure it's forbidden to go on a rampage if someone even insulted one of the many prophets or one of the holy books. Just educate them on it and carry on your own way. It's never stated to burn down libraries (quite the opposite, actually, because a thirst for knowledge is a must for every single Muslim, just like praying or fasting) or kill random people because of it.

As for the perpetrator in question, I'm not saying some aren't completely cray-cray. But he's not religiously motivated because it's clearly forbidden to do that in Islam. We call these people 'متطرفين' meaning they're not really Muslims, religiously motivated but wrongly so, not quite knowing what the Quran actually says about such things. So he /seems/ religiously motivated but in reality, he isn't because it's clearly forbidden.
