I'm coming at this purely from an outside perspective, but if the specifically anti-muslim rants were all Harry's, and the "Islam is a piece of shÂ¨t anyway" remark alone was from the author directly, then could be the author is actually being honest and consistent. He despises monotheist religions in general, and so felt it was okay to make a character who particularly hated /one/ of them.
