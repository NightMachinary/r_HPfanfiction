I remember reading this scene and thinking hard about the magic system rules he implemented because I was sitting there trying to figure out if it was rape. After a while I paged back to re-read the section of the soul magic and I thought, 'Well, then it's rape isn't it? Right? But surely I'm misunderstanding this? Or is he actually raping her?'

I was super confused especially considering there was an entire arc where Harry has to accept what the magic does and how it affected his relationship with Tonks, only for him to rape Narcissa.

Barmy.
