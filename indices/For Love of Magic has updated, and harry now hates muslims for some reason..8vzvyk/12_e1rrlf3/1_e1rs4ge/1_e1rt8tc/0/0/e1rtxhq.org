Like without religion things would be better.

Can you provide an example of the atheistic society without problems other countries have?

Contrary to your statement Australia is one of the most LGBT-friendly countries and at the same time 52.1% of the Australian population declared some variety of Christianity.

Aggressive attitude to religious people doesn't make person's values more valuable. It just shows that person is full of hate and his/her values are very questionable.
