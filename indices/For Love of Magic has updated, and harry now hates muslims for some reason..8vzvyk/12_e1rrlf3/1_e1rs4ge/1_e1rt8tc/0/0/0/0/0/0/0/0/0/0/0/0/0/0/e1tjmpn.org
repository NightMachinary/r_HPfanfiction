I don't disagree with your immigration policies. As I stated before you have all rights to protect yourself, you lifestyle and your culture from outside influence.

At the same time others do have the same rights. Your values aren't universal, because different cultures have different histories, economics and social psychology. You just can't apply your rules for everyone just because you wanted it.

The only thing that matters is whether people follows laws and respect traditions of the country they live it. But then it's more about law enforcement and social institutes in that country, than anything else.

Get out of your bubble. The world a lot bigger and different than Switzerland, Europe Union or even West.
