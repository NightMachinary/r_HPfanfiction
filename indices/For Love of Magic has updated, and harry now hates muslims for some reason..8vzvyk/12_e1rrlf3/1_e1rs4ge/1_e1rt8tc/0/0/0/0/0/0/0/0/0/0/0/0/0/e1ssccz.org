But if a country of 8M is open to migration from countries with a total of more than 50 times that population, only an idiot would complain about them not being open to the entire world.

I'll say it again: We don't have quotas. We don't have limits. Anyone who can afford it in the EU can enter and stay. You can complain about how shut off we are when you can point to other nin-European developed countries open to free immigration to that degree.
