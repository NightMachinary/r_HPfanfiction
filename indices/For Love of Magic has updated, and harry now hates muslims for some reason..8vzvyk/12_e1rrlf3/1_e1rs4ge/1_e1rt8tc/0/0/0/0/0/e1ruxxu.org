Indeed. And we've come a long way since - back then, religious nutcases had a lot more say, but their influence has eroded drastically. When my grandparents married, in 1945, the fact that a catholic woman was marrying a protestant (and a divorced) was a big thing. The police checked hotels and flats in the 50s to find unmarried couples sleeping in the same bed - with police officers checking if both beds were warm when coming in early in the morning.

It was a fucked up country, mostly due to religious shit. And as religion was driven back and churches emptied, we got better.
