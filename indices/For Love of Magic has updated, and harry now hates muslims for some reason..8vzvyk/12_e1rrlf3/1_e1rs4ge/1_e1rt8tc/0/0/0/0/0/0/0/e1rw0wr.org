We actually do not have "really strict laws against immigration and refugees". The whole "anti-immigration law vote" was a big spectacle, but what was passed into actual law didn't change anything significantly with regards to immigration - any EU citizen still can freely immigrate, same as before; there was no real change. In the same vein, the laws concerning refugees haven't been significantly altered either. What has been altered are laws dealing with illegal immigrants who aren't refugees. But there, too, the reality is that you can't really deport many people against their will in Switzerland. (And we don't dump them at the border, nor do we imprison them on islands.)

I've been dealing for 7 years with the deportation part of those laws, I know what I'm talking about.
