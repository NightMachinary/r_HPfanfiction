I think the number of people who think about religion so badly a lot less than you imply.

It's also wrong to blame it for everything. Especially when you can't deal with your own problems.

Often religion has nothing to do with human actions, it's just a tool in hands of other humans. The same with "progressive ideas". Very often they are used as an excuse for bulling, aggression and wars.

For some time I see that those "progressive" people are more aggressive than an average religious. At the same time their agenda has nothing to do with human rights, but it's all about spreading their power.
