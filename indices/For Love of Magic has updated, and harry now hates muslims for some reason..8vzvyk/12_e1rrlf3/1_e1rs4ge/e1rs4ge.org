Why wouldn't many people think of religion so badly? Mainstream Christianity and Islam aren't really a good thing for anyone who's LGBT. The more radical but still pretty popular parts of both religions are misogynist as well, and generally push very intolerant policies towards anything even remotely progressive compared to patriarchal doctrine rooted in ancient history.
