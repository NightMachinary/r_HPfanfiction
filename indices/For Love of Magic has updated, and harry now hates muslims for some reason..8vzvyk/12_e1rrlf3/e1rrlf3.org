Nah, he has rants on Islam a lot, at some point he calls them slaves because of where the name Muslim derives from. Frankly the excuse that its a characters ideology would normally work but this Harry is very much an authors mouth piece. I do wonder how much the author interacts with other people at all, his characters whilst interesting and well written are largely robots or driven by a singular goal and not very realistic in that.

Overall I can overlook a racist rant in a fic, I've seen far worse in both fiction and real life. My main worry is the type of life the author lives where he thinks of religion so badly.
