Religion is a stain on mankind that needs to be cut away.Religion is a cancerous growth that spreads and infects and destroys. Christianity did it, Islam does it.

Fact is, as soon as Islam is target of critic, people freak out.

I wish people would keep their shitty Religion in their private life, where it belongs. I wish our Nations would ban religion from public space. Shitheads posting their "Deus Vult" comments, when Arabs die, or an Migrant has commited a crime. Islamists slaughtering people in the name of their god. How can anyone seriously expect that this is something we should uphold? Banish Religion from the public. Tax the churches, the mosques.

But it wont happen. As long as there are countries ruled by christian parties, or straight away by radical islamists. Nothing will change.

I wish the Enlightenment would have spread through the world and burned away all those silly beliefs.

Gotta move along and hope for the best.

Sidenote: love how some of you freak out 'cause someone got an opinion.
