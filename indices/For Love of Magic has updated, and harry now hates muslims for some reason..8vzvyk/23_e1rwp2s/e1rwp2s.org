So? There are many cases where Christianity is bashed, Harry is a magical Nazi, the magical Nazis had been right all along, there is nothing wrong with turning Azkaban into a concentration camp, racial purges are fine or where the Ministry introduces a rape law which neither Hitler nor Stalin ever seriously considered, but bashing the religion which currently is by far the most violent one crosses the line?

Europe has been in conflict with Muslims for close to one and a half millennia now, starting with the Moorish conquests in the 8th century and the crusades during the Middle Ages, the defeat of the Muslim Hordes in modern-day Russia and Reconquista in the Renaissance while most of the Modern period was spent battling the Ottomans for Hegemony over Eastern Europe. Hell, during the HP era there was the Yugoslavia conflict, where religion was one of the main issues.
