Spitting on ideologies is perfectly fine. You can look at someone in disdain for being Muslim just as you can disdain someone for believing in flat-earth or denying 2+2=4. You can say terrible stuff about Islam, or any other movement, and as long as you support your argument, you're fine. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with this - especially because the author is doing it via a fictional medium and his own characters rather than insulting real people.

Society has evolved to where it's at today by people challenging the social norm. If people had censored as heavily as you suggest, we would be stuck in a decidedly more backwards society.
