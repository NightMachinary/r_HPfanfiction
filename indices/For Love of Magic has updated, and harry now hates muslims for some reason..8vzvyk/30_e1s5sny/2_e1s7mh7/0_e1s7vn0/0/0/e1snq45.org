It is the answer to people dehumanizing and spitting on other people for being Muslim - or gay, or trans, or black, or women - especially when they're an author talking to a reader personally, and put it into a publicized work to spread their backwards and disgusting views. It should NEVER be accepted, and I'm never going to. It's wrong, it's hurtful, and it's going to stop.
