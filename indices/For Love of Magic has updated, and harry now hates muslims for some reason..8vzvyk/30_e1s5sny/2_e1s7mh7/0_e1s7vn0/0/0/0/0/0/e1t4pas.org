You initially focused on the story when you said you wanted to report it for being bad and mean. I find it even more outlandish that you want to report someone for having views and stating them, if you don't want to see those ideals then don't read their stories, but you're not the person in charge of how everyone else thinks, you don't get to decide what's disgusting for everyone.

Your personal disgust for an author should be shown through a negative review and then not reading their work again, not through shutting their content down. I find you wanting to use censorship to oppose a different view as a bit disgusting.
