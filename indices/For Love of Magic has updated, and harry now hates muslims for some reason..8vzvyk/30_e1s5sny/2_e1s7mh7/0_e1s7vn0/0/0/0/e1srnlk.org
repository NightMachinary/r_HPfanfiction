The problem with this is that you aren't a sovergn power with a perfect understanding of what is right and wrong in the universe.

I disagree with the sentiments that the author is portraying to the audience but that doesn't mean they don't have the right to write the story the way they want.

Ultimately the idea that because a theme in a story is offensive to you means a story should be removed at your command comes of as naive and utterly childish.
