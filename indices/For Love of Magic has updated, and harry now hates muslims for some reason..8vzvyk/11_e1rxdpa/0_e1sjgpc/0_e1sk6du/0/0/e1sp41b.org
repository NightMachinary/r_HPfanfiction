True enough, Johnny Marr's new album is ace. I still definitely enjoy Moz's lyrics, but at this point he sounds like every yer da ever, and you can basically get American Morrissey on any Father John Misty record these days, so it's not as if we're truly missing him. Especially when you consider how awful Low in High School was.
