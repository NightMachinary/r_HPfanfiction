Having characters espouse your political views is rarely a good look, especially if it's something as contentious as blanket condemning an entire religion. Especially in a fandom like HP. Do you really think a book series that was all about accepting people for being different and fighting magic Nazis would really be compatible with Islamophobia?

Yeah, but can we just take a second to talk about how great Blur actually is? Albarn ought to stop with the constant mediocre Gorillaz albums and get the lads back together.
