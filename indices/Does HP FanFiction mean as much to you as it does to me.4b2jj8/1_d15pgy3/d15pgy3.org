I understand what you mean. Growing up with the books was magical as I'm sure many people agree with. I found fan fiction by accident when I was in junior high & I fell in love. As an only child, I had TONS of free time and that usually meant I spent it reading books or surfing the web. I don't read too much of fan fiction these days because I'm extremely picky (we can blame Turn by Saras-girl for that). I so badly want to be apart of that world JK Rowling created and I don't want the majesty to end so reading fan fiction helps that. I believe the love stories I've seen in fan fiction gave me unrealistic expectations, but that's what's fun about it I guess!
