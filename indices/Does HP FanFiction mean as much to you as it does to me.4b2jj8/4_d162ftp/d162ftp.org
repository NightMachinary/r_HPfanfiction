This is always the way I've felt about reading, ever since I was a child reading has been an escape for anything from seriously screwed up things (like my parents divorce while I was a young kid) to when life begins to seem monotonous and boring. Fan fiction has added a whole new depth to this. However I want the maincharacter to be I can find a fic for that, and it's the most amazing thing. In some ways fanfiction feels like the most amazing friend you can ever have. It will never judge you, it's always there when you need it, and it always has what you want it to have. I mean if fanfiction can come up with Draco/A bowl of fruit, what isn't it capable of?
