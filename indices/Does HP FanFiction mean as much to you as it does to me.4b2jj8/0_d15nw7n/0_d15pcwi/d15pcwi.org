I'm sorry to hear about your nephew, and while I can't imagine what it must have felt like to be sitting there next to him at the time, my love of fanfiction stems from a similar place.

What you said about reading super Harry and do over fics, I totally get it. I too wish that I could go back in time and fix everything, or that I could wave a wand and everything would end happily. I read fan fiction because I can get lost in the fantasy, and if I try really hard, or if I read enough, I can pretend that /I/ did those things, that /I/ was the one the save the day.

It seems rather childish saying it out loud, but I understand the comfort that fan fiction cam bring.

Thanks for sharing.
