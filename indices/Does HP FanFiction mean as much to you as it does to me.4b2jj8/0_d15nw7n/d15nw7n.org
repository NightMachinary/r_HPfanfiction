A year and a half ago, my nephew was diagnosed with a terminal heart defect and heart failure, doctors said only way he would survive was a heart transplant that they wouldn't give him because they don't give newborns heart transplants here. He was given a month to live and my family fell apart.

I read fanfiction, when everything is falling to shit it was nice to escape into a magical world that fulfilled my dreams for what should happen. I love do-overs and super Harry because It made me feel like strength was possible. I sat next to his crib in the hospital and read to him, it made me feel normal and sane.

I eventually returned to a sense of normal, not reading fanfiction 18 hours a day anymore but I still love it and it is still my safe space.
