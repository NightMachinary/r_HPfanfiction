  Maybe it's because I'm a friendless loser, but I just can't help feeling so /close/ to these characters.

That's being too harsh on yourself. People forge connections with fiction for many, many reasons. It's understandable, and, what's more, you're not alone in it.

Characters in a movie or a standalone novel are like an interesting, legendary local you meet in a bar, one who is offering you a drink. Sometimes you don't like what's in the glass, sometimes you do. If you do like it, then you find by the end of the night that your new pal is great and memorable and you're definitely going to tell your friends about them. Sure, they really just have one shtick, but they do it well. You'll be treading old if beloved ground every time they tell their story to you. Regardless, hanging out can be nostalgic and you sometimes catch details you didn't notice before. It's always like meeting up with an old, reliable buddy.

Characters in a TV or book series are the interesting person you meet while pursuing a favorite hobby of yours. Maybe you're at a convention, or reading some interesting threads online, or at the last physical book store within miles of where you live, but you, for whatever reason, talk to this person. If the two of you click, then you have just made a friend who will be around for a while. You catch up with them frequently when they're active, and when they're not, you like to hear the stories about them you've heard before. You grow much closer to this friend than the previous one. Part of that is because they have more than just one tale to tell, usually, or if it is just a single story, it's an epic one. But you also get to know them on a deeper level.

In either case, having fanfiction is a way to hear new stories from familiar friends.
