I've been reading hpff for almost ten years now. I read... a lot, and most of the time I'm reading fan fiction. It actually scares me a little, because I know that if I spent half as much time reading "literature" as I do reading fan fiction, I would be exceedingly well read. But the truth is, I deeply love it, and I keep coming back to it time and time again.

I think part of it is that I read so much, I don't really have the time and patience to get heavily involved in a new world with each series I read. With fan fiction, the author doesn't need to stop and explain the significance of a character or an act, because you already have all the context you could ever need. It's immediately accessible in a way that only later books in a long series can be. And it lessens the pain of finishing a great work, because you can immediately go and find something else with the same characters or the same theme.

I don't know. It's complicated. But you're definitely not alone.
