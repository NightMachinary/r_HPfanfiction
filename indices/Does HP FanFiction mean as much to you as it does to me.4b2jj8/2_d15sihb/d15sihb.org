I totally understand. I often joke that my longest relationship has been with fanfiction - I started reading 11 years ago in my teens and now I'm in my late 20s. It's been the one constant through 4 different cities, two different degrees, living with various family and then on my own, it's seen me through breakups and family death, seen me through falling in love and getting married. Other than tea, it's been the one thing in my life I can count on all throughout that. I feel you dude/dudette.
