Dear god, you just described exactly how I feel. Fanfiction is just a way to keep the magic going. It's the whole fucking Harry Potter universe that I'm so enthralled with. I remember going to every book release, starting with OotP, and every movie release starting literally from the first. My entire fifth grade class went together to our small town movie theater the evening Sorcerer's Stone (I live in the southeast US) was released. Every single member of my class was dressed up in robes. I attribute that to us having a badass fifth grade teacher.

I just can't stay away. I have all of the audiobooks and I listen to them daily while I get ready in the mornings or while I drive. When I was a kid, my parents used to ground me from reading my Harry Potter books if I did something wrong, because it was the only kind of grounding that had an effect on me. The majority of my books are missing covers, have water and food stains all over them, and just generally look like they are really goddamn loved. I've read so much fanfiction that I've started to dream in Harry Potter. It's definitely just not that you're friendless, cause yeah, I have a lot of friends. And yes, even the ones that love Harry Potter make fun of me for how goddamn obsessed I am. I was finally able to visit Universal Studios last holiday and you would have thought I had died and gone to heaven. Hell, it WAS my heaven. I spent New Years 2016 riding Escape from Gringotts three times with my boyfriend and my little brother, rather than watching fireworks.

So... yeah. No one honestly understands how much it means to me. Except people like you.
