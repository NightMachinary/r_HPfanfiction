I can see how that would be frustrating for you. But as a reader, and a fic-reader specifically I have a thousand stories on offer and only so much time. I don't know you as an author, I haven't bought into your brand, so when I come across what I consider structural issue in the first chapter, how can you expect me to trust you to fix it?

Perhaps it's ultimately an issue of the medium more that your work, as fanfiction.net is basically a dating site for readers and writers all vying for attention.
