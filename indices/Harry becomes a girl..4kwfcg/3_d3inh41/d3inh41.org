*Effects and Side Effects* linkffn(4606270) is probably my favorite.

I have two stories I wrote/am writing where Harry turns into a girl.

The first is *Rose Lily Potter* he turns to a girl pretty early on in life, but it does explain about Harry. linkffn(11486857)

The second is *Harry Potter: Neko's Mate*. In this story, Harry's a Metamorphmagus, who can turn back and forth between a boy and girl. linkffn(11868945)
