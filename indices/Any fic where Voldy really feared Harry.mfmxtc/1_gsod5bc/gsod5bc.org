That would be a good story: to the perenial question “Did Voldemort feel when a Horcrux was destroyed?” answer would be resounding “YES”, but for some reasons he couldn't do anything about (magically, he couldn't create new Horcrux, because he exhausted his quota, or something else). So, he is just waiting on his fate coming, falling deeper into madness with each Horcrux destroyed (because each part of his soul feeds into mind, when they are gone, he is going literally crazy). Beethoven's Fifth on steroids: Fate is comming. Could be good angsty story.
