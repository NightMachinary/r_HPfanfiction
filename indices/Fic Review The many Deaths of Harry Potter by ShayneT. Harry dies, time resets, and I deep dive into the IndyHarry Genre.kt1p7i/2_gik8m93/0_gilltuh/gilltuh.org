Thank you kindly!

Believe it or not I cut a lot from this review for word count - I could have gone into a lot more detail. I was a fan of the blow by blow detail and creativity of the fight scenes, particularly how Harry was able to leverage the most out of a small skill set to get through momentous obstacles, like mastering the diffindo spell.

Competent Voldemort made the story way scarier, which was great, I just wish the starting premise had been better explained, because there was a lot that just didn't wrap up. We never find out who even caused at least 2 or 3 of Harry's deaths, where the threats were within Hogwarts, and what Voldemort was doing between Halloween of 1981 and the start of the story.
