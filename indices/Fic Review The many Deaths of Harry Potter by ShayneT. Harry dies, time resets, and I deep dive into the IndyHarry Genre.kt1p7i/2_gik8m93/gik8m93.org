I always enjoy these reviews, they're always a great read.

I am similar in the sense that while I think Indy!Harry stories typically do suffer from the points you laid out, I count this story among one of my favourites of the genre due to how it's written.

The competent Voldemort is absolutely a big factor for me, he's so rarely a threat in these types of stories, and I found Harry's final battle with him to be quite gripping.
