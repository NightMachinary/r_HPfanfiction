Actually, I found the story much more intriguing than the premise :D. The gender swap is minor, though, compared to the identity swap; pretending to be a boy isn't a crime, but pretending to be a Pureblood will get you life in Azkaban. And that's before Riddle starts taking a personal interest in this precocious teen-ager...

If you're familiar with Alanna the Lioness, you'll recognise some elements inspired by that, but it's not in any way a straight copy from either that or HP. It's a whole new story.
