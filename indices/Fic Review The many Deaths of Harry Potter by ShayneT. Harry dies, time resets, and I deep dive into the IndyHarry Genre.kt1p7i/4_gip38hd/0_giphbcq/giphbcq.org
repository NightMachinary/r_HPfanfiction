The premise of Pureblood Pretense looks really interesting! I've never read a genderswapped Harry story, and Indy!Harry by and large seems to centre around male protagonists, so I'm interested to see wat the similarities and differences are. Thanks for the recommendation - I've added it to my reading list!
