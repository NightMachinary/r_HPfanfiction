I've read Many Deaths twice, and liked the way it used the reset to avoid giving Harry plot armour. Make a mistake and you /will/ get squished. Sometimes literally. And even if you get back up again - your friends might not.

Do you only review completed stories? If you're coming around on powerful protagonists, I think The Pureblood Pretense does a good job of justifying and balancing one. Harriett Potter grew up with both her parents, so is naturally much more familiar with magic, plus she has a good work ethic and is in a situation where socialising and relaxing is risky while learning extracurricular skills is essential. So, she develops a number of impressive skills, but constantly frustrates her friends by keeping secrets and not fully trusting or relying on them.

When she does have a power-up that's just because the story wrote it that way, like unusually large magical reserves, it causes as many problems as it solves, drawing attention that she can't afford and making her a target.

Perhaps most importantly, the story makes use of her abilities to enrich a new plot, rather than steamroll through canon. It delves into advanced potion brewing, and magical healing, in a really interesting way, but it doesn't just make things easy for her.
