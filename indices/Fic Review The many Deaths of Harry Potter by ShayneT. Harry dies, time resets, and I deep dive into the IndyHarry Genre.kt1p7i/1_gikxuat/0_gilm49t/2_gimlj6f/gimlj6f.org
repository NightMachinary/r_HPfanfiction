Kill them all has Taylor literally making it rain the corpses of her enemies through the city.

The government is very much not pleased with her.

Consider that kill them all Taylor kills an extreme amount of people and flaunts basically every law there is, saying that, canon Taylor(the main character of worm) is a villain and this one is a hero, that should say something to you about the original material.

Though canon Taylor does keep death to a minimum, but does other horribly fucked up shit to make up for it Haha
