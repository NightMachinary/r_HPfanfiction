  Ron ... Hufflepuff ... Ron walks out during the Horcrux Hunt, but what matters is that he comes back
#+end_quote

That's actually not what matters. What matters is that he abandoned them in the first place. A Hufflepuff wouldn't even consider this course of action - let alone doing something like this.

This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. Ron is the least Hufflepuff person I've ever seen. He's neither loyal nor hard working.

What are you smoking?
