Why don't you try making your own arguments? The only thing you presented up until now is "look at this illoyal act that borders on betrayal as evidence for why he is loyal". What else am I supposed to do than worry about your health?

I'll do you a favor and address one of the most common defenses. The "he's just a teenager defense". I don't think there's anything about teenagers that makes them particularly illoyal. Teenagers aren't tempered by reason, which means they tend towards the extremes, but that also means that they can take loyalty to extremes. See gang-culture or just how they can stick together on the school yard.

All of these arguments ignore entirely that there's plenty of reasons for Ron to support Harry that have nothing to do with loyalty: His country is being taken over, his family is a bunch of bloodtraitors and might be killed, his sister is stuck in Castle Voldemort and he himself is probably pretty high on Voldies hitlist. The fact that he comes back could be explained by many reasons and loyalty is IMHO not one of them.

In any case, even if I were to accept that abadoning your friends and coming back with your tail between your legs is somehow a sign of loyality, you still haven't made a good argument why any of that is a Hufflepuff trait. You see, it is also the opposite of "hard working". "Oh noez, this is too tough and we aren't making progress fast enough and I'm hungry... I want to call it quits," is the oposite of what a Hufflepuff would say. Ron is the least Hufflpeuff of the trio:
