Why don't you try realizing that when you have a Horcrux influencing your mind and corrupting your thoughts, you make bad decisions?

Ron is dedicated and loyal throughout the series, and you're blowing up one incident where he loses faith in Harry to him “coming back with his tail between his legs”?

Honestly, it's a wonder that Ron didn't abandon Harry and encourage his family to do so as well! Harry is trouble, and he even encourages Ron and Hermione to leave him at the end of HBP. So actually, regarding your reasons why Ron should come back, it would have made more sense for Ron to not have gone with Harry in the first place.
