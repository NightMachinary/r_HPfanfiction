Are you still trying to argue that abandoning your friends is a sign of loyalty? Are you having a small stroke right now?

A loyal person will never be in a position where they have to come back after being illoyal, because they are actually loyal and not mental-gymnastics-kind-of loyal.

I don't think this discussion will be very fruitful when your speech-language center is so impaired that loyalty is literally the opposite of loyalty for you.
