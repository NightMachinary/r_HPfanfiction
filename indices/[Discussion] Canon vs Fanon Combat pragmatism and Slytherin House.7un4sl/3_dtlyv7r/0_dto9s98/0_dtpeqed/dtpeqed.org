The houses represent different ideals. Obviously, no one is a perfect representation of an ideal, but for someone to be a Slytherin or a Hufflepuff or whatever, they /tend/ to act that way.

  That's actually not what matters. What matters is that he abandoned them in the first place. A Hufflepuff wouldn't even consider this course of action - let alone doing something like this.

So what? Neville is scared of Professor Snape, to the point of Snape being his boggart. Does this then mean that, because Neville was scared, he isn't a Gryffindor? No!

Ron is most certainly loyal, as he chooses to enter the forest to meet the spiders - his greatest fear! - in order to help Harry and to solve the mystery of the Chamber. Regarding the tent, what matters is that Ron /chooses/ to return. He left in the heat of the moment, while being influenced by a piece of Voldemort's soul, and immediately regretted it the moment he Apparated away. In the Potterverse, it's what a character chooses at the end of the day that matters. An example is with remorse and Horcruxes; had Voldemort felt any hint of remorse, his soul could have been healed.

In summary. Ron is loyal. Yes, he made a mistake, but that's what happens as we grow up.
