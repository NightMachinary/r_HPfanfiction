Because it doesn't fit in with the overall motif/theme of Harry Potter, which is that power comes from strength of will. The greatest willpower comes from, of course, love - love is what lets Harry walk to his death in the Forest, to face his demons and his fears and keep moving forwards.

And, interestingly enough, I think you're forgetting the greatest Slytherin of all, Harry.

See, the so-called golden trio, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all represent different houses - Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Sure, Ron walks out during the Horcrux Hunt, but what matters is that /he comes back./ What sets them apart, what makes them Gryffindor, is their willpower. They demonstrate a capability and willingness to act, and though it throws them in troublesome situations and indirectly kills Sirius, it also is the quality /emphasized/glorified by the theme./

Essentially, the Slytherin house represents ambition gone wrong, the lazy kind of ambition - though Tom Riddle rises above this - ambition without will.

Now, are people truly that one-dimensional? Hell no! But this is a story written with a purpose in mind, so fuck that.

On a related note, I really dislike how inefficient most fan fiction is. Many “greats” can really afford to get rid of some of their more irrelevant plot points and unnecessary embellishment.
