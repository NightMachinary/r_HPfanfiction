I'll just say that Rowling definitely didn't "drop the ball". All the worldbuilding incosistencies aside, her story was the perfect young adult novel series with /themes/ coming before stone-cold grit. To all/most of your points: Yes. Had it been an adult novel series, most of this would be applicable criticism. But a series made for kids to young adults cannot allow itslef too much gradients between black and white. It would water the story down and make it from something I and many others have fond memories of, read countless times, /write fanfiction about/, to just another forgettable fantasy novel series.

But I'll immediately stand behind the statement that should you write an adult HP story, you're right.

Slytherin is the House of Ambition and Cunning. Nowhere does it say that Slytherins must be evil. However, chances are that the dungeons are full packed of opportunists, pragmatists and all in all colder in character than the other three Houses. On the action side of things I would assume that Slytherins are prone to overdo it with the intel while never acting, risking to pass on opportunities and timings, other than the Gryffindors who will act on a bare minimum of intel, risking traps and (fatal) mistakes.

I've tried figuring out a Slytherin Harry for a long time now and it's a rather painful process to scrap away the thematic and character-perspective bias on the Slytherins. But of course a first year Slytherin will be one thing first and foremost: a kid. He or she will be a kid molded by their parents, naive worldviews and very black and white thinking.
