  Now, are Slytherins bad people? Sort of. In order to be Sorted there, one has to either possess cunning and selfish ambition or at the very least view them as virtues. That is, one must be OK with taking advantage of others to one's own ends, with climbing over others on the way to the top.
#+end_quote

Slytherin does not value selfish ambition, but rather ambition as a whole. Likewise, cunning is a trait that can be utilised for either good, evil, or somewhere in the grey area. Yes, there are Slytherins who would gladly backstab their friends for reasons like power, but it would have been better if Rowling showed us a greater variety of the house, like some of the above examples of Slytherins.

  In short, generally nice, kind kids don't go to Slytherin; and the few that do learn very quickly not to be generally nice or kind.
#+end_quote

That is exactly my point! Rowling should not have written the house in such a two-dimensional way. Being cunning and ambitious are not mutually exclusive with being nice and kind. A Gryffindor can easily be a villain who sees /everything/ in black-white to extremist levels; a Ravenclaw villain would experiment in the name of science and magic; a Hufflepuff would seduce you into their cult. Does this mean I want all of Slytherin house to be good? Of course not! The types of Slytherin in canon act as a compare and contrast to other students.

  People with great ambitions to make the world a better place (whether the world wants it or not) go to Gryffindor, not Slytherin. The characters we see with such ambitions, who plan far in advance, and are often quite ruthless in executing their plans---Dumbledore and Hermione---are both Gryffindors. In short, Bruce Wayne would be a Gryffindor, whereas Roland Dagget would be a Slytherin. (The Joker would be a Ravenclaw, IMO.)

Are you kidding me? Bruce in Gryffindor? True, he is brave, but Batman is much more likely to use his brain to win, instead of charging head-first into battle. He will use anything in his arsenal, learn anything to have the edge, change the rules - all with a compassionate heart. If not Slytherin, Bruce could be in Ravenclaw.

On the subject of Dumbledore, that brings me back to my main point. Why didn't Rowling put him in Slytherin? Imagine how surprised Harry would have been hearing that the headmaster had been a part of the 'evil' house - how it would make him re-evaluate what he knows? People with great (and good) ambitions can be in Slytherin, especially if that ambition is strong, but that doesn't mean that they aren't also loyal, smart etc.

  Same deal for "combat pragmatism". We don't see much overall, but Harry (a Gryffindor among Gryffindors), is probably best of all the characters we see at taking advantage of openings and opportunities. Ron, when he is captured by Snatchers and disarmed of his wand manages to get his wand back and escape. A Slytherin has no particular advantages in that respect.

"We don't see much overall" - once again, exactly my point. War is war, and you have to do some things in the grey area. While the typical Gryffindor would blindly smash ahead, what should have been a typical Slytherin (or even Ravenclaw) would use their head. A overly "paranoid" (i.e. over-prepared) Slytherin would have traps, potions, portkeys, miscellaneous weapons. What do you mean by a Slytherin having no particular advantages? What "particular advantages" do other houses have that Slytherins do not?

  Is it that hard to believe that it's simply the case that Salazar Slytherin, for all his achievements, wasn't actually a very good person and valued the wrong things in himself and in other people? That he perpetuated these bad values through his influence on Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

In the end, it doesn't matter if Salazar was good, bad, or evil. It is the fact that the house itself is mostly portrayed as the 'evil' house. Having most of the DE kids in Slytherin really stripped away at the chance of adding nuance to Slytherin.
