  Slytherin does not value selfish ambition, but rather ambition as a whole.
#+end_quote

When talking about "ambition" or "ambitiousness" as describing a plan or an idea, it could be either. When talking about them as character traits, it generally connotes ambitions to elevate oneself. For example, when we say "ambitious politician" we refer to a politician who wants to attain a higher office for themselves, whereas "ambitious plan" refers to a plan that seeks to accomplish a lot.

  That is exactly my point! Rowling should not have written the house in such a two-dimensional way. Being cunning and ambitious are not mutually exclusive with being nice and kind. A Gryffindor can easily be a villain who sees everything in black-white to extremist levels; a Ravenclaw villain would experiment in the name of science and magic; a Hufflepuff would seduce you into their cult. Does this mean I want all of Slytherin house to be good? Of course not! The types of Slytherin in canon act as a compare and contrast to other students.

You are asking for a very specific kind of a "good" Slytherin, though: a Guile Hero, but Slytherin isn't very conducive to producing heroes of any kind because that's not what it's about. A Gryffindor gone bad is a tyrant or a conqueror who thinks of themselves as a liberator: Dumbledore almost became that. A Slytherin gone bad, like Voldemort, takes his selfishness and self-preservation to an extreme, to the point of mass murder and crimes against nature to avoid death and to protect his in-group (the wizards) from out-groups (the Muggles and what came from them). A Slytherin gone good is someone like Slughnorn: an acknowledged master of his craft, always on the lookout for mutually beneficial transactions, and fond of personal safety and creature comforts; all the while not really caring about people not in his social circle. (Can you imagine Hermione "wasting" a vial of Felix Felicis to just have a good day?)

  Are you kidding me? Bruce in Gryffindor? True, he is brave, but Batman is much more likely to use his brain to win, instead of charging head-first into battle. He will use anything in his arsenal, learn anything to have the edge, change the rules - all with a compassionate heart. If not Slytherin, Bruce could be in Ravenclaw.

A hypothetical Good!Slytherin!Bruce Wayne would use his wealth and intelligence to get others (knowingly or unknowingly) to clean up Gotham for him. Actual Bruce Wayne dresses up in an animal costume and punches out criminals personally, exposing himself to deadly danger on a daily basis, often dragging an adolescent into his adventures. He might be clever in how he goes about it, but Gryffindors are allowed to be clever.

  On the subject of Dumbledore, that brings me back to my main point. Why didn't Rowling put him in Slytherin?
#+end_quote

Perhaps how JKR envisioned Slytherin is not how you wish she had envisioned Slytherin. I've seen people make similar arguments about Ravenclaw: they're supposed to be the inventors, the future mad scientists, but they are mostly paperpushers.

  "We don't see much overall" - once again, exactly my point. War is war, and you have to do some things in the grey area. While the typical Gryffindor would blindly smash ahead, what should have been a typical Slytherin (or even Ravenclaw) would use their head. A overly "paranoid" (i.e. over-prepared) Slytherin would have traps, potions, portkeys, miscellaneous weapons. What do you mean by a Slytherin having no particular advantages? What "particular advantages" do other houses have that Slytherins do not?
#+end_quote

Now that I think about it, you can find all of the above in canon. Traps/Portkeys were used to abduct Harry at the end of GoF, Draco used Peruvian Darkness Powder and Thief's Hand (IIRC) at the end of HBP, Bellatrix is apparently very good with throwing knives, etc..

However, I think that what you seem to be asking is that Slytherins be /distinguished/ in this way, and that can only be accomplished by denying non-Slytherins their cleverness.

Ultimately, I think that what House you're in is less about your arsenal and tactics and more about what you do with them.

#+begin_quote
  In the end, it doesn't matter if Salazar was good, bad, or evil. It is the fact that the house itself is mostly portrayed as the 'evil' house. Having most of the DE kids in Slytherin really stripped away at the chance of adding nuance to Slytherin.
#+end_quote

Why does there need to be nuance? If you have a House that selects for antisocial personality traits and values, people who come out of it will tend not to be paragons of selfless heroism.
