First of all, I am not sure whether Rowling can be "biased" with respect to her own story. At worst, the protagonist might be an unreliable narrator, but it's a 3rd-person story, so unless we postulate that Harry is downright delusional, those things he has seen Slytherins do and not do, they did or didn't do, respectively.

Now, are Slytherins bad people? Sort of. In order to be Sorted there, one has to either possess cunning and selfish ambition or at the very least view them as virtues. That is, one must be OK with taking advantage of others to one's own ends, with climbing over others on the way to the top.

Then, one gets dropped into a social environment full of people like that, and being beneficent without asking for something in return is asking to be taken advantage of. An environment like that will train general goodwill and altruism out of someone pretty quickly, refocusing them on mutually beneficial relationships and a strong in-group out-group sensibility.

In short, generally nice, kind kids don't go to Slytherin; and the few that do learn very quickly not to be generally nice or kind.

This shows up in the heroic Slytherins we see in canon:

- Snape was motivated by revenge.
- Regulus was motivated by revulsion at a crime against nature and the possibility of an eternal tyrant. (Remember, he was a trusted Death Eater before he found out about the horcruxes, so he was perfectly OK with torture and mass murder.)
- Slughorn originally wanted to sit the conflict out, and while we don't know exactly what motivated him to fight Voldemort, given his general attitude, I think it was less general principle and more that people he cared about were fighting Voldemort---conformism, not courage.

People with great ambitions to make the world a better place (whether the world wants it or not) go to Gryffindor, not Slytherin. The characters we see with such ambitions, who plan far in advance, and are often quite ruthless in executing their plans---Dumbledore and Hermione---are both Gryffindors.

In short, Bruce Wayne would be a Gryffindor, whereas Roland Dagget would be a Slytherin. (The Joker would be a Ravenclaw, IMO.)

Same deal for "combat pragmatism". We don't see much overall, but Harry (a Gryffindor among Gryffindors), is probably best of all the characters we see at taking advantage of openings and opportunities. Ron, when he is captured by Snatchers and disarmed of his wand manages to get his wand back and escape. A Slytherin has no particular advantages in that respect.

Is it that hard to believe that it's simply the case that Salazar Slytherin, for all his achievements, wasn't actually a very good person and valued the wrong things in himself and in other people? That he perpetuated these bad values through his influence on Hogwarts?
