My headcanon is that House Points only really matter to first/second years and prefects, all of whom are worried about impressing their teachers. Ask most older students if they'd rather win the House Cup or the Quidditch Cup, and they'll look at you like you have leeks coming out of your ears. "Quidditch Cup, obviously."
