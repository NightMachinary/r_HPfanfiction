I could see a way that House points and the House Cup matter... perhaps everyone in a house who won the cup gets a chevron on their robes as a status symbol like a varsity jacket in high school.

ETA: There really should've been a reward system in the school for House points i.e. if you get the most amount of points in a week in your house and year, you get a slightly later curfew. Rewards could go up to a free visit home with your family or some completely unsupervised free time with your SO/parents/friends in a special room.
