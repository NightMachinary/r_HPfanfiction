In short: yeah, basically.

JKR just failed in worldbuilding on the small scale. Most of the large concepts, like Hogwarts as a school, the Statute of Secrecy, magical government, etc. are perfectly fine. She failed and fails, however, in details (most notoriously her nonexistent math skills). Is Hermione's middle name Jane or Jean? Is the Trace supposed to be location based or wand based? Why the hell do house points matter to students so god-damned much!?

The comparison that popped in my addled head is that she wanted to make the best sandwich in the world. She got the meats and other ingredients, came up with a plan, then wound up making a PBJ somehow.

Like I said, addled, but hopefully you get what I mean.
