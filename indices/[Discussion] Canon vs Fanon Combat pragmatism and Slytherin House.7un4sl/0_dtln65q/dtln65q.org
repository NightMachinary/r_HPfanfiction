There isn't room for good people from Slytherin in Rowling's black and white +universe+ narrative. The story that Rowling wanted to write couldn't afford to get bogged down in details like that. Especially in the earlier books that were written more toward younger audience, shades of grey would have taken away from the themes of heroism and love conquering all.

As an example, it wouldn't surprise me to learn Moody was sorted Slytherin. Slughorn, someone presented in a less than flattering light that he himself cultivates, wound up dueling Voldemort himself. Just because loyal/brave Slytherins aren't spotlighted doesn't mean they don't exist.

Combat scenes with intelligence have the same problem. If the story had been about action Dumbledore wouldn't have spent the entire of sixth year talking about history. Instead the focus was on Tom Riddle's psychology and allowing Harry to absorb knowledge that would let him win the battle before even stepping up to duel. I personally enjoyed that being a Dumbledore-level wizard wasn't about throwing the biggest magical nukes; it was about exploiting weaknesses and having more information than the opponent.

There are currently 782,000 Harry Potter stories on ffnet alone. Rowling had 7, the first few of which had to be K+. Fanon has a lot more space to do all the things and I think it's a little unreasonable to expect canon to accomplish the same things. Expanding on what's there is why fanfiction exists, after all.
