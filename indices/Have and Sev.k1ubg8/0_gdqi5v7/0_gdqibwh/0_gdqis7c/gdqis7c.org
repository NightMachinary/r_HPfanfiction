Again, I can think of a lot of fics that have this going on - Sirius freaking out when Harry calls Snape "dad" is kind of a Severitus classic chapter.

The one I can think of that has the most conflict between Harry&Sev and Sirius, with Remus broadly neutral if I remember right, is A Brother To Basilisks, where Sirius literally cannot accept anything about Harry's life. Even if that's not the one on your mind, I think you might like it based on what you're looking for.
