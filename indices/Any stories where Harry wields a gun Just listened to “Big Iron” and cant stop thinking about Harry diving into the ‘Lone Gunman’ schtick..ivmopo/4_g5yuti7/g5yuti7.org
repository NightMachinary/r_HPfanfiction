There's a whole movie like that, [[https://harrypotterwithguns.com]] . It got taken down from youtube but copies are still floating around and should be findable with a bit of effort. People who watched the whole thing say it's hysterically funny all the way through. I thought the trailer was very funny but am not into movies enough to want to sit through 2 hours of even a good one, usually.

Harry with a gun and other Muggle weapons shows up in HPMOR but might not be what you are looking for. If it is, then there's a spin-off fic "Alastor Moody and the Methods of Engineering" that has more of it.
