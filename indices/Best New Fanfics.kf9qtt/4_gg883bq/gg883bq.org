Found a relatively good one today: !linkffn(Magical Creatures Will Get Me Killed (Again) by Anubis Enfield) It's about an reincarnated muggle veterinarian into the body of a young pureblood, whose father has made a fortune of of illegally raised creature parts, goes through all 7 years, complete with attempted ways to change the plot, with /gasp/ things not going perfectly for the characters like every other time travel story I know, 5.6/7 pretty good, not perfect.
