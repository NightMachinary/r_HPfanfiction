Linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) technically started at the end of last year, but it's close enough. It's one of the best fics I've read in a long time, and might be the best SI/fix-it fic. It's basically the story of one responsible adult who takes the uselessness of all the other adults personally, and injects a healthy dose of competence into everyone around him. The author is also British and loves to inject real British culture into the story, which makes it feel more authentic.

His other fic, linkffn(No Fate by AndrewWolfe) is also shaping up to be very good, but it's also still in the first act, so the meat of the story hasn't really hit yet. It has a very consistent update schedule, which is always nice with incomplete fics.
