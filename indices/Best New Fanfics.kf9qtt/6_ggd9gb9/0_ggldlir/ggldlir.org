Dumbledore is a complicated character in my story. He is not the villain insofar as he is not a thief with his eyes on the Potter fortune who is constantly potioning or charming everyone to get his way. I don't like this kind of bashing. Voldemort is similarly not the cartoonishly evil character in my story that he is in canon. But Dumbledore is an /antagonist/. His motives are explained and he honestly feels sorrow for what he feels is his duty, but I always had the impression that Albus suffered from a particularly strong brand of paternalism.
