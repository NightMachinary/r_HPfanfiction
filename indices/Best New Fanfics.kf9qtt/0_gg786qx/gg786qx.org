[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011][Ouroburus]] has become an instant favourite. It's definitely darker than what I presume most people's taste would be but considering the main characters are Voldemort, it wouldn't be realistic otherwise. The writing is great but the characterisation is the real treat. I don't think I've come across a better characterisation of Voldemort in all my (many) years of reading fanfiction. It's almost a shame I know quite a few people will be put off by the main pairing because it's just such a fantastic story. Also, Walburga ❤️ Never did I think I would develop such a soft spot for Walburga Black.

(If you haven't read Six Pomegranate Seeds I would also highly encourage you to read that one! Have read it through a number of times because I enjoy it so much)
