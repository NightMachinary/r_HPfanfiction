I agree. People here recommend the same old fics, over and over and over again. I almost never find anything new on this sub.

I really liked linkffn(If not for Umbridge) - a well written Daphne and a cool/unique Tracey.

linkffn(A different kind of war) is a more serious fic, sometimes a bit tense, but has really amazing and snappy dialogue.

linkffn(Dance of Death) and linkffn(Casting Shadows) are a two-part series that has the best take on the 'scar!crux' I've ever seen in HP fics.

I'm also partial to my own (big surprise there lol) story, linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

PS: I've heard great things about your fic on discord, but haven't started it myself. Is yours finished? How close are you?
