There was a crack fic where he thinks that he is dreaming and utterly destroys Voldemort, repeatedly. From what I remember it starts with Luna having a good time with Harry and he just imaging's that he is dreaming as it wont happen in reality.

I will look for it but I dont remember if it was a full fic or a ficlet.
