If I can do a self rec?

Linkao3(the might of the architect by tinyporcelainehorses)

This is a founders era adventure fic. It will have eventual f/f romance, but that's going to be very much a bonus rather than the main focus. It has two viewpoint characters/protagonists, one male, one female, and switches between them every two to three chapters. (The first two chapters are from the male protagonists POV though).

Hope that scratches the itch you have if you decide to check it out!
