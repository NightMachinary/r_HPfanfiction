#+begin_quote
  Audrey Causey is learning how to navigate a chaotic new world as she copes with what she has seen and done during the war as part of a resistance cell. She will meet new people, work to restore peace and have to decide what kind of life she wants to have now that the fighting has ended. But picking up the pieces is never glamorous, it is thankless and not a burden most would choose to bear. Meanwhile, dark forces in the shadows conspire against Audrey, her family and the new world she helped fight for.
