linkao3(Weasley Girl by Hyaroo)

Also on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]

Essentially, Ron Weasley was born a girl. Now I usually don't read any AU's, especially genderbend, but this is the exception. The author is ridiculously good at for want of a nail things, the small changes that expand into a full-blown enjoyable butterfly effect. For example, in the first book (The Leapling, the short one-shot prelude can be read anytime) we are shown that she has taken a fact from canon, that animals seem to really love Ron, and made it into 'Ronnie's' gimmick, so she's a bit similar to Charlie in that aspect, and the author takes away her chess skills to compensate. Another thing, she ends up leaving Scabber's with Ginny so she wouldn't be lonely, setting up an interesting plot point for later discussion.

Anyways, Harry is the protagonist I suppose, but Ronnie is a strong deuteragonist and in the second book (Secrets of the Past) she gets to take the lead. Rated K+ in the first, T in the second because it's told in Ronnie's point of view and "the girl likes to swear", much like canon Ron.

There are no pairings (aside from the married canon couples) and the main story is focused on action and mystery, with a bit of slice-of-life; essentially the same as the early books. Ginny also has her canon crush, but it doesn't do much to hinder her awesomeness, and by the end of Secrets of the Past she can talk to him like a normal person. However, don't read if you're homophobic, got it? I won't spoil it, but even after romance takes a backseat and is solely brought up.

About one to two spelling/grammar mistakes a chapter, but they're barely noticeable and I'll let it slide since each chapter is usually 10,000 words or more.

Hope this helps!
