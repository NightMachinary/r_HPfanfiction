That would be the darkest, most twisted dystopian world I have had the (dis?)pleasure of reading. I loved it!

Many of its themes are extremely controversial, which is why you'll see many people disagreeing about it. Like it or not, it's extremely well written.

(Just had an argument about this fic not long ago, so:) I think that all these themes make sense within the world-building, but I'll list the warnings anyway.

Misogyny, misandry, harems, kids that have to be too sexual too early, many phallic themes.

Apparently I can't link it, so (all on ffn):
