You made me remember a dead story (I think) about a SI as Draco,it seemed like crack at the begginning with the MC having Dobby raid weed dealers and using that weed to rapidly improve in learning magic, even making hermione smoke it for some reason but things went tits up when Voldemort found out, forcing the MC to smoke with him (hilariously creepy lol), got very edgy very fast.

PM or whatever if you know the story pls!
