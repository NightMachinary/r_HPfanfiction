Thank you very much! Try searching for "Sir lucifer morningstar" in ffn.com He wrote some good novels, one on Naruto, another on DC, both of them are really good for reading when you are tired of sob stories and mercifful mc's... In the DC one, mc literraly steals pantie's and says, "Remember this day, that [bad guy name] stole your panties. Remember it, and despair." And then walks off.
