Try Child of The Storm. It starts out fairly rough but quickly grows into its own. The basic idea behind the fic is that Thor was incarnated as a mortal before his glorified sight seeing trip to New Mexico. He was born as James Potter. He lived the Canon life. But upon his death his spirit returned to Asgard. He had his memory sealed by Odin and Harry grew up with the Dursleys. The action scenes and character development are top notch. As is the world building.
