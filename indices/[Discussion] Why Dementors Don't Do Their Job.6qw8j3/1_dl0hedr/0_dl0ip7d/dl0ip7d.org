Certainly. (Crouch Jr.'s escape, which is prior to Sirius's, does strike me as an example of Dementors slacking off, though. Since they absorb memories, I find it unlikely they didn't see the difference between the true and fake Barty.)

I'm mostly on board with Explanation 1, usually; this theory, however, is that the Dementors, the crafty devils, were playing a double game: if Voldemort won, they were free from Azkaban and could scour the world, Kissing at will; but if Voldemort was defeated, all the escaped Death Eaters would be brought back to be Kissed, making this is a winning situation either way. Of course, accounting for Dementors not being very clever, they didn't count on the fact that once the Ministry was victorious, it would no longer employ them for having temporarily served the Dark Lord.
