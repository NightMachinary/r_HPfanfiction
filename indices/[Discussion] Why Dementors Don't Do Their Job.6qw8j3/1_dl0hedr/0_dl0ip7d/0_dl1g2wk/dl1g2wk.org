I look at Dementors as intelligent sharks, essentially.

Imagine knowing that a 19' shark could understand you. Imagine meeting up with one (or many), and attempting to strike a deal with them. What on earth could you offer them?

I think the only way you could keep these beasts in line is to threaten them with giant nets, and harpoon guns. Force them to stay in restricted waters where they are /allowed/ to feed at your pleasure.

So here comes some guy who's like "hey boys, just letting you know, I'm taking over the government soon and if you join me, you can roam free and unchecked again. Just don't attack me or my dudes, cool?"

That's my interpretation of it anyway.
