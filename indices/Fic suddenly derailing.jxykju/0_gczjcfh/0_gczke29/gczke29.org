Thanks, that helps somewhat! I probably shouldn't have read those depressive! ADHD! Remus Lupin headcanon beforehand (whole gang had various sorts of ADHD, Sirius has anger issues on top of it, and a thing about lying, so he kinda snaps HARD at discovering that, while he had told Remus everything, Remus had callously lied to him each month), so I sort of went 'well, they would all try to comfort him at first, but something has to be done about that conflict, otherwise it'll never get resolved.' Also helps that it provides a solid motivation for thinking their best friend is a spy, if he is known for being a terrific liar who has lied to them before, while Sirius hadn't.
