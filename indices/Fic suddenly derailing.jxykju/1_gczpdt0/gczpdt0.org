At first I really enjoyed "Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce"... it was a really feel-good comfy story about friendship and getting over the house barriers through cooking. Then all of a sudden the author wants to make a political statement or something and all the characters are gay, bi or trans and their whole identity revolves around that.
