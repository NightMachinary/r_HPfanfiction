Applies to everyone yet he keeps getting defeated. Especially with Zhujiu like wtf. I remember when I started watching the drama I asked my friend if he was that annoying in the book too and she said he didn't exist in the book and I was like, that makes so much sense. And Zhao Yunlan is so badass in the book but in the drama he only knows how to shoot a gun...

The alarm moment was üòç And the look Dr. Cheng gave him, she was so onto them. Zhu Yilong as Yezun is also just phenomenal. Have you seen the deleted scene where he kills Shen Wei's female student (the one who went on that trip with them)?

Oh SPL didn't get through the first round of censorship? Damn. But HYX did, right? I get the feeling it'll be out soon-ish?
