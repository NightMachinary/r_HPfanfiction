lmao you really took the words right out of my mouth. ðŸ˜­ The drama plot was a bit of a trainwreck. Like, what especially bothered me is that scene with the fire user, it's obvious Shen Wei was stronger than him. He's the Black Cloaked Envoy for goodness sake, but somehow that guy was able to get away?? It really didn't make any sense. They kept nerfing Xiao Wei whenever the plot required it, istg if it weren't for those sweet moments like that part where Zhao Yunlan had an alarm for Shen Wei's first class when they went to see a doctor, I probably would've dropped tha drama. Zhu Yilong and Bai Yu are our saviors lol. Love them <3

Definitely! Haven't read spl yeat, but I heard they didn't get through the first round of censorship? Meanwhile 2haists (including me) are still clowning themselves waiting for hyx. ðŸ¤¡
