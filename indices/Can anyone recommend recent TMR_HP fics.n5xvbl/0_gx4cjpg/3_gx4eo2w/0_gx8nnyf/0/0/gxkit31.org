Omg you should read the novel! It's phenomenal and has spoiled me for danmei. Oh the drama minus the main cast was awful LOL. It's like that "look how they massacred my boy" meme - but at least we had Zhu Yilong's Shen Wei and Bai Yu's Zhao Yunlan. I understand the budget and censorship limitations but they butchered the plot and made WeiLan so much weaker ðŸ˜¤ And made it a BE for no reason...as with SHL. They hate priest, I swear. Are you going to watch Winner Is King/Sha Po Lang when it comes out?

My SHL friend got up at 7am to stream and wants to buy some photobooks from the concert. I admire that level of dedication. I really can't get up early xD
