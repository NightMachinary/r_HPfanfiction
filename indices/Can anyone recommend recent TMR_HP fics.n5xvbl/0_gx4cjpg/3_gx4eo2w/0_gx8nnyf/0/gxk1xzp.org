Yepp, I know Guardian. I haven't gotten the chance to read the novel, but I watched the drama. ðŸ˜­The drama could've used more work lol but I understand that their budget was cut. I stayed for Zhao Yunlan, Shen Wei, ðŸ¥ºand our wonderful SID peeps. I've also seen people who like MDZS but not any other danmei. I got into danmei because I was looking for japanese light novels but then fell into the world of chinese bl. I didn't read MXTX's works until later. The day 1 performace of tian ya ke is so iconic. ðŸ˜Œ
