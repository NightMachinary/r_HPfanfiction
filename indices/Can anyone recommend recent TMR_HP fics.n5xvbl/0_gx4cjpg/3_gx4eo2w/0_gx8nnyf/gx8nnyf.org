No problem, I hope you like them!

I'm not sure if you know Guardian but that was my gateway into danmei and my true love and I was disappointed but not surprised there's no subreddit for it. I'm just happy there's a SHL sub at all. I hope it keeps growing! I've seen quite a few HP fans into MDZS/Untamed (which I've never read/watched) but not anything else for danmei. Ah the concert, I haven't had a chance to check it out but I saw some clips on twitter. Them singing TYK has me ðŸ¤§
