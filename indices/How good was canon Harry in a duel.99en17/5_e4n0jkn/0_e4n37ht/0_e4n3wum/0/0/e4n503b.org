I referred to his escape from the Death Eaters, not his duel with Voldemort. He managed to incapacitate a few of them as well as escape while also avoiding all their spells. Also, the Shield Charm is not a basic part of dueling, it's actually a hard spell. In HBP, Fred and George even mention how most people can't do the charm, which is why their shield hats were so popular at their shop.
