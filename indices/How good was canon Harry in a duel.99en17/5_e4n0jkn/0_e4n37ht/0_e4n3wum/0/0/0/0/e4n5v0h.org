If there was no skill involved anyone could take on a Death Eater, which we know they cannot do. Most wizards flee at the mere sight of the dark mark. You do realize not everyone gets into year 6 DADA, right? You have to at least get an EE on the OWL. And Fred and George directly say most wizards cannot do a Shield charm.

Most adult wizards were below Harry in dueling Death Eaters. The ones who weren't were either exceptional on their own (like Tonks, who was an Auror) or they had been in the last War (Lupin, Sirius, etc.)
