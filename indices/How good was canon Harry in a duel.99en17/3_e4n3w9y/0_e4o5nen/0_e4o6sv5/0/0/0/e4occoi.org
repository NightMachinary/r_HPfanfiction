While that was really intended as a morbid joke (I couldn't work in a good veil reference, sadly), I'm not sure I buy the Bella one. She's always presented as being just notches below the Dumbledore-Voldemort level (she even blocks some of Dumbledore's spells if I recall). By all rights she should have lost much more than Sirius, who had an Animagus form to blunt some of the Dementors drain. But alas, it's not mentioned...
