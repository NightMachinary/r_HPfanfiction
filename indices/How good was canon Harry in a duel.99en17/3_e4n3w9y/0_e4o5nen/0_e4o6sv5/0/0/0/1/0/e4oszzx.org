Only the Unforgivables require negative emotions (emotions in general are not necessary for spellcasting). Bella is not devoid of positivity, nor is Sirius's spellcasting literally limited by his moral alignment (he's obviously going to choose not to cast certain spells). But people highly skilled at defense against the dark arts are also skilled at the Dark Arts. Harry didn't have any trouble casting a very dark spell on Draco, Sectumsempra, for instance.
