Well, there're several things in Bella's favor. First, dementors eat positive emotion, and the dark arts are fueled by negative. Building off this, Sirius is somewhere in the neutral greys in alignment terms to Bella's definite dark alignment, so it's reasonable to assume his arsenal is smaller, or he at least has less master of the dark arts. Third, and this is purely head canon, Bella probably practiced High Black Magic to some extent, and I think that would build up some sort of tolerance to the aura of constructs made of black magic.
