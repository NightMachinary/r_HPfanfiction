Sadly the entire series is filled with plot holes. Warning though for anyone who points them out in some areas of reddit.

Everyone on Voldemort side who came out of Azkaban retained all or some of their sanity. Would love to know how that happened. Maybe Bella has 0 happy memories and thus is unaffected by dementors. Maybe Voldemorts union with Dementors carried on through the lull in the "war" and the dark mark acted as a beacon to avoid.
