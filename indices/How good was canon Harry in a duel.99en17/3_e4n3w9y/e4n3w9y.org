Most of the adults are completely incompetent at anything at all.

Harry has almost 0 experience dueling anybody. He has a couple of scuffles that's it.

Book 1 he doesn't duel anybody. He touches Quirrell. Book 2 he "duels" Malfoy. That duel consists of getting hit with a weak expelliarmus and then sending a weak one in return. And then the snake bit. Later in the scary underground chamber He throws his wand away. Book 3 had the dementors and Sirius Black. He doesn't duel at all. Shows 1 good patronus the entire book. Book 4 he and Draco cast 1 spell apiece at one another. Doesn't show anything special I still besides flying in the 1st task. He goes to the graveyard and his 'duel' with Voldemort is Harry being hilariously out classed (although understandable). Voldemort toys with him until the plot armor hits.

Book 5 he shows some talent but to be honest it's more about the death eaters being adults and therefore morons in the prophecy hall. Book 6 shows a little skill vs Draco and none vs Snape. Book 7 Harry shows some skill but not anywhere near incredible or prodigal skill vs the death eaters in the coffee shop, no skill vs the snatchers or at Malfoy Manor. He's nonexistent in the battle of Hogwarts and won because the wand against him was his.

In short Harry is nothing special or brilliant. None of the students at Hogwarts are special or brilliant at dueling. Saying Harry is the best dueler at Hogwarts is equal to being the best in the local county show.
