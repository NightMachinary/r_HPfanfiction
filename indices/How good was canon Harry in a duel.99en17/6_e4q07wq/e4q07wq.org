I think he's pretty good. I might be biased cos he's my favorite character, but still. He'd had to be good at dodging (at the very least) since he was a young child because of Dudley and his gang. So from that, we know he's athletic and has good reaction times. This is only supported by him being a great seeker. He held his own in every duel he was in. 15 yr old Harry survived (and barely got injured, if at all) facing off against several death eaters. He was faster than Draco in HBP. He won against the DEs in the beginning of Deathly Hallows, and later against the Malfoys and Bellatrix. Lost against the Snatchers, though. Didn't sustain any injuries during BoH (if you don't count dying lol) among all the chaos. He'd also fought against magical creatures when he had to. All in all, I think he was absolutely capable of matching (and besting) average Death Eaters and wizards; he was raised to fight bc it was a necessity.
