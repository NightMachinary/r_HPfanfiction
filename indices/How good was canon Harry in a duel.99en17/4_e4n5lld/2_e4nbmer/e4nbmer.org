I always assumed the Patronus was something that was impressive /because of his age./

Like, I'm assuming it's something that's a little tricky for an adult to do, but mostly because it requires practice, an esoteric casting mechanism (happy thought), and is almost completely useless in daily life.

Like it's if you knew a 13 year old who could play the piano blindfolded. It's not a crazy feat for a trained adult, but pretty rare in a kid.
