Well since you are talking about 5th book on, he was average. JK swapped away from him being powerful at book 4, and that he would only be amazing at seeker and DADA because that was already established. 5th book on was him being average and exceedingly lucky in almost everything.

I mean, the Patronus was a post NEWT spell that took a lot of power and was something most adults couldn't do, yet he mastered it in the 3rd book driving off a large number of Dementors. Suddenly, in book 5, everyone can do it.
