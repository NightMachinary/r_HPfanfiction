I see the word average. You need to be more clear. The 'average' wizard has little to no skill in dueling. Why would they? Its not like bureaucrats in government need to be able to fight.

Harry needs to be able to fight. Even in his first year people were trying to kill him. Harry has far, far more incentive than anyone else to study defence. Average witches and wizards want to avoid touching cursed objects and that's probably about it. They don't know anything about duelling because they've never had the incentive to. Maybe muggleborns who were at Hogwarts while Voldemort was around might be a bit above average but they're no aurors.

Harry has more reason than anyone, and possibly more skill from what we saw in defence than anyone in his year. He has more practical experience after stuff like the Triwizard. That experience amounts to nothing compared to an auror or hit-wizard who are likely better educated, better trained and have more experience. If you're fighting dark wizards you don't do it half-hearted, Harry lacks experience, he lacks knowledge. He might have 'talent' but some people will say talent is a myth. Personally I think that's bullshit but its hard for talent to overcome experience and knowledge.

How good is an average Death Eater? Well we don't know. Who were they before they became death eaters? What else do they do? Why didn't the aurors catch them? We know that Evan Rosier went head-to-head against Moody in what was likely Moody's prime. Moody killed Rosier but lost a chunk of his nose doing so. Was he average or more talented? If he could hurt Moody he'd probably destroy Harry.

Look at the books, was Harry and the lot at the Ministry safe because they could defend themselves or because they had the prophecy and it couldn't be damaged? Did they ever fight or did they just run. Would you call what happened dueling or just chaos?

In sixth year Snape basically plays with Harry. We know he had a fetish for dark magic and was an active Death Eater in the late seventies but how many other Death Eaters does that describe? We know Snape wanted the Defence job and we know he was talented in potions but how much experience did he have? We just don't know.

In Harry Potter knowledge tends to correlate with skill to a large point. Grindelwald, Dumbledore and Voldemort were all the brightest most talented wizards of their ages in their schools. Hermione on the other hand was one of the first to go down in the DoM fight. Harry seems to be better than Hermione in combat. Is he more knowledgeable in defence or do we look at what Hermione said in the first book. 'books, and cleverness, there are more important things.' She lists friendships and bravery as two. We know from the patronus charm and Bellatrix's description of the unforgivables that some spells you need to mean, a mental or emotional part. Perhaps Harry sits in an emotional sweetspot where as Hermione is too detached? We know its not about being a good person or else Voldemort wouldn't have the same talent but there appears to be a special quality that great wizards have.
