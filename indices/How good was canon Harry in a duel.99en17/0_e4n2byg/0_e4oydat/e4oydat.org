  In sixth year Snape basically plays with Harry. We know he had a fetish for dark magic and was an active Death Eater in the late seventies but how many other Death Eaters does that describe? We know Snape wanted the Defence job and we know he was talented in potions but how much experience did he have? We just don't know.

Wasn't Snape inside Harry's head anticipating all his attacks in that fight? IMO, a competent legilimens could roflstomp pretty much any non-occlumens in a one-on-one duel.
