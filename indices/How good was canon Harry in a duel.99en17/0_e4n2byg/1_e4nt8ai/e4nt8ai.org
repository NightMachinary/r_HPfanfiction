  I see the word average. You need to be more clear. The 'average' wizard has little to no skill in dueling. Why would they? Its not like bureaucrats in government need to be able to fight.

Huh, that seems strange to me. As a Muggle, I am well versed in the ancient and noble art of Muggle fighting, even if I'm just a paper pusher. It's practically a job requirement, and it's a skill I use most every day. I'm not sure why it would be different for wizards.
