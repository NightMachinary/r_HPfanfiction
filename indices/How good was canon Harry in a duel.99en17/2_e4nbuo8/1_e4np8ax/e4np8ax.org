Seconding this. One of his first descriptors is that he is faster than he looks. He can dodge things and he can draw his wand pretty fast. We know from him being a great Seeker that his reflexes are good. If he's better than his opponant at both those things, then he can probably escape a duel. If his opponant can cast their spell faster, though, then I don't see Harry winning. At least before he trains more anyway.
