Decent. He's athletic, and he's practiced. He doesn't know many esoteric spells, and he doesn't have the sheer breadth of tactics that Dumbledore and Voldemort do. But he's pretty good at pointing a stick, shouting /Stupefy!/ and dodging.

Which sounds like faint praise, but in a regular battle that will win you 90% of fights.
