Boy, do I have a list for you! I haven't read Coven either unfortunately, but I'm a huge Snape nerd. It's nearly all I read and write about. These are Snily and OC except for one Snarcissus. Hopefully you'll find something you like.

1st favorite: A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles

We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view. (Paired with an OC, but that storyline is minor.)

2nd favorite: The Long Road Home -- Snily Voldemort chooses Neville but the Potters do not escape unscathed. Five years later, Lily Potter walks back into Severus Snape's life. Things are about to get complicated. AU Severus/Lily. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/The-Long-Road-Home]]

3rd favorite: Too Deep for the Healing -- OC

This story begins where Snape's story ends in canon: In the Shrieking Shack. Severus Snape survives the war - but which Snape? Who is he in the new circumstances? Some things will never be the same again. Other things, however, do not change so easily.

Miles to Go Before I sleep -- Snape/OC This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8090116/1/Miles-to-Go-Before-I-Sleep]]

Severus Snape and the Art of War -- Snily After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world.

If Someone Cared Enough -- Snily What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

Who We Are -- OC, one shot

Alexis is a muggle who lives across the street from Severus Snape. (Chronicles their relationship throughout twenty years) Warning: Slight domestic abuse

Cauldrons and Lilies -- Snily

"This train will take you where you have to be. Severus, listen to me, this is a rare occasion." Albus held his shoulders and he realized he was shorter than the headmaster. That couldn't be, he'd been taller than Albus ever since he was nineteen and finally stopped growing.

Veritas Omnia Vincit

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.
