Haha! Ok I have consulted my list, and here are The Snapes! In no particular order.

First, here is a shorty one-shot, which actually fits into your female OC main request!

Alexis is a muggle who lives across the street from Severus Snape. (Chronicles their relationship throughout twenty years) Warning: Slight domestic abuse

​

Ok so this is my delightful friend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8598867/Animalium][Animalium]], who mainly focuses on Snape (her fave).

My fave of hers is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088244/1/Wormwood-and-Asphodel][Wormwood and Asphodel]]

Not only did Harry survive the attack of Lord Voldemort, but Lily did as well. While grieving over the loss of her husband, she reconnects with a certain potions master who vows to make amends. Enacting their revenge on Lord Voldemort, they find one another as they once were. They rekindle a love they never thought possible amidst a war that threatens to tear them apart.

But her profile is just full of awesome Snilys! She is currently working on this 1st person Sev POV which is doing an amazing exploration of chronic pain.

Severus made a grave mistake by joining Lord Voldemort and he paid for it with his body. Lily lost the man she loved to the war, James Potter. With both of them missing pieces of their lives they find themselves relying on each other. Chronic illnesses, sick!Severus

Here is another absolutely glorious one (if you don't mind James/Sirius bashing):

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

She also has a Sevmione which is also really good, and another Snily I haven't read yet, but it is on my short list. She is an awesome writer!

​

Here is the Snape/Ginny I mentioned for easy access :)

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

​

Here is another Snily --- I just started it and I'm only 8 chapters in, but so far it is INSANELY good! The writing is amazing.. like poetry. Stargirl (who wrote speaking in tongues) recommended it to me, so I was like yes please!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle][Puzzle]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/531023/we-built-the-shadows-here][we-built-the-shadows-here]]

Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world by ruled the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James. COMPLETE

Ok this one is a little different and Sev is in-character about I would say half the time, but it is bloody hilarious. Also full of lemons. :P

An American muggle from the year 2022 ends up in a pub in England in 1992, and meets Severus Snape. Somehow she knows everything about him, and he is determined to find out why.

​

And have you read The Changeling??? Snape is Ginny's mentor in that, and she's a strong female OC! :) It's like my favorite fanfic ever, and it has 3 sequels! (The gift that keeps on giving).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/763509/Annerb][Annerb]]

Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

​

OK! If you actually read all these, I think they may well keep you occupied for several weeks! lol.

But what the heck, I'll give you mine too cause it has one Snape chapter and I have no self control! XD

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.

​

Ok I am out of Snapes that I have personally read and remember fondly... though if you would like, Animalium can supply you with many more. She keeps going on about something called "The Long Road Home" and something called "The Snape Chronicles" or some such, and supposedly they are both amazing but they're long so I haven't gotten to them yet. I can ask her for links if you'd like though! I think they are all on FFN.
