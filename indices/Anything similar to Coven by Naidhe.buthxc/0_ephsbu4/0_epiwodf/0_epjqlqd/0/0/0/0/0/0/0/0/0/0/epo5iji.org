Ah! Not that you need anything else to read for a good year, but I just realized I have another perfect story for you! :D

​

This is set during Hogwarts Mystery time if you're not opposed to that (playing the game not needed to follow), and it's halfway through being a full 7 year fanfic. It's lovely, has a strong female lead, and Snape features in it quite a bit as her mentor! I've actually been betaing in from somewhere in the beginning of year 4, I can't believe I forgot about it! xD

Athena Lockhart is haunted by the disappearance of her brother Jacob. With everyone thinking she's cursed too and the foul Merula Snyde willing to make her life at Hogwarts a living hell, can she survive school, find the Cursed Vaults and find out what happened to her brother? With some magic and the help of loving friends, everything is possible.
