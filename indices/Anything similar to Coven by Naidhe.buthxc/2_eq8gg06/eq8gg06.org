I just finished reading Coven and am now also looking for similar fics. You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1844462/1/The-Twenty][The Twenty]], which also focuses on Hermione and Pansy. It's been a while since I read this, but I remember it as being great. I also really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/][The Reclamation of Black Magic]], which features a Coven. Both have strong female characters, but you might already know them. Hope I could help!
