When a Shakespeare society casts a female Hamlet they are doing it because they want to see something different from a story they've heard a thousand times. The same is true for any other trait. Slytherin/Genius/Indy Harry are the same way, how does a change impact the story?

In the case of Desi Harry, did the Dursley's mistreat him more? Did other people ignore it easier because he was brown? What does Harry look for when he learns about his parents? A different wedding photo, different traditions. Maybe he can learn about Fleamont and Euphemia travelling over from India (in places where it breaks canon you patch up the holes with more ideas). How does Harry interact with the Patils? Do they expect him to know about his heritage or do they help him out. How does this change the Yule Ball? What is magic like in India? I doubt it's Latin based, do they have different spells and potions? Harry usually likes DADA, so are there differences in duelling? Are there unique dark creatures? What if that's why Harry's a parseltongue since there are more snakes in India? (Bloodline traits being strengthened by a muggleborn aligns with Tonks). What other characters have similar experiences by travelling to Britain? Even if there isn't a system of racism, could there also be regular stumbling blocks? Is Umbridge an even bigger bitch?

And actually a good 70% of the story has completely 0 changes. Voldemort is still the bad guy, and Harry still goes to Hogwarts.

I think the problems you mention start with Rowling. For example, why is Dean black? Where in the text does it explore that in any way? Why is Cho Asian?

Stories that make Poc Harry explicit usually try explore that in some way in the story, even if it's just a different outfit for the Yule Ball, or Harry reopens Potter Manor and it's got cool architecture. Lots of opportunities for storytelling.
