You can put it through culture as well as discrimination - it is part of the academic definition of ethnicity, after all. And that can go both ways. Exploring a character not raised in a culture exploring their heritage (eg. Indian Harry learns about India), or exploring how a character defies their heritage culture for whatever reason (eg. Maybe the Patils are Muggleborn and have super traditionalist parents, so there's some cultural conflict at home between the new Wizarding Cultures and the Older Traditional One.), or something else entirely.
