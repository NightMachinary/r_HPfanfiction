I don't think the fire was meant to stop him.

I think that all the “traps” were meant to be distractions that would have delayed anyone for as long as was possible without killing or even really harming them (which Tom---and thus also Quirinus---managed to bypass in his genius and blah blah how great he is), while also alarming Dumbledore and enabling him to collect the hapless thief. Because that would fit Dumbledore's style and it's the last one that is the true trap (can't get the stone if you came for the stone unless you know what to do) and the rest is just there to give an appearance of an attempt while also possibly stopping adventure seekers from getting too far.

And the stone was probably a fake from the very beginning; after all, none but Albus, Nicholas, and Perenelle have the means to reliably check if it's the real deal without setting up a potions or even alchemy lab, which simply wasn't a possibility for anyone who would try to get the stone.
