I agree with [[/u/Lord_Anarchy][u/Lord_Anarchy]]. He got in, he can get out.

 

It would be AU, but it would be neat to read a fit where the traps were just the first layer and a distraction, so that when Voldemort grabbed the stone it sets off the big time traps (a la Indiana Jones) like portkeying a nesting Horntail dragon into the room, unshrinking and dispersing a giant container of mustard gas or the classic: poison darts and giants boulders :)

 

Also, what would happen if he actually took the Elixer of Life? Would it react negatively due to the possession or horcruxes?
