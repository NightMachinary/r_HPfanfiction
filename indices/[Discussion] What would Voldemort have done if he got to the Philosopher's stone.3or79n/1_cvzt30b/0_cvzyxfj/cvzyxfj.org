Most likely the stone would be used to create an elixir that could be used in a resurrection ritual, or perhaps a resurrection ritual that sacrificed the stone itself.

I'm not sure about triggering another set of traps, though. That trigger would need to be person-specific, and the only way to do that would be to key it to Voldemort's magic, otherwise it would trigger when Harry gets it. If Dumbledore could do THAT, then he probably would have gotten that sample from an unsuspecting Quirrel, which means he would know it was Voldemort, and would be an asshole for not doing anything to boot him out of the school or capturing him.
