Agreed. I think the key is limiting his "omniscience". Dude's got a mastery in Transfiguration and is scholarly enough to keep up on a lot of magical theory. That's it.

If you want to keep the idea of another set of traps, maybe make it so a distinction isn't needed. Up the difficulty of the first set, seal off the third floor corridor entirely, make it so harry genuinely /wasn't supposed to be there/ but somehow got in anyway, maybe by tailing Quirrel while he dealt with everything. Then everything hits the fan and only Harry's extreme brand of luck keeps him alive.
