I don't think not-Moody altered Dumbledore's spell, I think he cast an entirely new Portkey spell on top of the present spells. It was still bespelled by Dumbledore to get through the wards, but it makes more sense than not-Moody intentionally giving Harry an escape.

Unless they had planned on returning Harry's corpse with the Cup, as some sort of "Welcome Back Voldemort" alert.
