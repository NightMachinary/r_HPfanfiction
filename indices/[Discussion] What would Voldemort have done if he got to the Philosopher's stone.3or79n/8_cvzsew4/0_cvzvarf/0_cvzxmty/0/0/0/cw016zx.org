My belief, and I think a common one, is that Dumbledore can make portkeys through Hogwarts protections as the headmaster. He made the Triwizard cup a portkey to take the winner to the stage when they touched it. However not-Moody altered the portkey to add a destination. Since it was still the headmasters portkey it worked, and that is why Harry ended up on the stage when he went back to Hogwarts instead of in the middle of the maze.

This isn't contested by anything we see in canon, and it ruins the horrible horrible horrible 'portkey kidnap' scenarios that people do sometimes. Also it gives a lot of credit to Voldemort, because if he just needed Harry to touch a portkey than the whole 4th contestant thing was a massive waste of time and resources.
