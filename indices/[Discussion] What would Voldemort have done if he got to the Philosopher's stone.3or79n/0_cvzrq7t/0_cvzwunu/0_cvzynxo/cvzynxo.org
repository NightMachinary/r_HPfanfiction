The fire very likely wouldn't have stopped him. It was a protection put up by Snape, and Voldemort is Snape's superior by multiple factors when it comes to arcane knowledge. A bit of black fire doubtfully holds much of an obstacle to him. From what I can tell, the Mirror and it's ensnaring properties (people have wasted away in front of it) were the main obstacle for Voldemort. If he gets past that, then he very well could have gotten out of the castle by the time Dumbledore got back.
