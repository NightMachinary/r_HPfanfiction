He isn't trapped by the black fire, the fire only springs up when there is someone in the potions room. He would just walk out of the mirror chamber, take the potion and return to the troll, etc.

I think the whole gambit of defenses was to lull him into a sense of security. I think the mirror was the only real defense, and it was intended to trap the person there. 'Wasted away in front of it'

This is my beef with most 'Dumbledore sets Harry up' stories, I'm pretty sure if Harry just goes to bed that night the result is the same. Voldemort can't get the stone from the mirror on his own, and he'll abandon Quirrels weak-ass body.
