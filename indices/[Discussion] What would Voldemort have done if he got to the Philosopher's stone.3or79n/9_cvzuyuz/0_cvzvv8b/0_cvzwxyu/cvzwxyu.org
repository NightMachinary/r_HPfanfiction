But these are the effects the stone would have on a normal wizard. Voldemort was living a half life as a kind of parasite on Quirrell. It wasn't clear but my understanding was that the elixir would have restored voldemort to the power and independence he enjoyed while he was at the height of his powers. If Quirrell was able to help create the elixir as an inside man, voldemort could theoretically be made strong enough to overpower the obstacle course.
