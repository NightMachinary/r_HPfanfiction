The stone doesn't make you immortal.

1) You still need to actually brew the "elixir of life", which is not something he was prepared for then and there (since there was no potion lab available)

2) The elixir only prolongs your life long as you keep taking it regularly. Once you stop you once again start dying. This is what happened with the Flamels.

3) The stone doesn't make you invincible/indestructible. It only prolongs your natural life.
