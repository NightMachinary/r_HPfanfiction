I'm not a writer (nor an editor for that matter) so feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt.

It comes across as choppy. You have a lot of very short sentences, and while it does make it sound more ominous in a way (which is what I'm assuming you're going for), some of the short sentences detract from how it flows. You also have several sentences that range from 'borderline run-on' to 'blatantly run-on;' getting rid of excess detail and wordiness in those would help with the flow as well.

You're also missing some commas/other punctuation. Some of the missing punctuation leave your work grammatically incorrect, while others would just help to make it easier understood.

This is the biggest piece of advice I have right now: work on the sentence structure. Rework the piece so it flows better and is easier to follow. I honestly had to read it twice, and I still am not completely sure what's it's about. If readers have to put in a lot of effort to figure out what you're trying to say - especially if it could have been reworded to be easier understood - it'll probably defer them from reading the whole thing.

Content wise: it seems creepy. I like that. It's obviously too early for me to know where you're going with the plot, but it seems like it could be quite interesting.
