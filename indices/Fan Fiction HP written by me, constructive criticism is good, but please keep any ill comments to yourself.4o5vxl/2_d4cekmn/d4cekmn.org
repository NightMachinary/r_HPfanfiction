tldr: You're trying to write maximum drama. You're trying to express that drama in your writing style, and it interferes with the reader's ability to understand what's going on. You are forgetting that the basis of storytelling is communication.

Beyond that, you have some other style issues and a decent amount of grammar to work on.

#+begin_quote
  "Wait." He said.
#+end_quote

But what did he say?! (You meant to write: "Wait," he said.)

And who is "he"?

How does he possess the power to interrupt the narrator? Wait, this isn't Ambush Bug, is it?

#+begin_quote
  He always had a way of knowing whether or not it was safe for us.
#+end_quote

You are mixing first and third person narration without proper framing. This is awkward, to say the least.

#+begin_quote
  "Continue."
#+end_quote

There's been no sign that anyone else is present. Nobody /does/ anything. Is the person alone? Telling the walls to wait and continue?

#+begin_quote
  The men in this room
#+end_quote

Oh, there /are/ people in the room. Only men, no women, for some reason. What reason is that?

They apparently didn't want to obey the speaker when he bade them continue.

#+begin_quote
  could not have all entered this room otherwise
#+end_quote

There's a mystical force preventing them from entering this specific room unless the end of tyranny is at hand?

#+begin_quote
  The door opened, and as planned they had received key.

  A slight pop was heard, and under no pretense or condition it stopped.

  Confusion erupted
#+end_quote

Everything you're writing is passive. You aren't talking about people. You're talking about things happening to, well, we're not really sure. Confusion and terror are breaking out, but we aren't informed who is confused.

#+begin_quote
  The phrase "Avada Kedavra" and all men fell at once
#+end_quote

From context, I gather that there are leaders who are falling, and I am guessing the dark lord is not falling. But with this phrasing, I have to take a moment to realize that it's just talking about these people and not all adult male humans.

#+begin_quote
  the world does not change so simply for a few good men as it must be repeated until all pieces are met correctly.
#+end_quote

This is incoherent.

#+begin_quote
  The world did not change that night but was moved ahead tenfold for the dark lord's reign of terror to continue.
#+end_quote

"Tenfold"? I do not think it means what you think it means.
