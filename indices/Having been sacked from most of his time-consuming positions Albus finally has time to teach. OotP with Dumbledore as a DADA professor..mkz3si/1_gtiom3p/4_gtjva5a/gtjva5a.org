According to the Crimes of Grindelwald (up to you if you consider it canon), he seems to have had the same teaching style like Lupin. My headcanon is that Voldemort also recruited the younger Death Eaters through a secret course of Dark Arts (Bellatrix sort of implies that he had taught them) and his prop was to demonstrate the Unforgivable Curses on spiders and then subject his pupils to the Imperius Curse to see who could break from it.

Sorry for the rambling... anyways to your point. It would be funny to have a senile Dumbledore in his old age who would constantly get distracted by ramblings against government, the youth of today, the amount of books he receives for Christmas. And when he is in a cheery mood he would go on and on and on talking about that time when he fought Grindelwald.
