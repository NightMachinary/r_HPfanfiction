I think you have a point, but at the same time, Dumbledore was an amazing teacher- from what we know anyway.

I think it would feel like he's gone senile, but by going off on tangents of real life events, the students would learn real world things.

I can see it being like a Mister Miyagi wax on wax off type of thing.

I can totally see a scene where a student uses a spell that seemed completely useless during the lesson, only for it to save their life. Just the pure, "oh my god, he's not nuts" would make me laugh.

Dumbles is a Transfiguration Master, he's gotta think outside of the box, so of course he's going to teach outside of it too.
