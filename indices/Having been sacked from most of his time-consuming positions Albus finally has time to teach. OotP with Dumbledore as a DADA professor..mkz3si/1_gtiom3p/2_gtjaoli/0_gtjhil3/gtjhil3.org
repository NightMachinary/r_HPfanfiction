I actually thought about your last line when I initially read the prompt! I pictured him hanging out with a couple of younger students to teach them how to use whatever their specialty is (potions, charms, etc.) to defend themselves, because that's how fights really are. He seems like a very hands on teacher if he had the chance to actually teach. (Honestly, people ignore Dumbledore's tragedy as well. Dude just wanted to hang out at Hogwarts but he kept having to fight dark lords bc he was so badass)
