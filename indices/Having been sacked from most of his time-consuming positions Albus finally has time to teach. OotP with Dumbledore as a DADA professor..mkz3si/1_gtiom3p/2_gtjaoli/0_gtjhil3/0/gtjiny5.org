Ah, a fellow intellectual!

I love the idea of someone throwing around potions like Oprah. "You get a potion! You get a potion! You get a potion!" His targets explode, melt, turn inside out, grow gills and asphyxiate. Just pure carnage! Then he can throw healing potions. Just imagine bleeding out only to get cracked over the head with a bottle and feeling right as rain right after, the possibilities are endless.

(And exactly! The dude just wanted to be normal but people won't leave him alone. Honestly, I kinda want a fic where he becomes a teacher to teach other people to lead the light so that he doesnt have to.)

"Yes... that could work. If I teach everyone to think and act for themselves, maybe even act like I'm losing my touch so that other people step up and do the work, maybe then I can finally retire and create my knitting club! Yes! Magnificent once again, Albus. I think I deserve a lemon drop..."
