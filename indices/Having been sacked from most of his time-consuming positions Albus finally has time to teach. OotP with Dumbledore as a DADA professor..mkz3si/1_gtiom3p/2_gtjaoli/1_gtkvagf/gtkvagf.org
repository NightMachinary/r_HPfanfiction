  I think you have a point, but at the same time, Dumbledore was an amazing teacher- from what we know anyway.

Was he, though? The only on-screen lessons we get from him were the Pensieve lessons in Book 6, and he dragged those out over the course of what's implied to be months when it could have been wrapped up in a matter of a couple hours or days.

Really, all it did was arbitrarily increase the length of the plot until the hunt for the locket in the cave coincided with Malfoy's plot to invade Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore.
