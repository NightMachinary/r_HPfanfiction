I think students like Hermione would HATE having him as a professor. He'd never follow the syllabus, have an informal grading system, and allow his students to bait him into story time instead of an actual lecture. You'd learn so much from him if he actually bothered teaching what he was supposed to that day, instead of getting distracted and lecturing on an Albanian weather charm because he looked out the window and saw rain.

(I love dumbledore, I just think he's a whimsical mess most of the time.)
