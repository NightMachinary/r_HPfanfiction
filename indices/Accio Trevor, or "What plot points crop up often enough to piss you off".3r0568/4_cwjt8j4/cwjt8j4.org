Can't quite muster the ranting bile for this, but...

Daphne Greengrass. In fanon, she's prettier than the rest, but cold-hearted with her icy-blue eyes shrouded by her [red/honeyblonde/ravenblack/just nothing like Hermione's] hair. She's smart and a pureblood but doesn't crow about it like others, because she's cool like that.

Riddle me this, Mary-Sue: if Daphne is all that and a bag of crisps, why in the magical world would /PANSY PARKINSON/ be the chief Heather in Slytherin for Harry's year? It's not because Pansy's better-looking or smarter or better-connected so you're telling me the proto-goddess Daphne just stepped aside because Draco favors Pansy? If Daphne appealed to Draco any more than Pansy did, do you think Pansy would count for anything?
