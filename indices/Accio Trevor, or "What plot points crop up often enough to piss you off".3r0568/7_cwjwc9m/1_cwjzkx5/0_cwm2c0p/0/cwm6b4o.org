More or less. I don't even think about how intricate the plot is going to be - if someone consistently misspells every name that is repeated dozens of times per book (like the Dursleys), then I almost immediately conclude that they're just a poor author.

It's nothing personal, and I try not to mean it in a bad way, it's just that my estimation of a person's writing drops extremely quickly when spelling and grammar aren't up to snuff.
