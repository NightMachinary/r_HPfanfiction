Same, there was a particularly long one I read where Harry and Hermione (but obviously not Ron) find out they're like super totally amazing in some way and now can't trust anyone, and suddenly they both had the amazing ability to /know/ that there was something fishy about the lemon drops, so they stopped eating them and Dumbledore was irritated/respected them more for seeing through his devious plot of handing out candies laced with stuff. I also remember a fic a long time ago that the lemon drops were actually made by Snape for Dumbledore to contain certain bits of potion depending on who he was giving them to. I can see it being a funny crack fic, but it didn't belong in a serious one.
