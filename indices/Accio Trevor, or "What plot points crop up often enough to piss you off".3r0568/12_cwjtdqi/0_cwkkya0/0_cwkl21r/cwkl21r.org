I'm actually being much more broad in my statement than just a Hogwarts rehash fic. I am genuinely just not interested in Hogwarts in any context, and don't really think it has any potential left.

If you know of a fic that explores Hogwarts in an interesting way, feel free to link it, hopefully it will change my mind.
