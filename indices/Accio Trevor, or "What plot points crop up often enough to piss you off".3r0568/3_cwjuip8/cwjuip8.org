I totally agree with you on those stupid heritage fics, OP, but Accio Trevor is actually canon. Harry does it in GoF while practicing summoning.

I really hate it when Dark!Harry pushes the Order of the Phoenix away. These guys are like his own personal bodyguards, if he's so smart, why would he push them instead of use them?

Also, when all Purebloods (except the Weasleys, of course) are portrayed as sophisticated, beautiful, rich and aristocratic, and able to easily cast powerful magic at age 11. The Malfoys, Blacks and Lestranges were the elite, not the norm among the Purebloods, and even they didn't own multiple castles or possessed a fleet of house-elves. There's a general Slytherin-wank in fanfiction that makes them out to be a Mary-Sue house, rather then a bunch of dumb kids like everyone else.
