  This one in particular is fucking amazing. Seriously, like half the fanon I subscribe to about Hogwarts comes from this fic. (Particularly Chapter 9)

  This one's sorta similar in terms of personality. Also Remus is awesome in it. It explains what he was doing while Harry was with the Dursleys.

  This one is... unique. That's the best way I can describe it. On an unrelated note, did you know Harry was the 5th founder of Hogwarts and the inventor of the inferii? Or that Voldemort can squeal like a 14 year old girl who's just seen Beiber? Oh, and this story has the cutest dementors ever.

  The prequel to the one above this. It starts out as your normal everyday Azkaban fic with the oh lordy why me pity party in my cell I have no friends thing with a side of bashing, but HOLY SHIT does that change.
