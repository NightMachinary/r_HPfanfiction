I think I might be thinking a bit darker than you're thinking. What I have in mind is the "I am Riddle's successor, time for my 11th Horcrux out of 13, that means I need to find a newborn baby and murder her in front of her mother with a few dozen crucios" instead of just a goddammit I hate Dumbledore maybe I'll try some blood magic or something type of dark.

The other disconnect could be because I don't really read political stories very much. Most of the ones I read are the "constant violence, main character's a fucking psychopath oh god he's killing us all" type of thing.
