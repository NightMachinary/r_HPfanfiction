I think you overdosed a bit on bad fanfiction, mate. I guess it depends on the story, but I don't see Dumbledore or Moody as danger to him, they are powerful allies, and the Order are competent and well connected enough to help him a lot. My point is: those fics usually try to portray him as intelligent and cunning and well-versed in politics, so he should be able to recognize how much he can profit from having the Order on his side.
