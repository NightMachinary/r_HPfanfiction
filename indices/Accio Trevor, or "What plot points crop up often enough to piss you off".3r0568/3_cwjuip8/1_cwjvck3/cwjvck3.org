  I really hate it when Dark!Harry pushes the Order of the Phoenix away. These guys are like his own personal bodyguards, if he's so smart, why would he push them instead of use them?

Issue with using them is that you have to deal with Dumbles and Moody on a regular basis, both of whom could be a danger if they notice how dark Harry's getting. If he eliminates them he's left with a fragmented group of mostly civies and a couple incompetent aurors running around like headless chickens. The only real benefit I see from keeping them is the Fideliused Grimmauld Place.

I agree with your point on the Slytherain wank though. It's kinda absurd sometimes.
