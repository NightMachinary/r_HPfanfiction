I think you misunderstand me. I don't mean they have to lose the overall conflict. Magical Britain completely falling to Voldemort is fucking depressing. I mean they can't keep just succeeding during the journey. If you can do all your spells perfectly, if everyone who is important loves you, if you never run out of money, if your enemies are bumbling idiots, then what is the conflict?

I'm just saying, there should be some sort of conflict, something that is such a challenge for the protagonist that he/she struggles with it.
