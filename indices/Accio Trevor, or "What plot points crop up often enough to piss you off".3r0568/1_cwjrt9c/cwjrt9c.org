Whenever the main character keeps winning. What's the point of reading an HP Fanfiction if I know the main character is just going to keep winning?

Also, bashing. The Weasleys aren't stupid. If you're going to make them evil, at least make them an intelligent evil. Don't throw them into your fic just so you can bash on them.
