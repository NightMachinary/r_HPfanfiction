I feel like this is related to one of the most annoying misconceptions about Slytherins, too, and I've had to have this conversation with a surprising amount of people: Slytherins don't do /everything/ for political gain. Yes, they'll do a lot to get what they want, but that doesn't mean they calculate every response or only befriend/chastise people if it works for them in some way. Even in real life, with other Harry Potter fans, people have said to me, "What? You can't be Slytherin, you're so nice haw haw haw." /Bitch/ Slytherins aren't mean. There can be bubbly ones, dumb ones, horrible-at-strategizing ones... it's just a few personality traits we have in common, not a layout for our entire being! /rant
