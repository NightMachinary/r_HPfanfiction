When things get super political at Hogwarts. yes it can be interesting if well done to include a political backdrop, but having 11-14 year olds talking like politicians is just so unbelievable. "The house of Potter is indebted to the house of Longbottom." Or Draco writing home about being unable to get an alliance with the Potter Heir.

And it's like this world seems exhausting, why is literally every single move you make a political one? 12 year olds are not going to be thinking over every word they say
