Harry's first letter got to his house at least a week before his birthday. Hagrid eventually got through to him on his actual birthday, but that was a special situation.

The books never mention the letters being a birthday thing. Rowling has said a lot of post-book stuff that I don't consider canon. I'm going to put this birthday letter idea in the same file where I keep Cedric the death eater.
