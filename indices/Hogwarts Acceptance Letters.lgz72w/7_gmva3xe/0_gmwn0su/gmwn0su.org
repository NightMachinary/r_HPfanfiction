  The books never mention the letters being a birthday thing. Rowling has said a lot of post-book stuff that I don't consider canon.

You hit the nail on the head: if, as op says, it's controversial to claim that the letters are sent out around the time of each individual student's birthday, then that's only because the assertion is dependent on the idea of literary authority, which is, y'know, /controversial./ It's a bit like eating a bite of cherry pie and saying to yourself "wow, there sure are cherries in this!"
