Regardless of whether letters are sent on/around birthdays or during the summer hols... I suspect the “controversial” part is that you're pointing it out on people's fics. Pretty much universally, fanfic authors do not like to have people like you “point out” stuff that's canonically ambiguous in their comment sections. It's not controversial, it's rude.
