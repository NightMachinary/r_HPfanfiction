I go to a Private school, and we get the offers at the end of February, so we can assume that the letter comes after that, or at least Justin's did. Ideally, they would send the letters to muggleborns around that time as well, so that there would be no problems with any muggle schools. Harry got his first letter around the 24th of July, Although they would have assumed that he knew about wizards, as his aunt could have told him. Therefore, I believe that letters were sent sometime after valentine's for muggleborns, and around a week before their birthdays for half-bloods and purebloods.
