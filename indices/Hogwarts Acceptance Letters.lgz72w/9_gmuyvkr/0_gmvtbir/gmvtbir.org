I've never seen this used in a fic, and it makes so much sense! There's not too many muggleborn students in a given year, so I imagine it's entirely doable for the professors to visit them all over, say, the Easter hols, which gives Hermione plenty of time to read all of her textbooks, and memorize a good portion of them. And then students who should already know about Hogwarts, and who would not be expecting to go anywhere else, get their letters over the summer. I'd never thought of that, but it's now my go to headcanon :)
