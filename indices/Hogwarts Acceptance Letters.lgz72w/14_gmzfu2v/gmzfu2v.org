I think I have a way to make this consistent with canon and not too stupid: on their eleventh birthdays, they get JUST the page with the Hogwarts acceptance. Then, in the summer, the book lists go out. (They really have to go out then, because they need the required books from the new DADA professor.) We even saw this in the books, where one year the book lists came out later than usual in the summer.

Thus, people with late-summer birthdays, like Harry, get BOTH in one letter the first time.

It's still pretty stupid, because McGonagall has enough to do without keeping track of all the kids turning eleven, and most of those kids get TWO letters the first year, but I think it covers all the canon bases.
