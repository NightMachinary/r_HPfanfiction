Honestly, it just seems like an oversight. JKR sucks at keeping dates consistent. I'm of the belief that letters get sent out the summer before first year.

When Dumbledore visits Tom Riddle at Wool's, Tom is already 11. According to the Harry Potter Lexicon (not officially canon but they seem to do a pretty good job at sorting out JKR's wonky calendar) the meeting takes place in August 1938. I think they infer this because Mrs. Cole mentions that Tom does something to two other orphans “on the summer outing- we take them out, you know, once a year.” The way it's phrased implies that it's the most recent summer outing. Since Tom's birthday is on New Year's Eve (and since we know Hogwarts doesn't send out letters when students are months away from turning 11) we know that this would have to take place in the summer of 1938.

There's also the way Hermione is seen as weird and a “know-it-all” for having read her books in advance of school. I think most anyone (especially muggleborns and others raised without magic) would want to know more about this new world, but reading 8 textbooks is excessive if it's done in less than 3 months. But in 11 months for the people with September birthdays? That seems highly doable.

I also imagine that they send out letters at around the same time because it's probably less pain on the professors. As evidenced by the aforementioned Dumbledore telling Tom about magic (among other canon instances), we can infer that professors tell children brought up without magic about Hogwarts and magic. Imagine it's exam season and you are dedicating your time to your current students, but no you can't mark papers or work on your less plans because you have to tell Muggleborn Student ABC that magic is real.
