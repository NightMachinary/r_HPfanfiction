How would that work though? The letters contain the booklist, which isn't finalized until summer because of the new DADA professor every year. I don't think Lupin and McGonagall work well as examples, since McGonagall turned 11 before the Voldemort cursed the position and I'm pretty sure Lupin would have turned 11 the first year after Voldemort cursed the position, so nobody would have known that there was going to be a new DADA professor the next year.

Using Harry and Ginny as examples to prove your point also doesn't really work, since, as you pointed out, Draco was getting his robes at the same time even though his birthday was 2 months before, and Ginny got her letter at the same time everyone else in the Burrow got their booklists, implying that everyone gets their letters at the same time.
