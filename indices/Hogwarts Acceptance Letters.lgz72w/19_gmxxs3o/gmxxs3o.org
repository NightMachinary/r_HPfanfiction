In Chamber of Secrets everyone's letters arrive at the same time, presumably July 31st because it's Harry's birthday (might have been August 1st tho), including Ginny's. Now, someone could argue that Harry's letter was sent on his birthday, so it's a birthday based system, right?

Wrong. Ron's birthday is in March and the twins in April, so why are they receiving their letters in july/august? Now, Ginny's birthday IS in August, on the 11th, BUT when they go to the Diagonal Alley, it is packed with students, admittedly, not only first years.

But back in Philosopher's Stone, Harry meets Draco for the first time inside Madam Malkin's. Draco's birthday is June 5th. We all know he was a spoiled brat, he most probably wouldn't have waited so long to get his stuff. I believe they all, regardless of their date of birth, receive the letter around the last week of july and the first of august.
