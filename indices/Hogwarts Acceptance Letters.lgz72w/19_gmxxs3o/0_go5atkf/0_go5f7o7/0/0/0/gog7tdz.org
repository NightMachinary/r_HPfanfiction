I'm in the Netherlands. It's not really complex at all though it seems it. We don't have admittance tests, but we do have level-tests in the last year of primary school. That gives you access to that level of high school. In all schools. However in some areas there are 10 or more high schools for every level so if all thousands of students in a city want that one school, the school will be full. There are plenty of schools in every city, no private and no scholarships, but some schools are more popular.
