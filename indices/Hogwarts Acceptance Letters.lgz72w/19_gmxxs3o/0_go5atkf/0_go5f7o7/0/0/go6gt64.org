This is so complex, may I ask where do you live?

Here in Brazil you basically just enroll, be it a private or public school. You have to go through a test if you want a scholarship but that's about it.

If it's a federal school they have a test, similar to what happens for ppl to get into university but "regular" schools don't have anything like that, so it's a very foreign concept to me.
