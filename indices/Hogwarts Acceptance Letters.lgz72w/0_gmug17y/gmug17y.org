It /feels/ like an inconsistency, especially given real-life summer holidays (which run from mid-July to the week of September 1st), even if it's not.

Harry and Ginny's letters arrive during the summer holidays, which isn't all that problematic - especially in Ginny's case, as she's a pureblood witch and pretty much already knew. Any Muggleborns who get their letter on their birthday might get mildly screwed by the system, especially if their birthday is the very tail-end of the summer hols.

March and October are mid-school, which would be more problematic for scheduling visits and letters - unless Albus Dumbledore, /the Headmaster/, is both the only person doing visits and the one with the most time on his hands (both seem unlikely).

Rowling in general has a habit of unnecessarily "tangling" canon with pretty much everything that happened after the release of Book 6.
