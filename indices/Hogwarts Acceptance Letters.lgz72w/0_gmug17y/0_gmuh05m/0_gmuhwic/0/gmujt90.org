Either approach can work, certainly!

I find the birthday approach more cinematic/fitting for the magical world partly because it isn't as practical - and partly because I find the idea of it being tied to a given age also seems fitting magically speaking (eg, Hogwarts having a magical book that has everyone who's magical enough for it and updating when they get a certain age/sending the letter out). Plus, wizards caring about muggleborns doesn't strike me as something they'd really worry about ;)

But I can certainly see the argument for the other view!
