I personally went the other way for my fic and had the letters go out at the start of the summer holidays, across the board.

I prefer it that way, it's consistent and doesn't cause any additional problems for Muggleborns (see: Justin Finch-Fletchley, who would have to have his name removed from the listing at /Eton/ - if his birthday was late in the summer holidays that's really problematic for his parents).

I don't really see "letters arrive on the birthday" as any more cinematic than otherwise - if he gets it earlier it'd still be a big moment, and then by contrast his birthday could be either a quiet moment (given the Dursleys ignore it) or another "big moment" entirely (given not-Dursley caretakers).

We can agree to disagree there, though.
