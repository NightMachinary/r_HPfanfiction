Have to say that if Justin was born in the late summer holidays it would still potential cause issues for someone like him. Eton starts at age 13 so his parents would have plenty of time to take his name off the list.

But given he was going to go there, he'd likely be at a fee paying preparatory school still, unlike a lot of other muggleborns who'd have just finished primary school and would be moving on to secondary school. And maybe his parents would have already paid for the upcoming term so it would be somewhat unfair.

Additionally the September 1st date only accounts for some children in the UK, as schools in Scotland start the school year in August, so a Scottish kid could start the school year, have their birthday on the 25th August for example and then be sent a letter telling them they're magic - at which point their parents then have to shell out loads of money on that as well.

And finally the whole thing is based on English schools with the Primary-Secondary system and being 11 when leaving Primary, but even in England not every school system is that. Some are Lower-Middle-Upper, and you tend to be 11 midway through Middle school.

So yeah it's all awkward, which is why it's probably just better to ignore it all, because it isn't standardised.
