My headcanon is that all children receive their letters until an established date. If their birthdays are on or before this date, they get it on their birthday. Otherwise, students receive them in a random order that gives preference to Muggle-borns, so they can have more time to prepare.

This would be very important in the first year, but I assume whoever visits them also takes them to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies. Though, no one will help them in the following years, so if the student lives away from London, their parents can use Muggle transportation to take them there or to another big city that might have their own "Diagon Alleys".

Of course they can use the Knight Bus, which is much faster, but I assume parents wouldn't let their kids go unsupervised to another city at such young age, and I'm not sure Muggles can take the Knight Bus. It uses magic to avoid transit and all, so I suppose they would be crushed to death when it gets thinner.
