Calendars are not JKR's strong suit - see, the school year /always/ starting on September 1st, and seemingly having September 2nd as a monday because of that.

The way I read it, the implication for what JKR intended is for the letters to arrive on the birthdays, since that's a big scene and everything for Harry.

However, he obviously got the letters sent earlier than his birthday, so we can have arguments with both ones. I think having it on the birthdays is more cinematic, so I don't mind the slight liberties taken for that to be the case.
