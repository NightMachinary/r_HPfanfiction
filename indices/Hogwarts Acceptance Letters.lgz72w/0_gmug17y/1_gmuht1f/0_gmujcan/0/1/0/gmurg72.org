  I don't think there's any actual rule that prevents werewolves going to Hogwarts

My fault it seems they didn't go because they were uncontrollable and shunned.

And I doubt Dumbledore can visit just anyone and invite them. Remus appears to be a very special case in that he wasn't born a werewolf and he didn't become one as an adult, so his name was written on the list when he was born.

In fact, Dumbledore /only/ visits because he'd heard what Greyback had done. Had he not, I assume Remus would have received the letter and his father would have rejected it.
