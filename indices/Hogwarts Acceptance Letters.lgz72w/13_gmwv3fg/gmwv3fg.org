Add it to the list of confusions made by Rowling. The birthday thing makes zero sense for anyone but Harry. Why would you send an acceptance letter and then have to send the booklist separately(since most of those DADA profs weren't picked until the summer anyway)? And just imagine profs having to miss lessons because some muggleborn just turned a 11 and we can't possibly wait until summer when we have all that free time!
