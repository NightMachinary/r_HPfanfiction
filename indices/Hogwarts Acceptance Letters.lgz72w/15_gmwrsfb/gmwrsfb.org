So for my stories I kind of hybridize the two. First year letters go out on the kid's birthday, not for any practical reason, but because it's Tradition(tm) and whenever someone brings up the idea of changing that you get a bunch of purebloods pulling heartstrings about why people want to deprive their children of this most treasured rite of passage et cetera et cetera et cetera. So first year letters go out on birthdays, no matter how illogical and inconvenient this may be.

I also really like how this can be used to make interesting plot points! I love the idea that Hermione, born September 19, spent most of her year before Hogwarts knowing about magic. I loved a plot point I saw in a story once where Flora & Hestia Carrow were born split across the midnight line of August 31st and September 1st, so Hestia didn't get her letter until the following year and her older relatives treated her like a squib for the next year even though Dumbledore pointed out the hard cut-off line for letters. I even love the idea that Dumbledore deliberately sent early letters to Harry for Dumbledorish reasons (make them up, there's both good and bashing options!)
