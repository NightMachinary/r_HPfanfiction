It's just clunky no matter how you do it, though. Mostly because the school year takes up most of the calendar year, and if some random Muggleborn's letter arrives April 3, does McGonnagall have to skip classes to take the kid to Diagon? I mean, it's convenient for Harry that his birthday is in summer, and the teachers aren't working, but for kids not born in summer what happens? They get a letter saying that they're born magical and are welcome to a magical school, and we'll talk to you in the summer when we have time? Or, like Hermione, born on September 17th, does she get a letter and have to wait until summer, or does she get a letter AND a visit and have to hold off on doing magic for nearly a whole year? Neither of those are good.

Basically, this just gets back to JKR not thinking through the consequences of anything she writes. She's a seat-of-the-pants writer who doesn't worry too much about things making sense, which is why fanfic is so easy to write. There's just SO MUCH that needs to be fixed.
