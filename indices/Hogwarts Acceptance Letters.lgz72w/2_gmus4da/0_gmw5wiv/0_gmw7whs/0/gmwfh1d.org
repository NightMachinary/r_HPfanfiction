We don't really have a date in my country. Our classes start at the end of February or beginning of March and usually end a week or two before Christmas. Parents usually enroll their kids from January of said year until January or February of the next year. So, if you start first grade, you're supposed to turn 7 at some point between this period, which could be before school year even starts or almost when the next one does. Also, some parents choose to enroll their kids in first grade a year earlier than the standard, so they graduate at 16 instead of 17.
