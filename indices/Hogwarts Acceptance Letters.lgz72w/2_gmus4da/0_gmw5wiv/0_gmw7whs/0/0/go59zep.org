We used to have a strict cut off for going to first grade (year 3 in our system). Kids join year 1 on their 4th birthday if they attended preschool or on the first day after a school break near their 4th birthday if they didn't. Now for the kids born in October-December (and exceptions born in other months) the year 2 teacher decides whether to advance the kid to year 3 or let them wait a year. Some schools also offer a year of interim class for kids who are ready for year 3 material but at a slower pace.
