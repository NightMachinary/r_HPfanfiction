Yeah, but that is actually an IRL thing. A school year groups people of an age range starting with the birthday at that beginning of the year till before the next year. There have been countless mad children since the beginning of compulsory education.

And rationally, it's irrelevant either way; since the cut-off point has to be /somewhere/, there's always gonna be one who was born a day too late (and the age range between the youngest and the oldest will also always be just about a year).
