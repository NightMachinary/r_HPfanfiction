I dunno about controversial, it just never occured to me that that would be the case, because it makes no sense. Ignoring McGonagall's letter, it always seemed obvious to me that a letter to tell you curriculum, books & co would arrive at some point between the end of the last school year and the start of the new one. Late enough so the teachers have been finalised and everyone knows what books to get, early enough so that the students have enough time to shop. And that was pretty much it. Especially since that's how any boarding school does it, and the birthday thing is never stated anywhere in the original books.

If you /don't/ want to ignore that bit of writing you cited, you have to come up with explanations in other places. Say, how the correlation of how early (or late) the letter arrives and the perpetual search for a new Defence teacher works, or how the unfortunate children with a birthday on August 31st are supposed to arrange for shopping before going to Hogwarts.
