One of my favourite fanfictions of all time. If you are unsure about the sequels (slight spoiler): The first sequel basically has her dealing with the aftermath of the war. I would highly recommend reading it though, since the second sequel covers Ginny's last year in Hogwarts, so you will find all of those things that made the changeling great, without too much focus on Ginny's and Harry's relationship.
