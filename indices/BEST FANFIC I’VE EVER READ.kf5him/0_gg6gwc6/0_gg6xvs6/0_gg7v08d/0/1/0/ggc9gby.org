What's particularly realistic about it? I've only read some of the stories in the series and I'm not sure what you are referring to.

I've always thought that a lot of fiction makes relationships overly complicated and dramatic. Most real life relationships are very straightforward honestly. Humans aren't that complicated when it comes to romance and sex. Especially teenagers.
