That was my thing, it wasn't dramatic. I mean, there was the one classic “I'm putting sunscreen on her my god” scene but other than that, I felt it was more about letting them work out how to be together in a non-cliche way. Same went for Ron and Hermione. I also thought the author handled sex scenes really well and liked that the characters discussed stuff like birth control beforehand with older, maternal figures. So basically, I totally agree most fics can over-complicate relationships (they're teenagers not soap operas) and felt this fic handled it differently.
