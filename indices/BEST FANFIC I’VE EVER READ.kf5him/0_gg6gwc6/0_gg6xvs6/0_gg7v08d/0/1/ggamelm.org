Yeah, even if you don't like Hinny I think it's worth it. It's the most realistic way I've seen any author, even outside of fanfic, deal with a teenage relationship, and it also has a good take on a post-war Britain. Plus, my phone buzzed with stay at home orders an hour ago, so you may have the time haha
