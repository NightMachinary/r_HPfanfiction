I didn't finish it the first time through, but did on the second. It was ok. I don't rate it as highly as many people seem to, but the author has put a lot of work into it and woven an effective storyline.

It's good for challenging preconceptions about Slytherin, I suppose. And it was good to see some of Slytherin actually help in the final battle; JKR really did them a disservice in canon by making every single one of them sit out.
