If you want someone to gush over how amazing this fic is, hit me up!! I adored it so much I immediately reread it after finishing it. The sequels are good IF you're into Hinny. I personally find Harry incredibly dull so no matter how well written it was, I just couldn't stick with it. That being said, it takes a long ass while for them to get together, and that sweet spot of time before Harry features regularly is as good as the first part. In fact, it's so well written that I enjoyed reading Harry's POV up until he and Ginny get together (sorry to Hinny fans out there, I just find them mind boggling boring together).
