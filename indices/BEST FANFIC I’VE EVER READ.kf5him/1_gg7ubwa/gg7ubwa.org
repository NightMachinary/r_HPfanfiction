Very powerful fic. I was in a slump and I remember it changed my view on fanfic completely when I read it.

Spoilers ahead: I thought it was extremely well written and gripping, but the content was almost too much for my poor heart at times. The idea of a young Ginny being tattooed against her consent almost made me physically ill. I almost couldn't keep reading just because of that
