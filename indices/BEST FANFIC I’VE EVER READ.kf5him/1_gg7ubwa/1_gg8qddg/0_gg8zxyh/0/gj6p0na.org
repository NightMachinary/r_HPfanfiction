Definitely better than Rowling. In the original series, Slytherin was mostly just a bunch of death eaters and I could never understand why that house was even allowed to be at Hogwarts if it was so evil.

In this fanfic it was obvious that most of the Slytherin students weren't any more evil than the other houses.
