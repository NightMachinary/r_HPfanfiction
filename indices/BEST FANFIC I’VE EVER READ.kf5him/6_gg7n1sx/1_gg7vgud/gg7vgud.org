Yes 100%. This is more of a Ginny fanfic than anything. The hinny stuff doesn't start till the very end, but unlike the books, it's a more slower/realistic development of their relationship and it's not too heavy. Since Ginny is a Slytherin in this fic, she doesn't really see Harry that much anyway. It's more focused on her life and how her character develops as she comes to understand the meaning of being a Slytherin.
