Just so you know you can also search characters or just pairings or genres on ffn. for example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=1&c2=549][Harry and Tonks as main characters who may or may not be togther]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=1&c2=5549&pm=1][Harry/Daphne pairing]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&g1=2&r=10&c1=1&c2=547][Harry and Luna as main characters with a romance genre]]

just keep in mind that a popular fic may not be all that well written or they might seem fine if you are new to the fandom but after a while you notice they are really pretty meh.

Don't be afraid to delve down into the low 1000s of favorites or even hundreds. Ive found some really good stuff before that is not anywhere near the first pages of a search.
