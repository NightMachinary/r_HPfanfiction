It has absolutely nothing to do with this post or your comment, but I had to say, I loved your tag. It reminded me a cartoon-ish small person with a big head yelling "I'M HELPING" trying to row a boat with a fork.

Or a Jarvan 4 traping his entire team inside an enemy's Rumble ult.

One or the other.
