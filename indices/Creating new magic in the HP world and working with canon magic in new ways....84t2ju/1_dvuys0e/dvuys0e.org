I spend way too much time on magic (and worldbuilding in general), which will probably be my fic's undoing. There is not a week where I don't buy some new book on occult, myths, legend, religion or philosophy because I had some idea to implement some stuff in the setting.

As can be guessable from the previous paragraph, my project is very much AU, but it is still canon-inspired in terms of magic even if crazily expanded (that was also the planning process, I started with divergence fic, but then ended up changing things I didn't like and throwing new ideas at it).

Still, going back to magic. I heavily use real life occult and esoteric works as an inspiration with a key one being The Three Books on Occult Philosophy. Its author, Cornelius Agrippa (he has a chocolate card, he knows his stuff), a Florentine Platonist who syncretised a lot of renaissance esotericism into one system and presented it in a single work. (I'm also very interested in Giordano Bruno, who further merges Agrippa work with different takes on esoterics, but his system is spread around many works).

I would say that a Three Books on Occult Philosophy is a very good work to read for anyone who wants to add a deeper layer to magical theory, from transfiguration to arithmancy. Generally, works rooted in Neoplatonism and Florentine Platonism present a lot of ideas that can fit in(and probably often directly or indirectly inspired) HP magic. Modern occult, with its Mesmeric roots, fits much less here, though I incorporate elements of it, especially from Theosophy.

 

But enough on old books, let's go to what I think is a key to building an interesting magic:

- Magic rooted in concepts and ideas - this one is obvious as we see that presented in canon. But it can be taken to further extremes and applied to many ideas which are popular in fanon but are done in less interesting ways (family magic, runes, etc).

- Multiple ways of achieving the same goal - again something we already see in canon (TWT especially has rather direct examples of it). Unfortunately scarce in fanfiction, despite providing an easy way to show characters' individuality.

- Elasticity of spells - Again something that was seen in canon (mostly with Shield Charm) to a certain degree, but can be extended more. Spell's effects can be altered to some degree.

- Impact of magic on society - And that's what in canon was pretty limited. Understandable to a certain degree, as Rowling largely focused on relatability of the setting. Still, fanfics can go further with it, especially as they are usually aimed at older readers than the books (especially early ones) were. Personally, I think that focusing on "otherness" of wizarding world is much more interesting than making it familiar.

- Worldwide wizardry - Again, something that's not really AU, but which is lacking in canon. Most of the things we see were created in Britain or the rest of Europe, and that's despite the Wizarding World being more interconnected from the beginning. Likewise, despite all that was said on Pottermore about immigrant magical American population interacting with native one, we don't really see any impact of that in Fantastic Beasts. It all looks like shaped by those who came from Europe. There is a lot of potential in having differing magical traditions across the world, and there is a lot of potential in having elements of those spreading to the other nations other than wands and Quidditch coming from Europe to everywhere.

- Magic isn't a singular "thing" - Unfortunately, canon writings imply that it is, and it's also a case with almost all fanfiction. But I prefer to see magic as a separate layer of reality, or rather as I'm going very much overboard with this - "layers". The physical layer governed by the rules of physics? That's a top of an iceberg.

- Narrative-ruled reality - This is going full into crazy AU theritory, even if it is largely inspired by aspects of canon. Magical thinking makes absolute sense when you deal with magic. Wizards shape reality through ideas and in turn their reality is shaped by ideas too arranging their life into stories.

- Multiple-interpretation magic - Speaking of concepts. Many things are interpreted differently in different cultures, or by different people. Many cultures used fire-earth-air-water-aether/void/etc system of elements, but China has its Wu Xing. Winter solstice can be seen as the ultimate victory of darkness over light - the longest night. But it can also be seen as a victory of light - nights no longer lengthen. Concepts are up to interpretation and thus can be invoked in seemingly contradictory manner. This is sort-of present in canon as it seems that similarities in names help in transfiguration.

What can partially be seen in my points, but what is important to mention separately is that in magical world magic should shape other aspects of the story. It dictates the rest of the setting, it largely influences character's outlook on the world, it can be used to show their individuality. It should be more than just a dressing to the story.

Well, I went on to make rambling wall of text. What can I say, I like worldbuilding.
