I want to give you like 500 trillion karma right now.

A lot of my additions have some connection to Greco-Persian history - it's something I studied during my senior years of high school and I love expanding on it. I'm not quite as ambitious(?) as you in making and implementing new magic; I just have bits and pieces here and there. To be honest, I was just commenting on the fact that so many fanfiction authors seem to throw things in without much thought and, to me, it looks messy.

Aaaaanywayyyy... thank you for your awesome response!
