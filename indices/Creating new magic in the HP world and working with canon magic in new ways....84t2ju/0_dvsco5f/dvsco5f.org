I don't use any particular method to come up with magic. Indeed, I feel like using a method would result in magic that was too formulaic. However, when a potential new piece of magic into my mind (whether a magical law, or a piece of theory, or a spell) there are certain factors I will judge it against to decide as to whether it will make the cut:

*The negative factors*

1. Would this addition make canon events difficult to explain? If so, discard it.

2. Would this addition give Muggles/technology an ability to overcome, circumvent, nullify, or acquire magic? If so, discard it.

3. Does this addition treat magic as energy, or otherwise some kind of depletable "fuel"? If so, discard it.

4. Does this addition use or otherwise call upon (including by analogy or similarity) mathematical or scientific concepts, such as mathematical formulae, units of measurement, or the modern understanding of chemical elements? If so, discard it.

5. Does this addition treat Transfiguration as a tactile illusion with the original object "underneath", or otherwise temporary? If so, discard it.

6. Would this addition make it difficult to establish conflict later in the story, because it would raise the question "why don't they just use X?" If so, discard it.

7. Does this addition significantly reduce the importance of wands? If so, discard it.

8. Does this addition have a large area of effect? If so, seriously reconsider its inclusion.

9. If a spell, is the incantation longer than two words? If so, come up with a better incantation.

*The positive factors*

1. Does this addition treat abstract and human-created concepts as real? If so, a point in its favour.

2. Does this addition act through an indirect medium rather than producing a direct result? (E.g. conjuring fire vs heating charm) If so, a point in its favour.

3. Does this addition contribute to the feeling that magic is difficult and complex, requiring study and intellect to understand, without calling on scientific concepts? If so, a point in its favour.

4. Does this addition, if intended to be an item of "deep magic", contribute to the feeling that magic is arcane/mysical rather than mechanical in nature? If so, a point in its favour.

5. If a spell, is the incantation a single word? If so, a point in its favour.

6. Does this addition incorporate some element of real world folklore? If so, a point in its favour.
