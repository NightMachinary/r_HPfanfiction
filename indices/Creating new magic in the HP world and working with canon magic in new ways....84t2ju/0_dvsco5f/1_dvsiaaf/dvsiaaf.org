This is thorough and interesting, but why are you so consistently against any treatment of magic as energy? I write it as such, but /not/ depletable, and I have a coherent system and all that fits with canon. It's possible, for all that your concept-based headcanon works. Also:

#+begin_quote
  If a spell, is the incantation longer than two words? If so, come up with a better incantation.
#+end_quote

Again, this hinges on how your magic system works, but in mine and a few other stories I've read's, long incantations do exist, they're just impractical and looked down upon. One or two-words incantations are the golden standard that professional-grade spellcrafters try to reach, but a short number of syllables and wand motion rythm require a lot of designwork to get an effect --- the more complex the effect, the harder reducing it to two words get. So when a gifted-but-beginner like Hermione tries her hand at spellcrafting, for anything more complicated than the really basic /Point Me/ of canon, I'd have her struggle to keep her incantation under ten words with a lot of complicated wand-twirls, whereas if Dumbledore or Snape had a day or two to design a new hex, they could do a neat little incantation like /Sectumsempra/ for even a relatively complex effect.
