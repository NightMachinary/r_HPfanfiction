  This is thorough and interesting, but why are you so consistently against any treatment of magic as energy? I write it as such, but not depletable, and I have a coherent system and all that fits with canon. It's possible, for all that your concept-based headcanon works

I think we both know that, for all that you maintain that your system of magic is canonical, it is absolutely not the way JKR intends HP magic to be seen nor thinks about magic.

For the sake of avoiding tangential arguments, I will stipulate (without admission) that your magical system avoids factual contradiction with canonical events. However, even in that situation, I think you would have to be delusional to believe that the quasi-scientific, numerically consistent and mechanical system you promote is anything near in keeping with the themes and tone of the canonical system, or how JKR views it.
