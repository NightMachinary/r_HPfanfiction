That mine may not quite be Rowling's is one thing; but I'm still unconvinced yours is quite there too. Inasmuch as she has a coherent idea, I feel like her idea of magic must be somewhere in-between. Magic in canon is clearly not just cause and effect --- wizards rewriting reality --- as your interpretation seems to be. Spells go wrong, magic has a physical presence when cast as these flying bolts, it's an energy that is /there/. Magic isn't just an action, it's a /thing/.

Also, to clarify, my idea of magic is thus: a sort of Force-like field of energy (of unknown, possibly divine source) that reacts to wizards' souls. If a wizard wants something badly enough and focuses on it, the flows of magic will spontaneously respond to his will, hence things like accidental magic; spells and wand-movements and potions, meanwhile, try to force out a particular magical effect from this energy, reducing the human element as much as possible (but don't succeed on the most complex spells, such that intent is still required). The result is that intent can make up for imprecision of wand movement and motion and vice-versa. Direct interactions between souls that is rooted in a very strong, passionate, universal human intent (like the Killing Curse or Patronus Charm) will be almost all intent with only very cursory artificial magic-shaping, whereas things that produce a dumb mechanical effect like a light source or a cutting force (like /Lumos/) can be cast with virtually no intent at all. In short, magic seems to respond to meanings because the way human spirits shape magic echoes the human soul.
