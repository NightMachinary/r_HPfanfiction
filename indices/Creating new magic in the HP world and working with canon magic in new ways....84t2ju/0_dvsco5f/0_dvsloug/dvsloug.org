A lot of these are good, but some are baffling. For one, in canon magic is formulaic. To put things in a curriculum, they kind of have to be such.

But more than that, # 4 in your negatives list is contrary to canon. Unless I'm much mistaken, there are mathematical formulae used in Transfiguration. The variables include things like "wand power", which dovetails nicely with my next bit.

#3 is both very understandable in one way and silly in another way. Magical cores are a dumb idea, but that's aside, even in canon magic is some kind of energy, and it's even measurable. When they go to find the Locket Horcrux, we are told one of Voldemort's defenses involves a boat which requires a high level of Magical power for the boat to register the occupant and move. This means that on some level, magical power can be measured. And even earlier this is hinted at with the Killing Curse, where Crouch says that 4th year students lack sufficient magical power do perform the curse. Magic can be measured in some ways without that implying it's depletable.
