Taure pretty much aces it. If you're creating magic, it should feel like magic. Making a furmulaic, mechanical kind of magic, while not completely non-canon, takes a lot off the novelty. Perhaps that's why Rowling never went in depth into her own magic. Like it is meant to stay somewhat unreasonable.

That said, I actually endeavoured to create a piece of magic in my own fic, Old Blood, so I'll give that as example and try to explain my thought process.

First, I did not create it per see, as I took Alchemy and gave it another spin, making it different from the canon one (which we don't know much of in the first place). The premise of this magic is simple: make solid potions that can work on an area basis. I'll be the first to point out that this in indeed very powerful magic; the effects of Amortentia, for example, can be devastating that way. I countered the same way Rowling did with Legilimency: in that Alchemy is not widely available. One, it's past-NEWT magic, very advanced. Two, it's difficult to do, requiring a lot of time and effort. And three: it's not all powerful, it's possible to fight it.

Second, the process of that Alchemy is not entirely mechanical. For example, and taking a page out of Taure's book, the ritual to create an Alchemical Stone can involve all sorts of crazy things, from doing it in the first day of Spring to sacrifices of life as offering. As of the last chapter, there's a snippet of a ritual in which two characters make a stone, and I tried to picture how these concepts work in that scene.

And last, I didn't create it just to be different. There's a reason for that; a plot reason. The existence of this magic is important for the story I'm trying to tell.

So that's mostly it. I thought of something that could be interesting, but not overly disruptive of canon magic; that tries to embody the craziness of Rowling's rules for magic; and that serves a purpose for the plot.
