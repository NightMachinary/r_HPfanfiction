Right now, probably not. While the bot is capable of multiple subs, I think introducing multiple subs would add too much time overhead to every reply.

Bot v1.4.0 which we tried to deploy a couple of days ago would work fine, I think, but that's quite buggy right now! Combine that with the fact that [[/r/fanfiction]] has half the activity of our sub and fewer users, it might be best to wait until the bot updates to handle that.
