Linkffn(A curse of truth) pretty good serious SI who's very careful not to make things worse, but still makes serious mistakes mixing canon and fanon.

Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

Tom and Jerry take over the world! HP reader dropped into the back of young Tom Riddle's mind, with a strange sense of humor.

Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

Similar spirit, but completely replacing Tom as Voldemort in 1981 and taking the death eater movement in a slightly different direction. Lily didn't expect to be spared, and especially didn't expect to become the Dark Lord's personal student and the second most feared person of Britain.

Linkffn(So How Can I Weaponize This?)

What happens when a nerd and engineer attends Hogwarts? Insanity, butter powered laser beams of doom, various flying vehicles from a tank to a MURICA van, Sirius has found his equal.
