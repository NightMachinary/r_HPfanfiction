This fic really made me conflicted. One the one hand it extended the world of Harry Potter in quite unique ways. Polynesian magical communities? Hell yeah! On the other hand, the SI goes on about their Christian faith, which I think is the author's. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some rabid anti-theist. A character talking about their faith is totally acceptable. It just pulled me sharply out of the world of Harry Potter.
