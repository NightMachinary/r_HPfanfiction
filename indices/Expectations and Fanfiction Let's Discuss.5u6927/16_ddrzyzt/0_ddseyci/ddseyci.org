Technically it isn't 'legal' to commission fanwork. But it's 'illegal' in the sense that speeding is illegal.

As for the great area you mention in another post. I've not done much research into the specifics of it but agree that I wouldn't touch it and you would have zero chance of winning in court.

I did once have someone offer to have me ghost a fanfic for them and pretty much said I wasn't going to go there. Of course that was more because I didn't think that the person would actually pay >.>.

Now that's a legal grey area I really don't want to think too hard about. Someone paying me to write fanwork in their name for them. I think I'm going to go get a drink rather than think about that any longer.
