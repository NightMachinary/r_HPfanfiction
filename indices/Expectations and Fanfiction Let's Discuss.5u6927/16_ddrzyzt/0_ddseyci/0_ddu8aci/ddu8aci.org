Well, technically the latter isn't illegal. It's just being hired to do work and forgoing the rights to the results of your work; if would be illegal if someone offered you after you finished the work because then they wouldn't be hiring you but buying the product, but if you got paid to write it for them from the get-go then it's all theirs (in the legally feeble way that a fanfic can be anyone's) from the beginning. But yeah, it's ... not something I would touch with an eleven-feet pole either.
