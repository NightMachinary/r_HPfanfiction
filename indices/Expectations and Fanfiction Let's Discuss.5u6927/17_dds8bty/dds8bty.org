1. Like some others already wrote, I am fine with it when the author means that people shouldn't read if they dislike the basic plot idea; that said, if it's the actual writing quality that is shit then such an addition in the summary will make me add the author to a “never give another chance again” list because they're clearly lost cases.

2. Well, yes. That said, having expectations is one thing and one can use them to judge whether or not to spend time reading a given story, but having expectations does not make anyone entitled to demand things from the author. Likewise, it's all fine and stuff to have expectations regarding writing quality, but it's really realistic up to a certain level as expecting people who write to actually try writing something that isn't shit is common sense but expecting every single work to be a masterpiece is not.

3. I am fine with people doing that when it comes to writing, sure. But make that /original/ writing and not /derivative/ writing (which fanfiction is). And it really isn't hard to write an original story inspired by something that already exists rather than just go for a fanfic, especially when most people's use of characters and setting when writing fanfiction is fairly loose in its canon-accuracy. As such, I find such things to generally be not good; there are exception but with the ones I remember the authors have both original and derivative works under their belt (or only original works altogether) and release content fairly regularly and the donations are just for people who want to use money to express their gratitude and don't really give them any special treatment.

4. Not really. It's nice to get a sign that people like what they read, but feeling entitled to things that depend on other people is fairly selfish and arrogant. If people don't do anything of that sort then so be it, it's their choice and if they want the author to create anything similar in the future then it's probably the worst choice they could make, but yeah, no entitlement to them choosing to do one thing or another.
