  Quite a few fics have DL;DR (Don't Like; Don't Read) written in their summaries. This is a way of writers shielding themselves from negative reviews and criticism. What do you think of it?
#+end_quote

I don't have a big problem with that. Many reviews are worthless, criticizing for not living up to /unreasonable/ expectations, or praising chapters so awash in spelling errors that they're nearly impossible to read. If you want constructive feedback, get a beta reader.

  Do you think a reader is entitled to have expectations from a story they click into?
#+end_quote

Yes, but mostly from reading the summary. I expect slash or MPREG to be mentioned if there's any. I don't mind slash, but many do, and MPREG is definitely not mainstream. Unexpected slash leads to bad signal/noise ratio in the reviews.

Personally I +expect+ /demand/ the use of a basic spelling checker. I can understand the HP-specific parts can be difficult to proofread, but there's no excuse for misspelling regular English. I also expect a bare minimum of basic knowledge, like what kind of currency to use. Dollar bills in England is inexcusable. Jumper/sweater and trainers/sneakers mixups are acceptable. I'm undecided about pancakes for breakfast or S'mores.

  Some writers set up Patreon accounts, where readers can donate money to them and get early access to chapters and stories. What is your opinion on writers doing that, and does that change your opinion about expectations in any way?
#+end_quote

Don't care too much about the money aspect. If the story is good, I can wait for the next chapters. If it's /very/ good, then ... but that rarely happens. I usually stay away from WIPs anyway. It's a completely different can of worms to benefit financially from another person's intellectual property.

But it raises my expectations sky high. The story had better be technically perfect. No homophone mixups as in their/there/they're. No misspelled incantations, like "stupify" or "alohamora". No misspelled names, as in McGonagle or Hermoine.

  Finally, do you think that writers are entitled to reviews/kudos/favourites from readers that fully read their stories since they basically provide free entertainment to them?
#+end_quote

Yes. The worth of that depends on the reader giving it, so it's definitely not a mark of quality. But it's nice for the author to feel appreciated.
