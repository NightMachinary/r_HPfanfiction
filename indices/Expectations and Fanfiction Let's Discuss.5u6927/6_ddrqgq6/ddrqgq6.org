1. In terms of DL;DR, I like to think that it's not so much to do with criticism as it is to do with 'flaming' or just being an ass in the reviews. I've received anonymous hate in reviews on my work and I just censor them, as I don't think of "hur dur this is dumb" as a valid criticism. I do think that you should be able to express criticism in spite of a DL;DR notice, but that said criticism should aim to be constructive, and then everybody wins.

2. I think a reader is perfectly entitled to have expectations, everyone does, but they should try and keep them in perspective - fanfiction is a hobby, a work of passion for the subject more than anything else, and expectations tend to adversely affect the reader most, as they'll be the one that's disappointed when they aren't met. Open-mindedness is better (in my opinion) for a reader's enjoyment of a story.

3. For fanfiction, they shouldn't take any money - whatever the size, scope or quality of a story, if it's fanfiction it is in my opinion unethical to accept money to write it or for any reason related to it. Period.

4. I think that writers are perfectly entitled to expect feedback - if you didn't want people to see/read your work, you'd never post it online, after all - but that it still remains the reader's right whether or not to give that feedback. If you don't get enough feedback, just let it go, because there's nothing you can do to force readers to give you feedback across the internet. Well, nothing except refusing to post chapters unless you hit milestones, which has happened a few times that I've seen, and kind of disgusts me with the desperation that it implies.
