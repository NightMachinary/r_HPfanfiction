  What do you think of it?

It should be common sense. However, humans are bad with that, so a reminder by the authors is good. I'm not sure if it helps, but saying "I don't want to be ripped apart in the reviews on this site" is something okay to say. After all, as you say, it's done in their freetime.

  Do you think a reader is entitled to have expectations from a story they click into?
#+end_quote

Yes, of course! But blaming the author when these expectations aren't met isn't cool.

  Some writers set up Patreon accounts, where readers can donate money to them and get early access to chapters and stories. What is your opinion on writers doing that, and does that change your opinion about expectations in any way?
#+end_quote

I'd only subscribe to something like this if it's a story I found truly exceptional, that I expect to get a lot of enjoyment out of. The biggest problem I have with that is that it definitely is a legal grey-area for the author, and I feel like it's a bit of disrespect to JKR to profit of her name.

  Finally, do you think that writers are entitled to reviews/kudos/favourites from readers that fully read their stories since they basically provide free entertainment to them?
#+end_quote

Yes, if you liked a story a bit of positive feedback would be great, but not necessarily a must
