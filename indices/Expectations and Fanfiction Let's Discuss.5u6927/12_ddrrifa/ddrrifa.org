1.) DL;DR is IMO imperative unless they decide on not bashing anyone, not giving Harry a pairing, and not making Harry female. Although, if I see a story that I think has potential and I tell the writer that they're doing a pretty garbage job at making their vision come to life, DL;DR isn't an excuse that works on me.

2.) Yes. What is the point of writing stories on the site and publishing them if the quality is sub-par? I get that they write it in their free-time, but in all honesty, they can write in their free-time in Microsoft word if they have a problem with critiques of their work.

3.) If someone was doing something crazy big, like creating a giant expansive world, re-working the entire series, adding pictures for each chapter, etc... Then yes, I think Patreon is worth it, as you're paying for quality. But some of these writers are so entitled, they think that just because they're the #1 writer of Hermione/Severus one-shots with overgrown cliches, that they can hold their stories hostage because no one subs to their patreon. I've yet to see someone make a good au Harry-centric fic, not going to shell out for someone who can't even compare to Taure.

4.) Firstly, reviews don't have to be positive. In fact, most of the most reviewed stories on ffn have terrible reviews. Secondly, no, they're as entitled to likes and favourites as a youtuber that actually gets paid for them, which is to say, not at all.
