1. Others have already properly explained it. I don't like Harry/Draco either, but I wouldn't go around finding those stories and flaming the authors about it.
2. On one hand, fanfiction takes a lot of work to write and a fair amount of readers are obnoxious shits about this wonderful free entertainment that they get, so I'd say readers aren't really entitled to anything. On the other hand, if you write a story labeled "Harry/Hermione" and then you spend most of it bashing Hermione and then killing her off, you probably deserve some hate.
3. Nobody should profit off fanfiction. Period. This is complicated though because some writers write original fiction in addition to fanfiction, and it gets blurry when the Patreon is "intended" for the original stuff.\\
4. I think if you enjoyed a story, leaving a review/kudos/like/etc is a small courtesy that encourages the writer to keep going.
