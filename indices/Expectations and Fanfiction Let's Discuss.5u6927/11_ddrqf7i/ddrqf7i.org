Everyone is entitled to their own expectations, but you really can't hate on an author when they don't live up to those expectations.

I definitely think writers should be allowed to use Patreon accounts. The majority of fanfiction authors that use Patreon write a lot, so they should be allowed to ask for donations.

Writers shouldn't be entitled to reviews, favorites, or kudos if a reader reads through the entire story. But I do feel that if a reader really enjoys a story they should let the author know.
