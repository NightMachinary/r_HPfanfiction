- DL;DR is worth about the same as a disclaimer: absolutely nothing. It also screams uncertainty and amateurishness about one's work -- no one is free from criticism.

- Readers should expect something /readable/ ... and that's about it. Quality is a crapshoot when it comes to free shit.

- Asking for money in exchange for fics is a bad idea. Beyond bad. Fan fiction is a legal grey area that is allowed to thrive because it /IS NOT MONETIZED/. Fan fic writers are using the IPs of creators by the grace and/or willful ignorance of those creators. Anyone who does try to get money or goods for writing fan fics is at risk of ruining the whole thing for everyone else by breaking that trust -- and they're risking legal troubles too.

- Writers should get feedback or favorites if readers want to give them. Some fics simply don't deserve them.
