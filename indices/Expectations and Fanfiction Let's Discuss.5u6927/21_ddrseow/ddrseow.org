When I first discovered HP fanfiction about two and a half years ago as a reader, I suppose I did have certain expectations. I expected to find that the majority of it would be compliant with canon events and would be written in a way that felt fairly compatible with the original material. I expected to find more older writers exploring aspects of the world in mature and interesting ways. I expected to find more of the sort of thing I was looking for (stories about the adult characters who, clearly, I find more interesting than most people do), and I expected very popular stories to be very good. What I did find is that those expectaions were pretty misplaced on the whole.

  Quite a few fics have DL;DR (Don't Like; Don't Read) written in their summaries. This is a way of writers shielding themselves from negative reviews and criticism. What do you think of it?
#+end_quote

Irrelevant. Who reads something they don't like? And if you're just a troll, DL:DR isn't going to stop you.

  Do you think a reader is entitled to have expectations from a story they click into?
#+end_quote

Up to a point, I think the reader is entitlled to expect a story to be what the summary says it is. Otherwise, no not really.

#+begin_quote
  Some writers set up Patreon accounts, where readers can donate money to them and get early access to chapters and stories. What is your opinion on writers doing that, and does that change your opinion about expectations in any way?
#+end_quote

I think they are treading on very, very thin legal ice. and I have never found a fanfiction story I'd want to pay for anyway. It would propably put me off reading altogether.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, do you think that writers are entitled to reviews/kudos/favourites from readers that fully read their stories since they basically provide free entertainment to them?
#+end_quote

No.

Expectations as a writer are trickier to quantify. I can't remember quite what I was expecting when I started posting my first story but it's fair to say my expectations were extensively disappointed.
