It gets into a debate on intellectual property that I know way too little about, to be honest. In another fandom I'm in, the creator has explicitly stated they don't want people to profit from 'merchandise'. And yet a lot of fans offer patreon perks for their fan works, make art for money etc. To me, that goes against the creator's wishes, but obviously others don't see it that way.
