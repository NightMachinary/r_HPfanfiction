Would it really be that bad if they started selling unregistered handguns out of the trunk of their car to pay for the essentials of life?

It's still illegal. It's still infringing on intellectual property. Right now, most Authors who have gone on the record about fanfiction find it distasteful but accept that there isn't much point to do anything about it because the other creator isn't profiting from it. Websites like Fanfiction.net do have a large disclaimer you agree to before posting siting spefic fandoms they will not allow fics in at request of the author.

When profit comes into the equation it changes the dynamic completely. The creator of the pirated work has no leg to stand on in the event that the original creator decides to do anything about it.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that say as an example, JK Rowling would say "wait X amount of people are making X a year using MY intellectual property with no credit given back to me?" she could, in theory, have a lawsuit against Patreon for funding the theft of intellectual property, Fanfiction.net for hosting and profiting via advertisements from the theft of intellectual property, and the writer of the pirated content.

If JK Rowling said 'Remove all Harry Potter fanfiction from your website' it would be gone in minutes and the writers of Fanfiction accept that when they agree to the terms of posting.

While this is an extreme case, it's an example of what could, rather easily, happen if a cottage industry of profiteering from fanworks existed.

As a whole it's a very slippery slope that is, for the most part, ignored because it's not big enough to really matter to the original creators of the content. And it's best for everyone involved if it stays that way.

Also if you have enough time to create enough fanfiction to warrant being paid for it. You also have enough time to get a part time job somewhere to help with your bills.
