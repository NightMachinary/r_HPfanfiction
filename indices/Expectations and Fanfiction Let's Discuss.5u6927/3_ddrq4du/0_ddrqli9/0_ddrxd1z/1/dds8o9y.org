You are kind of missing the point.

It's not all that hard to make a story that is an original story simply inspired by one that already exists, even if it would be fairly similar, rather than just a fanfiction. As such, it really wouldn't take all that much effort for any writers who want to get money for their stuff to write an original story and not just a fanfic. This means that if they wanted to get money, which they should in no way get for a derivative story, they should instead get it for an original story writing which is guaranteed to be within the realm of their abilities if they managed to write derivative works.

/That/ is what makes it unacceptable: with just a bit more effort they could be getting money for a story with which there would be no issue, but instead they are jumping through loops like that and that is something that, if or maybe when noticed, could result in a huge mess.
