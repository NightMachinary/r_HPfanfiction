This sounds like you have quite a big bone to pick with them. And that makes you sound very biased, which in this situation only serves to show you as someone who came in to complain and throw eggs at other people.

There are people here whose behaviour I find grating in one way or another, sure. Everyone has people like that. But I do try to not hold a grudge because sometimes it's not intentional and so being hostile serves nothing and in the cases when it is intentional actually caring about it is a waste of energy. If you find that people being “self-righteous” is grating for you then so be it, but trying to put them down for it really gives you nothing but a negative public image.

That said, ScottPress's way of expressing his opinion about the “money for fanfiction” bit is a bit out (rude, that is), sure, but that's a problem with the attitude rather than with the belief that made it appear; and honestly, even if I do not agree with the attitude, I can agree with the sentiment as trying to get money for fanfics is a very shitty idea that can actually have very bad consequences not only for the writer doing it but for many others too. TE7's comments, on the other hand, all seem very sensible and not at all rude here, so your attempt to include him here really doesn't do you any favours because given the choice between him and you I am very ready to say that you are the person with foaming mouth and bloodshot eyes.

Also, I happen to actually agree with them that trying to get money for fanfiction is a fairly bad thing to do, because as an actual author I am well aware that if someone is able to write fanfiction then they are also able to write original works and with minimally more effort they could be getting money for that instead of putting creations of a lot of other people at risk.
