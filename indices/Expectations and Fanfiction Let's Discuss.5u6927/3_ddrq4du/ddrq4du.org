1. I think it's fair enough, to be honest I probably won't click on it because it sends a signal of a certain type of fic/writer, but I think it is reasonable to just view fanfic as a hobby and not want criticism. Not everyone does want to improve their writing and not everyone has a thick enough skin to handle the often very blunt way people can respond. When you're writing a fic with drastic changes or themes people like to shit on, like mpreg, or something, its probably very dull to have to read the same old criticisms over and over again.

2. I think it depends. It is reasonable to expect clear English and for the fic to follow the warnings it has given - I don't want to read a fic with rape in, so I avoid those that have that warning. It's horrible when it pops out of nowhere and the author hasn't included a warning tag for it. But I don't think it's reasonable for people to expect professional quality writing. Let's be honest here, the vast majority of fanfic writers, myself included, are amateurs and hobbyists at best. Perhaps they have ultimate ambitions to write professionally, but if they were at that level they would probably be writing some original stuff rather than fanfic. I know there are odd examples here and there that buck this trend, but at the end of the day you're getting free content from hobbyists.

3. I am very uncomfortable with this. I won't elaborate for now because I've had this discussion multiple times and I don't particularly enjoy it. But no, I would never pay.

4. It's funny, a few months ago I would have said that while obviously readers aren't obligated to review, it's the least they can do after finishing a fic. I still feel that guest reviews are almost always worthless. However, my latest fic, though it's getting a decent lot of favourites and follows, has low traffic and low review numbers. My last chapter got one review. This is directly after Aurors which was getting ~20 reviews per chapter. My goodness it has been freeing. I thought it would bother me and it did slightly, at first, but there's so much less pressure and I can write it just for me now.
