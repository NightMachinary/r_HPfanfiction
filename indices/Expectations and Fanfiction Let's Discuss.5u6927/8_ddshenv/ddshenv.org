I can understand putting a "DL;DR" on your story, but a lot of the time I see them, it feels more like an author forewarning people that the work might not be quality. "DL;DR" is something I do anyway, like if I find I don't like where a story is going, I'll just close the tab. Putting it at the end of your summary or in an author's note just feels like an author not wanting to hear anything negative, no matter if it is constructive or not.

I think that it's okay for a reader to have expectations, but they should understand that if a story goes in a direction they don't like, they can give their opinions on why they didn't like it, but do it in a respectful way. There's no point in simply posting a review on a story blasting the author for being a piece of shit who should die because his story isn't following your expectations. Basically, just don't be an ass about it. The only expectation I have from stories is proper spelling, grammar and consistent characterization. One thing I really hate is when an author presents their characters in a certain way, then has them suddenly acting completely OoC for the story or holding the "Idiot Ball", just to reach a plot point (especially if they include an author's note saying, "I'm sorry, I know it doesn't make sense, but I didn't know how to get the characters where I wanted them otherwise").

Patreon is something I don't really have an opinion about.

I think writers should ask readers to "Please read and review", but not expect it from them. Just like you aren't getting paid to write your story, they aren't getting paid to review it. It's fine to complain in your head, but I'd draw the line at complaining in the story itself or holding updates hostage until you get the desired amount of reviews.
