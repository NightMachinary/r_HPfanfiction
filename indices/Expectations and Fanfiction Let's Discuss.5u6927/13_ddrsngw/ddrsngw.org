Everyone has expectations, everyone judges. They're lying if they say they don't. What matters is if they act on that. Personally I tend to judge stories for having a DL;DR in their summaries and tend to stay away. Any story where someone feels they have to justify their work tends to be full of the justification instead of story and plot. There might well be examples of good stories with it in but the DL;DR suggests a certain frailness with the author that can negatively impact the story.

Reviews, what do authors want from a review? For everyone saying I like this there will likely be some that don't. People who take the effort to review are either doing it because they're kind or they're a little bit more extreme on either side of the like dislike spectrum. A review could be criticism on a story or an observation, are either of which going to change much? For example I didn't like some of the decisions in 'The Merging'. I stopped reading it, it was my choice and the author has every right to write however they want to regardless of my views. Should I have left a review saying I loved it until this point? Does that help, the encouragement might be nice but I'm also saying I'm, abandoning their story as a reader. Does that cancel out the praise? To some special snowflakes they'll take it badly whereas some people might say fair enough. Either way I doubt they'd change their story unless they are writing it for me not themselves.

I don't review. Its because I tend to be quite a blunt (tactless) person, without knowing the author I wouldn't want to leave anything but praise because I don't feel I have the right to say anything potentially offensive when it's their story.Maybe I should be posting a quick thank you if I finish a story I enjoyed but what if the story has been out for years? Is there a cut off?
