Erm, yes? I don't really know how to comment on that without coming off as rude, but seriously, my point was that his comment can easily be taken by people as “someone trying to make a ruckus and not at all wanting to be constructive” which counts point-for-point as a comment that doesn't contribute anything to the discussion as far as people see it. So I don't really see the point in you attaching this comment to mine as if you were trying to explain that I am somehow wrong.

But maybe I'm just mistaken and you are trying to elaborate for people who would miss that point ... I don't know, I don't think so, but it's a possibility.
