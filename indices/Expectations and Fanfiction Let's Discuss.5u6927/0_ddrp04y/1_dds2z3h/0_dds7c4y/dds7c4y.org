I think people actually downvoted you because for one lack of capitalisation of names makes it seem as if you don't really care and for two your complaint is the very example of a misplaced criticism as you are complaining about the basic plot idea rather than about the execution, and with both of those its really easy to construe your comment as someone trying to make a ruckus and not at all wanting to be constructive.
