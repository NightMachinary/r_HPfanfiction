With regards to DL;DR, I feel that you have to differentiate between criticism aimed at the execution of a story, and criticism aimed at the basic story idea itself. As I see it, DL;DR is aimed at people who complain about Harry being gay in a Drarry story. If you don't like the basic plot of a story, you really shouldn't read it, but at the very least you shouldn't complain about it. Criticising how the plot is delivered is another thing.

I think most readers will have at least some expectations after reading a rec, or a summary.
