I have found 'DL;DR' style 'warnings' as being a great arbiter for if I would even want to read the story in the first place. In an ideal world, yes, this warning should be used towards deflecting people away from complaining about the stated plot of the story. In reality I have often found it being used to deflect from how the plot is delivered.
