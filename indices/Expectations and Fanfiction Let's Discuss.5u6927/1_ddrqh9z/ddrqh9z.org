Re: DLDR: It's the Internet. If you put your stuff out there, you should have a default expectation that someone will shit on your fanfic for whatever reason: it sucks, the reader had a bad day, etc. There are always trolls lurking. Also, someone might enjoy reading badfics to then shit on them.

Re: reader expectations: why the hell not?

Re: Patreon (and other such associated shenanigans): People who do that are cunts. I thought we were agreed that fanfic is not for profit and exists in a morally and legally grey area. Let's not poke the freaking bear, eh? Because by the law of sufficiently large numbers, a day will come when someone will go, "let's shut down the cunts who are profiting from our IPs".

Re: writer expectations: I think I'm entitled to expect feedback and whine about the lack of it in the privacy of my head, but I would never announce it because I find it embarrassing. As for the free entertainment angle, I direct your attention to the word "free". Look, in the age of memes, if you do something that people like, word of mouth will spread and you'll look cooler for not having e-begged for reviews. Sometimes it just takes time. Sometimes your stuff just doesn't find a big audience. Take what you get, I say.
