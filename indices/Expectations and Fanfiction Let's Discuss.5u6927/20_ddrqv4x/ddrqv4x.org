  What do you think of it?
#+end_quote

It should go without saying. I expect literally nothing from any fic. As you said, these are stories written by people for the fun of it, without thoughts of profit or fame to their real name. So if you don't like what you read, leave; close the tab, maybe leave a bit of feedback as a review if you feel strongly about something.

  Do you think a reader is entitled to have expectations from a story they click into?
#+end_quote

Only in terms of not being tricked into reading something the reader hasn't looked for, meaning that fandom, category, summary, rating and all that stuff should represent the story. That also includes to a lesser degree certain basic things like not bloating your chapter count with 500 word chapters, not doubling your wordcount with needlessly long AN, and so on and so forth.

  Some writers set up Patreon accounts, where readers can donate money to them and get early access to chapters and stories. What is your opinion on writers doing that, and does that change your opinion about expectations in any way?
#+end_quote

The moment people pay them to write, I think you also have an obligation to produce at the very least semi-professional standards. At that point a typo, grammar mistakes - basic freakin' editing, should be the very lowest of requirements. In general I don't have a problem with writers asking for Patreon donations, but I do have a problem with those writers who then don't follow up in quality and dedication.

  Finally, do you think that writers are entitled to reviews/kudos/favourites from readers that fully read their stories since they basically provide free entertainment to them?
#+end_quote

No. Its fair to a writer to review his story when it entertained me for hours on end, but they certainly aren't /entitled/ to it.
