1. I can't imagine discouraging someone from reading what I've written. Seems counter-intuitive to me.

2. Yes and no. Expectations about plot and pairings and what not are some of the worst things in fanfiction. The 'expectation' that lead characters will wind up in a romantic relationship, or instantly fall in love, is annoying and leads to a far worse story. But quality wise I think the writer is obligated to, at least, do their best with the story. Of course, every writer has a different best.

3. It is, at best, unethical and at worst, illegal to accept money for fanfiction. Even going about it in a round about way is sketchy. This is the exact type of thing that if it grows more prominent could lead to a crackdown against fanfiction. This is exactly the kind of thing that if it becomes prominent, will lead to the people that own the copyrights on the original works to be upset. And that could easily lead to say, JK Rowling's Lawyers approachign Fanfiction and saying 'remove all Harry Potter stories from your website' and they would do so immediately.

4. No. Just like the writer owes the reader absolutely nothing, the reader owes the writer absolutely nothing.
