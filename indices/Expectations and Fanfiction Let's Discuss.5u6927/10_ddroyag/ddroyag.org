Excellent questions! I feel like over the years my expectations have been set higher and higher, mostly due to coming across some fantastic works which really raise the bar. The bonus of that is it also raises the quality of my own writing, but the downside being is its a lot harder to find fan fiction at the quality I've come to expect.

In response to the questions: 1) Personally, I tend to skip author notes in stories. It breaks the continuity for me. I would feel that DL:DR is pretty safe to assume - I can't understand why someone would continue to read something they don't enjoy purely so they can hate on it in a review. I am also strongly irked when authors explain what's happening in the plot in basic terms (I should know what's happening by how you wrote it, if you need to explain further, edit the chapter) and I don't like being questioned about where I think the story is going purely so I leave a review.

2) whether you're entitled to or not, I think everyone has inherent expectations. I think it's fine to know what you like and what you're looking for. And there's no story that everyone is going to love anyway. I've seen rave reviews on stories that I've found painfully bad. People's tastes are so varied, it doesn't matter if you don't meet some people's expectations.

3) this is the first I've heard of Patreon accounts. That certainly changes the game. If I was paying for a story I would expect updates fairly frequently, and I would be after a quality of writing that you'd find in published books.

4) I don't think that everyone that reads your story needs to favourite / review it. It throws off the search results when filtering stories by popularity. Just because a lot of people read a story doesn't mean a lot of people liked the story, but if everyone favourites it it will rank higher than another story that is possibly better written. If I really like a story, I'll review and add to my favourites because I want to thank the author and give them a boost.
