I guess you'd have to make it so that Harry finds out he has to die well before he gives himself up to Vold. In canon it seems like half-hour/hour between him finding out and him marching to the forest (note that I said seems like). Anyway is he likely to go and run off and have sex with multiple girls at the height of the battle?

However, I think it's a good idea...and could be funny.
