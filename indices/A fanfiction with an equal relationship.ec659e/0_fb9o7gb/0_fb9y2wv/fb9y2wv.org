In suppose so but it does tend to be specifically female characters and that is nothing against actual females. I posted this after reading 'honour thy blood' and Daphne, Mcgonogall and Marlene all go mad at Harry, Sirius as mad Dumbledore which is completely out of character for at least Mcgonogall and for how Daphne is portrayed. I noticed it to be a very common theme and it gets annoying how it ruins good characters.
