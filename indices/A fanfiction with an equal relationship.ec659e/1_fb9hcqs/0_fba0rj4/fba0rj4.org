He's talking about Harry being a doormat and letting women walk all over him. And not in a fun, sexy way. More of an abusive relationship way. You know the thing- Harry does something good, but dangerous like saving someone's life or retrieving a kitten from a tree or helping an old lady cross the street. And immediately several women jump down his throat because he endangered his health and life. And he just stands there and takes it instead of defending himself.
