It's better than the 11-year old that gets to meet with the Queen and learn from Merlin himself through some weird memory-temporal shenanigans because he's an heir of one of the founders (along with Neville, Susan, aaaand iirc Hermione). Gets somewhat Mary Sue-ish, like all of Sinyk's fics, though at the end hogwarts decides she's had enough of Dumbledore â€˜endangering' the students and, in spite of Harry arguing otherwise, just transfers Headmastership to Harry and the other three xD

It's sinyk's first fic, iirc, and it /absolutely/ sets the trend.
