Sinyk writes himself some special Harry's.

This one, if I recall, has an 11-year old Harry jump up on a table during Sorting and yell at Dumbledore. Can't remember why, can't be bothered to re-read it to find out. Only reason I keep getting email notifications for Sinyk's fics is that I lost my ffn password and haven't recovered it yet.
