It's nearly impossible to write such a fic in the HP universe because magic removes the "struggle". Polyjuice is a thing, as is human transfiguration and metamorphmagi. While not something taught in the first year, someone of McGonagall's calibre would be able to turn your cock into a cunt within seconds and give you a nice rack free of charge (or the other way around). While not a 100% conversion (as you don't alter DNA), it would still be a lot better and faster than what medicine can do today.

There might be some social stigma, but honestly, after winning the second war against Voldemort basically singlehandedly, neither Harry nor Hermione would care about such trivialties since rude remarks are nothing compared to actual magical Nazis enacting the Holocaust 2.0. Tonks can already shift her sex (if you can do a pig nose you can do a cock as well), no one would care what Luna does, there are already five/six Weasley boys so no one will notice one more or less and every other women is so underdeveloped you might as well call them OC in fanfiction.
