  You don't have to see the movie to understand the story

The fic is only loosely based on the movie's premise. Honestly, caliing it a crossover is presumptuous. The works are pretty much entirely separate. You definitely don't need to see the movie to see the fic, and you aren't going to spoil the movie by reading the fic.

On a side note, watch the movie. It's great.
