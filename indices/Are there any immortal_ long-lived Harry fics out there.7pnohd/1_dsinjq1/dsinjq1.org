Tons, I'll link some later.

Edit: Might have exaggerated with the whole ”tons”. But there are a few. Although most is Harry being immortal through rebirth (while keeping his memories) or some sort of timetravel connected to his death. My recommendations: linkffn ( Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is By: Tsume Yuki )

linkffn ( Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time By: joe6991 ) This is a truly excellent one. Just read it and was hypnotized into reading it nonstop for days.

This is two right off the top of my head. I'll edit again if I remember any other ones.
