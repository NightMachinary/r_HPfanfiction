The kind muggles he meets in grocery stores and streets who want to shake his hand, are witches and wizards, he doesn't know this at the time but it becomes fairly obvious once he hears he is famous in the wizarding world. Of course Harry in canon knows the difference, but this is HPfanfiction not HPcanon.

As for the Weasley's Arthur Weasley sets him self up as some kind of muggle expert. Yet he doesn't know anything. He wants to learn and is willing to learn to give him credit, but he is also pretty patronizing. If I set myself up as an expert on say Nigerian culture, despite the fact I had never been to Nigeria and know virtually nothing about Nigerian culture would it matter if I was kind to Nigerian people I met? I think it would still be seen as me being ignorant.

In Goblet of fire, they mention death eaters hurt muggles for fun, it doesn't seem to have been Voldemort's main goal, but if he had subjugated the wizarding world I think he would have moved onto muggles. He wanted power and there are so many more muggles than magicals. Whether Snape /liked/ it or not it is safe to say he probably took part in such raids. If he had other motivations for joining e.g learning dark magic, funded research, he still made the decision he was OK with torture and murder in exchange for that.
