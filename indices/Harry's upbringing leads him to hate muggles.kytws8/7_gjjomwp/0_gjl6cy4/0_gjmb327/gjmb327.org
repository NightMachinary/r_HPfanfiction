Basically Harry was sensible enough to not assume every muggle is like his uncle and aunt. Unlike Tom Riddle. Snape is so contrary about his feelings towards muggles.

The fact that Arthur is the expert on Muggles in the ministry, and knows so little about them shows how ridiculously separated the magical and muggle words are (despite a lot of marriages with muggles). Possibly people like Dumbledore and Hermione can see that the statute of secrecy is a wall which will eventually cause problems, as the gap between both these worlds keeps getting wider.

I am not saying Snape is a saint. But, his character is so contrary that we can never truly know where his deeper motivations lie.
