Harry was able to early on not generalize Dursleys behavior, and was able to tell that not all muggles behaved the same. He speaks of the kind muggles he meets in grocery stores and the streets who wish him and shake his hand. He also speaks kindly of Miss Figg (at this time she does not know she is a squib). Even though he disliked the Dursleys for their behavior we never see Harry having a generalized negative view of muggles.

Regarding Arthur and the Weasleys, they can not be faulted because they never spent time with muggles. We never see them think muggles are inferior. They just think muggles are weaker, and are amazed how muggles have invented so much without magic. All their oddities is because of their lack of contact with muggles. Arthur is very kind to the Dursleys, and Mr and Mrs Granger.

We have no incident of Snape harming muggles (not sure where this killing muggles is coming from.) Yes, he was a death eater, and death eaters generally wanted to subjugate muggles. But we can see that even Tom Riddle did not care about muggles subjugation. Snape can have many other reasons other than ideological to join the death eaters. Maybe he wanted to learn dark magic and invent new spells, and the death eaters funded his research. We don't know so much about Snape. Snape is such a complex and contrary character.
