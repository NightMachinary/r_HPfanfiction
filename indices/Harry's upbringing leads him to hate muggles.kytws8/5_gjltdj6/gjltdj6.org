I would think that Harry would mostly be apathetic to muggles rather than hate them .. I don't even think Riddle or Snape(may be his father? is that cannon?) hate muggles but they see them as powerless and less than magicals rather than hate them .. so Harry in that scenario just ignores all the acts of muggle baiting wizards do except when it doesn't fit with his goal of Riddle's defeat .. so he would probably not ignore insults to Hermione who is clearly his friend & ally and help defend her parents if they are at risk but wouldn't lift a finger when he knows some wizards are torturing muggle strangers unless they are DEs and going against them reduces Tom's power & influence.
