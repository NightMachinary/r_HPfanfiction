I think it comes down to the kind of story you want to write.

A story where Harry is wrong in his "all muggles are bad" stance and learns that its just that he had a shitty life? A story where he decides that the Grangers are the exception? A story where he figures that they're nicer than most, but they're still /muggles?/

There's a lot of angles, and a lot depends on which one you want to go for.

I'd be interested to see a Harry who dislikes muggles on principle meeting a nice, supportive, loving version of the Grangers. I think it'd be interesting.

And yeah, his arguments don't have to be perfect, its nearly more interesting if he's flawed actually. That gives room for others to argue against him, which could lead to some fun character moments.
