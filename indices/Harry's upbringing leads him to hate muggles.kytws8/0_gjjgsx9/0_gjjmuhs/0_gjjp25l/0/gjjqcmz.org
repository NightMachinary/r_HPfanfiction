I think Harry would more have a childish black and white view of the world. He doesn't really meet Hermionie's parents in canon except in passing in book three, I don't even think they are introduced. Which makes them a blank canvas for fic. I always imagined Hermione had loving parents who completely supported her even if they didn't always understand. So maybe Harry hates muggles and Hermione takes him home with her to show him not all muggles are like he thinks (also Harry need therapy which doesnt seem to be a thing in the wizarding world) ajd by helping him process the abuse he suffered he starts to realize not all muggles are like that. So he's less hostile/wary/suspicious of Hermione's parents.

Equally maybe it doesn't work at all and he has decided because of muggles not understanding magic they should just keep away from them.

His arguments dont have to be flawless he's a damaged child/teenager depending on his age during the fic.
