Your idea is really interesting. Like I said: I'd not go "dark" with it, because that's just me. If you wanted the Hermione angle, you could even have Harry be like "Your parents are the exception" after meeting them.

Harry dislikes muggles, but Emma and Dan are alright. They're muggles, but they're not like most others.

So... Harry is kind of casually racist? "You're a credit to your race" kind of thing with the Grangers?
