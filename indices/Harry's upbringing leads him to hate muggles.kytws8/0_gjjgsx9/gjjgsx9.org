Funny enough, I posted a prompt myself that kind of poked at the other direction: Harry hating wizards (and also the Dursleys). Link [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dfugth/prompt_harry_decides_that_wizards_are_to_blame/][here]], if you're interested.

Basically, logic was that he's only in a situation that /allows/ him to be abused because of wizards. A wizard killed his parents. A wizard placed him with his abusive family. A wizard keeps sending him /back/ to the Dursleys. Etc, etc.

It was a fun idea, to me at least.

Anyway, about your idea: If I wrote this myself, I'd probably go more "I want them to leave me alone", and not "dark, murderous, revenge". Maybe Harry just conspires to leave the Dursleys, and the muggle world as a whole, behind. More "quest for freedom", less "Next Tom Riddle".
