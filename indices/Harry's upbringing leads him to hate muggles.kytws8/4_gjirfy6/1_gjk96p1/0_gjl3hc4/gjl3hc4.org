Regarding Mrs Figg I read one fic (wish I could remember I think it was a parental Snape! fic). Where Dumbledore set Mrs Figg up to keep an eye on Harry as in canon, but she wasn't reporting the Dursley's abuse (Dumbledore expected her to report any problems and assumed Harry suffered no abuse as she said nothing), because she was worried if Dumbledore removed Harry she wouldn't keep getting paid and might have to leave her house. It sort of gave Dumbledore an out of the usual bashing in such fics, and he genuinely felt really guilty for what happened to Harry and not noticing.
