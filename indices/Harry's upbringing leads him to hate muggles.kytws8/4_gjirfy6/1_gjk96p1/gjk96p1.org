In all the fics I've read that pull off a Muggle-hating Harry, they note that even though Petunia and co were the only actual abusive Muggles Harry met, no others Muggles intervene to stop them. Primary school teachers are trained to recognise abuse and yet they miss his second hand clothing, thinness, and bruises from Harry hunting, which should be especially obvious in comparison to how Dudley gets treated. Teachers also don't stop Dudley and his gang bullying him. And the neighbours all think he's insanely criminal and his classmates don't talk to him for fear of Dudley. So far Harry hasn't met any Muggles that have been actively nice to him. Miss Figg doesn't really count because she is also an authority figure who was in a position to recognise and stop the abuse and yet she didn't.
