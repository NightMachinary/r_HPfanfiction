Canon Harry is so loving he basically forgives everyone who screws him over (including the Dursley's and Dumbledore) the whole point of canon Harry is he knows how to love and Voldemort doesn't. He forgives basically everyone and even has some sympathy for Tom Riddle.

But I think this is more realistic, Harry upbringing both pre and during Hogwarts is not the sort of upbringing that in reality would lead to a stable person.

As for Snape it is never explicitly stated Snape personally killed muggles, death eaters did in the first war though and he was one. I think what Snape wanted was acceptance, he lost Lily as a friend by this point and his childhood was rubbish too, so he sought it in people who recognized his skills. He was quite happy to tell Voldemort about a prophecy that would lead to a child getting killed though (he must have known Voldemort would react to a prophecy about a baby about to be born that could vanquish him with murder he didn't care until Lily was involved). He could easily have said nothing but he told Voldemort and probably expected rewards, which indicates he was after the status and power Voldemort could potentially offer if he won, even if he didn't truly believe in his ideals he didn't care it was wrong if it benefitted him.
