Did Snape kill Muggles? I got the impression that he doesn't actually give two shits about the blood status thing, just pretends to.

Canon Harry gets weepy over owls and house-elves (and I like house elves, don't come for me!) so I don't see him hating or being actively prejudiced against Muggles. I think he is smart enough to know that not all Muggles are bad, he just got dealt a bad hand with his aunt's family. But of course in fanfics anything goes.
