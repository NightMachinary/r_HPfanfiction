I remember Harry feeling this way in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]). It's a very popular Slytherin Harry story, so you may have already read it. He doesn't want to kill muggles or anything like that here, but he isn't very fond of the muggle world. He even faces a bit of an identity crisis because he kinda agrees with Voldemort about muggles, but Voldemort is also trying to kill him.
