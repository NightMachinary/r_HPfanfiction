Perhaps not exactly what you are looking for, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7443406/1/Forever-is-a-Long-Time][This story]] by Refreshingly Original manages to craft a Harry that seems somewhat divorced from "nice-guy"ness.

It isn't exactly a feature I like about the story. It's a crossover w/ avengers and not much has happened in the story.

One thing that does happen is that Harry kills a guard so they can't tell anyone about him and his abilities. This guard is employed by a dubious organization that pulled Harry from his home and family, and Harry does feel bad when he finds a picture of the guard's daughter, but the weight is disproportional. It feels like Harry spends an equal amount of time agonizing about using charms to trick muggles into giving him free rooms and food. (though he does so liberally). I don't know, there's enough to the fic to enjoy. It seem like the narrative is building up speed, so if it gets updated, it would be cool to see what happens.
