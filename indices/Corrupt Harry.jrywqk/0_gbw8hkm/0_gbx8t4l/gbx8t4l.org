There is no way anyone is denying Harry anything after the war. Being their only hope and then defeating Lord Voldemort at 17, even if Harry isn't some super wizard every one who doesn't know him is likely to think that. Defeating the most powerful Dark Lord with 50 years of Dark Arts knowledge and experience with a 6th years education? He could literally get away with a completely unjustified murder, he could walk into a shop steal something and the owners would thank him for coming, nobody would ever deny him anything. It is a good thing canon Harry doesn't enjoy abusing power because he could easily create a government more controlling than Voldemort's if he wanted. What you're saying is totally a possible.

Although, I do think canon Harry wouldn't be doing it intentionally if he did. Considering how he reacts to people dying because of something he started in the past he would likely be grieving for a few months before he got back on his feet, along with most people. People like Kingsley and Professor McGonagall are more likely to put things back together and by the time Harry gets out of his funk most of the work would probably be done. A 17 year old is going to be extremely traumatized after a battle like that and I highly doubt he, or anyone else, would get into revolutionary mode. So I doubt they went overboard on the death eaters but once he got into the ministry he would likely be making better changes and would likely be unstoppable in the Wizengamot. Not to mention he would have to go through Auror training for presumably a year or two, cutting out some revolution time.

But yeah the Potter-Weasleys would control the wizarding world for sure after the war, but I doubt they would go into revolution mode and overly punish the death eaters and make things super controlled, other people would be punishing them.
