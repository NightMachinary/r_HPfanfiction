I would have still liked more characterization.

I think Rowling shouldn't have had her call Luna Loony to begin with. It's good that she's defending her later on, but she comes across as a hypocrite. She can obliquely say people call her Loony, but calling her that was uncalled for.

Yes, she was a great character in order of the Phoenix. I forgot about that, it's been so long. She actually listened to Harry. Frankly Hermione and Ron dropped the ball that book.

Rowling really needs to think of implications of certain things a bit better. She had Ginny asking about love potions and without any context it looks horrible.
