Ginny did call her that, but she also stopped two boys from calling Luna "Loony" later as well. Ginny is not without her faults. She's a lot like James and is quick to hex but is also the type of person who considers it a great dishonor to betray one's friends.

I don't know how you missed Ginny in the fifth book. She single-handedly organized Harry's floo call to Sirius. She was actually the only person Harry would really listen to during that book. She was able to immediately Harry down when he was flying off the rails and told him that he wasn't being possessed by Voldemort so he should stop hiding.
