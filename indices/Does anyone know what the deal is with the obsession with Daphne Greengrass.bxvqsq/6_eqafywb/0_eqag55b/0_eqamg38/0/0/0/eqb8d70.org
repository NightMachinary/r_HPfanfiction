Ginny also played Quidditch, taking Harry's spot as Seeker, while also being quick to reassure him that he will eventually be able to fly again.

Ginny's one of the only members of the DA who is relatively skilled from the very beginning, being able to jinx Michael Corner without missing (though whether Michael was letting her win is open to debate).

She's also proactive in testing whether or not it's even possible to eavesdrop on Order meetings--throwing Dungbombs at the door--and flat-out lying to her mother when Molly becomes suspicious.

She holds her own during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, lasting longer than Hermione.

Ginny does /a lot/ in /Order of the Phoenix./
