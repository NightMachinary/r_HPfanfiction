Nope.

Character growth? What a joke.

Rowling sets the stage of Ginny as a pathetic fangirl, then out of nowhere bombards us with her sudden, hitherto unseen virtues and popularity.

Another example of her telling, and not showing, and the movies don't help either.

Even when trying to make her look good (aka "girl power!!11!"), it has the opposite effect, such as when she derided Luna, looked down on Cho and Fleur because they were more attractive, and cursed someone for saying something she didn't like on the train.

Instead of coming off as a kind, independent woman who can hold her own in a fight, she looks the part of a facetious, arrogant girl that enjoys bullying and cutting words.
