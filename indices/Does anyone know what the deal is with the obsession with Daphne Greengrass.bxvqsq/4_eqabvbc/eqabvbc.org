She is very multifunctional as a character.

1) She is a canon character with very little characterization so each person can have their own headcanon of what she is like.

2) She is a Slytherin so she is a logical choice to use for any fics that focus on politics or wizarding culture. Plus she is also great to use for the "Not all Slytherins" plot point.

3) Early stories said she was hot so any Daphne in fanfiction is now one of the hottest girls at Hogwarts.
