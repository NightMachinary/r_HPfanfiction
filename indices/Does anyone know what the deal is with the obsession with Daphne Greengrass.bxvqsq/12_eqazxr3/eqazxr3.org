She's a blank slate Slytherin female character without creating an OC. Characters like Pansy and Millicent Bulstrode have negative connotations about them from canon (Pansy is too mean and Millicent is described as a female Crabbe / Goyle). That leaves characters like Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. Admittedly Daphne's name just sounds better to me plus you can work with some basic assumptions such as her being a pureblood as Greengrass appears in the sacred twenty eight and her sister marries Draco. Her family was also never mentioned as Death Eaters so there's potential for “good” or “neutral” Slytherins.
