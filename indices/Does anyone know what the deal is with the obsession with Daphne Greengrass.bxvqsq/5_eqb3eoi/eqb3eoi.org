1. Daphne can hit a lot of popular tropes at once from the bare minimum of what we know of her, including star-crossed lovers, redeemed Slytherins, and pureblood culture/politics.

2. She isn't explicitly part of the Pansy (pug-faced, prejudiced, loved Draco) gang and she isn't Milicent (looks like a troll, choked Hermione), so she and Tracey Davis usually end up being the good Slytherins.

3. Her early fanon interpretations became centered around the ice queen and became popular, and people realized she could be one of the ideal love interests (mainly because of the above) for Indy!Harry which is also hugely popular.

4. Some people have a really hard time coming up with names that don't sound fake or stupid so it makes more sense to grab one from JKR.

5. Daphne Greengrass just sounds like a hot name, at least to me.
