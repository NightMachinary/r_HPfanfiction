Even if she wasn't ugly, her name really /sounds/ ugly. Even in fics where she is described as an attractive blonde, I just can't see it. At all.

"Fleur", "Claire", "Daphne", "Anna", etc all sound like they belong to an attractive women.

"Pansy" really doesn't. And Parkinson's is a degenerative disorder, anyhow - her full name sounds like an ugly disease.
