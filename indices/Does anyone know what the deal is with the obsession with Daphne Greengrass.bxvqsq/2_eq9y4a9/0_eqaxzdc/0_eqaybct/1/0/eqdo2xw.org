Honestly, the first thing I thought about that scene was, "That's actually impressive, Hermione should have been prepared for that."

I mean, I doubt Millicent would have many opportunities for practice in her own house and Hermione would have a much better idea of what Wrestling is, and besides that, getting that close to someone in a magic dueling match is rather impressive.

Anyways, Wizards do have a major durability advantage, so they should be able to tank those extreme Wrestling moves seen in staged Wrestling matches, and I imagine there could be some form of minor statistics amplification going on with their strength and speed as well.
