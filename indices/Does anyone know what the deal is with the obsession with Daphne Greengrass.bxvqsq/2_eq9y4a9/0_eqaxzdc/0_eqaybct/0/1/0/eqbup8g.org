Honestly it probably is fanon. I can't remember any real appearance descriptors of Millicent in canon, though I guess I haven't done a rereading in a few years-- but the name /Millicent Bullstrode/ just sounds like a really ugly name, which probably contributes to people's headcanon of what she might look like.
