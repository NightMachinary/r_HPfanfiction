No canon characterization means you can make her have whatever personality you want (usually this is the Ice Queen trope but I've also seen ditzy or even manic pixie dream girl versions of Daphne).

Being in Slytherin makes her readily available if you want to sort Harry into that house, which a lot of authors do for a variety of reasons.

Her family being old purebloods gives authors an easy way to talk about Pureblood culture (pagan rituals and maque balls or whatev).
