I dont remember from which book but I'll always remember in text during care of magical creatures pansys taunting with quote "her gang of slytherin girls" so you'd have to assume it's in the same year since it's in class. I always remember that when greenglass or Tracey are mentioned as "the good slytherins" obviously Rowling was biased against slytherins it shows the way she writes.
