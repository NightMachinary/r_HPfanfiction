She was mentioned by Hary during the O.W.L.S in order of the phoenix.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with O.W.L.S Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

Rowling also mentioned her once when people asked about Dracos wife.

#+begin_quote
  Astoria Greengrass, younger sister of the Greengrass family. We meet Daphne Greengrass, part of Pansy Parkinson's Slytherin posse, in Book V when Hermione takes her O.W.L.s.

Then there is also this on Pottemore mentioning how Astorias family are blood-purists

#+begin_quote
  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law.
