Pretty much.

It's either go for a totally OC character you've made, or try and make one of the ones we know about a good person. The problem is that JKR made all her named Slytherins pretty awful, so people latched on to her. It spread into "She's the super hot, powerful pure-blood that my totally not self insert is definitely gonna get with because she's hot and the Ice Queen".
