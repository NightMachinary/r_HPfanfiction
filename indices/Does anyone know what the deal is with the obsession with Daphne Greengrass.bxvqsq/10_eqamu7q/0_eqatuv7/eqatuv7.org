Actually I think JKR had a change of heart regarding Snape sometime when she wrote OotP (2003). She may have planned his twist in the beginning, but as the movies were made (2001), she must have changed her mind. It provides a clear demarcation point for most of Snape's asshole personality. Pre OotP he's a bastard who's spying for Dumbledore, post OotP he's a layered character with a troubled past and redemption arc.
