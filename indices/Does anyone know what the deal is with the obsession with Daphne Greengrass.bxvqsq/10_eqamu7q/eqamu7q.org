1. When Pottermore introduced sorting readers into houses, there was suddenly one quarter (approximately) of readers who found they are supposed to be evil, because yes, in the original books it is largely that all Slytherins are Death Eaters-in-training. So, there was outpouring of “Slytherins are not all bad”, "From the inner world of the Slytherin common room” stories.
2. Also, most readers of fanfiction are women, and there is some weird (yes, I am a guy) idea of loving a bad guy (don't do it, most likely a bad guy will just be bad and you get hurt). Also, Alan Rickman was a great actor, so he (and horrible screenplay) made him into lovable person (he is not: a teacher who is the biggest fear of his student, who has both of his parents permanently resident in the mental ward, is just horrible horrible person, and he needs REAL and THOROUGH conversion, before I am willing to touch him).
3. Also, most readers of fanfiction are teenagers (or very young adults) and natural sympathy of such people is to contradict established rules (e.g., M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled, the third stage of mental and spiritual development). Having as good ones all those who are bad in canon and bashing those who are good is very natural state of such readers.
4. And yes, Daphne Greengrass is lovely blank sheet of paper. Why such sheet of paper is written always the same is strange (e.g., I have mentioned couple of times linkffn(3912184;4236594) as alternative non-nobility non-Ice Queen, actually very much non-Ice Queen ;), alternative character of her).
