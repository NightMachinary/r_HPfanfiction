[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11149377/1/The-Muddy-Princess][The Muddy Princess by Colubrina]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11153333/1/Presque-Toujours-Pur][Presque Tourjours Pur by Shayalonnie]] are both excellent examples of pureblood Hermione. They both have a really light-hearted feel to them and play around with pureblood traditions. They're both Dramiones as well.
