In one of the other comments you said that this post was inspired by linkao3(a place apart). While I don't think he actual claims the title of king, I've listed a few fics below where Harry helps establish/lead a community which is the part about A place apart that I liked best.

linkao3(island of fire by esama) --series that's a minor crossover but you don't need to know anything about the other fandom - harry and others get stranded and must survive

linkffn(9279255) - On an island in the sun by rorshach's blot - crack fic where he establishes his own island

linkffn(11132113) - The difference one man can make - Game of Thrones crossover where Harry builds a settlement with wildlings

linkffn(8149841) - Again and Again by athey - Time travel do over fic probably abandoned right at the point where they are setting up the community

linkffn(4145459) The horror! the Horror! by DisobedienceWriter -- crack fic about harry moving to africa
