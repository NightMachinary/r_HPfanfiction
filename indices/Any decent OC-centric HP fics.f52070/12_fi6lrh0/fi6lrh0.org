YMMV, but I'll toss in Methods of Rationality, because Harry is nothing like canon and is basically an author self-insert (there are in-story reasons for this that are eventually revealed). Bear in mind that opinions on its quality are /very/ divided. I generally recommend the alternate introduction, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR).
