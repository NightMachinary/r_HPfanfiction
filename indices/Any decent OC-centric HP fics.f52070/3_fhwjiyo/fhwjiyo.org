The Durmstrang Chronicles by Loup_Noir\\
[[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/loup_noir/]]

This series by Catherine Keegan/Loup Noir about a group of Dark Arts teachers at Durmstrang is chock full of interesting, non-Mary Sue OCs. Almost none of the canon characters are even mentioned--only one, Remus Lupin, appears briefly in the series, in The Contract, which you can read without spoiling anything of major significance. Loup Noir's characters feel very real to me, dark and knowing. She created original characters who aren't admirable or "nice" but who are compelling, and readers will care about their fates. The main characters are heterosexual, and there are some times when the issue of sex and relationships arises, but this isn't a romance, and that's not the focus of this rather dark gen series.\\
The Chronicles makes more sense read in order, and there are lots of stories in the series to savor. Do give this universe a try!
