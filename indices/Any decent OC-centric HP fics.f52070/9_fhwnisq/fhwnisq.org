Does OC in all but name count?

if so ; linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) complete subversion of most of the wrong boy who lived tropes, Harry is a complete OC who goes to Durmstrang with other OC's, while his brother Nathan takes canon Harry's role and personality. it's a complete subversion of the WBHL tropes by having no bashing, and having Harry and Nathan raised together by their loving, still living parents. Also Nathan is actually the boy who lived, not the wrong boy who lived.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) A hermione in name only, this is also features the OC's in all but names Daphe Greengrass, Blaise Zabini and the rest of the slytherin group.
