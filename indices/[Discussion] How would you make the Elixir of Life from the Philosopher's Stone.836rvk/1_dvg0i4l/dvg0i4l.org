Ingredients:

1. Water, about four times the amount of potion you'll be making.
2. A *thick bottomed* cauldron
3. The Philosopher's stone
4. Ashes from a resurrected phoenix

Pour water in the cauldron and boil it for at least 10 minutes. Set fire to simmer. The water must be, physically and magically, ABSOLUTELY sterile. Therefore, cast the strongest *finite incantatem* you can. Now you have an empty cauldron, and no fire, because you used Aguamenti and Incendio earlier. I wouldn't have expected anything more from a dunderhead like you. Put actual water in the cauldron and light a non-magical fire and stop being an embarrassment to the noble art of potion making.

Once the water has been boiled and magically cleansed, add three measures of phoenix ashes and simmer for 7 days. Cast a filter charm to keep contaminants from entering the potion during this time. And by contaminants, I mean dust particles or any stray magical energy. Like the one from the filter charm you just cast. Throw it all away, start anew and this time have the presence of mind to cover the cauldron with a dragonhide lid before you start casting willy nilly around a potion that needs to be MAGICALLY STERILE! 10 points from Gryffindor.

After 7 days, the potion should turn a light shade of silver. Now it is ready for the finishing phase. On that night and no later, using a carefully calibrated hover charm, use the Philosopher's stone as a lens to focus the light of the full moon on to the liquid surface for exactly 394 seconds. A quick change to a blood red colour means that the potion is ready. Pour it into a thoroughly scourgified glass vial and cork it with an oak cork, nothing else.

And now that you have figured out that your 7th day of simmering did not coincide with a full moon, throw everything away and start again. Detention with me for the next...hmmm...14 days.
