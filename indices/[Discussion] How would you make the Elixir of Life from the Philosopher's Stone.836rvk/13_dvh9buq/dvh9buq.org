Well, if you want to go with the actual history of the lapis philosophorum, the actual stone is a red herring. It's a code-word for being so enlightened and transcendent through knowledge of alchemy that you can inherently transmute elements and live forever. ISTR a fic where Riddle manages to get resurrected rather saner than he'd been up to that point, learns this, and due to his experiences of death-and-rebirth (also a feature of old alchemical texts) coupled with already knowing a lot of alchemy AND being a genius is able to complete the Great Work of Alchemy in a matter of weeks. Since I can't recall where the fic went from there I'm going to guess it was in one of the many abandoned fics I've sworn at.
