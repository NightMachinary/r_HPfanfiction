Melt part of stone then mix it with the recipients blood and then drink it/blood transfusion? I mean while we don't know how it was created and is used, it would be stupid to assume there would be no safeguards.(reasoning for blood would be that the blood while not necessary for the creating is like a security check to keep the uses limited to only the creators.)
