You make a good point but we need to remember it isn't outside the realm of possibilities that one who has made the stone once can't actually get the procedure down exactly as its intended to be therefore making it 'comparitively' easy each time the creator makes one more stone......this would also be good in a way as you could pass having one single newly made stone contain from 700 to 800 years and then one would need to recreate the stone so if someone against all odds manages to use the stone he or she still wont ever be !truly! Immortal unless he or she can create a new stone, which also happens to be the pinnacle of alchemy and we can be reasonably sure that its probably Extremely difficult to create the first time.(as we have no idea how exactly one managed the feat simply because as shown in canon we don't really have many stones lying around)
