it was belived that you could use bezoar to create antidotes for poisons by puting it in a glass of water. you could probably do that with the philosophers stone.

I like to think that you wouldn't use water but rather mercury or something equally poisonous and use the ability of the stone to transmute metals into gold, to ennoble it and turn it into a healthy golden fluid. Basically turning poison into elixir of life.

some ancient European beliefs were that one needed to store the elixir of life in clocks so that it would restore life to the user. so that could also be part of the method to create it.
