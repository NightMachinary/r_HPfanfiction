I like the concept that only death can pay for life. So the Stone is this powerful alchemical device, sure. But to create the Elixir you need the base Stone and an exponentially increasing cost in lives. So the first time, you need one life. Then, two. Then, four. Then, sixteen. So on until you kill everyone.
