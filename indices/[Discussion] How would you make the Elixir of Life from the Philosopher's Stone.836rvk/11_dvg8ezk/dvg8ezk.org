There's a few other steps to it, of course, but the gist of it is that it converts the blood into the elixir of life. The stone soaks up the blood, all that you can offer it. You then heat the stone and a critical component of the elixir oozes out. Too cool and it doesn't come out. Too hot and it evaporates into nothingness. Too much blood, and the stone dissolves during the soaking process. Too little blood and the stone burns during the extraction process. Leave blood in the stone for too long and it explodes. Leave the stone bloodless for too long and it crumbles into dust. (this is why Flamel is the only one known to have successfully made one, you have no idea if you made it correctly until you get /all/ the steps right!)

The ... I dunno, "vital essence" it distills could be used for both elixir of life and turning lead into gold. How dark you want it to be would determine just how much blood you have to use and under what conditions you can obtain it.

Fairly light: Can only use the blood of the creator of the stone.

Really dark: 1 pint of blood forcibly taken from someone who is not alive at the time of absorption per day of vitality (for those keeping track at home, a perfectly harvested and newly made corpse would grant around week of life. Less if them dying partway through the extraction ruins the batch).

Cheeky Bastard: Can use any human blood, runs a medical waste disposal company and cheaply disposes of expired blood from blood banks.
