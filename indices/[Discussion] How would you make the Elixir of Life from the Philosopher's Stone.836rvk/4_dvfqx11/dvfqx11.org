Well that depends on exactly how you turn lead into gold in your story.

Do you hold the stone and touch it to gold and will it? Is there a process? Is the wand involved at all?

I remember vaguely some theory that Harry only survived Voldemort first year because the stone was in contact with Harry.

So perhaps being in contact with the stone let's you manipulate things with alchemy? As well as with your wand, or even potions?

Permanent Transfiguration works perfectly, makes Lead into Gold possible

Some involved process with some kind of vitality potion 'upgrades' it to the Elixer of Life.

You could Transfiguration a dead price of wood back into living wood and grow branches from it.

Kill a Phoenix with it, create one from the ashes of a dead bird.

Growing younger is actually just a aging potion, or de-aging potions brewed with the stone in the cauldron.

The stone added permanence (wink) or perhaps a way of purifying effects of Magic. It's up to you my friend. Personally I like the idea of the stone Unlocking types of magic while holding it, similar to how the Elder wand works
