Ohh? That's pretty smart, immortality begets immortality. I find it too limiting though, since most magical creatures seem to have been created at some point in the ancient past.

They just developed into sub categories over time. Like some ancient fire bird was created leads to the Veela race, and the Phoenix, and the Anzu. Dragons had an originally made single ancestor race, they eventually became the races that exist today. Basalisk from regular snakes. Dementors by that necromancer guy who kidnapped muggles on the island before it became Azkaban.

I figure the creation of immortality could be used to make a new Phoenix, or a new Stone. But using the Stone itself could be used as a substitute for making a Phoenix and vice versa.
