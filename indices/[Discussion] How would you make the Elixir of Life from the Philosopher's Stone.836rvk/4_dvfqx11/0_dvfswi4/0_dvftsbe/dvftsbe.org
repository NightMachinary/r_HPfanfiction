Interesting, I'd have gone with holding the stone in the off hand and using wand or main hand using willed magic to make the change happen. Probably a very tiresome process as well.

Perhaps the automatic process with boiling lead and the stone submerged within. Maybe some pieces of a magical creature to provide the magic? It would be like potions experimentation. What kind of dragon gizzards make the change faster?
