Voldemort really is Machiavellan in here. See the thing is, none of the muggleborns are dead.

When Voldemort took over, he set up a new system regarding muggleborn and muggle-raised kids (its sort of like Lucius's plan in The Dark Lord Never Died): immediately remove them upon identification and mind wipe the family. Voldemort's plan is to force segregation from muggle society, and so he forced the purebloods to accept the new system. Spoiler: Hermione was raised by the /Malfoy family/, and Draco is very protective of her.

Hermione is probably Harry's oldest friend, though several other people are of nearly equal importance. The key to this story is Harry's apprenticeship (of sorts) to Voldemort.
