Well to be fair, Harry is a pretty powerful wizard. Aside from the circumstantial powers that elevate him to god level, he is actually naturally skilled for his age in the canon as well:

- He masters a corporeal Patronus by thirteen (which is generally accepted as a very complex spell);

- He is able to cast pretty much most defensive/offensive spells only by seeing them once or reading about them including some of the more complex ones such as Sectumsempra or the unforgivable curses (to put things in perspective, just remember that most of the DA members were taught how to cast the disarming and the stunning spells by Harry, even though he had been using them for quite a while);

- He is the only character explicitly mentioned to resist the Imperius curse;

- He is an excellent Quidditch player

I guess the reason he seems mediocre is because the story is told from his perspective. He has a pretty low self esteem after being bullied for most of his childhood by the Dursleys; and he is also constantly compared with other more powerful and experienced wizards (Voldemort, Dumbledore, the Hogwarts professors).
