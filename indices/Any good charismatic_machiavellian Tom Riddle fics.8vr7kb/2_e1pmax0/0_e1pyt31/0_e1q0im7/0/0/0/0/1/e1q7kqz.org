linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) Time-travel, Harry literally kills Hermione here

linkffn(By The Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) she /was/ Harry's girlfriend, but she died before the story started (I think Sirius killed her actually)

linkffn(Realignment) Harry time-traveled back to kill Tom Riddle in 1943

linkffn(The Mind Arts) Harry definitely is not very close to Hermione (who is sort of bashed in here actually)

linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup) Harry meets her like once in this fic, so she's not important at all.

There are more, but those just come to my mind immediately.
