I understand your point. I partly agree, Harry is powerful in canon, though I would argue that he gets a big boost of power from the horcrux inside him, but fanfiction writers tend to ignore that completely. As for the patronus: all members of the DA and therefore about 30% of the wizarding population that age managed to learn how to create a corporal patronus within one year without the help of a teacher... I know the patronus is suppossed to be difficult, but I do not think that being able to do something that almost everyone else who has about the same amount of training is able to do as well is not exactly a proof of brilliance.

About Quidditch, well, I would not say that professional athletes (for example) are known to be clever. It is a skill, yes, but a very specific one that has nothing to do with being intelligent.

But that is all not really why I do not like to read Harry centric fanfictions anymore. The older I get, the less I like him as a character and therefore am annoyed with fanfiction that contain too much Harry. How he is written in canon is incredibly one-dimensional. My MAIN problem with him is that he is not curious. Like literally not curious at all. He can talk to snakes and ignores it completely (like WTF?! you can talk to another SPECIES and you do not explore them?! What the fuck is wrong with you??). He gets to know he's a wizard and is just like "yeah cool, Hogwarts is nice, buying sweets is cool, yeah nice, blah". Hermione's reaction (reading EVERYTHING about this new world) does not really show anything about her character, it is just much more realistic IMHO. He never does anything special with magic, never. He does not ask for theories behind it. He does not develop anything at all.

I still read HP fanfictions because I grew up with the world of HP and still kind of love it, but I do not think that canon is actually good.
