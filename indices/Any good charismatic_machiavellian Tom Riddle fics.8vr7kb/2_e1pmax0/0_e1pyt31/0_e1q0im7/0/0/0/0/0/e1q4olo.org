Yeah you're right there isn't a lot of Harry-centric Hermione free fic, which is a same. Here's a small list of fic I enjoyed:

Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise: linkffn(10267302) which is very good but has (imo) a rushed ending.

Rise of the Wizards: linkffn(6254783). Easily one of my favourite fic.

Midnight Gold, the rise of the forgotten Lord: linkffn(7694530). Sadly abandonned but still enjoyable.

Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven (plus sequels): linkffn(11496914)

Paid in Blood: linkffn(9474009) has a difficult start but worth reading it till the end.

They Shook Hands: linkffn(7659033), good, long and has sequels.

Saviour of Magic: linkffn(12484195) has a good start, and look a lot like Rise of the Wizards. Didn't read it till the end so I can judge it completely.

Harry Potter and the Homecoming and sequels: linkffn(12867536) is regulary updated and one of the only fic I'm currenctly reading. Harry has a believable descent into Darkness.

Feel free to add some to this list :)
