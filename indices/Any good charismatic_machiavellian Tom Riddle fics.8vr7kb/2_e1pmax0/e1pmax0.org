The ultimate charismatic Tom Riddle:

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): /I/ would follow this Voldemort. And I hate the Death Eaters.

Good runners-up:

linkffn(Patron): Voldemort was more than up to the task of trying to topple Britain. Really the only reason he lost was that the people he was fighting were just that good too. Hell, he got werewolves from Norway to fight for him.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): Tom Riddle the Diary here (so far), his plans actually make a lot of sense, and as Harry says "Riddle has a multi-layered strategy with lots of possible goals to shoot for. And he adapts quickly to changing circumstances."
