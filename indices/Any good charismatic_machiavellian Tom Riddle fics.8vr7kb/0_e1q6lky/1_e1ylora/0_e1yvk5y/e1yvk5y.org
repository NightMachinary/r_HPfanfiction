He becomes darker and darker as the story progresses (it goes through years 1-7 at Hogwarts and beyond). Unfortunately the story is incomplete, but the author updated last year after a couple years away from it. So, I wouldn't say it's completely abandoned. But what I love about Tom's depiction is that his beliefs are developed logically. So he's not just some crazy evil guy killing people left and right. He's very rational and very pragmatic. You can almost understand and sympathize with him. That's where the Tom/Minerva pairing really helps. It provides an interesting perspective.
