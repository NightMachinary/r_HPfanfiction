Linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita) I always recommend this fic whenever someone wants a Tom Riddle story. Definitely a great 'origin story'. He's charismatic, intelligent, studious, and his growth to power and darkness is very realistic. The only downside (which I personally didn't mind) is that there's a Tom/Minerva McGonagall pairing. However, for most of the story it's more of a friendship than romance. And Tom still remains in character throughout. Minerva definitely has a lot of internal battles about him, loving and fearing him at the same time. It's really well done I think.

Oh and it's not complete...but still worth the read.
