There have been some great suggestions in this thread but honestly, I never was able to find them. Most of the Voldemort centric fics I came across either portray him as the darkest wizard from day 1 (i.e. no character development at all) or they make him act out of character by falling head over heels over someone (typically someone coming from the future).
