It's kind of a crackfic because throwing a DnD Wizard with munchkin tendencies into the world of Harry Potter, well, that's just not done while perfectly sober. But it's also really wel written, incredibly funny, with some very nice plot twists, interesting OCs, and a few ideas I never say anywhere else.

A must read truly, even if you don't know shit about DnD.
