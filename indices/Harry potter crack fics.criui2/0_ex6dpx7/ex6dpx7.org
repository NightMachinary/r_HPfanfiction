Honestly, Harry is one of my absolute favorite fics. I think it's ridiculously funny, and just plain absurd. There are only 3 chapters unfortunately. I would have loved it if the author wrote more to this. It's doesn't really have much of a plot, it's just Harry and Hermione messing around with the rules of magic and how far you can stretch them.
