The series by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][murkybluematter]] is the reason I'm still alive right now.

You don't need to know Alanna the Lioness to understand. But seriously, the characterization, the world-building, the freaking plot is so amazing I just wanna find out who the author is, give him/her all my money so he/she can quit work and finish the damn series.

P.S. It takes him/her a few months to update but when he/she does BOY IT'S ONE HELL OF AN UPDATE. Think 20k-word chapters especially in the 4th story of the series.

EDIT: Added the P.S.
