These are newish fics I'm currently following:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12948152/1/Elfish-Welfare]]) (Harry is raised by Elves and paintings of his parents, it's really cute and adorable)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16304039/chapters/38134826]]) (fem!Harry who is raised by the Tonks, a bit apprehensive about this one, but what I've read was really enjoyable)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13113032/1/Harry-Potter-the-Dance-Macabre]]) (this seems super AU, but I'm intrigued by how it seems to go an entirely different direction from canon)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13040642/1/You-Poked-A-Dragon]]) (Ron dies in the Mead-incident, Harry gets serious)
