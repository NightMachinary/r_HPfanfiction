  Harriet Tonks wasn't completely ignorant of her past. She knew that she used to be a Potter, that her Lily-mum and her James-dad loved her very much, that her mums had been good friends, and that her ‘Dromeda-mum and Ted-dad had taken her after her parents had died.She knew how they had died, and why, and what people were calling her, even though she didn't like to think about it very much.And she also knew that she was supposed to be living with her aunt and uncle, but they hadn't wanted her. And that technically (“The technical sense being the most important, when you're trying to get out of trouble, pet,” Ted-dad always told her) her mum had stolen her.

  Halloween 1981 and the Potter family has been attacked. But when Sirius arrives, the crib is empty. Harry is missing, presumed dead, but Mipsy knows the truth. She takes care of little master just as Lord Potter's portrait commands her to.

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL
