His Twenty-Eighth Life

Featuring a Master of Death Harry who has been continually reincarnated into different alternate realities and has defeated Voldemort 27 times, dropped into a reality where he is once again Harry Potter, but with an older brother, Jonathan, who is the BWL in this timeline.

It's well-written with round characters (including those presented in a negative light, which doesn't always happen in fanfiction) and a really interesting plot. I have no idea where it's going, but I'm enjoying it.
