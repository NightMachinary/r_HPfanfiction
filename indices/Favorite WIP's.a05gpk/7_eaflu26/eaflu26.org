Currently reading Harry and Hermione: Of Old Bones and New Quests...it stars an elderly Harry and Hermione being recruited to stop a brewing Civil War amongst all Magic creatures in the aftermath of the World War 3. Updates are quite regular! Really sweet and charming, and also explores very realistically how Harry and Hermione's relationship has evolved into their old age.
