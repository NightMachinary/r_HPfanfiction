linkffn(12778140) Everything [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] writes is excellent, and the Auror series is no exception. The first fic in the series, The Aurors, focus's on Harry and his OC trainee as they solve a gruesome mystery, while also getting their own lives in order. Hollow Ash is the direct sequel that starts up a new mystery, while still having elements of the first story present.

I've found the plot a little bit harder to keep track of than in The Aurors, but I think that's mainly because this plot seems more complex than the previous. The most recent chapter has also shed some more light on stuff, despite adding another layer of complexity (which I found really interesting).

All (I think) of the author's work is canon-compliant, and seemingly epilogue-compliant.
