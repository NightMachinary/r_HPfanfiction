I love the shit out of most of Odd ideas LinkFFN(2565609), there is quite a bit of romance, the ideas are generally good ones I'd say- though sadly most haven't been fleshed out.

A few are multi shots, but most are one offs.

Lot of crack though, depends on how you feel about that.

Wouldn't quite call them drabbles and romance is, I admit, not the focus, but still a good collection with more than a bit of it.
