linkffn(8527691) An Incomplete Potter Collection is pretty decent, although it has a strange obsession with something called Ashikabi. I particularly like chapter 12 for giving Ron a really good reason for his "Can I sit here? Everywhere else is full" line in canon.

linkffn(10362319) Bolts From The Blue is another collection. Some of them are a bit bashy for my tastes, but Ch. 13 is a spectacular bloody mess that's worth reading where the Hungarian Horntail from the First Task gets out of control, the Werewolf Conspiracy next chapter is an interesting idea too.

linkffn(10383313) From the Mind of Dunuelos tends to have a massive amount of cliches and bashing, and LOTS of gratuitous grandstanding from Harry, but you might like something in it anyway.
