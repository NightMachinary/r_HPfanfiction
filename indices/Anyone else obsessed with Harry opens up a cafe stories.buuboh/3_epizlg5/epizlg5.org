A change to my comment>

Baking and Cooking are two entirely different things and I can see Harry enjoying Baking while hating to cook. I think harry would want to make people smile and make people happy, and giving them sweets like what Mrs. Weasley did for him on many occasions would be something he could do, so owning a cafe that sells sweet cakes and other treats as well as coffee and teas would be something I can see him doing and enjoying.
