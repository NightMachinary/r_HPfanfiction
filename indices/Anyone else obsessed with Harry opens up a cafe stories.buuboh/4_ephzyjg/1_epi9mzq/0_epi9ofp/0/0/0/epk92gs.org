Somewhat true, but then it's a poor choice of summary. And in this particular case:

"Hermione had praised him as intelligent more then once.

She had always told him he could be the top of his classes with her but he just wasn't ever that motivated.

[...] Both would have been jealous. He knew he would have beaten even Hermione if he tried. [...] *He wasn't illiterate either*. He just made sure to do a bad job on essays.

He'd been reading since he was very little though as books were one thing Dudley had never gotten jealous about and Vernon and Petunia had never thougtht about. *He could write well and structure paragraphs perfectly.*"

-Café, Chapter 1 (very near the beginning)-

​

I honestly didn't make it much farther than a third of the first chapter...

​

ps: Why does Harry's pov sound like Donald Trump (I have the best words and write paragraphs perfectly [what does that even mean xD?] ) , and why do I suddenly want a fic with a Trump!Voldemort ?
