I'd imagine Sirius would be able to help with more of the social aspects of business, such as getting in the good books with where they get their orders from, as well as keeping misfits from crossing the line. I'd imagine that the bakery would make a good hangout for misfits, maybe even a sanctuary for those without a place to be?

But yeah, Remmy doesn't really have a lot of bite to his bark, and Hagrid is a lot more intimidating when it comes to looks than reality despite his capabilities. It's also why I feel like Remmy would act as more of a cool uncle, than a fatherly figure, he's used to feeling like a hazard and being treated as one which would cause him to build an ice wall that Harry will likely melt as well as his and our hearts XD
