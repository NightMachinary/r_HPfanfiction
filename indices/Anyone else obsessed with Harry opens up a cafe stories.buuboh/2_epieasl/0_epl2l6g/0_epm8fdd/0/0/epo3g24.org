Out of the three of them, i'd think Remmy would be the one. As a werewolf he has a much harder time getting work, which leads him to require a drive and determination that you don't get if something is easy. He'd likely be willing to try harder, and learn the business sense needed to run something like that, while Hagrid would likely be the face of the business to avoid unneeded and very unfortunate outcomes
