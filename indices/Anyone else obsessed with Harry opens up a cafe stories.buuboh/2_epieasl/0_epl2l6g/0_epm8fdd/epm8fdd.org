Sounds like a great story! You should link it if/when you post it! I'd imagine Sirius has more of a Father relationship with him, as well as a habit of making Dad Jokes. Remmy would likely be like the cool uncle, sneaking him sweets, and helping teach him things not only about life, but about the magical world.

I imagine that Hagrid was initially teased for wanting to bake, however Lily encouraged it, going so far to put together a massive cook book, only having an equal size in Hagrid. It seems like the type of thing she'd do, and would likely fit in her style of Magic. Perhaps it would be like an Opposite of Tom's Diary? Where you could enter the Book, and see how to make something, rather than just having to Read it?

Maybe there could even be a bit of a bittersweet tone to the Book? Maybe Lily had promised to contuie it, maybe over time it would've had more pages, but after she passed it couldn't add more. So, whenever Hagrid made a new recipe, he put his own page into the Book in honor of her? The Story could give some great Context for the Series, maybe it would help him figure out something was off about the Diary as well as lure him to it? Stuff like that.

Either way, i'd love to read it!
