Yes I love stories like this! I've read a few Drarry fics where Harry has a cafe/bakery. Off the top of my head I can recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2027253/chapters/4397940][When It Alteration Finds]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11018361/1/Once-Upon-An-East-End][Once Upon an East End]] (although the latter one is a muggle AU). I didn't know this was a Thing outside of Drarry though. I love baking, and I find the idea of magical baking really fun to read.
