It's not limited or specific to fanfic. it's a relatively mundane activity where you can still meet a person. You always hear stories about running into so and so at a coffee shop and they end up married or something, or rom coms that start by two people meeting at a coffee shop, etc etc -- when you do something as mundane as getting coffee, anything can happen.
