  What good is raw power against decades of experience and knowledge?

Honestly? Quite a bit. If you're three times stronger than your opponent, tricks and guile don't matter all that much. You power right through anything they do. (See Bolo's (Chong Li) fights in Bloodsport.)

"Oh, you're good at dodging and invisibility? I'll just set the entire acre on fire; you'll burn wherever you run to."

"Ah, I see you like to strike from behind. But my shield goes all the way around and reflects attacks from any direction, so I don't care which side you come from."

"Well, look at that, you know some advanced spells, but while I brush off those flee-bites I'm turning your whole body to juice via sheer blunt force trauma."

Sure, Voldemort is dangerous to most everyone because he has both power AND experience over theirs, but if he came up against someone with triple his power and none of his experience he'd still die like a chump.

Granted, most OP Harry don't make him THAT powerful because what's the point of writing that?
