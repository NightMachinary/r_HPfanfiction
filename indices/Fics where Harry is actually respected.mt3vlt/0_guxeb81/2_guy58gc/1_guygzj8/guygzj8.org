This is partly what I tried to convey in my story. My Harry does very well against monsters/beasts, but when he comes up against other humans, humanoids, he often struggles, despite being very powerful.

Mainly, it's because he is, more often than not, fighting against individuals with much greater experience and knowledge. He also struggles with his own morality, but does eventually become more ruthless.

Some people complained that my Harry didn't kill his enemies at first. It's a completely valid criticism, but I kind of based my earlier Harry on Peter Parker, and Clark Kent, so him ruthlessly killing any Death Eater he sees, doesn't make much sense.

My Harry is a very kind person, so I wanted him to struggle with the idea of wilfully ending another person's life. An event happened which pushed him over the edge, and he has since added Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne to his character profile.
