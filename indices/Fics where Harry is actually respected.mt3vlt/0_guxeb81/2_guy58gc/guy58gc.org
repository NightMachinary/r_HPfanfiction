What good is raw power against decades of experience and knowledge? It actually makes more sense to me for Harry to be able to match Voldemort on a purely magical level (marked as his equal etc) but struggle against Voldemort when it comes to how that power can be used. Voldemort has, on top of a completed Hogwarts education, decades of studies covering powerful, obscure, illegal types of magic, not to mention an abundance of political resources in a broken system he can meld to his benefit. Canon Harry wins because he has access to Dumbledore's info, Voldemort's mind, and ultimately, finding a piece of lore so obscure that not even Voldemort has bothered/managed to study it in its entirety. I like the idea of the adults actually seeing Harry's power, realizing that he, like all children, needs a healthy and stimulating environment in which he can grow to embrace his full potential, and treat him as their (future) equal instead of just coddling him and keeping him in the dark.
