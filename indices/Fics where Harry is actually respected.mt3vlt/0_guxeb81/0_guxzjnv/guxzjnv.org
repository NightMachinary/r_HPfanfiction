It's mainly because, if you're respected for your power, there's not much more thrill to becoming more powerful, like, who cares if your stunner can break through a protego maxima, vs two protego maximas, if they're so scared of your power they don't bother to fight.

By keeping people disrespectful, while still powerful, it lets you get more of that great schadenfruede feeling of putting someone who underestimated you in their place.
