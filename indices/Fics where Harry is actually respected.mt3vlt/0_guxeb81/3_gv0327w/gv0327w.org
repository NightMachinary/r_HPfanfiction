The problem with OP Harry who everyone knows is OP and treats him as such is... it's not a school fic. There's no reason for him to go to school to learn Lumos when he can already go toe to snout with dragons and win. So since it's not about him at school, you instead have an eleven-year-old trying to keep up with a hundred-and-eleven-year-old in politics and strategy, and he has no friends, and all the other characters basically don't exist. There's no story any more.
