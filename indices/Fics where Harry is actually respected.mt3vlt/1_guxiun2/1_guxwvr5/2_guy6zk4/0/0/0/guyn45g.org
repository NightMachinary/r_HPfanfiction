Year 1? If you read through Chapter 122, you finished HPMOR.

Yes, the Ministry doesn't feature /heavily/ in HPMOR, but what little there is suggests extreme incompetence. Eg, ^{⟨spoilers for the finale of HPMOR⟩}being so bloated that it employs three-quarters of magical Britain's adult population and ^{⟨spoilers for the finale of HPMOR⟩}being unable to mount a meaningful resistance to the Death Eaters even after Voldemort purged the Ministry's ranks of incompetents for seven months.
