HPMOR does indeed spend quite a bit of its earlier chapters billing itself as a science-centric story, but it by far spend more of it's runtime dealing w/ themes about rationality than themes about science. Of/c, this is belied by Less Wrong's heavily flawed and pockmarked understanding of rationality, so large tracts of HPMOR's commentary on rationality just don't work. Ironically, HPMOR's strongest aspect is emotional storytelling and the character development of several of its main characters.

I am puzzled by [[/u/lkc159][u/lkc159]] bringing up HPMOR up w/r/t a a fanonical competent Ministry---if anything, HPMOR's Ministry is, both diegetically and non-diegetically, ridiculously /in/competent.
