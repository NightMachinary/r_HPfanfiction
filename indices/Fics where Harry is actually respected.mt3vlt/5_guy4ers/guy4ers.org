I have a Harry that's slowly becoming powerful, my latest chapter has him leading a battle, 10 (with two of them firmly in the 'support only' column) good guys against 49, and winning through tactics and surprise. (And surprise airdrops of transfigured, very angry, bears. (Nothing is as surprising as having six grizzlies fall out of nowhere and begin trying to eat you.)) My Draco's been forced to admit Harry isn't all talk, but Fudge remains an idiot.
