I remember reading a fic where Harry travels through dimensions helping other Harry's with Voldemort. He stumbles upon OP!Harry in one chapter who is at the end of 'the summer of training' and he tells OP!Harry to focus REALLY hard on summoning the head of Voldemort. OP!Harry does so and Voldemort's head appears in his hand and just like that - the threat is over. It was hilarious!
