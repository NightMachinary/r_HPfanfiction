Yeah, I'm not... the fight aspects of that fic never seem too clear to me, but then I tend to skip fight scenes anyway unless there's snappy dialogue or they're really well-written and very very clear. I guess I don't see why they couldn't just AK him if they could stun him through the barrier, or if he actually fell behind it after getting stunned and no spells can pass through it.
