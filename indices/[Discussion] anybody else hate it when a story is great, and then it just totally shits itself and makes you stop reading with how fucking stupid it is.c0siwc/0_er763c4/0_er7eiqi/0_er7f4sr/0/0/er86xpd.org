Sometimes I'm in the actual mood for the /really/ awful worst-of-the-worst just to dwell in the worst excesses that people will willingly publish. It makes me a whole lot more forgiving about the stuff that younger writers are putting out that is a bit wish-fulfilment and not very well plotted or a bit fanonish. They aren't at least lovingly describing things that make you wonder whether the writer is a general danger to humanity.

I still can't get past any more than one chapter of Harry's Inheritance List and Hidden Powers though. I have my limits.
