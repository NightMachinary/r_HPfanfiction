I've never run into those. The only thing that I've run into that is absolutely the worst for me is:

- Harem

- James apologists (unless it is resolved in universe!)

- Sirius gets out of Azkaban and then gets some sweet but badass girlfriend who helps him overcome it all

- Luna is a prophetic God

- Luna is a sexy assassin, who is really messed up psychologically but also she sexily sexes with Harry and Hermione

- pfft both dark and light are shite, we are neutral! Muh heritage

- Harry bowed to us, the goblin nation will forever be brown-nosing you from now on
