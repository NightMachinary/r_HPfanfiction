Bitch, this is nothing, /nothing/, compared to some of the shit I've seen in my day.

Randon gangrape scenes, Harry deciding to work for Voldemort at the drop of a hat, fucking Ron the death eater.

There's always bigger shit, /especially/ in the HP fandom, this is pretty fucking tame in comparison.
