Retrograde a "time travel" fic that has harry travel to the past and fall for xyz. Then there were barely any chapters for that span of time before he gets ejected back into the future. Potentially could of had a great story in that era. So now we have present time. Ok he's a young adult now in a time where he would still be a teen. Upon meeting up an older xyz. They try to keep the time travel thing a secret. And saying "try" is being very generous. It's barely a chapter and the secret gets out right in front of a teen. These people are supposed to be adults and the let this very sensitive secret get out in less than half a chapter. I stopped reading right after that. Too much bullshit for what would of been a potentially great fic.
