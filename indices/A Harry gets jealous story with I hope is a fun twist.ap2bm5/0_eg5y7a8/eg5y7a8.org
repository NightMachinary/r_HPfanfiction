Almost every single witch wants to date Michael corner? I might be over-analysing this but most is the majority right?

So as Michael was in Harry's year he'd be 15, and as the majority of Hogwarts is 4 years worth of students, having students that range form 4 years his younger to 2 years his older? Bit of an age gap much?

He's also a half-blood, so I doubt that the pure-blooded families will be happy that their daughters are trying to seduce this boy, though they could make an exception for Harry for the benefits that come with having him as a son-in-law.

it's also stated by Ginny Weasley that "/Not any more. He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead./" Michael comes across as petty and obnoxious, not really boyfriend-material.

Yeah, so this is a really far-fetched idea, but I suppose in fanfiction anything can be come a story, though I doubt they'll be any stories like this, but then again, who knows?
