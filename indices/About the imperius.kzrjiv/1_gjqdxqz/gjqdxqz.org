Not that this is ever really elaborated on by J.K., but here's my thoughts. The ability to resist the imperious would depend on:

1) How far away the requested action was from the person's natural inclinations. So, imperiousing someone to kiss their crush would be much easier than imperiousing them to kill their best friend. 2) The relative magical power of both the caster and the victim. 3) How relatively strong or weak the individual was in terms of their identity and sense of self. Someone more independent who likes to make their own decisions would be harder to imperious, whereas an easy-going person who didn't mind going with the flow would be easier. 4) How much practice the person has resisting the Imperious. (With the thought that practice would make one more aware of what was happening and therefore more able to fight back.)

So imperiousing people like Amelia Bones and Bellatrix Lestrange would be nearly impossible, whereas someone like Ron Weasley (and Harry Potter) should've been pretty easy. This doesn't quite square with canon, but I think Rowling often didn't think things out logically and instead went with whatever the story demanded.
