I think it could be possible for muggles/squibs/anyone to resist, too.

If I remember correctly, in canon 14 years old Harry started resisting it. And it probably comes from his being a bit paranoid etc. He probably would have been just much more better at resisting it after having experienced the whole trauma of having Voldemort in his mind. (The same way it would be logical for Ginny to be able to resist just as much after the trauma of her first year).

But if trauma and paranoia must work similarly in muggles, such as in your exemple of a soldat or anyone being on the look out for drugs slipped to them ; I feel like even people who do yoga/méditation constantly would be able to know their minds and feel the spell taking effect and be more or less able to resist it.

But then again, common people are not all traumatised or paranoid and not everyone practice mindfulness (not sure if it's the word), so if the wizard doesn't make you do something totally abhorrent like « kill your mother that you love so deeply » (I reckon most everyone will stop and fight against such an order), you'll probably not stand much chance either.

So, let's say you do a crossover with Sherlock : the Holmes brothers will probably be able to completely fight it, whereas someone like Molly or even most of the police wouldn't---even if some would feel the effects.

(And then, I guess there is also the variant of how powerful the wizard is. Where fighting off Fake Moody's spell is already something, it must be quite different to try and fight off Dumbledore's or Voldemort's).
