Yeah, I get ideas like this all the time, and not just for HP fanfics, or even fanfics in general, but also for original stories. I write them down and encourage them, because they usually either end up going somewhere, or get sucked into much larger projects. For example, I had two ideas for two separate original stories. One took place way in the future, another took place in an ancient fantasy world. I entertained both of these ideas until I ran into problems I solved by merging the two stories and worlds so they told one long story of a character's beginning and end after they're taken out of time.

Keep those ideas you get somewhere and they might turn into your next obsession! Its also really fun to go back and find ideas I had that I kind of forgot about.
