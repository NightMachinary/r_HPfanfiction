yes. I have like eighty story ideas whirling around my brain like a blender.

- Harry is a ghost animagus but he almost-dies at the end of first year and transforms and thinks he's dead.
- Harry tries to make a staff, it ends up working like two big wands stuck handle-to-handle.
- Hogwarts falls into the Void between universes. They still go to Hogsmeade on weekends.
- Sword of Gryffindor talks. A lot. It won't shut up, actually.
- Hermione has a thing for knives. And she's good at Conjuration.
- Sirius does all kinds of dumb illegal stuff to the point where nobody even thinks of him being Voldemort's Right Hand Man, he's just the jerk who keeps loitering and leaving his trash on the ground a foot away from the garbage cans and runs around without pants on.
- Luna Lovegood teaches Merpeople how to make omelettes.
- Harry's Holly wand actually doesn't like him but he buys it anyway because when he first tried it it jumped out of his hand and beaned Draco Malfoy, and he wins vs Voldemort because it flies out of his hand and impales the Dark Lord
- Sticking Charm abuse
- Ron using his broken wand to cast 'Expelliarmus' which makes him throw his own wand and it beans Draco Malfoy
- everyone beaning Draco Malfoy with their wands
- A huge conspiracy where Crabbe and Goyle were actually baby cows transfigured into Wizards at birth in order to provide Malfoy with bodyguards.
