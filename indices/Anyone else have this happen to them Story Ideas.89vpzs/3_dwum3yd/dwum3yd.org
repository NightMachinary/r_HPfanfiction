I currently have some stories running around in my head, but since I usually run into trouble filling in the blanks of the story. Like I can think of a premise or a start for a story, but then from where I start to finishing it is where I lose creativity.

Right now I've got what I'd like to think is a decent AU, somewhat original story with time travel. This one was mostly because it seemed that in all time travel stories Harry becomes this super loved character and tells his parents who he is and they love him and life is good. But I haven't found a properly written story that has Harry take a more dark turn, while still not becoming a Dark Lord himself.
