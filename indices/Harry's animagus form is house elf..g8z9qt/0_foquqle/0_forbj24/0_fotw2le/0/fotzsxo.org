Did you mean to reply to me? I'm confused.

But yes, that's what I mean by saying it's fanon. Harry doesn't do all the chores in the house in canon. He definitely doesn't get never ending lists of things he has to do without food or water, or he'll get beaten. Never happens. We see him cooking for the Dursley's a grand total of once, IIRC, when he's helping Petunia on Dudley's birthday.
