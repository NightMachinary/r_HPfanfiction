He was given all of Dudley's old clothes (while house elves don't get articles of clothing, the ‘clothes' they do wear are tattered), they don't remember his own birthday in CoS “The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake”. The only reason he gets a bedroom in SS is most likely because the letters were addressed to the cupboard. Although, he gets Dudley's old room which is filled with broken toys. In the CoS, he taunts Dudley even after Dudley was verbally making fun of him for not having friends, and this is what Aunt Petunia did: “Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.

Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.”

After the whole dessert exploding incident in the CoS, Vernon put bars on his window, and “He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in the room around the clock.”

This was only the first two books.
