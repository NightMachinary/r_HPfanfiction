Yeah rereading the idea of space warping this doesn't fit exactly but there is a time/space singularity event where both collapse into an event where the threads of space time are broken due to magical events and can be utilized more in the time aspect. This is more of a “living Hogwarts” and Hermione focus fic in all. Sorry I couldn't get spoiler tags working mobile or I'd go into more detail - but one of my favorites ever. The follow up “Bouquet of Asphodel” is really good too so far.
