I wouldn't say that the wizarding culture is that drastically different from the muggle one as they're not completely isolated, there's a constant influx of muggleborns. I could see Malfoy esque old pureblood families following old pagan religions mostly just so that they can be more different from muggle trash.

Atheism might also be quite popular, as biblical miracles aren't that impressive when you can do the same with a simple spell, and religious rituals could just be remnants of early attempts at casting magic by appealing to spirits.

I'm not sure if wizards have definite proof of an afterlife. The Veil is one way, so nobody knows if there's anything but nothingness on the other side. The Resurrection Stone is mostly myth and when we see it in action the spirits it creates don't seem to be very in character, which makes it quite likely that they're fake illusions based on the user's expectations with the goal of drawing the user to suicide. Horcruxes somehow prevent the soul from disappearing, but give no indication of if there's another place for souls to go or if they just vanish. I'm sure Dumbledore believed in afterlife and in the Stone really communicating with it, and Voldemort probably did not believe in a pleasant afterlife.
