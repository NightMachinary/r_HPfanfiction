I don't know the answer to the Anglican question. It was probably English, but that still raises a similar question of how services have changed over time. If Cedric's a solid Anglican, did he learn his habits from a 1662 Book of Common Prayer? Modern Anglicans don't generally use one that old, it's been revised repeatedly since then.

Since the Statute of Secrecy applied worldwide, we know it applied across nominally Catholic societies. Even in Britain, there was a sizeable Catholic minority, so the Latin thing might well have come up.
