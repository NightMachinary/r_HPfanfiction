First let me refer to the older discussion on this topic and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b2b2qj/probably_gonna_catch_some_hate_for_this_religion/eirp9cl/][my contribution]] to it (since then I have found also an excellent stories linkffn(12738075) and linkao3(5537045)).

Second, specifically to your questions:

- I can imagine that with literal witch-hunts at least on its face promulgated by the Church (there is a lot of historical material showing that it was more complicated than that), there was at least in that time (before The International Statute of Secrecy) significant clash with the Christianity.
- However, I believe, that since that, at least because of the influence of Muggleborns and other contacts with the Muggle world, there were some improvements, and that there are now some families of wizards which are traditionally Christian (or of some other religions, but in Britain we are talking probably primarily about Christianity; although, I guess there were less problems with religion in nations which never had witch-hunts --- Patils could be non-problematic Hindus, I guess).
- On average I would think they are roughly as religious as the Muggle population, except there is less pressure to be a member of any church, so there are less Christmas-only Christians (like I would suppose, for example, Dursleys were).
- Mass in Latin is an interesting idea; what was the language of the Mass of the Anglican church in the time of the Statute?
- I am absolutely 100% certain that if there are two Jewish wizards they argue wildly about the rules for Shabbos (BTW, see linkffn(3388041) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/636071]]). Yes, it is my firm head-canon that Grangers are completely secular Jewish family originally called Faktors (which is roughly the German translation of a granger) who emigrated to England from the Czechoslovakia before The Second World War. Comparing to that series, I believe they were completely secularized (as most Jews in the Central Europe were), but that is the only explanation why super-bookish girl in the country with the established church did not know where does “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” come from.
- I don't think any of the main characters are practicing religious people (because somebody would have to mention something). So, either they keep it really private (e.g., linkffn(6494461)), or it is somebody quite distant to the Trio. I quite agree with the general fandom expectations on Cedric Diggory being a Christian, Anthony Goldstein being a Jew, and perhaps Patils being Hindus. My personal feeling is that from teachers the only seriously religious person is Professor Flitwick (that choir sings during the services; sermons of The Fat Friar are incredibly dull and boring, but he is an excellent pastor in the one-on-one dialogues having hundreds years of experience), and yes, I thought that Professor McGonagall was a Presbyterian (somehow in the style of Helen Burns from “Jane Eyre”) even before JKR wrote that she was a daughter of the Muggle Presbyterian pastor. I liked as an idea of linkao3(7292632), Snape being a Roman-Catholic and dealing with his issues in the confessional.
- Yes, I agree with many stories, that the anti-Muggle fanaticism of Death Easters prevents them from being religious in any mainstream religion, and they may try (rather unsuccessfully) practice some pre-Christian religions.
