People dont believe in religions because of miracles, they believe in religions because they agree in their teachings and want what the religion promises them. And nature deities simply dont offer the things that would be most desirable for wizards, most of them barely touch upon things like the afterlife, and if they do its often either a very negative prospect for the majority of people or something very abstracts like reincarnation, promising eternal happiness in heaven for all true worshipers is a much more attractive option.

And even if you just talk about miracles the biggest difference those seems to have comparison to what a wizard could do, is scale. Sure a wizards could probably conjure some annoying creatures, but it would take a wizards at least as skilled as Dumbledore with the Elder Wand to imitate things like the plagues of Egypt and things like the splitting of the ocean would still be beyond them.
