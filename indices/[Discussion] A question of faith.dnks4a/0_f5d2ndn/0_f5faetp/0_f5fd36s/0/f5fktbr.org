Frogs falling from the skies, firstborns dying and swarms of locusts can be easily done with today's biological weapon divisions, nevermind someone with magic. Also, you don't need to be able to do everything, you need to know that it's possible to achieve. Most people can't run a marathon in under 2 hours 10, but since it has been done by a guy recently, we know that it's not a divine sign.

From a magical point of view, most prophets would be seen as little more than Muggle baiting wizards.
