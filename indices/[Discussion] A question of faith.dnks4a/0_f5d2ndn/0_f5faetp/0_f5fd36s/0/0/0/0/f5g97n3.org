We have magicians, fortune tellers, and faith healers though, as in people who are able to convince others that they have special powers, most of their methods dont even require modern technology, you could probably make a case and say that this or that prophet was just a extremely intelligent fraud faking all his miracles with methods we know would theoretically work, but that doesn't really stop people from believing in it. Like have you ever tried to talk to someone who believes in stuff like homeopathy.

But again, miracles dont really play much part in convincing people to follow a religion, the teachings of the religions themselves do.
