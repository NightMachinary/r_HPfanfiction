Sure they could, but a single wizard would struggle a lot with those things, except for resurrection, range seems to be by far the most limiting part of magic, so a prophet achieving all of that with magic could be considered extremely unlikely.

And just because something is theoretically possible doesn't mean people wouldn't attribute it to the divine, take Alexander III of Macedon for example, his skill in warfare was so great that people believed him to be the son of Zeus, even though everything he did was humanly possible.

Like sure you probably get a few people claiming that the prophets were just magic users (which in real life did happen), but it shouldn't really affect the belief in general.
