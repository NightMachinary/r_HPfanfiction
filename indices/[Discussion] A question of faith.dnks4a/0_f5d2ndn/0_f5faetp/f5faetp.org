I would argue that a belief in nature deities is a lot more logical for wizards than the belief in Abrahamic religions. Because the messiah figure or prophets are not really above wizards when it comes to miracles. Lazarus might be the only one not recreatable, other than that it is either basic Hogwarts stuff (eg water to wine) or things which are similar to existing magic, such as temporarily returning from the dead (resurrection stone) or healing illnesses. Hell, half of Jesus miracles can be recreated with dark magic and the other half is basic.
