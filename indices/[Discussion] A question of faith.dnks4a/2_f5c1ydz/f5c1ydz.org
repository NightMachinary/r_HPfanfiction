Probably a belief in natural deities rather than an Abrahamic god. It would make sense if they honoured a magical groove (if naturally occurring) or other places with magic manifesting. Magic is the essence of life, so there could be sacred places where it is left untouched. This would be an individual faith, with some holidays were groups gather (maybe for rituals). Maybe even the common pagan tropes like dancing naked and the like.

Or a pantheon where they worship something akin to half-gods; powerful wizards and witches, maybe not even entirely human, of times long gone who created/shaped the world with their magic, possibly reaching some kind of ascension upon their death where they became one with magic. Some kind of origin myth which explains where magic came from. This one would be more akin to the faiths of antiquity, which had a clear organisation with temples and dedicated followers, but did not control everyday life as much as later religions.

There might be a few cultural leftovers from Christianity, but as you pointed out, I can't see wizards and witches follow a faith whose miracles are stuff all children learn. So no mass or sacraments.
