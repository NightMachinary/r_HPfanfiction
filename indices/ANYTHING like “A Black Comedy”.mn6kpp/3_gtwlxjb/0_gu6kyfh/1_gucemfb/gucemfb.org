Basically Harry has James Potter's memories and is now a fusion of both. Named Harry James Potter in the Marauder's Map.

The Sorting Hat swears a lot, and is very present in the story.

When I read it, I felt Harry's anger at times, and so, was impressed by the author's ability to make the reader feel the story.

It's in First Person POV.
