Basically James's memories end up in Harry's body post his death and after the dementor incident at the end of POS, Harry begins accessing those memories. The Sorting Hat becomes Harry's trusted guide and advisor and he is a foul-mouthed scrap of cloth that brings much of the potty humour and occasional gravitas to the proceedings. The one-two punch between Harry and the Sorting Hat is what makes the fic excellent imho.

The author also completely revamps the Triwizard tournament and makes it much more exciting. There are elements of Indie!Harry, but the story is a bit old and I felt those elements were handled well.
