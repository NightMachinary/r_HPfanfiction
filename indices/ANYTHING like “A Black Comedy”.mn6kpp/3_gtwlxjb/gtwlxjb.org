I would say Nonjon's brand of humour is unique unto itself. His "YOU WHAT?" Trilogy leaves me in stitches to this day.

For some high crack fun, try Dear Order: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order]]

Other than that, JBern's Lie I've Lived is good for a chuckle if you like swearing and lad humour: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]
