Yes, and the correct mental state is properly focusing on a happy memory or scenario. Harry already knew that.

Perhaps you should reread of the books. Seeing as you're clearly unfamiliar with the source material, I'll let you know that the patronus has nothing to do with thoughts of your father. In fact, when Harry teaches it to the DA he doesn't tell them even once to realize that it wasn't their dead father casting it. Neither does he require them to see their time traveling selves do so. Those aren't requirements.
