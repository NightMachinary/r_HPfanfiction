He does it successfully that exact same night.

If we know that he was consistently practicing from the quidditch game encounter to the one with Sirius, we might assume that he was steadily improving and therefore wouldn't have been capable of casting it near dementors back then. Though that requires that we also assume that continuously practicing it without nearby dementors translates into being more capable of it in presence of dementors.
