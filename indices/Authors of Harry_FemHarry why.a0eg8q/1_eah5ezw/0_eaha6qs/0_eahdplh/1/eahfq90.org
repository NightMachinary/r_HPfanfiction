I quite like this pairing, (for pretty much the same reason as the original commenter in this thread) but I feel abit of a warning on "Equal and Opposite" is appropiate. This fic, is dark. It is twisted, and it is at times an almost toxic thing to read, as if by doing so, you are somehow letting something into your head that does not belong there. It is also bloody brilliant. It at least, the first part is. Its plot perfectly matches the tone and feeling it inspires in its readers, and that is something that rare to the point of absurdity. That being said, I literally cannot comment on anything past a certain point because of what I said earlier, it got into my head and fucked shit up like a bull in a china shop. I eventually had to stop reading because it felt like I was being exposed to a toxic material, I dreaded whatever was coming next and absolutely could not wait to get there. My reading experience was simply not healthy. It should be noted that I was somewhat depressed when I started reading, which most certainly had an effect on the story's impact on me, but regardless I feel that anyone approaching this story should know what they are getting into before hand. A story with an almost overwhelming intensity that, at the very least, explores some of the darker parts of the human mind and heart. If you are psychologically unstable, DO NOT READ. If you are in fact stable, and willing to brave the storm, then by all means go ahead, and try to appreciate it while you're there. Because I imagine you won't be coming back for a while.
