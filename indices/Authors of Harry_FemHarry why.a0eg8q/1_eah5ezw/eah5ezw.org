Harry's life is hard. He doesn't share much but carries a lot of difficult burdens. If he were to approach or be approached by someone who knows /exactly/ what he's gone through, the sense of kinship would be overwhelming.

It's wrong, inappropriate, but for a person (or two people) carrying a burden of destiny and the expectation of a short lifespan, why not reach out for that absolute understanding? If the one can forgive the other, then maybe they both can forgive themselves.
