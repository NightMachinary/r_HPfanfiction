Not only that, but the person who understands you best is yourself and frankly:

Loving yourself (even if that self happens to be in another body and of the other gender) is quite healthy :) - hell, you might learn something because you can bounce your ideas off of somebody with similar experiences (without talking to yourself, which often doesn't help!)
