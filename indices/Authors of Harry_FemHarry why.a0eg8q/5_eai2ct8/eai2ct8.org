If Harry meets fem!Harry late enough, the sibling kinship will fail, potentially leading to this. Not that it is /right/ according to normal society rules, but...

Personally I never cared much for the incest taboo in first place, as long as people are aware of the pregnancy reprecussions (and thus avoid it), and all other morals are maintained. With that said, Harry/fem!Harry isn't something I read myself. Not because it repulses me, but because I'm simply indifferent to the pairing.
