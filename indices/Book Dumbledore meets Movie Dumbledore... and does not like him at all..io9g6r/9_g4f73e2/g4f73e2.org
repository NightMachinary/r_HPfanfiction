In don't only see Book Dumbledore intervening in GoF. Everybody always remembers calmly - but nobody thinks about how Michael Gambons Dumbledore (I don't call him Movie Dumbledore because I think Richard Harris did a decent job) hurt Ron at the end of PoA. Book Dumbledore and Richard Harris' Dumbledore never would have done that. The End of PoA was Gambons first big mistake, not calmly.
