Snape was demonstrating non-verbal spells with Harry. Harry used a verbal spell (Expelliarmus I think) to throw him into a desk. Snape scolded him, Harry said something, Snape said "...sir" and Harry responded "No need to call me sir". It's a bit of a cheeky response. Tell it to a professor that you have just attacked (even if for academic purpose) and I'm sure it means you're looking for trouble.
