Off-topic, but the only detentions that Harry and Ron received from Snape were quite justified: Ron for yelling at Snape in class, Harry and Ron for calling a professor names (no matter how unfair he seems, as a student you're still not supposed to call a professor names), Harry for a being a smartass and Harry for almost killing a fellow student and lying about it.
