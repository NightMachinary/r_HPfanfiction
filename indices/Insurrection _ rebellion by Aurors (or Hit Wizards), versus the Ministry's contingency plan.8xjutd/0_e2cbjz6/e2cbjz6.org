I think I read something like this before - harry starts off as a shadow wolf and eventually gets partnered with Tonks as an auror before eventually fudge goes tyrannical and bones launches a coup against him resulting in a full fight in the halls of the ministry during what is technically Harry's fifth year. Probably not what you meant but look it up? It's called wolf by damonblade. Linkffn:4807588 I think that's how the link is supposed to work?
