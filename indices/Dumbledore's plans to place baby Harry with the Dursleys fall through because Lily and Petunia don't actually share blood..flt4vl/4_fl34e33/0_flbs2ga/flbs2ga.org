Oh god! Now I'm with this scene In my head where a very drunk Dumbledore stops his battle with Voldemort at the ministry to try convincing him to take Harry in during the summer to protect him from Voldemort. Voldemort's questioning Dumbledore's sanity, Dumbledore is doing the whole condescending grandfather routine while ignoring how illogical it actually is and Harry going all “Meh, he can't be worst than living with the Dursley's” and is all for it.

And after the battle both Harry and Dumbledore start sending letters to Voldemort about Harry living with him, them grow tired of being ignored and Harry just starts to ramdomly crashing in Voldemort's bases, all the while a progressively more incredulous Voldemort tries to shake him of his tail.
