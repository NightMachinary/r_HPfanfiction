In an abstract sense, yes. I currently have 14 WIPs to finish and another 92 ideas-for-fics (and yes, I keep count), so it really depends on when I get my current batch done, which could take awhile. Or possibly not, given how much free time half the world has now. :D

I will definitely write it at some point though, even if someone else takes the idea from here first. I plan to post some 'Self-promotion' threads whenever I start writing for HP, so I'll definitely let people know when I take a thwack at things. :)

They're not HP fics, those 14 WIPS, in case you were about to ask - they're for Life is Strange.
