I mean, I think it'd be funnier if he was a Muggle and got in anyway. Link in those "A muggle actor has gotten really far into the Wizarding world and doesn't know what to do" prompts. But, he is to Magical things what Arthur is to Muggle things.

"Ah yes, Harry. Transgifure that thing already and lets go."

"Actually, Count Olaf, it's Transfigure and-"

"No, it's Trans-JIF-fer. Test failed, tiny magical person. Test failed."

And, since he insists on being referred to as Count, there could be a whole lot of lampshading of Lordship tropes.

"Of course Magical Lords dress like this. I am a Magical Count and this is my Giant Fur Cape!"

"You mean you don't wear family rings passed down from generation to generation through your family? Why, I remember the day Great Aunt... Great Aunt..." /clicks fingers at troupe member/ "What was her name?"

"Meltadora"

"Yes! Great Aunt Meltadora. Such a shame how she went. Strangled to death by a passing Emu. Deadly things, you know. The jailbirds down in New Zealand lost a war to them."

"Australia."

"Same thing. Deadly things, funny accents, lots of sheep, who cares."

And so on and so forth. :D
