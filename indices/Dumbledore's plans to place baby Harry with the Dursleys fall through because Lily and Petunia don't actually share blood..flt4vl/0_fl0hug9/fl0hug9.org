I always wanted to see a Series of Unfortunate Events style fic where the Dursleys died as well and Dumbledore just desperately bounces Harry from prospective parent to prospective parent as stuff keeps happening to them that means they can no longer take care of Harry (Harry's incredible Hogwarts-era bad luck, coming in regularly).
