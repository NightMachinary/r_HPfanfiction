The stories of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Black-INK/71873/][Mr Black]] are very entertaining if you haven't gotten to read them yet. There are crossovers of Naruto, Marvel and StarTrek just to name a few. I'm sure you can find something to catch your fancy there. The story that spawned all of that world it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]].

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13034223/1/A-Discordant-Note][A Discordant Note]] is a HP/GoT crossover. But you may want to read the first part, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]], before you jump into that or you'll be lost otherwise since Noodlehammer changed *a lot* of the canon.
