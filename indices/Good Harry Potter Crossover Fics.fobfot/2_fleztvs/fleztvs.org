[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10884033][Ninja Wizard Book 3]] can be read as a stand-alone if you are willing to accept that this Harry is ooc. It is a crossover with Avatar the Last Airbender and is complete at 185k. Harry is not romantically involved in the story but it sets up his pairing for the sequels. The series as a whole is complete (and really long) and is one of my favorites.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255][Whispers in Corners]] is also complete at 64k and is a crossover with Sherlock. It is slash.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]] has a few HP crossovers, some complete some not.
