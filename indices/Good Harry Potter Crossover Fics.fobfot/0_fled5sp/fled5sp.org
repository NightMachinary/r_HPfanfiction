A couple of my favorites are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future]] This is a Harry Potter Marvel crossover. well over a million words and still going strong , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher]] By the same author as A Third Path and is a DXD crossover. ,[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12853038/1/Swords-and-Roses]] this is a crossover with Game of Thrones/ A Song of Fire and Ice. It's complete and very well written , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12397161/1/Same-Song-Different-Verse]] The idea of this one is borrowed from an unfinished story by Plums from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3136818/plums]] . It's a star wars cross over about what if Harry appeared on Felucia right as order 66 is given.
