If you want one that follows an mc female oc that goes into the de as she grows to be a spy I got one. The Dursley's when Harry is a baby are tricked to send him away to a â€˜boarding school' that's strict in boys, like the one they tell aunt marge he attends anyways. He lives with the Dursley's for the required two weeks a year to keep Lily's protection spell but then mainly lives with Regulus, Remus and a disguised Sirius who escaped from Azkaban a short way into his sentence along with Neville who Regulus got custody of and Sirius' daughter my oc. There's tons of world building and new events and enemies along the way until eventually the third Wizarding War begins and threatens to destroy the Muggle and Wizarding world.

Summary - In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.
