It's different from the books. Definitely an au. I know the founders idea was one of my oldest ideas for the series back when the books were still coming out so I stuck with it because it makes more sense in the third book when making allies in the new world they escape to.

It's a niche series, it's ok if it's not your thing. It's just the opening to save having to rehash it when oc uses the book later, it all plays in later on into the series and two books after. You did say you wanted world building and new magic in the description.
