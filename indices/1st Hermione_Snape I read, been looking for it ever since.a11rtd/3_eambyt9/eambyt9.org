It could be linkffn(Camerado by MillieJoan) but I think she knew ahead of time in that one.

There are actually a number of fics that it could be - Secret Sixth Year is one of my favourite tropes - I know Slytherpouf has done one, and linkffn(Hermione Granger and the HBP by Grangerous) is a good example of the trope - the story has three parts and ends about a year after the final battle, so I don't think it could be that.

If you could give me more details about it, I might be able to narrow it down (although the potions thing is already helpful, most people go with secret Occlumency lessons).

Is Snape still alive at the end? Do they get a HEA?

(PM me for a Snape-positive Discord server link, if you're interested.)
