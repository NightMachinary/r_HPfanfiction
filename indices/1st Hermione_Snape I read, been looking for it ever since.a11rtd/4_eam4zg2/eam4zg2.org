Honestly that's pretty much bashing poor Hermione, it's like bringing her down to something worst than her Lockhart moment.. Snape's almost 40, has a horrible personality and isn't exactly good looking. He also hates muggles.. What exactly would Hermione find attractive in him especially when she has much more appropriate individuals all over the place?

Seriously, I find this pairings the most hideous form of bashing, because it isn't even intended as such.
