There has been a calculation made that predicted the population around 15.000 british wizards and witches.

Rowling once said that Hogwarts houses around 1000 students (~142/year). So one explanation would be that the year of 91 was an exceptionally low populated one, maybe due to the dire time during which they were conceived. We never really get good estimates on other years, so data is hard to come by.

However, if you set your numbers somewhere around the 100k citizen mark, other schools or education paths are a necessity.

I personally like the idea that one big additional branch of education are Master-Apprentice relationships. A Master would be responsible for the thorough education of the Apprentice to at least OWL levels, and may optionally lead his student to NEWTS. However, the purpose of this arrangement is to train a young magical in the craft or magic branch the Master is proficient in.

I also once read the idea that Diagon Alley, the Ministry, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are just the closest the wizarding world gets towards the muggles and muggleborns. Its the world in-between the muggle one and the world of real, profound magic. These other enclaves are more insular and have their own schools, with knowledge they defend viciously.

Another idea, of course, is that there are just a lot of other schools around Britain that are freely accessible.

There really is no limit once you separate from strict canon.
