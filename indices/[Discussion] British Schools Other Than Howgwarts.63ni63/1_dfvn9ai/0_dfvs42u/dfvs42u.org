Yeah I saw the 1000 student figure somewhere too, but then if 91 was only 40 kids... who knows? I definitely think the war would be a good explanation if 91's an outlier.

The Apprenticeship idea sounds interesting and honestly pretty plausible. I mean, I recall there being opportunities for further education after Hogwarts, and always imagined that there'd be a wizarding equivalent for a college education in a specific field, but craftsmen might have a different system outside of standardized education.

The idea of the magical society we see in the books being an almost in-between world blending some muggle elements with a fully magical people is kinda iffy for me though. I mean, it kinda lessens the significance of the plot if Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort et al. weren't really all they were cracked up to be in the grand scheme of things and there was a more arcane society with its own leaders that outclassed them. Plus, I always saw the magical world in Harry Potter as an evolution of that more mystical magical world after the Statute of Secrecy prevented muggles from interacting with wizards nearly as much. The magical world developed just as the muggle one did, just in a slightly different way ofc. It'd be an interesting idea for an AU though.

And yeah, deviating from canon is half the fun in (reading) fanfics for me. As long as it's done well, it's usually a fresh take on exploring the world and characters in a different way.
