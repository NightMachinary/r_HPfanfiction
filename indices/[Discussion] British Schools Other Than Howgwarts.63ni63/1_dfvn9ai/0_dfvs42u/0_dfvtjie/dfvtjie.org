Yeah, unfortunately the execution of the second idea wasn't very good when I read it. But I did like the idea that there are communities out there that are even more isolated and insular than the wizarding world muggleborns and muggle-raised see at first. I think the idea there came from the fact that a lot of Magical Britain just wasn't very /magical/. I explicitly remember that the author wrote that Ottery St.Catchpole was such a community. When Harry went over the hill to the house of the Diggorys, he'd found a village of a thousand people, a small school that specializes in magical farming, Care of magical creatures and herbology, as well as just a community of magical farmers who all think that Arthur Weasley should've really put his foot down and make at least some of his children go to school in Ottery. Harry then finds enclaves who are even stranger, and had their roots much deeper in british history. Runesmiths who were direct descendants of the last Vikings in the North of Scotland. Enclaves that still practiced druidism. And all of it was a world you weren't invited to if you didn't already know about it.

There was never really talk about there being just way better wizards and witches in those communities than Dumbledore or Grindelwald. They just had different sets of traditions and focused more on some magic. The sheer talent and power of Dumbledore was still respected and admired by them, even if he was taught in a culture that was closer to muggles than they were.

Anyway, I liked the idea, but the execution was sub-par.
