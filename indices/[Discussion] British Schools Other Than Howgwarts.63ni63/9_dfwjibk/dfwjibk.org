One of the great things about Potterverse is that JKR left a lot of wriggle room. Nothing in canon disputes the existence of other English schools. (In fact, the fact there is whole bureaucracy around magical education, examinations and discipline, means that there is, at the very least, a large number of homeschooled children.)

Personally, I favour a larger wizarding Britain (as is reflected by wizarding society's popular culture, infrastructure and government). This means multiple schools -- although Hogwarts is presumably the most reputable. These other schools would likely have a higher proportion of muggleborns and/or specialise in certain fields.
