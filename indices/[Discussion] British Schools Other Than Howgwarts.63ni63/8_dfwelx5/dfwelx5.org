The whole question can be traced back to economics though. [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/60918/what-is-the-economic-system-of-the-potterverse]] has a great summary of what it probably is (tldr its "post-scarcity economy" combined with "late feudal/early bourgeois trade system")

I say this because you have to trace where everyone gets their employment from, resources from, etc. You have a huge government, a sports league that has many teams and lots of players, and lots of rich old families, for some easy examples.

If we assume that people 1) specialize and 2) have an economy based on magical skill combined with resource ownership/manipulation, then we see that we have a school that gives basic education (OWLs) and then a societal path ends up becoming that apprentice-ship based post-scarcity world we know of (all these trade shops utilizing resources, as an example). NEWTs are a way of specializing, and you can either in the public arena or private arena (ministry or business, pretty much).

So, I think that there are lots of kids at Hogwarts, and based on how the society works, has pretty much everyone go to hogwarts but with very different results afterward, and decisions made in it (what classes are taken, tests passed etc)

The point is that you have to run this economy that we see glimpses of (huge gov, businesses, social and economic classes, communities). I don't have a number to tell you for how many students should be at Hogwarts, but I think that there always will be a steady % of Britain's overall population that is magic, and that number has to be enough to service all that Magical England has going on.
