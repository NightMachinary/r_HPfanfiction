Any solution that claims that there are other British schools than Hogwarts needs to answer two questions:

(1) How come Hogwarts accepts Muggleborns? If Hogwarts is so good and so prestigious, why would they turn up wizards and witches for people that have no magical training?

(2) How come the kids of society's elite also go there? Especially those prejudiced against these muggle borns? If homeschooling was an option, for example, why wouldn't the rich just homeschool their kids?

I haven't found any fic that addresses both of these questions well because, to be fair, I don't know if there is even a solution. Until then, my headcannon can't support there being more than 1 magic school in the UK.
