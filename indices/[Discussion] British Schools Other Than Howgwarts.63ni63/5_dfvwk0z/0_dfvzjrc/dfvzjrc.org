I believe that the logic would be thus:

(1) Hogwarts accepts Muggleborns because the current Headmaster is famously pro-muggleborn, as were several of the Founders. They're not passing over pure-bloods or half-bloods for Muggleborns, either; from what we've seen, the school doesn't appear to limit the number of students it accepts (there seems to be little evidence to the contrary). The only school that does not accept Muggleborns is Durmstrang, insofar as I am aware.

(2) Because Hogwarts, despite the pro-Muggle sentiment, is lauded as "the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world," according to one (admittedly biased) source. Regardless, it has produced two of the three greatest wizards in the past century: Voldemort and Dumbledore, and continues to graduate competent young wizards and witches. Protesting blood purity is all very well, up until it costs you something (like a quality education).

Furthermore, chances are that the old families have attended Hogwarts since time immemorial; it's something of a status symbol/tradition, and not something they are likely to stop doing. Sending children abroad is taxing in many ways; many wizards and witches have neither the time nor the inclination nor the skill to teach their own children. Hogwarts is also where competent young pure-bloods can begin to form power bases and friendships that will be beneficial in the future.
