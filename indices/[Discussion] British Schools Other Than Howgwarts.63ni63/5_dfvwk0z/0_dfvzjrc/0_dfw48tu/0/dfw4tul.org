By all accounts, most people do go to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the largest magical school in the United Kingdom, and most people go there. Some extremists probably don't for the very reasons you listed, but the vast majority of wizards do.

Any other schools would be very small, with probably less than a score of students, and they'd offer something that Hogwarts didn't: they'd be close to home, obsessive about blood purity, or offer instruction in more obscure (or illegal) branches of magic. They exist because they offer a more palatable alternative to homeschooling or schooling abroad. It's much like wondering why private schools exist when state schools already do.
