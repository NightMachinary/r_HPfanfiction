For my headcanon, there are a bunch of academies spread throughout the country where small clusters of teachers do their best to cover the basics of Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology, Potions and Care of Creatures. Their programs aim to get the students to pass at least three OWLs by the time they're adults so that they can legitimately carry a wand and get licensed for Apparation and such. The most gifted will be encouraged to try for a NEWT or two.

The value of the NEWT is for the application for apprenticeship to a Master or to work in the Ministry, and obviously these aren't the ones who normally would make it as Aurors.

Since they are generally rural & community-based, their attendance is limited to half-bloods and purebloods, though if a muggleborn were to show up in their range, they'd offer them a spot- partly because they'd suspect someone locally had been 'plying the fields' and just never went back to explain why their poor paramour's child has devil powers.

By contrast, Hogwarts is the Eton/Oxford of schools, though the entrance isn't limited by tuition cost so much as talent and ambition (or legacy).

EDIT: In fact, it could be that Hogwarts only detects and registers the most promising of muggleborns with the rest being referred to nearby academies. The ones we know of were notable (though the fact that they're notable enough for Harry to notice them might invalidate the argument). Lily and Hermione were top students, Dean was an artist, Penny Clearwater was a prefect, Justin Finch-Fletchley came from wealth and education, even the Creevey brothers were audacious in their way, with Colin figuring out the nuances of magical photography in his first year without any guidance.
