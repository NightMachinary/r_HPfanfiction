People could just deny their Hogwarts acceptance in favor of home schooling too. Read the story of Isolt Sayre and Gormlaith Gaunt. I really liked that bit of additional canon, even it goes even furthur in the black/white tones that everything is portrayed in.

In Canon, Hagrid came and forced the issue, so we don't know how it goes for muggle born really. I dont think that all the parents would be convinced to send their children off to a place they cant ever visit or talk to others about just on the basis of some random funky man/woman coming and putting on some shows and taking them to a magical alley. There would have to have been dissenters and disbelievers and haters. Short of making them forget everything and think their child goes to some prestigious school and use some magic to keep them from asking questions, I don't see how it would be possible.

And of course we know magicals who would prefer home schooling for many reasons, like not wanting to be associated with muggleborns, cost, inconvinience or even just tradition and preference.
