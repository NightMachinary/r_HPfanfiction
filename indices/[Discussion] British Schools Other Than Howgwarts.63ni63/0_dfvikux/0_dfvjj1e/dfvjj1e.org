Yeah I forgot to mention it, but homeschooling does seem to be a likely option. You gotta wonder exactly how the Hogwarts students are chosen though, it must suck for those who're left out.

Not too sure about how many would send their kids abroad, though, as that's probably pretty expensive and the kids might want to stay abroad with their friends and colleagues, which just leads to the same population drain.

Rowling's number issues do seem to be pretty bad lol, although maybe she just didn't want to write down names and houses for more than 40 kids, half of whom weren't even really used lol. If it were upped to 40 kids per house per year you'd have a perfectly reasonable native population of about 24,000.

Also, thanks for pointing me to the whole Eleven Schools thing, had no idea that even existed.
