I think it quite probable that some of the Darker families send their children to Durmstrang; other families may send theirs to Beauxbatons. There are also innumerable smaller schools that are not counted among the Eleven Schools.

Homeschooling is certainly an option, and I shouldn't be surprised if a great many wizards are home-schooled. It fits right in with the general history of magic as we know it: a secretive art, with knowledge passed from master to apprentice throughout the generations. Correspondence courses are probably also common.

Remember too, Rowling was famously bad at maths; in all likelihood, the Hogwarts class size should be quite different. Canonically, there are 35-36 students per House Year.
