True, Hogwarts is supposed to be this innumerably large castle, yet we've only gotten as far as seven floors into it, I think? Also, how are there no 'Wizarding Specialisation Tests' for Hogwarts students? One would think that it would be mandated by the Ministry, given how intrusive they are with everything else (your wand being the prime example). I was hoping that we would get five more years of Hogwarts based on that premise, with Harry sort of getting into more esoteric fields of Magic, learning more advanced techniques and spells, learning what field of magic he is truly meant for, etc... While struggling through the aftermath of the war, and the rising threats of New Dark Lords following Voldemort's lead and example.
