I like the educational setup described in linkffn(The Marriage Stone). Wizards have a very large population than described in the books. Hogwarts is for the cream of the crop in terms of magical ability. After that, there are more "regular" schools that are day or boarding, vocational schools, and then homeschooling for those with barely any magic. This setup is also hinted at in linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom).

I think this makes sense, since people do seem to have varying ranges of magical ability (ex: Stan Shunpike vs Severus Snape) and it makes sense to separate that way to better educate adolescents. I think canon has a similar setup, with Hogwarts and 3-4 more day/vocational schools that are a bit more local to an area. Also, parents would send their kids abroad if they wished.
