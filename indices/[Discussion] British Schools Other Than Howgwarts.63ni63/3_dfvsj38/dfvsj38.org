We have this lovely article: [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm]]

Author of that agrees that Harry's year is small, as are the ones around it. Their conclusion based on derivations from muggle culture (so many people per pub in a town, so many workers vs upper admin in Ministry, Qdt World Cup info) is that Magical UK ~ 10,000. Rougly 1:6000 wizard to muggle. /In the UK./

Also he suggests that Hogsmeade is a bustling mini metro of 2000. My problem with this is that Hogsmeade must basically be the cultural hub of Wizarding UK. Yet Diagon Alley has more pull and a wider variety of shops. I think his Hogsmeade numbers are a bit off. Still, he contends that kids from Hogsmeade would be day students (they 'live out') and therefore wouldn't crowd Hermione's dorm. OH! THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE!

... Except during Harry's 5th year when Umbridge is carefully controlling access to the school. Would one of her decrees be 'for security reasons, everyone resides'?

[Forgot the chart]

Amongst muggle humans (based on 2000 Census figures)...

- 22% are under 11
- 16% are 11-18 [Hogwarts school age]
- 44% are between 19 and 50
- leaving ~ 18% being 50 or older. This is also when women start outnumbering men

So if 16% of the magical population in the UK and total UK magi population ~10,000... but wait. We should drop their percentage to 12% - due to extended lifespans adding to the over 50 set. 12% of 10,000 = 1200 students of Hogwarts age. Looks like at most half of them are going to Hogwarts.
