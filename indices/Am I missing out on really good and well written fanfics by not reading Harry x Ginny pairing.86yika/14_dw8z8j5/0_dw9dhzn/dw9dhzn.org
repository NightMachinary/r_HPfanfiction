How much R/Hr is a dealbreaker for you? For example, if in an H/G fic, there is literally only a line or a paragraph saying something along the lines of "R/Hr are married and here are their children Rose and Hugo, now I'll shut up about R/Hr for good and focus exclusively on H/G", would you still not read it? Because I think that in H/G fics, there is a spectrum from "there is 0 R/Hr" to "R/Hr go on constant double dates with H/G".
