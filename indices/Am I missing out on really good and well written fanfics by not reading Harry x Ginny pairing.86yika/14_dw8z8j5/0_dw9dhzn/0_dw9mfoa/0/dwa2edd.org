I like Molly. My opinion of her does tend to swing around a bit, but I'll be honest - she suffers from bad writing. JK needed Harry to stay with the Dursleys, but she didn't want them to be anything more than maybe two chapters at the start of the books, and a few lines at the end. And thus, all adults who otherwise care about Harry quite a lot, suddenly become unable to do anything more than send a hamper if food, and glare at them.

Also - what could she do about the Dursleys? Nothing. Just because she has magic and they are Muggles, doesn't give her the right to override them as guardians. Ask anyone who had a neglected friend growing up; their parents could do no more than Molly could.

Who do I have a problem with? Arthur. He was a shit dad who ducked out whenever shit got tough. Of course Molly was not the best mum - she had to be a dad, too. Arthur was a foolish man who broke his own laws, and refused to parent his kids. He, and his whole family, had the potential to be in serious shit over that car, but of course, Molly is the one who gets censured for scolding her son - obviously acceptable in that society.

Let's not even mention his setting up the floo without the homeowner's permission. Or even an invitation.
