I have read good Ron/Hermione pairings, but all of them ended up in a smutty threesome with a permanent triad to follow.

As for a normal R/Hr relationship, my biggest issue with them is that by the end of book seven, IMO they are really incompatible due to the baggage from their past. During the books, Harry is clueless about girls, but Ron can get downright insulting. For the relationship to be believable, they need to grow up and take things slowly (same applies for pretty much any postwar fic, but that's an entire different can of worms). And by take it slow, I mean not getting married straight after the eighth year but live together for several years afterwards.

And perhaps my biggest gripe with Ron/Hermione is it ending with the "big happy Weasley family" trope, which I utterly despise. My opinion of Molly Weasley is as low as it can get because she claims to care about Harry, is angry about the Dursleys, and yet never does anything about it despite knowing by CoS. As someone with personal experience with getting abused, that is simply unforgivable and if she has any place in Harry's life, I'm instantly out. Ron/Hermione usually has her in, so it's a red flag. If Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione do their own thing, I'd be in.

Ron/Hermione also leads to all of them working in the Ministry, something I find rather boring and really unfitting for Harry, who just won a war. He really should do something besides hunting dark wizards. Any of the trio working for the organisation who was busy running their own Final Solution a few months ago without some Stalin level of purge is rather is implausible.

R/Hr usually is a symptom of a lot of things I don't like and therefore serves as red flag to filter stories. Also, I feel like that pairing has a lot of baggage, which needs to be addressed on screen. I think that the pairing can work, but I've yet to see a decent one outside of smut oneshots.
