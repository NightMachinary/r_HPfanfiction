See, I agree with the “big happy Weasley family” trope being annoying, but instead of it being Ron/Hermione, it's Harry/Ginny that bothers me. In the story I'm writing right now (different from the H/G one), I'm about to have Ron tell Harry, “You don't have to marry my sister for you to be a part of my family. You already are.”

As for Molly, both she and Lupin have a redemption in my H/G story. When they find out the blood protection is rendered useless (Voldemort has Harry's blood so he can waltz in any time he wants), they give Dumbledore the metaphorical finger and immediately remove Harry from the Dursley residence. Otherwise she's barely featured in my other stories.
