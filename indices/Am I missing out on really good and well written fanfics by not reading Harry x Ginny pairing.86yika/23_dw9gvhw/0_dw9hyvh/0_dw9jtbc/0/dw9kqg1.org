Yeah, that's what I meant when I agreed. But when you don't like most of the characters, it's hard to find a fic, isn't it? I've never seen a Filch/Trelawney or Snape/Dobby. Well, I had a Snape/Narcissa as a minor couple, cheating on Lucius, and I must agree, it was fun. Malfoy jr, the slimy coward wasn't pleased at all.
