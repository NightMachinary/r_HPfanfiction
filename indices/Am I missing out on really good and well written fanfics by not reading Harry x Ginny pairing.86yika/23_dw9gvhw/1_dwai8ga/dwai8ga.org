Same here. I don't feel I'm missing out on too much because I avoid H/G, H/Hr, and Tonks, but that's because I can't stand the pairings. If you dislike a pairing, you aren't missing anything by not reading it.

I feel this isn't a good sub for disliking those characters though. The other end is Drarry/Snarry/Tomarry, and you actively dislike slash so what exactly do you read?
