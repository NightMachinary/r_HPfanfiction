It depends how much you dislike the pairing, I personally don't read any Ginny, Tonks or Hermione fics and while that limits most of my reading to nothing nowadays I dislike those pairings enough that even if I somehow love a fic at the start the second I see the pairing turn towards one of them I lose any interest in those stories. Lately I can't even stomach fics where Hermione is too relevant.

If you just think that it's too vanilla or something and don't have a personal distaste for any of the characters then you probably are missing out on some amazing fics.
