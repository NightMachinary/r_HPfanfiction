Probably. You'll find at least a few good fics for pretty much every pairing.

My favorite short one is Compromise: A Love Story linkao3(1181280). I love Ginny's characterization in there and how she and Harry interact with each other. I think Harry/Ginny fics can get too sappy sometimes, to the point where it doesn't really feel like them. The best ones are the fics that keep in mind Harry and Ginny are both stubborn, quick-tempered, and a bit mean.
