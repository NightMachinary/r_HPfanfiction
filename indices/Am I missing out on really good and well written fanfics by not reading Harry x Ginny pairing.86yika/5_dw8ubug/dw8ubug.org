Eh, a few. Honestly, a lot of the ones in my Favorites list don't hold up well, but there are good ones out there. Late canon fics like linkffn(10467472). A few aftermath fics like linkffn(11317075), although that's about the only one I really like.

And of course, there's linkffn(9818387), which is by far the best Soul Bond fic and actually pulls off the trope with realistic character development.
