Lol well the statistics refute that too pretty harshly too, though.

Pornhub actually released a lot of their data about it. Women's top 3 categories were lesbian, gay, andddd then bondage (women being tied up, used and abused) - in that order.

I feel like I'm just being overly disagreeable here but I don't think that your reasoning is accurate either. Women almost universally prefer to be submissive.

At the end of the day our fantasies don't often reflect our genuine desires for real life, so I don't mind what women like at all but it is still curious to me.
