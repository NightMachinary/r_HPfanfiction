I haven't done any research, but especially with younger women - I always liked in slash that the characters could be "equals".

In media, you see a lot of rape, and abuse, and talking down from, and "oh my old lady hur hur", and the heros GF just cheering him on, etc, just generally women being secondary in relationships. In slash - both partners are men, and equal.

Like I said, just a theory of mine.
