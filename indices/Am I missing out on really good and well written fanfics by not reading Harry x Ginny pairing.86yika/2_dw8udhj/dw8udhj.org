Yellow Submarine is a post-war teacher Harry fic that has some dark tones to it with Ginny (as a 7th year student) dealing with rape and Harry not knowing exactly what to do, but wanting to help her out while also dealing with his own issues.

It's my #1 favorite fic of all time, especially when it comes to romance which in my opinion is VERY rarely well done.

It encapsulates the (realistic) obscene sexuality of most guys around this age that the vast majority of girl authors don't do well at all or seem to even understand (it's actually written by a girl, but she's very brilliant).

Smut authors (who are mostly horny wish fulfillment males) go way too far on the other end of the spectrum, making males degenerate sex addicts.

It's extremely relatable if you're a guy especially, since I feel like masculinity gets kind of warped by most authors but she does a brilliant job and makes a very likeable Harry.

It also has an actual plot line that's decent, a ton of character growth and development and you get really emotionally involved in the story.
