Yeah it's pretty harsh how it all happens, too... not for the faint of heart when it comes to tragedy or those who don't cope well with sexual trauma.

I'm a not super emotional grown ass man and it made me cry. It's brutal and devastating to put yourself in those shoes. But honestly it was so much more powerful to me because of it and the resolution is better too.
