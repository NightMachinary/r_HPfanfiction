I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10714425/1/Messing-With-Time][Messing With Time]]. It's in progress, basically abandoned, but the story opens with a depiction of two very broken people who have managed to fill in each other's gaps, and I feel in love with it by the end of the third paragraph.
