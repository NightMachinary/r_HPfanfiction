Here are all the ones off the top of my head plus my brief thoughts

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Pros: long, some very amusing portions/lines. Cons: Pushes a cultlike, crazy philosophy that pushes Bayesianism haaaaard. Much better story if you view it as crack and not a serious tale. Hermione in Ravenclaw.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) Been awhile since I read all the way through it. I'm finding the most recent chapters to be not anywhere near as good as the earlier stuff. Hermione in Slytherin.

linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina) I don't know why I'm telling you about this one, because it is terrible. Hermione in Slytherin.

linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI) Amusing, but not great. The Lupin focused sections are better than all other sections. Hermione in Ravenclaw.

linkffn(Great Things by redfoxrabbit) Still a fairly early fic, though it is the only Ollivander raises Harry fic that I know of. First year feels kind of canon-rehashy, but I feel like that is going to change after this. Hermione in Ravenclaw.

I don't think I've ever read a Hermione in Hufflepuff story.
