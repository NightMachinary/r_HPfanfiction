I was about to say Hermione would make a terrible Hufflepuff but, well, she /is/ hardworking and loyal. Hmfp. Not very patient or a believer in fair play though. I also don't think she's very kind, at least not in the selfless sense. (Not that she's selfish, mind you, but she isn't likely to help a stranger if there's a chance it could be detrimental to herself, loved ones, or education- not without a failsafe, anyhow.)
