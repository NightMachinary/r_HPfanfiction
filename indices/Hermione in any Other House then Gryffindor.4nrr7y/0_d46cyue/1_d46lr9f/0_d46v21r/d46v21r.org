Myriad issues.

The near automatic acceptance of Hermione by the Slytherin purebloods because of Slytherins protecting their own.

Rampant bashing of all things Gryffindor (Harry, Ron, Dumbledore, etc.)

When becoming a Death Eater, being so oh-so-special that her Dark Mark is not a magical tattoo/brand but a fucking necklace.

Horrible characterizations, yet somehow clings to canon despite the massive changes the characterization changes should/do cause.

Lack of any significant challenge/conflict for the protagonist.
