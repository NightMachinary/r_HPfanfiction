seconding it! it's well into its marvel crossover at this point and i believe asgard had just become a major factor in the section i left it at.

Small warning that the ship may end up being a slash one at the end; last i checked it hadn't been definitely decided and harry was solidly in the 'still deciding' phase, but i know there were strong undercurrents being set up in case the plot went that way.
