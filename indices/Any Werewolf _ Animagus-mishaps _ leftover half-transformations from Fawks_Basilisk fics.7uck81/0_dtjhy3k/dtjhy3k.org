lnkffn(9406877) is the only one I can think of. It's HP/Avengers crossover, but I know that [[/spoiler][Logan]] is in the story as well as an OC. It's been a very long time since I started reading it, and I haven't caught up, but I wouldn't be surprised if other characters from the Marvel universe showed up. I do remember liking it a lot, though, and I've seen it recommended a few times before, so I definitely feel comfortable recommending it.
