Are you familiar with the Anita Blake series of novels? I recently read a crossover with HP. Harry is in St. Louis and gets attacked by a werewolf. There's a lot of plot happening in the werewolf and vampire worlds.

I think the story explains Anita Blake well enough that you shouldn't be lost if you're not familiar with the series.
