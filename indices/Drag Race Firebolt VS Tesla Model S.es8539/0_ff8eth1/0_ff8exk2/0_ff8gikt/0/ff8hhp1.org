That instantaneous transportation is range limited. It's fine for everyday needs but relying on range limited teleportation and speed limited brooms instead of developing acceleration limited means of transportation becomes more and more of a problem the longer the distance you want to travel is. If someone developed a magical acceleration limited method of transportation (let's say, a flying car limited to 15 m/sÂ²) it'd beat brooms over distances beyond a few miles and portkeys over distances beyond a quarter million miles, it'd be able to do Moon and back in a day, Mars and back in a week, Jupiter and back in a month, Alpha Centauri in four years and Andromeda in a decade. Put a two way teleporting vanishing cabinet in it and you can always go back home after your piloting shift is over.
