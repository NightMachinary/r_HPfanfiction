I'm not exactly sure this rec would be something you're looking for. It's quite difficult to find something that involves OC or self inserts like that in that era. Though I might have something in mind that is set in WW2/Grindelwald's era.

There's this wonderful crossover with HP and the Avengers (specifically Captain America the First Avenger) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3494062/oniforever][oniforever]].

A very basic summary: Tom Riddle, still very much in character in the beginning, ended up captured by HYDRA. Stuff happens and he essentially became a WW2 soldier.

It stays true to Tom's personality but made room for him to grow. At age 16 at least. This took place after the Chamber of Secrets which he is still very much guilty for. The story is very well written from the beginning and continues to become more impressive as I read on. It's to the point that I have no clue how many time I've reread this specific fanfiction.
