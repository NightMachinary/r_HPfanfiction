I seem to remember a story with a stoner Neville and a girl from Gryffindor (Faye Dunbar?) who hung out with him a lot. I can't remember the title now. The Harry in there was the one who supplied Neville with weed when the latter asked for tips on how to gain confidence. Neville eventually started growing his own weed. If I'm not mixing things up, this Harry was also into tabletop RPGs because he was brought up by the adults in a comic book shop he frequented to escape the Dursleys.
