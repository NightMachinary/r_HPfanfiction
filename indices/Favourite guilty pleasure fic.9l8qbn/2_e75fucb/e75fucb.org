I don't really have a specific fic in mind, but a whole genre. I will always have a soft spot for super!Harry and Noble!Harry fics because that's what was in vogue around the time I started reading fanfiction. I don't read it as much as I used to, but it's the genre I always return to to center myself. They have a lot of tropes that people seem to HATE these days, but even now, I genuinely like.
