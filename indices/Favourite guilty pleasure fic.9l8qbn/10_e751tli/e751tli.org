Identity by highbrass, it's fucking dumb... But it also takes the idea of Mr. Black More seriously and makes me salivate for something in the same vein significantly less circle jerky

Myrddin Emrys Returns by General Obi-Wan Kenobi SIYE, can you say Broken? I can and so can this story cause Harry too is Broken to all fuck. So fucking OP it's barely funny but it is

The Power of the Mind by Landstradd, I shouldn't like this story this much but I do, Harry's mix of insanity and intelligence is refreshing to me, he and everyone else knows he is a few screws loose but it only works to his benefit

Appetite for Destruction by The Devil's Left Eye, It's dumb its to action packs to the point where the Plot is just set dressing for action scenes rather than Action driving plot forward... Fuck tho it's good action
