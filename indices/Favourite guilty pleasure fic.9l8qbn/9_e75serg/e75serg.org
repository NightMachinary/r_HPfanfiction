Is my entire reading list a valid answer?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]]. It could be considered a good fic or guilty pleasure, but it's one of my favorites regardless.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12660860/1/Vendor][Vendor]] is one that is such a quick fix guilty pleasure for me. I almost wish it got expanded further than what it is, but as it is now it's just right.
