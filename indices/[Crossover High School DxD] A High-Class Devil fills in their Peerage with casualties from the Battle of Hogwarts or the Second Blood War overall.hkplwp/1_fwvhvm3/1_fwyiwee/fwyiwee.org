DxD is one of those settings that's incredibly ripe for crossovers. I'd love to see more from "A Demon Lord's Hero" or the "Beyond the Outer Gate Lies..." series, and I'm waiting for "Gods, Devils, and Wild Horses, Oh My!" to win in Vimesenthusiast's update polls again. Just recently I read into "Remnant DxD" and a new chapter dropped for "Xander DxD".
