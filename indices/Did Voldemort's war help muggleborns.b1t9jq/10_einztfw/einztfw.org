The percentage of muggleborns compared to purebloods/halfbloods may have increased due to the war not affecting the muggleborne birth rates while diminishing pureblood birth rates. But did the war help muggleborns? No.

Whatever small(compared to before) percentage the pureblood hold is a lot worse for the muggleborns. Because after the war prejudiced purebloods were more in percentage compared to their open-minded counterparts. These same purebloods make situations for muggleborns difficult.
