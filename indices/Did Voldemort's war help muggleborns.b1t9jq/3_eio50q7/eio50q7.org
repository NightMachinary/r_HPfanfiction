I would argue that it may ultimately have helped muggleborns in a more immaterial way, rather than demographic change: by showing how terrible and destructive the 'blood purity' ideology actually is, I think it would have had far less popularity and fewer adherents post-war. There are historical examples of this - fascism had quite a sizeable following in Britain (the British Union of Fascists claimed 50,000 members at one point and had the open support of some newspapers) before WW2 revealed the movement for what it was.
