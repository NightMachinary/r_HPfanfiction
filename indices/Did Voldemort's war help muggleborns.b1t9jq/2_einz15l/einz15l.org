It is difficult to argue that a campaign of Murder and later genocide helped the victims. I find your claim about the blood status of the victims dubious since at least most of Umbridge's and the Snatchers' victims were Muggleborns and not purebloods. People like Ted Tonks and the former Goblin liaison.
