I just have to ask. What makes you think that Sirius or Hermione or Ron would be knowledgeable about every family tree in Wizarding Britain to such a degree that they can know who is or isn't a half-blood? Sirius probably knows a bit, but as he seemed to distance himself from his family and purebloods from as early as he could, I doubt he has a lot of knowledge in that area.

And then to take Burbage: Dwindling can be slow it can be fast. Most countries today have a dwindling population. anything less than 2 births per couple. To again take our low sample size of canon characters. We have 1 family of more than 2 children. 2 families with more than 1 child. As far as we know at least. But again, it's pathetically low to pull any full data from. But speaking from my own middle school class, I know that most of them had atleast 1 sibling. And a good few of them had 2 and some had 3.

So I think we can say that if W-B is dwindling in purebloods, well it has to do with them not having children. Now is that the only issue with them, probably not. But it's certainly not a massive drop in pureblood birth outside the lot that died in the first war, and Barbage probably had some projection of how many more were likely to die in the second war. Which is where and when it'd be more necessary.
