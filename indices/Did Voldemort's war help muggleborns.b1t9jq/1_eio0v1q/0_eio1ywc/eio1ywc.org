I wouldn't trust any hard numbers that came from JKR, official author or not.

And that 40% half-blood/40% pureblood ratio contradicts what's said in the books:

  "Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out."

- Ron, Chamber of Secrets.

  "â€˜If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry pure-bloods your choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left."
#+end_quote

- Sirius, Order of the Phoenix.
