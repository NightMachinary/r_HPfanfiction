Interesting. I still think that 40-40-20 ratio, even if it applies for one year of Hogwarts' student intake, is still unrealistic to apply to the wizarding world as a whole. Just as unrealistic as there being 40 students split evenly by house and gender: works for the purposes of telling a story, but doesn't really sound like believable worldbuilding.
