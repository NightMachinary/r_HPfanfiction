That's the error of a low sample size, here we quite literally have a sample size of 1. We can't actually try and extract any workable data from it.

Though as you say:

#+begin_quote
  Just as unrealistic as there being 40 students split evenly by house and gender
#+end_quote

That has a plethora of other theories surrounding it that I just know about in passing.
