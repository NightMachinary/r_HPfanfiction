Last night I read an estimate based on Rowlings classlist for Harry's year that put it at: 40% Purebloods and 40% Half-bloods with 20% Muggle Born.

For this to hold true it should've been 50% Pureblood and 10% Muggleborn before the war. Unfortunately 1 school year is really too low a sample to say anything definitive about it.

Though as you say, the purebloods being killed directly affect the birth rate of purebloods, whereas muggleborn being killed would barely, if at all, affect the birthrate of muggleborn.
