Several comments mention the term genocide to argue what muggleborns lost in the war. The main difference between known genocides and the muggleborn hunt is, as stated by the thread opener, that muggleborn birth rate is not affected at all by the war because muggleborns cannot reproduce (what I mean is that the children of muggleborn are not muggleborn anymore). If we take that into consideration and the fact that many families that followed pure blood prejudice died out or nearly died out, the war actually helped future muggleborns because key members of the pureblood movement are dead and after the war the society can be rebuilt without any prejudices. Tl;dr: yes the war was positive for future muggleborns if you compare it to the state of wizarding society before the war.
