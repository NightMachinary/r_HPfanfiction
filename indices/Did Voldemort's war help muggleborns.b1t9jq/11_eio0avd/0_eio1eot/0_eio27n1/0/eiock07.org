Let's not forget that pre-holocaust, most nations were not well predisposed to jews. They were generally unwanted, "undesirables" one could say, a necessary evil at best. In the early years of the rise of Nazi germany, many countries refused to accept deported jews. What we now call "anti-semitism" was more or less normal.

​

Post holocaust, that is all rather different isn't it. Anti-semitism is now at the very least frowned upon, if not outright punishable. Israel exists, and I don't think people get refused entry into countries simply because they are jewish (that would be anti-semitic).

It's rather undeniable that in the larger picture, the situation of Jews worldwide was much improved by the actions of the Nazi's. That isn't to reduce the suffering of those who died or lived during the holocaust itself, but at the very least their suffering wasn't in vain. Their descendants enjoy a much more... accepting world for it.

One could see a similar effect taking place in the wizarding world after the second voldemort war. Marking muggleborns as a protected class, making it outright illegal to discriminate against them, etc. Not to mention the populations opinion in general increasing, which strengthens the effects of those laws and regulations.
