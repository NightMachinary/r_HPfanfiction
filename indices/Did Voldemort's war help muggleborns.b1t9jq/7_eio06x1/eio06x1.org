"Help" is a word that seems very out of place when used in the same context of "war".

The muggle-raised to wizard-raised ratio of students might have been higher, but they never received any benefits for falling in one category or the other. In fact, most muggleborns (with the exception of Hermione) were probably behind their studies, compared to their peers with magical families who could ask their Mum and Dad for support if that year's DADA teacher turned out to be shoddy, or when they were put under stress of being killed by the Heir of Slytherin in the 1992 school year.
