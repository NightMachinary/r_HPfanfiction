No, pro-muggleborn purebloods joined the Aurora and OotP, and many died. Anti-muggleborn purebloods joined Voldemort, and in a lot of cases were imprisoned or talked their way out, along with the Order being generally against killing. I believe their was a higher mortality rate among the good guys, which would have left more on the bad side left to make decisions.
