I loved Beyond The Curtain by Bobicka. He has a femHarry in LOTR story going now which is pretty good.

Now back to your request, I unfortunately havnt found many great dystopian fics, but I did start one of my own.

The premise was that Grindelwald and Dumbledore's duel was so great and powerful that it was witnessed and recorded by muggles. Muggles who were nearing the end of WW2 and feared the wizards as weapons of the enemy. So, they interfered and killed both of them, then used the film and now widespread knowledge of magical kinds to stir up a McCarthy-an style witch hunt which eventually broke into open war.

In my fic, a canon-esque Harry stumbles his way into the dystopian world and gets rescued by the "Muggleborn" magical crews(havnt decided their name yet) who monitor for accidental magic from children and extract them before they are reported to an anti-magical(havnt figured their group's name) police force.

Now Harry is a fugitive in a new and devastated world. One that mostly dominated by paranoid and dangerous muggles. Now he has to navigate between two factions, the pureblood one that hides behind massive magical shields at a familiar Scottish Castle and is lead by a handsome and dangerous Tom Riddle. And the paranoid, fragmented, and hidden new blood one. The local leader of which is a witch with very similar eyes to him.

Well I didn't mean to get into so much detail, but writing it has been tough sledding. World building for dystopia requires a lot of work.
