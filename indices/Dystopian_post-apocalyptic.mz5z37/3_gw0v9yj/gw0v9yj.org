Linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) Technically counts if not in tone then in the apocalyptic premise. Harry is apparently the last wizard alive. Complete comedy with no major romance and very competent Harry. Would advice reading the Wikipedia pages for Firefly and Serenity for maximum comprehension.

Linkao3(Manacled) Very Dystopian Voldemort-Wins AU. Mind the warnings. Completed with romance as a central theme. Harry is dead.

Linkao3( Mi Aedijekit by local_doom_void ) Set a few centuries into Voldemort's rule. Very unique. Harry POV with tons of OC'S.
