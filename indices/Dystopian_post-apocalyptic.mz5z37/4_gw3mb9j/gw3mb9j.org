This one begins in a post-apocalyptic AU setting and then (minor spoiler) dumps the Harry and Teddy from that world into the canon world. Their magic has been irrevocably altered from where they come from, and Teddy in particular has no idea how to act in a "normal" setting. It doesn't perfectly fit what you're asking for, but it's got great worldbuilding and fantastic characterization (including some fun OCs) so I'm recommending it anyway!

Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.
