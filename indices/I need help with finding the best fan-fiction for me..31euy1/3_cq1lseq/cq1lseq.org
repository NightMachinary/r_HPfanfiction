Haha, oh boy, you just finished the series? That's wild. I originally read them so long ago that I can't even remember how not knowing felt...just that I was /extremely excited/ the entire time. Anyway, your stipulations are a little odd because A) Harry and Ginny actually did have a daughter, and B) Ginny probably does love Quidditch more than Harry because she went on to play professionally. But I digress...

I'll teach you a little bit about fanfiction. You have Alternate Universe (or AU's) - which pretty much means that anything goes. It changes the plot of the story and goes away from what's in the books. Thinks like: "Stories where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived" or "Stories Where Harry Becomes Evil!". There are a lot of fanfictions like that, but everyone has their cup of tea so you don't have to like these. The books and anything JKR announces are what we call "CANON"...so if you see a story that says it's canon-compliant, it means that it follows the books and/or her short stories. It sounds like you want stories that match the end of the books, so you might want to start with any information JKR has released since the end of the series (try [[https://www.pottermore.com/en-us/][Pottermore]] or [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wiki]] for more information). She's released a lot of new stuff recently, so you might be interested. Things like, how many kids Bill and Fleur had, the fact that Luna married a guy named Rolf Scamander and wore a really crazy wedding dress, and that Ginny and Rita Skeeter got in an argument at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup. Also, she has a [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling][twitter account]], which I follow religiously.

Now, there are more Harry Potter Fanfiction Stories than any other fanfiction database. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/][FF.Net]] alone has over 711 THOUSAND stories, so that's a great place to start. There's also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/][HPFF]], [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/][MuggleNet FF]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/][A03]]. They are all good places to look for stories. I will give you some of my favorites because I also read only canon-compliant stories, so this will be a good place to start. I'll give you only finished stories as of right now, because you're a sweet summer child. In no particular order:

1) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] by Thanfiction. Basically, it's about what happened at Hogwarts while the trio were off hunting Horcruxes. Main character is Neville. The author is a little odd apparently, and I think the story is at times a little sexist, but it's still really good. I've never read anything else by them, but I've heard their other stories aren't really that great.

2) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] by Inverarity. This is the first book in a series about an American witch who goes to a school called Charmbridge somewhere outside of Chicago. VERY well written. Almost professional quality. The main character can be a little too much sometimes (she's very...troublesome), but at least she's believable!

3) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] by little0bird. Takes place right after the Battle of Hogwarts and follows the characters over that first year after the battle. A very heartwarming hurt/comfort story. The author has a lot of stories that take place during those 19 years. Deviates from JKR's extra information, but still follows the books. Can be a little...girly? at times. Lots of weddings and babies.

4) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia][Australia]] by MsBinns. Want some Ron/Hermione romance? This is the story of them traveling to Australia to rescue her parents after the war.

5) [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] by padfoot4ever. This is about Rose (Ron and Hermione's daughter) becoming pregnant with Scorpius Malfoy's baby. This pretty much STARTED fanfiction for the next generation. Not very well written at first, but she grows as a writer as the story progresses, and it even has a completed sequel.

6) [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html][The James Potter Series]] by G. Norman Lippert. This guy is writing an entire series about James Sirius Potter (Harry's son). It's very well written, even has an editor and an illustrator. I've only read the first two, so I don't know how the rest are, but I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat.

That's all I got so far. I have a ton of favorite stories, but not many of them are completed (one of the evils of fanfictions, apparently people have lives outside of their amazing stories). Let me know if you want some more. Also, if you want to try some AU's, just keep checking around on this subreddit. I find a lot of people here prefer those over canon-compliant, but it's still a pretty even divide. As for Ginny-specific stories, I haven't read too many. I am, however, currently writing one, but it will not be released until after it is complete. Wish me luck :)
