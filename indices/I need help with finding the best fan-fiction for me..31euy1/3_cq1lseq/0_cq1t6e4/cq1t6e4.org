"A) Harry and Ginny actually did have a daughter" Oh, I meant Lily and James Potter had another child. Not only Harry. I saw some fanfics with this and that was just only like a big wtf in my head xD I know that Ginny and Harry had 3 child.

I think I'll try the 3rd and 4th one, and maybe the 6th one later. Thank you so much for your help ! Good luck with writing your own story ^{^}
