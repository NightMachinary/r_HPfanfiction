While I agree that most of these stories with another kid are self-insert garbage bullshit, I offer the counterpoint story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by the Santi. Amazing story.

Of note, it was updated in January 2015 on the DLP (darklordpotter.net) boards. You'll need a membership to access it but there is no finer hive of scum, villainy, and fanfiction.
