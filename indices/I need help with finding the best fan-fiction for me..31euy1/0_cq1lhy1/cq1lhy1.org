This doesn't fit your requirement of Harry/Ginny stuff, but I've always felt that Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity is almost canon. Featuring Teddy Lupin as a main character. I feel like if I had just read the books and someone said told me "oh yeah this is an eighth book about Lupin's son's first year at Hogwarts" I probably wouldn't have questioned it.
