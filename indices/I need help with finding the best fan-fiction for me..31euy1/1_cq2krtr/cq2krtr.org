I would recommend you go read the collected works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. He has crafted a very detailed, post-Hogwarts world with canon characters (mostly--his Lavender Brown survives the final battle).

I suggest you start with his WIP novel /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/ and see if the writing style appeals to you. If it does, branch out from there.
