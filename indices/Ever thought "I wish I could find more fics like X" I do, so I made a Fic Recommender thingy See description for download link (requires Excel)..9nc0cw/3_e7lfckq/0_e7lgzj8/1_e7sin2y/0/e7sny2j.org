Hmm. Probably not. I don't know anything about what that would entail.

I'm finishing up an expanded version of this (30,000 fics) but I might want to stop at this point. I don't know how "maintainable" this database is.

For example, the "Fic Info" page was from a scrape of FFN that I did over a year and a half ago, so it's already old.

The weights were calculated from a scrape of info from 65,000 FFN users, so that's another database that might need to be updated. It's also only a tiny fraction of FFN users.

Lastly, for my expanded version I'm conserving space by only saving the nearest neighbors to each fic. It's nice, but I don't really know how to easily add new fics to this since you might have to recalculate ALL the weights. There's probably algorithms out there but I don't have the time to find out.

That being said, I'm happy to make my code and data available.
