I'm ingesting data from the xlsx already, but if you have code to calculate more, I can probably use that directly - and this database (currently postgres) should be more space efficient than the xlsx.

With the right indexes it might even be feasible to calculate on the fly.

Obviously no need for any kind of commitment, though any help would be appreciated.
