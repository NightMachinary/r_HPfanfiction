Well if you want more data, here's a new file. [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=12TRoBtJ92ssvZ-ekaDSM0s07ARGsbftN]]

Sorry it's in a different format, but it's pretty simple. Instead of the full matrix, I save the 20 nearest neighbors for each fic, so the largest 20 values of each row in the matrix. This is the "Weights" sheet. The "Indexes" sheet has which columns those weights are from, so it's used to lookup the corresponding row in the "Fic Info" sheet.

I also have this version: [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XH5BX-x1508iZXnKOE2-F7AX0ZvaDEQj]]. It's the same info, but I removed the parts of "Fic Info" which are outdated, so things like # of favs or reviews. Feel free to use any of it.
