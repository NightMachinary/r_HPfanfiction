I like a few more H/G authors:

kbo: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0]] He likes to write intelligent Harry stories, such as *Harry Potter: Rogue*, linkffn(3796738), and *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382).

Brennus: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus]] His stories are good, but bashes Dumbledore/Molly/Ron too much. In *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), he bashes almost everyone else except the protagonists.

pottermum: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum]] Her latest *It's Complicated*, linkffn(11567591), is a BDSM smut fic. *Always*, linkffn(11379466), and *Living for the Moment*, linkffn(11299554), are nice fluff romances.
