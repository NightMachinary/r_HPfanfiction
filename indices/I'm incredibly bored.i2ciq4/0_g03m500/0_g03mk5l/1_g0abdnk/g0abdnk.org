If you enjoy it, there's a different crossover with Fate Zero by Carnivorous_Muffin. Might need to read Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus first. If you enjoy it though, there are several good crossovers and one shots.

I also enjoy Full Metal Alchemist crossovers where Ed (or someone else) teaches Alchemy. Best one I can think of is The Colours of the World. I read several of these crossovers before I watched FMA and enjoyed them.
