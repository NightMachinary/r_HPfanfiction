I doubt it is overused. I doubt I read the most HP fanfics, but I read a lot. I can count on both hands the amount of times it's been used on the fics I'm currently reading, and still have fingers left over.

And as you mentioned: Sturgeons law, 90& of everything is crap. IDK how many fics have detention as a central plot element or use it to kick start a part of the story. But I'd imagine 90% of them are shit.
