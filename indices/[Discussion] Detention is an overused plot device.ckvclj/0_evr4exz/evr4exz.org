How is it overused? They are in a school setting(Most fics are at least), detention is likely to come up even if only as threats. And honestly it comes up quite a bit in canon as well just to summarise the three I can recall:

PS: evening/midnight in the forbidden forest looking for Unicorns.

OoTP: Umbridge giving detention to all who questions her: according to the wiki, from 5 to after midnight.

HBP: Snape gave Harry detention at least once a week for the remainder of the school year.
