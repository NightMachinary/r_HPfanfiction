I'd imagine it would be something that would be hard to find an audience. There seem to be quite a few hp readers that have a preference for either slash or non-slash, and thus a story where the character might end up with either preference is likely to not interest those groups. At least it seems like you might get "author flirted with bla but them made the character go foobar instead".

Might work better as a background character.

The only fic that comes to mind is that one where Hermione goes "I think I might like girls" and Harry responds "Good, I think I also like girls", in a fic that had a nice Hermione/Harry friendship... But it wasn't a drawn out thing.
