I really loved linkao3(Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)).

I had discovered myself to be asexual and was desperate for someone's experiences I could relate to, even if it was fictional. Harry's confusion and attempts at relationships touched me a lot.

Hope you find what you need.
