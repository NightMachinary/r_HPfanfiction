#+begin_quote
  Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. LGBT characters. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse. More notes inside.
