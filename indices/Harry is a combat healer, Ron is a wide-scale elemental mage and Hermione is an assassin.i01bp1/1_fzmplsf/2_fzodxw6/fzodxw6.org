I used to see an advertisement for a HP Mage the Awakening game all the time on a discord. D&D would be a weird choice... but so would basically any system since HP is so unique in that it lacks summoning, mana, really any kind of limit to spell casting beyond speed.

If I was homebrewing an HP system then I'd probably make speed determine how many spells in a round, or perhaps have a wheel initiative (even though I've only had a bad experience with that)... or probably go extra rules light and do a Powered by the Apocalypse type thing
