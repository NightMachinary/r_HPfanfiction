I really like it, It's called “The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic”.

The MC is accidentally summoned along with the actual targets of the summoning, the most popular boy and girl in his school.

They get their magic tested and find out their attributes.

The boy and girl are Heroes, and have attributes reflecting that.

The MC gets healing magic.

Cue terrified talks of “her” finding out.

She shows up, turns out she's the head of the Medics, she's also terrifying as hell.

She -kidnaps- takes MC for training and so the series begins.

Healing Magic is strong but there is a trade-off.

If you have Healing Magic, you cannot learn any other type of magic.

It's also rare and seen as a “trash” magic.

Healing Magic is all about creativity.

Rose (the head of the Medics) uses it to extend training to superhuman levels.

When you fall down, she heals you and shouts at you to get up and continue running.

As a consequence, her training breaks people mentally, they change greatly.

But they also become superhuman, to the point of being fast enough to disappear from sight.

The Medics are called “The Kidnappers” because those wounded on the battlefield are retrieved so quickly that it looks like they disappeared.

I really recommend it.
