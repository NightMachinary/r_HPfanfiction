It's not something that can outwardly hurt someone.

If you punch someone while encased in Healing Magic, it does the damage then immediately heals it.

That's why it's seen as trash, you can't really use it to attack.

Or so they think.

Rose and the MC have different ideas.

It also goes deeper than just “Healing Magic heals you” it's a bit more complicated.

Just on the topic of it being rare and “trash”.

There's only one kid in the worlds most prestigious magic school that has Healing Magic, he gets bullied and beaten up just for having it.
