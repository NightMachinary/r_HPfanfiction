I'm right there with you, do you have any idea how easy it would be to take over the planet with Healing Magic?

Here's a hint, Healing just sets something to what we would consider an unharmed state.

Any disease? Cured. Any physical disability? Fixed.

Hell, you could probably use it to increase your senses to superhuman levels.

You can certainly do it with strength.

You play a Healing main?

You're a saint.

And probably in need of several therapists.
