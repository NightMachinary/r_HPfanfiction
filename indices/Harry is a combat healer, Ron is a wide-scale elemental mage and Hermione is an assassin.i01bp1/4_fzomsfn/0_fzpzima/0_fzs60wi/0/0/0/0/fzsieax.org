I never said that they were smart, they just don't think it's good (they're 300% wrong).

Keep in mind that if you have Healing Magic, you can't learn any other type of magic.

Especially in a world that takes great pride in what magic you have.

When compared to things like Lightning, Fire and Light, Healing Magic looks (at first glance) not very good.
