I had similar for the girls for my list.

Though i had Ron as a barbarian, his emotion gets ahead of him sometimes but he still gets in the thick of the fight.

I had Harry as the Fighter. Solid defense spells but also some offence. Sticks to the basics (Equivelent of sword and shield) mostly but does them well

For some reason i always had Neville as the Paladin. Willing to stand up for what is right in the face of all darkness. But Even from a young age willing to tell his friends that he thinks what they are doing is wrong and hold to that conviction.
