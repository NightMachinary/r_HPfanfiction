I know of a fanfic like this, "Deepest Reflections", but it's the third one in a series, so you need to read the first two for it to make sense. Also, AU Harry hasn't exactly been /raised/ by his parents, but his parents are alive and he lives with them now. It's a pretty interesting premise and series of fanfics, so I do recommend reading all three =)
