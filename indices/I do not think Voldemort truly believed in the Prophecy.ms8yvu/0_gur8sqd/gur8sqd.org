Yes, Voldemort was a megalomaniac afraid of being defeated. He outright did a "See! He's not so special. How could this be my defeater?" in GoF. He kidnapped Ollivander and switched wands to even the field.

But he believed in the prophecy as well. His decision to kill Harry was born of the idea that Harry was prophesized to kill him. Yes, Voldemort wanted the prophecy to learn how best to defeat Harry, but that also tells us he "set store by the prophecy."

Essentially, he wanted Harry dead to prove he was the best and he was using/wanted to use the prophecy to do it.
