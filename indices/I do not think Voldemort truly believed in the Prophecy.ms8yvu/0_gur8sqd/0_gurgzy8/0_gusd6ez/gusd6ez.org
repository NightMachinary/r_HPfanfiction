The most we can do is assume his motives were for targeting the target of the prophecy (i.e. Harry).

What we know from canon was that Voldemort was on the winning side of the war. But his reach seemed to stay at Wizarding Britain because of Dumbledore.

So, it's likely that Voldemort didn't want to have another obstacle rise up - one that was "prophesized" to defeat him - while his current - and biggest - obstacle is still alive and could potentially raise or protect Harry until he grows up to be the next obstacle.
