  But he believed in the prophecy as well. His decision to kill Harry was born of the idea that Harry was prophesized to kill him.

The fact that he attacked the Potter shows he gave some attention to the Prophecy, but what I was wondering was his motivations behind this act. Did he decide to kill Harry because he thought he had to kill him, and did just do it "just in case it comes back later".

If I had to make a comparaison with superstitious people, did Voldemort avoided to pass under the ladder because he was afraid to get bad luck, or did he just do it by habit because it costs almost no energy to just go around?
