When I was a kid, I had a dog. One day this dog found a wasp and tried to bite it. The wasp stung her mouth.

My dog got /mad/. She tried to bite that wasp again and again and again, and got stung again and again and again. Eventually, my mother had to grab her and kill the wasp so that she would stop. My dog hunted up and down for that wasp for ages afterwards, and from then on whenever she heard an insect buzzing she went for it like a thing possessed.

Voldemort always reminded me of my dog when it came to his relationship/obsession with Harry Potter. I think it stopped being about the prophecy rather quickly and started being about Unending Rage. I think it started being about How Dare You Survive I'm Going To Make You Pay.
