Yeah, it's so hard to answer the "how many books do you read?" question because then I'm trying to do the mental math of how long the fanfics I'm reading would be if they were in printed book format lol. Plus, the whole "what do you read?" if you give them an answer to how many and its like 'eeeeehhh...."

I find it to be a bit of a tricky question even for people my own age. Lots of people don't read, and if they do read, it's usually books, not fanfiction. Fanfiction is a very specific subset of fandom culture, most people are "casual" fans and never get into fanfiction for any show. Even if they do read fanfiction, they may think your pairings are just plain weird and nonsensical. You could have completely different fanfic tastes.
