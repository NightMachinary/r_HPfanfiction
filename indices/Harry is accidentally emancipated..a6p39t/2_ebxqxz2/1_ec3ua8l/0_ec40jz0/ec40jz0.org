It's neither, really. It was the easiest statement to express what I meant:

Some people like robst, and will like the fic - I personally don't. But if you expect robst's fics to be good, this one will work for you, too. I don't judge anyone for liking robst. He writes decent prose, but has his flaws - but so have my favorite authors.

Personally, I can't get over him telling essentially the same plot-point over and over again, his characterizations and world-building but that's just me. If you want some revenge-fics where Dumbledore (and sometimes the Weasleys) are the baddies, robst is certainly one of the best authors around.
