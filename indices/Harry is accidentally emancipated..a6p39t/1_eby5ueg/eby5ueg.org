Here's an excerpt

#+begin_quote
  As a result of Mister Harry Potter's (14) name coming out of the Goblet of Fire, and being named a competitor in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, the Boy-Who-Lived applied for emancipation, and it was granted, writes Hieronymus Cartwright.
#+end_quote

The trial in his 5th year was for using magic in the presence of muggles. In this fic, he proves that the dementors were deliberately sent to set him up.

Harry is emancipated due to a soul bond which trumps every law. So, he gets private quarters in Hogwarts etc. This is one of my favorite fanfics. It's really good.
