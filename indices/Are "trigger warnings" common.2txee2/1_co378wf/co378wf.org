I see them around occasionally, and sometimes the author is just going overkill- like the one you mentioned. Every once in a while I'll find a fic where they just have a warning on one chapter for a suicide or character death. I feel like the latter is appropriate, and the former is just kind of ignorant.

I guess I tend to avoid angsty fics, so I don't come across them often.
