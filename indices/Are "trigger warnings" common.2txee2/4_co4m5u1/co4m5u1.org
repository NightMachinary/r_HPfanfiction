Only in the Wormverse. On the plus side, trauma = powers there! I tried writing a straight Worm/HP crossover once. It can be summed up as saying 'Scion shows up just after Voldemort's defeat. Villainous Strangers, Masters and Thinkers discover existence of wizarding world in 1986. And then there was fire. Lots and lots and lots of fire. Harry gets 'volunteered' by the PRT after triggering at age six and getting picked up by a woman wearing a classy hat almost immediately. Hogwarts classified as a national monument in 1990 to commemorate the end of the 'hidden age of capes'. Voldemort posesses someone, runs into Greyboy. Scion is felled by a mysterious green beam. The. End'

Paradoxically, Harry has a happier time of it. Hermione kills Eidolon and the Siberian (triggers with perfect post-cognition, meaning that she gets to learn ALL THE MAGICS EVER on top of knowing who is responsible for the endbringers) before assuming a new identity and going to live with her cousin Annette in the US. A couple of years later, Clockblocker calls bullshit.

And that's as far as I got.
