I wouldn't say that they're common in the form that you posted (that seems a bit overboard).

I do, however, frequently see explanations at the start of a story for why the author gave that rating, which is nice (especially if I don't feel like reading a "Dursleys physically abuse Harry" or "Harry/Draco slash" story).
