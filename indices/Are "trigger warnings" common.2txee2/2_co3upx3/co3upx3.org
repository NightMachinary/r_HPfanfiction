They're fairly common, but not ubiquitous. People have different sensitivities and standards, just like some people are horrified by the notion of including sexual violence in a Potterverse story while others seem to be unable to resist completing a paragraph without some sort of outr√© transgression. Also there's probably some correlation between frequency of trigger warnings and membership within various subgroups within the fandom, e.g. stereotypically the Tumblr crowd is more likely to care about trigger warnings, non-gender binary stuff, terms like "wixen" rather than wizard, etc.

I tend to mentally categorize trigger warnings under "not important to me but important to some and cost me nothing so why not."
