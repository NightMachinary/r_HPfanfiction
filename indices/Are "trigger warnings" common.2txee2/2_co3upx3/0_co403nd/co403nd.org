I personally dislike the 'tumblr crowd' as you call them for putting up trigger warings about the most banal of things at times. It often times takes all of the suspense out of an FF if it says in the introduction: "Oh and there will be [important plot point here] and [another important plot point here] but X will not actually die, so there's that. LOL"

There is a rating system on FFs. If I click on an M or E rated FF then I can't complain when the content turns out to actually be 'mature' or 'explicit' even if I find that I don't like it.
