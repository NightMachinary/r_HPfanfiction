I dislike the idea most of the time as well, but they /do/ sometimes have a place.

For instance, [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks & Englishmen]] has to be my favorite Harry/Luna story ever. That said, there are some seriously screwed situations that could definitely set someone off who has been sexually assaulted.

I'm not against warnings when the subject is serious. My problem comes in when you have those oversensitive morons who want a warning on /fucking everything/.
