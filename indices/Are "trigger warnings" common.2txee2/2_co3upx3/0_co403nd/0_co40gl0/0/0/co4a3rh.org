MCD warnings /baffle/ me. I put them on my fic because people moaned at me about it, but I just don't get it. This is fiction, of course you can expect characters to die; why should I have to warn you about it? Especially with something like HP where the source material kills off major characters. Most warnings I get--rape and violence can be hard for victims of abuse to handle, and matters like drugs and alcohol could be triggering for recovering addicts--but I simply don't understand MCD warnings.
