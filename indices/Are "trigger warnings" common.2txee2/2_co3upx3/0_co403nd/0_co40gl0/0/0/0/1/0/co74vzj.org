Who said anything about literature? Literature is what I analysed all day through high school, regardless of having to remind myself for hours after it that /my/ life didn't actually suck! it was just the characters who had had every injustice and misfortune in the world heaped upon them and I had unfortunately empathised with them to the level that it felt like I was them. *Fanfiction* is what makes me happy! and having to rage-quit or grief-quit a fanfiction because my mood and sense of self are literally not strong enough to distinguish reality from the story, and the story fucking suck because everybody dies or is broken, is not what I want to do with my spare time. I'd rather read a math textbook than the emotional trauma that is characters dying.

But thank you for your opinion =) I'm glad to have set a new bar for you xo
