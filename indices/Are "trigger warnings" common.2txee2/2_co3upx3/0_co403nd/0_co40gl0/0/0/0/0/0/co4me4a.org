Fanfiction is special as a writing form because the readers have a direct channel back to the writer. There was considerable crying and yelling when Sirius died but JKR didn't have to hear it from thousands of overly-sensitive readers.

In that sense, trigger warnings exist to protect the writer from whiny readers. To maintain suspense while still using them, I like to seed a sample of a bad event early on in a story, as a taste of what's to come. This acts as both a polite litmus test, giving the reader a chance to 'nope' before we get to the hard stuff, and as a piece of foreshadowing.

Other times I just kill a relevant character in the first scene, so people will assume that's what I'm referring to with the warning. One might see this as the George R.R. Martin form of trigger warning.
