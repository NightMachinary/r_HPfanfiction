Not for everyone! For some the point of fanfiction is to read more about a world that you loved so much - to see what kind of fascinating things other people have thought of, inspired by this fandom you love so much.

Sometimes, fanfics make me cry. I love the ones that can, because those /mean/ something. Actually, I love the ones that can make me laugh, too. I don't often do either when reading, so I know how much the writer is offering their readers when they manage it.
