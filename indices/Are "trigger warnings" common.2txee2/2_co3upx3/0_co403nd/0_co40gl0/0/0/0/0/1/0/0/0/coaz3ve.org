Well, I was more directing your "that's the point of fanfiction" - when really, it isn't. Just pointing out there isn't one point of fanfiction, haha.

I understand your feelings, I like using fanfiction to escape reality myself sometimes. But I also enjoy going into it just like I would with a real novel - with nothing but a blurb on the back telling me what I'm in for.
