I don't believe I tried to speak for everyone...? I've heard of plenty of authors that adore torturing their characters and making them as miserable as possible. I've heard of people who think stories that make them cry are "deeper" or more "profound" and, implicitly, better/more important. Thus, literary merit. There's some quote that apparently you should suffer emotionally while reading, because that means the book is challenging your beliefs, or whatever. Well more power to those people! But that's not what I want to read, and when I'm spending hours and hours or days, giving up sleep to read a story, and become emotionally attached to a character, and then that character /dies/..... Well, I'm happy there's a huge geographical distance between me and the author. Some stories are good despite this. Tozette's Hit the Ground Running is still amazing and I love it.... Right up until the last chapter. But then an even /greater/ time investment is necessitated to rewrite the ending to soothe the emotional upheaval, and most of the time it's not worth it and I just don't want to /deal/ with that shit! So by all means, kill off and torture your characters... But mark it off so I don't make the mistake of reading it.
