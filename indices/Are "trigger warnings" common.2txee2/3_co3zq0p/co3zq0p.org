Depends, I's say. I've seen authors go overboard with tags on AO3. They give the whole plot away in the tags sometimes. I rarely see trigger warnings in the actual text, however. Sometimes I get a warning before a sex scene or a bloody battle or a torture scene but these are usually at the start of the chapter, not in the middle of the text body.
