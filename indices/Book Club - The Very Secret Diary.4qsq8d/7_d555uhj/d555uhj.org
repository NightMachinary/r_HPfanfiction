It certainly gave me new perspective on Ginny's character, but it also made me a little sad that we don't see more of the effects of her experience in canon. It felt really slow at first, and I actually almost gave up on it at one point, but I'm glad I didn't. I really liked the style/tone of it as well. It's definitely made it into my headcanon for the series.
