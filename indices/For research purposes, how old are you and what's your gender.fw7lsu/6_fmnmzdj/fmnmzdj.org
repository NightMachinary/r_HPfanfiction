23, and very feminine NB.

As a side note, after peeking at a couple of the older surveys, I'd honestly like to know how the genre of fan fictions consumed breaks down when looking at different demographics. I also think it would be nice to see how many users on this sub write fanfic (regardless of sharing it) in comparison to how many read it. I imagine the former would be a much smaller number.
