I'm pretty sure that this is the one where Death or something accepts Lily's sacrifice, or answers her call, sending Harry back in time. And then it ends up with a little bit of an X-Men crossover and then he becomes a professor at Hogwarts. I think it's something like that. I'll try finding it for you, but I may have gotten the details wrong, and I'm quite sure that I didn't bookmark it, because I didn't particularly enjoy it. But if it helps, you can probably find it off of Reddit, since I choose most of my stories from here or Author's favorites.

Edit: Does it involve him being the first Wizard, mating with people until his offspring (which I think all have green eyes) are magical, and become elves (not house elves)? And that all modern wizards and witches are his descendants.
