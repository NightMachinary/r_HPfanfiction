Deputy head, head of Gryffindor Dumbledore and McGonagall teaching together makes perfect sense. Far more sense than Deputy Head, Head of Gryffindor McGonagall teaching by her lonesome.

  What the hell is the Head of Transfiguration Department, and why do you need a department for school teaching, it's not some Ministry of Magic work or research team.

I've never gone to a school without different departments for each subject. I'm not sure of what it all entails, but I know teacher's are told which classes they'll be teaching, textbook/book decisions by grade level, performance evaluations are discussed.
