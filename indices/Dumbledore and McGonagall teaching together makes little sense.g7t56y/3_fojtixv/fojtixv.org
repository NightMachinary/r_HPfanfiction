I imagine that perhaps before the First Voldemort War started Hogwarts had a lot more teachers and students. After all, Hogwarts is a castle, yet it's stated that their are only 12 classes that have O.W.L.s. So I think that the head of the department for subjects would create and distribute lesson plans, as well as manage funds for that subject. While other teachers would teach the subjects. But once teachers and students started dying from the War, the other classrooms would become obsolete.

The 12 OWLs mentioned in the books are Transfiguration, Charms, Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Potions, Divination, Carr of Magical Creatures, Muggle Studies, Herbology, History of Magic, Astronomy, and Defense Against the Dark Arts.
