  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
