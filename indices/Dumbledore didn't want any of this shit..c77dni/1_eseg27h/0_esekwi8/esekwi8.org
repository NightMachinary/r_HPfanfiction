Why? Horcrux doesn't stop your body from aging, nor does it prevent you from being killed. If something happens, you must be sure that you have someone trustworthy to perform the ressurection ritual for you, so you don't spend indefinite time as a wraith. And when you are finally ressurected... Well, Voldemort might be okay with the whole noseless and scaly look, but most people wouldn't. And that's not even considering that Voldemort went completely mad in his later years, and Horcruxes probably played their role there as well.

Now Elixir of Life... That's the shit.
