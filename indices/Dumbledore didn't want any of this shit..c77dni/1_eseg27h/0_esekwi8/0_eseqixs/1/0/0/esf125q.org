Precisely, and it's one of the many reasons why Horcruxes is such a shit way to achieve immortality. What's the point of living forever if you're all frail and senile?

Dumbledore knew Voldemort did something to secure his survival, but he guessed what exactly only after the diary. So there must be option other than Horcruxes and Philosopher's Stone. Maybe if Voldemort didn't go with the first thing he found at 16, he would find some magic with fewer side effects.
