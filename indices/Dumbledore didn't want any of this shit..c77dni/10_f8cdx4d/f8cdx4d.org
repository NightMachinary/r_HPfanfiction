I present the most complex and ambiguous HP fanfiction Albus centric I have ever read

Title: [[http://geneticallydead.livejournal.com/211978.html][Möbius]]Author: MandyRating: NC-17Length: MediumTen years after the fall of Voldemort, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, celebrated as the saviour of the wizarding world. In the history books, Harry Potter stood over the hollow corpse of Lord Voldemort, vibrant and triumphant, and incinerated that withered old body to the depths of hell. The real truth was, Severus Snape killed Voldemort. Not Harry Potter.Pairing: Harry/Severus

​

Oldie but goldie, please, despite the pairing, give it a try.

​

Harry is just soul crushingly well written here. :>
