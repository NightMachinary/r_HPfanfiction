Dumbledore, stares down at Harry 'You think I wanted this, its been months since I have been bowling I am always busy with some inane Task, If its not the ministry its something else, I am old and so so tired, In my youth I used to look down on my brother whose ambitions stopped at owning his own bar, but now I envy my brother, Owning a bar would be so simple and pleasant, Instead I run a school where the governors and ministry battle my every move. People call me manipulative and a mastermind, but the world is barely holding together, in the 70's a muggle student brought comic books to this school a story about one man holding the weight of the world on his shoulders, the story was framed as heroic harry, but it failed to account for how much damage it does to a person, Do you know the most amusement I get in my daily life is showing up to the ministry in a garish robe but even now thats getting old, and I am Just an old man left with regrets, I went to school with your great Grandfather, he was a few years older then me, I taught your grandfather and father, I watched your father grow from a boy into a man and then I had to watch the funeral, I have had to watch so many of my students be buried because of tom, because of my failings to set him on the right path.\\
My failings robbed you of a lifetime spent with your Godfather as well, So many mistakes harry'' Dumbledore Sighed and paused but was interrupted by Harry 'I am sorry for lashing out at you, You Do not have to go this alone professor, me, ron, Hermione and the order are here for you please let us help you carry your burdens''
