Then he should have stayed OUT OF IT!

Sorry, but making excuses for Dumbledore's poor leadership, keeping secrets, placing burdens on a kid (who's life he ruined by placing him in an abusive household and then using him as a sacrifice) and generally hindering the war effort ("Don't kill your enemies, stun them, so we can look them up!" - No, if someone wants to kill you you obliterate them and then later on collect the pieces, you don't use stunners on deatheaters (unless you want to interrogate them, but not as a main combat spell!)) simply piss me off!

Dumbledore should have protected his school, he should have fought when neccessary but he should have put someone else in charge of the order (Mad-Eye Moody maybe or Shacklebolt) and should have kept out of the war mostly (he should also have not protected Snape, because with another potions-teacher I am sure there would have been more Aurors, Healers etc. (all of them need a potions NEWT after all and Snape didn't make getting that easy, in fact he made it harder than it should be!))
