Parts of HPMoR are good, and it was enough for me to force myself to read quite a bit of it.

But when, not even 6 months after the first year started, Harry and Hermione are overpowered, battle-hardened generals who discovered every secret of magic... yeah, nah. This would make some degree of sense if the characters were 35yo and accomplished wizards, not when they're 11yo kids who literally just discovered that magic exists.
