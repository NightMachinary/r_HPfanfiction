You've the right to your own opinion. It's wrong, but you've the right to it.

But don't try to suggest that it's just everyone else that's wrong, because either they haven't read it, they just didn't get it, or they disliked it for reasons you discount. For better or worse (for worse), it's the most read HP fanfiction out there. It's not a meme that most people dislike it, as if it's just some parroted opinion people who've never read it claim to fit in or whatever you're implying. Most people have both read it and believe it's utterly insufferable.
