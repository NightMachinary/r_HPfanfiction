But your declaration that his opinion is wrong is also an opinion. Also what do you mean most people have read it and believe it's utterly insufferable? Most of this subreddit? Most of the people who ever read it in total? Because if it's so terrible how is it favorited and liked so much on fanfiction.net? I'm not trying to be contrarian I genuinly want to know cause I got into fanfic this year and have no clue the history of the fanfic. Also what other reasons are there to hate it besides the general smugness and annoyance of the main character? Thanks
