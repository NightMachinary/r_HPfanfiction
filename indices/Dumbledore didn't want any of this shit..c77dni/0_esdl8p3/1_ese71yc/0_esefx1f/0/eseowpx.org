HPMoR isn't that bad, and the way in which it /is/ bad is almost certainly not what you've been led to believe. Harry is a smug smart-ass, but the story takes as many opportunities as it can to kick the shit out of him for that. The big message at the end of the story is that Harry was so much of an idiot that it literally took the combined effort of thousands of prophecies in order to stop him from tearing the world to pieces.

There are actual problems with HPMoR, including, but not limited to: the pacing, the fact that the nod to Ender's Game in the second act is /too long/, an over-reliance on fanon and the wiki instead of reading the actual books, strange, out of left-field assumptions that are thrown in and then just as quickly thrown out, (Sirius and Peter were gay lovers? The Weasley Twins are the heirs to Gryffindor?) and, /apparently/, not making it clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harry's behavior largely isn't reasonable. This was exacerbated by fans not quite picking up the message either.

It's not flawless, it's not the best piece of fanfiction I've read. But the /meme/ that it's the worst piece of fanfiction in the fandom gets on my nerves, because it's just /not true/. Not only is it genuinely entertaining, but it's /not even flawed for the reasons people believe it's flawed./
