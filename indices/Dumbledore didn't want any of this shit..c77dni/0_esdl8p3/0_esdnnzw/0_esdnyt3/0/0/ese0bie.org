I dont know if this would fit in your description. First it has slash (Harry/Draco), so only read if you are interested. And it starts right after Dumbeldore gets killed, so you dont see dumbeldore in action in this fic. However, Harry realizes that while the adults tell him that he is only a child, but nobody has taken active roles after Dumbledore has died. In this fic he matures, and he works on SO many things which help him to deal with voldemort. I love it because it's a more realistic take on Harry defeating Voldy, by way of his maturation and training. Also it has a VERY interesting take on "he will mark him as his equal" it's amazing. I sidetracked. The fic is called "Secrets". And Harry finds himself acting like Dumbledore by keeping so many secrets in different circles, and all of them for "the greater good". And he actually realizes this in the fic and says how much he understands Dumbledore now and why he had to do all these things that make him seem as manipulative, but are actually needed. Also this fic focuses on Snape as well as he becomes the sort of mentor and trainer. For me, this is the best fic i have ever read. It's called "Secrets" by Vorabiza
