No problem, I can't remember fics enough to give recommendations either. Besides, that wouldn't be exactly what I am looking for anyway. Travelling the world stories have never been my favourite, to be honest. They give me a feeling of ignoring life's problems. Probably some repressed desires to go on a world trip.
