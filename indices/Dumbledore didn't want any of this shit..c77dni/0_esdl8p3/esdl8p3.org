I kinda just want to see some more fics where harry finds out Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard but it is pretty much okay and even supportive of it when Dumbledore tells him a bit of what's really going on. That mutual understanding and respect of eachother is absolute gold when its done right, really let's both of the characters shine. The ones where Dumbledore gets to be more straightforward are always home to my favorite versions of Dumbledore lol
