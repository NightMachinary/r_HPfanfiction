It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but I will say that "the religion thing" is a pretty reasonable level of religion for a devout Christian. I mean, it's totally valid if you don't want to read about that in your Harry Potter fanfic, but I don't want anyone scared off because they're worried this is going to be Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles or whatever that was called.
