linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/]]) -- /Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals/ by mugglesftw. The self-insert main character is very afraid of Dumbledore because he suspects Dumbledore of putting Harry in an abusive home on purpose and doing other manipulative things. But when the protagonist finally has a conversation with Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/5/Why-Time-Travel-Should-Be-Illegal-and-Other-Morals][Chapter 5]], Dumbledore turns out to have very reasonable explanations for his actions and for why the Chief Warlock has much less political power than the main character had assumed. The main character presses Dumbledore on some of his other actions later in the story, but Dumbledore has good explanations for those too.
