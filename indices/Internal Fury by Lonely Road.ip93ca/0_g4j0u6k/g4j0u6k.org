Sorry to make a comment when I don't have the fic you're looking for, but a quick google search for "Internal Fury by Lonely Road" lead me to [[https://hp-ficsearch.livejournal.com/645505.html][this]], and I just wanted to ask if you have been searching for this fic for more than three years now, and if so what's so good about it that it's worth it?
