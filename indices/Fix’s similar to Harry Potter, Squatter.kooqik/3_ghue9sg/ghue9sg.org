I don't have a link to it, but "when wand and sword collide" is pretty great. The plot is basically last hero/ son of neptune, but instead of switching with the Romans, Percy gets swapped with Harry. Percy has to do a year at hogwarts solving mysteries, and Harry has to do a Quest. It's written pretty darn well, as I recall. The Harry chapters are written in Riordan's style, and the Percy chapters are done in Rowling's.
