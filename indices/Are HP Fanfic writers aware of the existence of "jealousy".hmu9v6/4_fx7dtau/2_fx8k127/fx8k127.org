Yeah, this. I have spent more time frustrated with myself for doing poorly in video games than I have on feeling jealous over a girl.

Of course, I only ever had a crush on one girl in the 9th grade, but I was so shy about it that she and her friends all thought I was gay. And when I, rather confusedly said "no? I thought you were pretty and had a cute laugh, but I wanted to be friends before asking you out," she declined going to homecoming with me, and then by the next week everyone was avoiding me because there were rumors going around that I'd "pretended" to be part of her friend group so I could... well, perform a certain 4 letter R word that rhymes with cape.

Needless to say, after being a social pariah for the entirety of 10th grade, I was relieved to be changing school districts for 11th, and I haven't tried dating since.

Damn, that was almost a decade ago...
