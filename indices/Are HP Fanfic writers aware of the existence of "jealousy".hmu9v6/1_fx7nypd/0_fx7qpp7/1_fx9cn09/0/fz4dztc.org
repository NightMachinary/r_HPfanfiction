OP is using a somewhat archaic meaning for the word "jealousy". It's not used in that way very often, currently, but it crops up in the Bible at points. When the Bible says that Yahweh is a "jealous" God, that is what it means. He is constantly vigilant about his worshipers being poached by other gods. He guards what he has /jealously/. Envy is, classically, a different thing. To envy is to covet. To be jealous is to be protective/possessive. It's a useful distinction to make, but if you use the two words as synonyms, I don't blame you. Almost everyone does. That's language for you.
