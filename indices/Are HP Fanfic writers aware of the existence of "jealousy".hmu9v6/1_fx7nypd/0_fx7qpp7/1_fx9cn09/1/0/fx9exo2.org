First definition of jealously that pops up when googling it

"feeling or showing envy of someone or their achievements and advantages."

Jealously is a feeling of envy, the article you linked asserts that jealousy is when you feel like something you owned has been taken but that's simply incorrect.

The feeling of being threatened that something you feel you owned is being taken can be caused BY jealousy but it is not jealousy itself on a definitive level

Edit: For an example ron could be jealous because of h/hr by thinking that harry had a better life than him because he was dating a girl that ron wanted to date (because then he would be envious of Harry's achievements) but if it was because he thought that that harry was stealing what was his then that's specifically not jealousy, that's possessiveness. It's a very important distinction to make
