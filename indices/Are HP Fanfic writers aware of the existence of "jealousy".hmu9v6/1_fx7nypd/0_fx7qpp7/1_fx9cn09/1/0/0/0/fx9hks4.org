...what? How would your arm not be long enough? What type of jerking off motion would require more than armlength?... I'm very confused about what you were going for with that lol, also hey I hate writing like that too but you linked to an article by a professional so I figured you wouldnt listen to what I was talking about unless I wrote it that way.

TLDR what you and the psychologist described as jealousy was not jealousy, it was possessiveness. They can be similar in some cases but if you feel you were "stolen from" then you're not being jelly, you're being possessive and creepy.
