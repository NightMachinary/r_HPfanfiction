Jealously is feelings of envy toward another, they're literally the same thing, I think you're maybe confusing it with possessiveness or obsession?

Edit: seeing another comment you made I'm sure you're confusing it with possessiveness, and the reason that people dont write about it is that they want the protagonist to be either likeable or hated, not creepy lol
