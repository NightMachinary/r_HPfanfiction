It would depend on your perspective. Ron is jealous of Hermione/Harry in Book 7 because he feels Harry is taking something that is his/that he is entitled to (Hermione's affection).

Ginny was "Harry's" first, given that she had a crush on him since she was... like, a toddler.

I don't really see any inconsistencies.
