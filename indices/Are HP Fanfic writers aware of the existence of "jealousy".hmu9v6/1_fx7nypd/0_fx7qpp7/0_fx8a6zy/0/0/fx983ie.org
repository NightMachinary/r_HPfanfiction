Jealosy, in my opinion, is wanting something/someone, usually someone, that someone else has, and getting angry about it, and defensive of the thing/person. A common example is seeing your crush with someone else. You resent the person they're with bc it's not you.

Envy is being upset because someone has something you don't. It's similar, but it's more "oh, I wish I had that" than "why do you get it and not ME". In my opinion.
