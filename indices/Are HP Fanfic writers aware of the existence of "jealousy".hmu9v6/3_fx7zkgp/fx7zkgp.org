Considering lots of fanfics are either wish fulfillments or power fantasies, it can often be hard to find emotions such as jealousy in them. Writers often forget that the MC is actually capable of feeling negative emotions except anger and often don't give them any flaws. Also given that jealous is one of those emotions that are really common but also almost universally disliked, jealous characters also make very bashable characters (eg: Ron). Writers usually prefer to vilify jealousy instead of actually just accepting it as something that is common for everyone and thus dealing with it in a realistic and believable manner

There is also the fact that most harems and Harry/Multi fics won't work or would be really difficult if you add jealousy to the equation. For most inexperienced and ameteur writers it is often just easier to pretend such stuff don't exist in the first place and go with whatever the plot demands. I have yet to see a harem fic that deals with all the issues that come from being in a harem in a believable manner.
