Depends on the genre. Fluff fics purposely exclude it because "good feelings only". Action/adventure will often not bother with a complicated romance. PWP fics only (sometimes) use it to build sexual tension. And multi/harem fics exclude it for convenience, I'd assume. If I had to guess, I'd say you might find more jealousy in the enemies-to-lovers category.

I think the issue for you might be that jealousy usually comes in the form of "misunderstandings that get the main pairing together". Fanfiction authors don't often know how to write their faves dating /someone else/ in a realistic way, because fanfiction is escapism and of course you want to get to the good part where your faves are progressing toward each other. So if you're looking for a more realistic dating scene in general, where everyone in a fic is dating around & breaking up & trying things out, and not just... Matched up with the author's opinion of their most compatible partner almost immediately... Then that's a harder ask.

That said, I wouldn't say instances of jealousy are /uncommon/ in fanfiction. In general, I can't say I share your experience (and I don't read much like I used to) so perhaps it's a newer phenomenon.
