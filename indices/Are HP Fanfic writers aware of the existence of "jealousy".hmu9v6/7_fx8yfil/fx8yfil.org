  Everyone can write what they like, but it always bums me out when I'm reading a fun story and suddenly all of the female characters decide they're A-okay with sharing the MC, and oh-by-the-way they just now realized they're bisexual, but only for each other. So. Damn. Lazy

That is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to issues with harems. And the reason why they pretty much all suck (it works in crack-ish premises like "It could only happen to Harry").

But in regular fics, well what's the point? The one canon example of romantic jealously we see in widely regarded as one of the worst bits of canon (the "chest monster").

If Harry (seriously) wants to be with his mate's girl, he is a dick since they are considered off-limits. If Harry is in a relationship and some girl wants his ass, well, that won't cause much conflict either since either she will be told to fuck off or there's some kind of showdown which amounts to little more than bashing.

And perhaps most importantly, jealously is kinda irrelevant with magical Hitler out for Harry and all Muggleborns. There are bigger issues to focus on.
