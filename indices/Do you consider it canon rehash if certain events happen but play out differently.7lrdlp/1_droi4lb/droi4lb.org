It depends on whether the events that played out differently actual butterfly to effect future events. If they do then I'm pretty sure thats considered a plot divergence.

E.g. Cedric doesn't die in the cemetery, he witnesses Voldemort being reborn with Harry. They manage to convince the minister that he's back, so Voldemort doesn't have enough time to gain his power back. This could lead to a different 5th, 6th and 7th year.
