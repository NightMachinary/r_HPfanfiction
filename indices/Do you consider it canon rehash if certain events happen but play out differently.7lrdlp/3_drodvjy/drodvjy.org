According to the dictionary, a rehash is a reuse of old ideas or material without significant change or improvement. I feel as long as the event had a reason to happen (no matter how different the characters are, Hermione always seems to run to the bathroom crying) and there are at least a few changes to make it interesting and original to read, that's fine.

I think all your examples are perfectly ok and I would go as far as to say adding some canon events make the fanfiction better and more realistic. I mean Voldemort wouldn't suddenly stop having an interest in the Prophecy or try to change his horcrux hiding place if Harry befriends the slytherins or something like that.

On a side note, is this spoilers for you own fanfiction linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)?
