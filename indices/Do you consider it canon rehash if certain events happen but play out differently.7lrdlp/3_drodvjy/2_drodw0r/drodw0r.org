[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/][*/Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8816781/Autumn-Souls][/Autumn Souls/]]

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Life never stops trying to tear her apart, but as everyone soon learns, Iris Potter bites back. Five unique tasks. Animagus and eventual reasonably powerful fem!Harry. Fourth year.
