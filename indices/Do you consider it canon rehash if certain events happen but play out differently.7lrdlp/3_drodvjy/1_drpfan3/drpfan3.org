I'm of the opinion that the stone always appears in Hogwarts in year 1 and someone gets the diary year 2. Harry's actions or lack of it wouldn't stop Lucius giving someone the diary, maybe not Ginny but someone, and the stone shows up before Harry does. Lots of scenarios where 3-7 don't happen though.
