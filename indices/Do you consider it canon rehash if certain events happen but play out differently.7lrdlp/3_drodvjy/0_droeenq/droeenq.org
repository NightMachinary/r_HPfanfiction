  I mean Voldemort wouldn't suddenly stop having an interest in the Prophecy

Yeah, this kinda thing makes me struggle with trying to avoid canon rehashing. Sometimes there's just no reason Voldemort would suddenly stop caring about the prophecy, or suddenly not want to get resurrected.

  On a side note, is this spoilers for you own fanfiction
#+end_quote

Nah. I just made the examples up on the spot. I mean, I'd kinda have to scrap the majority of my outline if Voldemort never got resurrected, so I shouldn't say that /none/ of it happens. The examples weren't taken from my story, though.
