Avoiding canon rehashing isn't the same as avoiding canon motivations.

For example, you could write a story where a much lonelier Harry winds up with the diary after Lucius attempts to stick it to Ginny. That story would play out extremely different even though canon motivations are pretty much the same.

Can do something similar with the prophecy. Harry, for whatever reason, isn't bothered by the horcrux in him, or it doesn't exist at all. Suddenly Voldemort needs a different way to get Harry into the DoM or even go himself, both of which can play out way differently than canon regardless of wanting the same thing.

tl;dr - Characters can want the same thing while changing the reason of why they can't have it.
