I would say it depends on how the scene is written. If the events leading up to it match canon exactly and you use the same or similar enough dialogue and descriptions as in the book, but Cedric lives, I would still consider it a canon rehash. On the other hand, if the actual details are totally different and Harry's internal dialogue is totally different and events play out differently I would not consider it a canon rehash.

One of the most frustrating rehashes I see tend to replace one character for another but the events play out exactly the same. Such as Harry is in slytherin and Draco is his side kick for some reason and they still go and rescue Hermione from the troll. Or Draco still steals the Rememberball, slytherin Harry catches it and Snape puts him on the team (Really? There is no way he would do that considering how he feels about Harry). I would say in your other examples, I would prefer you skip the cave scene or any parts of battle if you are going to keep them the same. Or at least put a new spin on them so it's not boring to read.
