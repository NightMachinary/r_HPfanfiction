That's not really a rehash you are describing. There's nothing wrong with using the stations of canon as long as you do your own spin on things and it makes a difference.

Having Neville instead of Ron go after the stone, just to reveal that Neville is a Chessmaster and he sacrifices himself for Harry and Hermione to go on, is bad. But if he suggests using the brooms from earlier and simply flying over the chessboard and the fire so the final showdown is 3vs1 and having Neville actually die in the process is no longer a canon rehash.

I think it comes down to choosing the right starting point. For example in one of my stories I have Harry hang out with Katie and Leanne because Ron and Hermione are fighting over Wormtail. Therefore a different confrontation with Pettigrew occurs and he ends up kissed. However, my story only starts at the end of the year and after a quick flashback the story goes on from there. Harry dropped Divination for Muggle Studies but that is only mentioned in Chapter 4 instead of dedicating an entire chapter just to show that scene. And a lot of stories choose the wrong starting point. If you are just changing a couple of minor details in Book one and nothing in CoS there's no need to show us the first two years. Just drop a line or two somewhere, which explains the changes.
