If there's no point of deviation (re-using a few canon scenes? Sure, but you have to make it clear how the characters who are very often unlike their canon counterparts get there! An intelligent Slytherin or Ravenclaw Harry for example needs a different motivation to confront Voldemort than "Doing the right thing" (the Raveclaw would IMHO rationalize that this is NOT his fight, he's a child and fighting is adult business, while the Slytherin might just want to survive and couldn't care less for "doing the right thing" without there being anything in it for him!)) and it's just one canon event after another?

Yeah! Boring rehash and illogical! If you influence stuff a lot then the path of events is disrupted and the other events will not happen like this (especially events the characters can directly influence! So an intelligent Harry could not stop the Tri-Wizard-Tournament from being restarted, especially if he doesn't know about the effort being made, but he might not save Sirius from the dementors or see any reason to go after Peter because he might have ignored to clues in favor of more studying!)
