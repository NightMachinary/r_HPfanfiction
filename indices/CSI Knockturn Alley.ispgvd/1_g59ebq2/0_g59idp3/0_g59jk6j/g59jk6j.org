Heh, yeah. If this fandom ever took a stab at the Buddy Cop Police Procedural formula, it'd definitely end up being a mix of Lucifer and Castle. Quips, desperately longing romantic feelings and an explosive situation forcing them to admit them, and magical-CSU technobabble (arcano-babble?) worthy of Star Trek itself. :)
