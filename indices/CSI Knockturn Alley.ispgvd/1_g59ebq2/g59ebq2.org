First auror stares down at the body, all... mutilated and wrong. Where even was the face? Oh, right, it's over there. He shuddered. "This criminal act is... Unforgiveable. Sunglasseo Demitto"

/sunglasses fall from the sky and land on his face/

He grins.

Second auror looks at first auror and sighs. "This isn't the time for puns, wanker. Have some decency."

First auror slumps. "Yeah, alright." Vanishes the sunglasses.

Second auror clucks his tongue, shakes his head sadly. "Can't you ever be... Sirius?"

/sunglasses reappear/

"YEEEEEEEAH!"

"You're an idiot, Padfoot."
