Not exactly CSI but this is a buddycop story with Tonks and Harry. It's Harry/Ginny and Tonks/Bill but the pairing is only a small part of the story. The ending is bad and the villain is obvious but still the investigation is fun to read and Tonks and Harry have a great chemistry in the story. I would love to see a sequel or something that has the same vibe.
