it uses both live and survive which implies theyvare different. I agree and say surviving is just not dying where living would be achieving there dreams. Voldemort could bever take over England and get rid of muggleborns if Harry is still there to fight him. Harry could never have a family because he refuses to have them become a target for Voldemort. In the spirit if the post though. If Harry could get an unbreakable vow fir Voldemort to remain in the borders of England and Harry jumps ship to France or something they could both get what they want. Everybody who doesn't want to die in a war can abandon England and Voldemort can have his pure blood society.
