There used to be an old fic (Web Archive seems to have two chapters out of 20+) where he had the location tortured out of him, and then some Death Eater took a prototype Polyjuice to impersonate him... the potion turned out to be permanent duration. Then, during the fic, the real Peter escapes just as the good guys catch the impersonator.
