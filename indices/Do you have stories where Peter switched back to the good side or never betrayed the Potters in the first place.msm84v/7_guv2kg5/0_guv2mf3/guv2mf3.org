  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

  Joining the Order was easy, a chance to die for their beliefs. It was much harder to live with his own choices, each worse than the next, until all he had left was to face the person he had become.This is the story of a man who survived, like a cockroach. This is the story of a man who did the wrong things for the right reasons, a man who betrayed everything he was and is now trying to make things right. A Peter reincarnated as Harry redemption fic you didn't even know you wanted. No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable. Falling down the slippery slope of your own decision-making is so much more human than rat.AN: No Horcruxes AU. The pairings are tagged, so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.
