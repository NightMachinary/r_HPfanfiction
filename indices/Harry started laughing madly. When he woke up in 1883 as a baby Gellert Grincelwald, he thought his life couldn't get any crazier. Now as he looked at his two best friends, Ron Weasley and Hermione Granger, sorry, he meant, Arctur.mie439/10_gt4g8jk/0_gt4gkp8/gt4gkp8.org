Well, it seemed like an easy excuse why Hermione is going to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. Her mother is a foreigner and after the bad reputation that got their name from Percival's actions, Wulfric Dumbledore and his wife decided to send their daughter elsewhere to protect her from being "the younger sister of a man who tortured and murdered Muggle boys for no reason". So they send her to Durmstrang.
