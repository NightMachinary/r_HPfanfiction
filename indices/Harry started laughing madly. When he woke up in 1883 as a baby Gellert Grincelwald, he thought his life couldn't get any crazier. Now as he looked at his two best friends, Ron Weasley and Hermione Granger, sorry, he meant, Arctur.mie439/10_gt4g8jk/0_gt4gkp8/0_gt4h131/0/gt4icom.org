I know Durmstrang is in Scandinavia. However, it also takes students from countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There is also a Fanon thing about growing up that German is used as a lingua franca within Durmstrang (the language the classes are taught in, the language the books are in etc). which may be due to the fact that the name from the school "Durmstrang" comes from the German expression "Sturm und Drang".
