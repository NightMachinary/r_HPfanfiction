There are plenty of real-world examples that the ruling majority ignore their own privileged position and claim they're being oppressed. American conservative Christians do this a lot. Remember the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_controversies#United_States]["war on Christmas"]]? They claim they're being persecuted because people use the term "holiday" instead of "Christmas".
