*Edit:* Wording and grammar.

Lucius wasn't finished. "Hogwarts has truly gone downhill as well. From what Draco tells me, Dumbledore is becoming oppressive towards Slytherins. They can't even say the so-called---", he sneered, "---'M-word' anymore, just because someone might have their feelings hurt! This political correctness has gone too far!"

"And the supposed prejudice against the Muggleborns?" Lady Zabini drawled, "Why, if a Muggleborn were deemed worthy of being sorted into our house, we would accept her as one of our own---and it would be the other houses throwing the M-word around!^{1} We cannot be blamed for the Muggleborns being simple, boorish, ignorant of our culture, weak of magic, and therefore unfit for our house!

"Now, if only Dumbledore didn't resist introducing mandatory wizard culture and etiquette classes---"

"Indeed, how dare he say on the very floor of Wizengamot that our etiquette and mores are copied from the late-nineteenth-century Muggle aristocracy and that we should get over ourselves! How would he even know?"^{2} Lord Flint interrupted.

"Hear-hear! How dare he insult our culture like that! It's ridiculous that everyone just assumes that all Slytherins are untrustworthy, selfish, and bigoted. They shouldn't generalise like that!" Lady Zabini concluded.

"Draco also tells me that two years running, they spent the whole year provoking Gryffindors in front of Lord Prince---and Lord Prince spent hours each week finding opportunities to award House Points---only for Dumbledore to just... cancel everything out at the last minute!

"He broke such a beautiful, and completely merited, seven-year streak!"

"Ah, well, that might have been my fault..." Harry began apologetically.

"Nonsense, Lord Potter! You were but a pawn in Dumbledore's manipulations---he gave you praise and validation for enacting his anti-Slytherin agenda," Lord Greengrass reassured him.

"Indeed, Lord Potter, isn't it awfully convenient that he had you kill one of Salazar Slytherin's few remaining legacies using the Sword of /Gryffindor/, of Goblin make?" Lord Slytherin added.

"Not to mention use the whole incident as leverage to force me off the Hogwarts Board of Governors over a mere misplacing of an artefact," concluded Lord Malfoy.

Harry nodded. It /was/ awfully convenient. He was so happy to finally have people on his side who could help him see through Dumbledore's manipulations.

^{1} Yes, Colubrina, I am looking at you and your /Green Girl/, but you are just the most popular example.

^{2} Except for the whole growing up in the 1880s with a very status-conscious Muggleborn mother.
