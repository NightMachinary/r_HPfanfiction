  Lucius is probably the richest person in Britain, who can bribe his way out of everything, yet he's the oppressed one?

Lets make him actually oppressed. Oppressed as only a privileged son can by, by his dad holding the seat in the Wizengamot and refusing to retire and hand it and control of the family businesses over to the younger generation. Oppressed as only a second son can be who knows his older brother will inherit it all and he will have to make his own fortune.
