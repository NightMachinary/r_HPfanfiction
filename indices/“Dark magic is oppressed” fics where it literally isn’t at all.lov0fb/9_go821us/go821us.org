I mean, I could see something like how torrents of incoming Muggle-borns and Half-Blood "Christian" witches and wizards have slowly eroded traditional wizarding culture...replaced Walpurgis and Samhain with Christmas and Halloween. Sacrificial rites with "silly wand waving" etc etc.

I think Lomonaaeren for all her other faults, does dark magic quite well.
