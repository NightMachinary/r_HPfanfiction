It's interesting how authors can unintentionally replicate fascist worldviews, right? Irl ideologues like that also pretend to be oppressed whenever it serves to grant a little sympathy - one just has to look at how conservative christians in the US have been trying to make "the war on christmas" a thing for decades. More hardline conservatives and neonazis do the exact same thing, too.

It's easier to draw supporters into your elitist (and also objectively evil) movement if it appears to be fighting for a right to exist from an underdog position, even though it actually has its claws in every institution of the country. Textbook doublethink.

I wonder if there's any fics where Harry realizes he's being radicalized and puts a stop to it.
