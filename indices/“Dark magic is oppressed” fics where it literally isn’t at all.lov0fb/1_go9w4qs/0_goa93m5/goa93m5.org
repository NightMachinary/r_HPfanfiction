I always figured dark magic was about how hard it is to fix, the few times it really gets mentioned is stuff like being unable to just reattach or regrow an ear cut off with Sectumsempra.

If fits with the way most dangers are just sort of ignored, sure you might break a few bones playing quidditch and kids hex each other in school (though that one is technically against the rule of casting spells in the corridors), but at most you're looking at a day or two to fix everything, often more like minutes.

So naturally a society used to being able to just magic injuries away is really against the sort of magic that can't.
