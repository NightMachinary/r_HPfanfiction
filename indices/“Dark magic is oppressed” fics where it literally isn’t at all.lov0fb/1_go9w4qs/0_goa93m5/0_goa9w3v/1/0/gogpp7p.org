The Killing Curse is the only one of the three that cannot be blocked canonically - it is never said one way or the other for the other two. The sort-of-canon reason that makes the most sense for why all three are immediate incarceration for casting them on a person is that you have to “mean them” for them to work. You have to /want/ someone dead, or tortured, or under your control.
