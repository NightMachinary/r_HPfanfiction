Indeed, there is a serious debate to be had whether the Unforgivables (all) are Dark Magic. They aren't explicitly called that in the book scenes that I recall, e.g. with fake!Moody. They are obviously illegal, but those two needn't be the same things. Something could be Dark Magic without being illegal, and illegal without being Dark Magic.

Basically, it goes back to the unclear definition. The "magically impossible to heal" aspect is the only formal criterion we got, but everyone in the books tosses around "Dark Magic" as some vague synonym for "powerful", "dangerous", "doing impossible things" or all of that around all the time. Harry wonders if Sirius used Dark Magic to escape the (thought to be impossible to break) prison of Azkaban. Parvati thinks one might need Dark Magic to open the CoS. Of course people think Parseltongue is Dark Magic. Rowling says Inferi are animated by Dark Magic. Voldemort says his rebirth potion is Dark Magic. Sometimes the synonym even is explicit, when in PS, Harry knows that restriced books "were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts."

So the contradictions you are running into are baked into Canon -- they aren't due to wrong definitions or reading of the material, it's the material itself which is contradicting. In some sense, this is pretty much fine, since this is the case with lots of things IRL, even though it would have been nice to have /the Ministry's/ definition, if only to figure out whether they are genuine or slapping the Dark label on everything they dislike.
