the trope requires significant redefining of what "the dark arts" are, which is why it never works. canon never gives a strict definition, but the dark arts seem to be any magic that is purposed for violence

for instance, the full body-bind curse is a /curse/. it is dark magic. this may seem overkill, since it's never explicitly treated with the "THAT'S DARK MAGIC!" stigma, but isnt tying people up without their consent considered violent in the real world? isnt drugging someone so they cant move violent?

dark magic isnt oppressed. it is violence. never understood why the fandom makes excuses for it.

if anything, canon is sometimes too soft on dark magic. why is hexing someone with pimples that leave permanent scars considered okay? why is using the oppugno jinx to set birds on someone over nothing just glossed over? (i know why; it's a case of designated protagonist)

admittedly i can see situations where this trope could work, though. what if the ministry put someone in azkaban for using dark magic as self-defense? (i can only see this happening in some cases, such as to a minority group or a political dissident, never to someone in a position of power like the pureblood elite.) there's the canonical oppression of werewolves and vampires, who are the /victims/ of dark magic, but we all know the "dark arts are oppressed" fics arent talking about the oppression of creatures. theyre just making excuses for pureblood and wizarding supremacy
