if "crush target with a rock" is the actual function of the spell, then yes. there's a difference between the oppugno jinx (which directs objects to attack the target) and the locomotion charm (which is simply levitating something). you /can/ theoretically hurt someone with the locomotion charm, but that isnt the intent of the spell itself.

it's why guns are (read: should be) regulated more strictly than cars. both can aid in violence, but only one of them is created with the /function/ of harming others

as for the full body-bind, there are exceptions to everything, just life in real life. aurors are allowed to use dark magic, to a certain extent, in order to capture dark wizards. patients may get strapped down to the table during surgery, for their own safety.
