I really like the definition of Dark Magic as magic used in that particular case to cause harm. It applies to anything, including things like levitating rocks at people.

Dark Arts is the study of magic designed for combat in particular. Use of that can increase legal penalties, since it's a lot easier to prove intent. They aren't completely illegal, however: the first responder amputation spell to stop withering curses is technically Dark Arts.

Since there's no safe way to strip a criminal of their ability to harm without taking away all their magic, the government imposes harsher restrictions on people studying those magics. The old families want to keep their books on combat magic, but don't want the increased legal scrutiny it requires to maintain their collections. After all, they're more responsible than those uppity mudbl-muggleborns.

There we go, another dimension to societal conflict that isn't "we're evil and racist just because lol".
