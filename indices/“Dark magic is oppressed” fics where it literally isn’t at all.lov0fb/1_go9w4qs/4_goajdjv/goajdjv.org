You say the Dark Arts aren't defined, and then give examples of what is Dark Magic?

I'd agree with the first -- and also with the idea that one needs a (re)definition, if the OP's kind of story is to be written. However, I don't see the problem there. As far as Canon goes, indeed the best idea of what is Dark Magic we've got is "destructive magic that resists countering or healing". This is why Moody's got a peg leg, why George can't regrow an ear, and why Snape can't stop the curse from Peverell's ring. In turn, that's how we know those spells would be classified as Dark Magic.

Obviously, this is also why the body-bind curse isn't Dark Magic. No one ever calls it that, either.

However, all of this is also irrelevant. FF can make up any random definition for Dark Magic it wants. Why would you then measure it by what is Dark Magic in Canon? One common trope is having the Ministry declare Dark Magic anything it doesn't want people to use. Another is re-inventing magic wholesale, by splitting it into "Light Magic" (doesn't exist in Canon), "Dark Magic" and "Neutral Magic". Yet another deals with addiction due to casting Dark Magic (also not a thing in Canon). Etc.pp.

Some of those attempts are silly, others more interesting, generally, though, they are by and large coherent (i.e., the Ministry forbids X, a faction of people is dedicated to X, hence they feel oppressed), if often a bit unmotivated -- exactly /why/ is the Ministry outlawing "blood magic"? The biggest issue in those stories isn't wonky definitions, it's a lack of motivation; the "Dark Side" appears utterly reasonable in protesting the ban of whatever has been defined "Dark", while the other side/the Ministry objectively look like morons going "it's Dark, so there".

There are better ways to create such conflict, IMO. One way I've been using is the topic of protection on homes, for instance -- there is a dilemma when people can protect their homes such that not even the Ministry can enter, so the Ministry would be inclined to regulate that, while the inhabitants would thank them very much to keep their noses out of their ancient protections. What's more, the split between who has such homes and who doesn't neatly falls along Purebloods/Muggleborns, since the prerequisite is a family home that has been around for generations, so it's also a class issue.

And like that, you have a nice conflict to work with, where all sides have a motivation that makes sense from /their/ POV. This is harder to achieve using Dark Magic as it is typically depicted, even if not quite impossible. But yeah, inasmuch as you're happy to handwave /why/ Dark Magic is oppressed, the rest works just fine in those stories. Whether it's to your or my taste or not is a different point.
