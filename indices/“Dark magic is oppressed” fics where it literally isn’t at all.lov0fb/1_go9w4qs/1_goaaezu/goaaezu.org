Another thing it does is make dark magic strictly defined, with a set cut off-point where magic ceases to be normal and is instead dark, which is then somehow used as a basis for the legal system. The actual means or criteria of this are never addressed, because they're impossible.

I think it might be a lot less totalitarian than some people keep writing into their fics. I'd say there's probably a lengthy list of extremely dark curses and rituals and whatever the hell - stuff like the unforgivables, the withering curse that kills dumbledore, dark magic that can petrify, fiendfyre etc, that is universally agreed upon as /dark/ - if you cast these spells, you're dark. No buts about it. These spells do nothing an upstanding citizen needs to do that can't be accomplished with a less violent spell (you light your stove with the incendio charm, not fiendfyre. You slaughter animals with a gouging spell to the head, not the killing curse. etc)

Then, there'd be a flavor to magic as well - all spells are on the spectrum of light and dark. Something like a cutting curse is darker than a summoning charm, but these distinctions can only be drawn in relation to other spells, not universally, and also not quantifiably. It's a matter of instinct at best. People can just tell, maybe even just subjectively, if magic is dark or not. Maybe it's a defense mechanism from humanity's past, when magic was still wilder and more chaotic.

And then, there's the corrupting aspect. Dark magic corrupts, that's seen plainly in canon - the aura of a dementor drives you insane, using the killing curse splits your soul, the dark mark burns and hurts. Dark magic damages the caster's and victim's soul, mind and body. The degree and extent of this corruption is likely part of the mindset of the caster - a sadist would be corrupted more easily than a trained secret agent, for example. One's mind influences magic, and magic influences the mind, causing a spiral of dark corruption that breeds more and more dark within the caster, making it easier to use darker magics, but also more difficult to empathize with fellow humans, be altruistic and generous, feel emotions like happiness and love.

And that's where these fics go wrong. Dark magic isn't, and should not be, cleanly separated from other magic - just as every human has a grain of evil inside of them, so does every piece of magic have a grain of dark. Inconsequential, of course, unless it is fed by the caster - which becomes easier with spells where the dark is more apparent.
