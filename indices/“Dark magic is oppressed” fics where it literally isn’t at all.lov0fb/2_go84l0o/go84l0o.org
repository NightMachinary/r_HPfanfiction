I've been planning on writing a story where it's the other way around. Yes certain magic and traditions are opressed, but not because of muggleborns or even Dumbledore. The plot basically has Dumbledore hire a new teacher for History of Magic on Harry's first year which brought a lot of the Ministry of Magic's laws and pureblood supremacy in question.
