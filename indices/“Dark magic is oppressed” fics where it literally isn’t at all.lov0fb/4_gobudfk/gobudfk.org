It's called the Slytherin Persecution Complex, and it's been the ruin of many a good fic.

I've lost count of Slytherin-protagonist fics in which Dumbledore is this vaguely hostile figure who is obviously very prejudiced against Slytherins and always looks side-eye at the protagonist, but who never actually does anything to meaningfully impede them.

As others have discussed, it's not actually an unrealistic scenario: as the saying goes, when you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression. And, that could make for a very compelling story, perhaps a tragedy featuring Slytherin!Harry as an unreliable narrator who falls under Draco's influence. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k0wojm/dursleys_treat_harry_same_as_dudley_and_spoil_him/gdlh1yl/][I've outlined a possible story along these lines here.]])

However, I think that the vast, vast majority of fic writers are using this trope without any amount of self-awareness. In their minds, the poor aristocrats who are merely trying to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words][secure the existence of their people and a future for magical children]] /are/ being oppressed, and their way of life is being undermined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia][Mugglebornds not learning their place]] being coddled by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#Conspiracy_theories_and_threats][Dumbledore]].

And, let's not forget the ever-neutral Greengrasses---as if neutrality in the face of a genocidal tyrant is something to be proud of---but again, it's very tempting and realistic to stay on the sidelines when /you/ aren't the one being targeted. (This, by the way, is what makes Ron a *hero*: Harry had Voldemort after him due to the prophecy; Hermione had Voldemort after her by virtue of her birth; but Ron could have walked away any time and sat out the conflict.) Unfortunately, too many writers treat "neutrality" as a virtue.

And that's the real tragedy.
