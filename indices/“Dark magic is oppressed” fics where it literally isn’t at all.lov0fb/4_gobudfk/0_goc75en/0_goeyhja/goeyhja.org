I stand by my value judgement that in-universe, keeping the Slytherin House around after Salazar quit the project was a mistake, and the sooner they abolish it and resort its students to the other houses, the better. (Really, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l6zo3h/being_a_slytherin/gl5itcm/][what do you expect from this social dynamic]]?) Hogwarts would do fine with 3 houses: Ravenclaw for those who want to /know/, Gryffindor for those who want to /do/, and Hufflepuff for those who want to /be/.

Also, the truth is most people in most situations behave more like the memetic Greengrasses than like Ron. One of the benefits of democracy and similar institutions is that if you set things up so that opposing evil and achieving justice /doesn't/ require heroism, you get a lot less evil and a lot more justice. If you do need a hero, then something has already gone horribly wrong.

Anyway, it's one thing to explore "Slytherin" values and their consequences, and, like many including myself wrote, it's not unrealistic for Slytherins to sincerely believe that they are being oppressed, whether or not they actually are. The problem is that both in canon and in the sort of fanfic that the OP describes, they are not, in fact, meaningfully oppressed, and so what they consider /resistance/ to oppression and Muggle encroachment is actually /aggression/---in short, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU][they are the baddies]].

And, again, it could work amazingly well if the author is aware that they are actually writing unreliable or downright villainous protagonists. Unfortunately, they rarely are.
