I mean, this is a value judgement, surely?

Like, all of what you say is coherent and consistent and gets you from the start of the post the end in a logical manner. But it also presupposes the notions you laid out: Xenophobia (or more charitably, insisting on cultural hegemony) is bad. Being a hero is good. Neutrality is bad.

The way I take those stories is a thought experiment, an exploration of a world founded on opposite notions: Cultural hegemony is good. Being a hero is stupid. Neutrality/keeping to yourself is good. And if that were the case, then what would the people look like, living based on that? What would their world look like? And what happens if those two opposing notions of what is good clash?

As a literary approach, I can see the merits. If nothing else, I find it interesting, because it's different from the usual approaches. And while I'm not going to claim every FF author out there put that kind of thought into it, the /effect/ is the same -- just, perhaps, that the author is genuinely believing what he writes instead (which would be a bit worriesome, but then again, I'm not meeting them IRL). And especially so in the light of the value devide we /know/ exists in Canon: The House system lends itself to this kind of setup rather splendidly, because it maps onto just those differences.

Look at your own post -- everything you wrote could work as a motivational speech for Gryffindors verbatim. What you lament, in turn, is what Slytherin is told /and shown/ to represent. That is /fascinating/. I could think about those differences and what makes people tick all day. And ultimately, it helps that I know myself, and know that I wouldn't be Ron, but the Greengrasses. So in that sense, it can also be an issue of better being able to relate.

But yes, that as a perspective of what might make such plots appealing, perhaps. I just disagree with dismissing them wholesale, as a few commenters here propose. That a story might simply be written terribly isn't affected by this, of course.
