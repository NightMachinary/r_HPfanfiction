Rowling's biggest crime against Slytherin was creating Slytherin. As I've argued many times, including in the link from my earlier post, between its founder and its stated values, there is pretty much no way for it not to result in a toxic social environment that brings out the worst in people---people who weren't inclined to be all that good in the first place. (For that matter, Dumbledore's greatest crime against Slytherin was putting Snape in charge.)

Hagrid is just one (not very bright) character expressing his opinions. There was nothing in the words and actions of actual Slytherins we see that would cause anyone to question the general accuracy of Hagrid's assessment.

Inter-house rivalry is ever-present and encouraged by the House Point system. But yes, the status-obsessed Slytherins probably take it a lot more seriously than the other houses, and the other houses respond in kind.

Oh, and before Harry started Hogwarts, Slytherins had won the House Cup for 7 years straight---an amazing winning streak that began a few short years after Snape became a Professor. The way I see it, at worst Dumbledore was merely compensating for someone else having his thumb on the proverbial scale.

You are right about McGonagall doing the wrong thing to Slytherins before the Battle of Hogwarts. What she should have done is realised that many of them were children of Death Eaters, Snatchers, and others who came to storm Hogwarts---and therefore excellent hostages and human shields. She could have saved so many innocent lives!

But seriously, they were about to engage in what may well have been the biggest wizard battle in centuries. Over the prior several years, Slytherin students ranged between enthusiastic support of Voldemort and silence. /Not one/ Slytherin student gave any indication, either at that point in the story, or in the years prior, that they disagreed with Pansy's proposal or that they wouldn't stab the defenders of Hogwarts in the back the moment they had the chance to to curry flavour with the new regime.

I shouldn't psychoanalyse groups of other people, but when has that stopped me? People see Slytherins as underdogs because:

1. Tom Felton was/is hot, so he couldn't possibly be a bad guy.
2. Alan Rickman was an amazing actor who played Snape with far more charisma and dignity than the character had in the books, so he couldn't possibly be both a victim and a perpetuator of the toxic environment that took a brilliant half-Muggle kid and turned him into a blood purist terrorist.
3. In stories with a Slytherin protagonist and/or main romantic interest, Slytherin house couldn't /possibly/ be the source of the adversity or a corrupting influence; so it must be some else's fault, and Slytherins are just misunderstood.
4. People who are into some sort of pseudo-Victorian aristocratic romantic and political intrigue project that sort of culture onto Slytherins. But, aristocrats tend to oppress people, and they can't /possibly/ be the baddies in the story, so they must just be defending themselves, right?
5. Some people like their edgy and ruthless protagonists, but they know that an actually evil character would deter readers, so they make up reasons why whomever their protagonist hurts are even worse.
