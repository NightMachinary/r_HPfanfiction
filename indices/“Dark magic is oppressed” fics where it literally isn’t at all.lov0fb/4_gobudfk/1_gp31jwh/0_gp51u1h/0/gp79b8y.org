  Rowling's biggest crime against Slytherin was creating Slytherin. As I've argued many times, including in the link from my earlier post, between its founder and its stated values, there is pretty much no way for it not to result in a toxic social environment that brings out the worst in people---people who weren't inclined to be all that good in the first place. (For that matter, Dumbledore's greatest crime against Slytherin was putting Snape in charge.)

The Common Rooms can serve as an echo chamber for fanatics, but it's not as if they are prevented from interacting with the other three houses, which possibly rejects Slytherin as a whole by default (James even insulted Sirius because his entire family is in Slytherin before even stepping on Hogwarts).

But how to explain people like Andromeda Black (married to a muggle), Cedrella Black (married to a Weasley), Iola Black (married to a muggle), Phineas Black (support for Muggle rights)? They were Slytherin, but if no Slytherin student at the time of Harry supported him, then what happened? The only logical explanation I can think of is that goodwill came from outside Slytherin, which none of the three houses in Harry's time have shown...On screen at least.

Dumbledore should have made Slughorn the head of Slytherin from the start. He may be a little elitist and show some favoritism, but he does not discriminate Muggleborns or house. His club would be a good way to bring the houses together for something in common.

  But seriously, they were about to engage in what may well have been the biggest wizard battle in centuries. Over the prior several years, Slytherin students ranged between enthusiastic support of Voldemort and silence.

Yes, but the film version was a bit loose and didn't take the situation seriously. I don't know if you saw the deleted scenes, but Argus (who has no magic power) is shown somehow being able to trap Slytherins in the dungeons while they just scream without using magic themselves. And then Draco just appears and simply blows up the gate, while Argus just watches as the Slytherins run away instead of apparating. It seemed more like Minerva being mean and capricious rather than considering them a series threat.

In addition, movie Minerva forgot to evacuate 11-16 year olds outside Hogwarts, even those from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.

In fact, 80% of Hogwarts are "silent" about Voldemort. We only saw much of Gryffindor because it is Harry's house, while we saw more of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff when Army Dumbledore was formed. And why was there no Slytherin? Simple, none of them took the trouble to form a bond with any Slytherin student.

  /Not one/ Slytherin student gave any indication, either at that point in the story, or in the years prior, that they disagreed with Pansy's proposal or that they wouldn't stab the defenders of Hogwarts in the back the moment they had the chance to to curry flavour with the new regime.

Pansy wanted to turn Harry over after Voldemort promised not to hurt anyone if they turned Harry over. In fact, although she was probably being selfish, she did bring an interesting moral dilemma.

If you had to choose between sacrificing just one person to prevent multiple people from dying, what would be better? Sure, we know that Harry is very important in defeating Voldemort, but how would most students know that? On the other hand, if Harry were killed, he could end up being a kind of martyr. In fact, he dying turned out to be the option he chose anyway.

Sure, Pansy herself might just be thinking about herself, but the fact that we don't see any nameless Slytherin student supporting Pansy makes me think that they were more concerned with their own safety than who will win.

Do you really think that a 12-year-old Slytherin child who was selected because he wants to prove himself/herself (ambition) and cautious (evasive, prefers to avoid problems directly) deserves to be locked in a dungeon because last year, he did not defend Harry (a 16-year-old boy) against Draco, Crabble and Goyle (16-year-old bullies who would most likely hit that same child in Common Room)?

Anyway, I'm not saying that all Slytherins are secretly misunderstood, but talking about the OP saying that dark magic is oppressed. The narrative in the movie is so loose in relation to Slytherins that if you look carefully, you will see Slytherin students studying with Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw even outside of classes.

So it's easy to see what kind of thing someone could say to discredit Dumbledore, like the fact that Harry was allowed to play Quidditch at the age of 11 without any testing.

But at the same time, "Lord Malfoy" couldn't use that for bashing Dumbledore since Lucius simply insisted that Draco could play Quidditch in the second year, so he would be a hypocrite. But Dumbledore, Minerva, Snape and Lucius don't care that another Gryffindor and Slytherin student misses the chance to play Quidditch because of this.
