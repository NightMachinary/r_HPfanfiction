  The Common Rooms can serve as an echo chamber for fanatics, but it's not as if they are prevented from interacting with the other three houses, which possibly rejects Slytherin as a whole by default (James even insulted Sirius because his entire family is in Slytherin before even stepping on Hogwarts).
#+end_quote

I am sure that Ravenclaw families joke about becoming a Gryffindor meathead, Gryffindors laugh about the duffers in Hufflepuff, and Hufflepuffs think that each of other houses is nutty in its own way. Only Slytherins in OhSoOpressed!Slytherin!Protagonist fics treat it like some kind of oppression and victimisation.

  But how to explain people like Andromeda Black (married to a muggle), Cedrella Black (married to a Weasley), Iola Black (married to a muggle), Phineas Black (support for Muggle rights)? They were Slytherin, but if no Slytherin student at the time of Harry supported him, then what happened? The only logical explanation I can think of is that goodwill came from outside Slytherin, which none of the three houses in Harry's time have shown...On screen at least.
#+end_quote

Some people manage to defy their toxic social environment. Maybe someone reached out to them. Maybe they were the first to reach out. Maybe they ostracised from their own house. Maybe they kept their heads down and gave no indication of their beliefs until after they graduated. Some of them are not actually stated to have been Slytherin in canon sources. In any case, you seem to be shifting the burden of "redeeming" Slytherins on to someone else, which is in itself toxic. It's not Hermione's job to support Draco in growing past his bigotry. Particularly during Harry's time, deciding whom to trust was literally a mater of life and death.

  Dumbledore should have made Slughorn the head of Slytherin from the start. He may be a little elitist and show some favoritism, but he does not discriminate Muggleborns or house. His club would be a good way to bring the houses together for something in common.
#+end_quote

Slughorn was old and wanted to retire; Dumbledore had to dangle Harry and security of Hogwarts to get him back. And even as a professor, Slughorn was a corrupt wheeler-and-dealer, who took advantage of his position to obtain favours from students. His club was, first and foremost, a way for him to get future leaders of the wizarding world in his debt and make sure that those in his debt would become the future leaders of the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, but the film version was a bit loose and didn't take the situation seriously. I don't know if you saw the deleted scenes, but Argus (who has no magic power) is shown somehow being able to trap Slytherins in the dungeons while they just scream without using magic themselves. And then Draco just appears and simply blows up the gate, while Argus just watches as the Slytherins run away instead of apparating. It seemed more like Minerva being mean and capricious rather than considering them a series threat. In addition, movie Minerva forgot to evacuate 11-16 year olds outside Hogwarts, even those from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.
#+end_quote

I never saw the films past the first, so I wouldn't know; but my sense is that the consensus of the fandom is that where the movies contradict the books, the books trump the movies, so I don't care either.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, 80% of Hogwarts are "silent" about Voldemort. We only saw much of Gryffindor because it is Harry's house, while we saw more of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff when Army Dumbledore was formed.
#+end_quote

We are talking about why Slytherins are supposedly mistreated and ostracised.

#+begin_quote
  And why was there no Slytherin? Simple, none of them took the trouble to form a bond with any Slytherin student.
#+end_quote

Again, why is it on the other houses to redeem Slytherins? Why didn't any Slytherins take the trouble to form a bond with any non-Slytherin student?

#+begin_quote
  Pansy wanted to turn Harry over after Voldemort promised not to hurt anyone if they turned Harry over. In fact, although she was probably being selfish, she did bring an interesting moral dilemma.
#+end_quote

No, she really didn't. /Everyone/ knew about Voldemort's offer, so she provided no new information. What she did was /advocate/ for it.

I mean, one possible headcanon is that it was a brilliant Slytherin move to get herself and her house evacuated from Hogwarts just before it would become a battlefield. The logic:

1. If Voldemort wins, she can say that she was loyal to him even when outnumbered 3 to 1.
2. If Voldemort loses, the Order is probably not going to imprison her just for bringing up the possibility.

#+begin_quote
  If you had to choose between sacrificing just one person to prevent multiple people from dying, what would be better? Sure, we know that Harry is very important in defeating Voldemort, but how would most students know that?
#+end_quote

Pretty much all the major events of the prior 17 years, starting with the whole BWL incident and continuing nearly every year of his Hogwarts career, and Potterwatch afterwards?

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, if Harry were killed, he could end up being a kind of martyr. In fact, he dying turned out to be the option he chose anyway. Sure, Pansy herself might just be thinking about herself, but the fact that we don't see any nameless Slytherin student supporting Pansy makes me think that they were more concerned with their own safety than who will win.
#+end_quote

Maybe the rest were silent because they were outnumbered 3 to 1 and Pansy was the only one reckless enough to say what everyone was thinking. If one is willing to use a big enough a shoehorn, any action can have any explanation. For example, I've seen a Dramionist argue, with a straight face (metaphorically speaking), that during the Death Eater attack at the Quiddich championship, Draco wasn't taunting the trio. He was /warning/ them to get to safety.

#+begin_quote
  Do you really think that a 12-year-old Slytherin child who was selected because he wants to prove himself/herself (ambition) and cautious (evasive, prefers to avoid problems directly) deserves to be locked in a dungeon because last year, he did not defend Harry (a 16-year-old boy) against Draco, Crabble and Goyle (16-year-old bullies who would most likely hit that same child in Common Room)?
#+end_quote

No, and that's why I keep saying that the Slytherin house environment is toxic and should be abolished, its students resorted into other houses. If you weren't bad when you were sorted there, you will be by the time you graduate, with a tiny handful of exceptions. Nobody deserves to be exposed to that.

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, I'm not saying that all Slytherins are secretly misunderstood, but talking about the OP saying that dark magic is oppressed. The narrative in the movie is so loose in relation to Slytherins that if you look carefully, you will see Slytherin students studying with Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw even outside of classes. So it's easy to see what kind of thing someone could say to discredit Dumbledore, like the fact that Harry was allowed to play Quidditch at the age of 11 without any testing.
#+end_quote

The OP was about /fanfics/, particularly the kind where the fic acts like the Slytherins are oppressed, they whine about it constantly, and yet the actual storyline doesn't show any actual oppression. That is all.

#+begin_quote
  But at the same time, "Lord Malfoy" couldn't use that for bashing Dumbledore since Lucius simply insisted that Draco could play Quidditch in the second year, so he would be a hypocrite. But Dumbledore, Minerva, Snape and Lucius don't care that another Gryffindor and Slytherin student misses the chance to play Quidditch because of this.
#+end_quote

AFAIK, there was no rule against trying out in your first year; just against having your own broom. Maybe Draco just wasn't able to make Seeker in his first year, so Lucius had to bribe the team captain with new brooms the year after. (Or maybe Draco didn't really care until Harry became a seeker, and then it was too late to try out.)
