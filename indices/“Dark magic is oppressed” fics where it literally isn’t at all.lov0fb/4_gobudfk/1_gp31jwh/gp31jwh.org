To be fair, isn't there a time when the narrative seems biased against the Slytherins? A good example is when Hagrid implies that all dark wizards outside Slytherin, although he thought Sirius Black was a traitor (later, we found out it was Peter, but she is also a Gryffindor).

Or when an 11-year-old is selected for Slytherin, three-fourths of the school will go against them.

Or when Slytherin would win the first two years, but Dumbledore gave Gryffindor a lot of points for doing things that have nothing to do with school activity. He even placed Slytherin flags and then changed them later as if he were mocking them.

Or when Minerva locked a bunch of Slytherin children in the dungeons just because Pansy wanted to deliver Harry Potter. Basically in the middle of the battlefield. That was only in the movies, but still.

And I know people don't like to talk about that certain book, but apparently even Harry Potter disparages his own son for being in Slytherin and for making friends with an 11-year-old boy for the crime of being the son of the boy who mistreated him at school.

​

And it's not like I'm a big Slytherin fan, but I can see why some people see it as underdogs who are treated badly by people who expect the worst of them and then complain when it happens.

Not that it justifies fanaticism, I'm talking about the house in general, also known as Slytherin students who are not Draco, Crabble, Goyle, Pansy and Blaise.
