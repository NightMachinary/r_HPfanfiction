You say often it isn't, I say in some way it is. Doesn't seem all that much a contradiction :P

I was thinking of being a shoe-in for a job because you're <Attribute>, and now it's changed, other people also can apply, and since there's only a finite number of open positions, you're now less likely to get in.

Or, if you wanted to create such conflict in a HP AU, making Hogwarts expensive, making (some) old Purebloods house rich, cash poor (i.e., they have a nice manor and land, but no cash, a common thing in Britain back in the days), and having a finite number of scholarship grants: And now it used to be the case those purebloods got in based on "pure blood", but since Hogwarts began admitting more and more Muggleborns, the grants got diverted that way, leaving the purebloods stranded and unable to attend. Naturally, this creates resentment.

But yes, I agree that it's less of a zero-sum game for cultural issues. But of course, there are plenty of ways under the sun to get offended about being forced (not to) celebrate "Christmas" without that being the case. If there's one thing in the world people are good at, it's feeling aggrieved.
