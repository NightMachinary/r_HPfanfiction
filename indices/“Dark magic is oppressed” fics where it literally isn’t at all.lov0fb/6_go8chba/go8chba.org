There are two aspects that come to mind.

For one, as the other comment noted, it's a very real thing that people who on paper have all the opportunities in the world claim (and often, actually feel) they are disadvantaged. One reason for this can be a relative change: They used to be heavily favoured, but in recent years, those that were disadvantaged have gotten more opportunities. As this is in some sense a zero-sum game, it feels for the former group as though they are now getting discriminated against (when actually, they're just losing some privileges).

Of course, this requires a reasonably mature writer to make that point; I won't doubt that often, it's actually straight-face'd "the richest man in wizarding Britain is oppressed".

But the second aspect is that you appear to be mixing Canon and whatever story you are reading, and that is naturally creating contradictions. In Canon, there is no indication that e.g. Malfoy (prior to his arrest) is anything but a powerful figure with connections to get done whatever he wants to get done. He naturally vaguely laments about Mudbloods and no proper wizards, but as the group in question is kept away from influence, he hasn't got much to complain about -- and consequently, /he doesn't/.

On the other hand, if the story revamps the wizarding world such that no Dark Magic and holidays and etc. everything you noted, then he legitimately /has/ a reason to complain. The most common setup I've encountered is a reformist block lead by Dumbledore, who gained the needed influence on the back of his victory against Grindelwald and/or after Voldemort's fall. The purebloods you cited aren't in power: They are a minority faction in a Fanon-Wizengamot and /can't/ get things done the way they want to. This setup also may involve a powerful Ministry that can ignore the Wizengamot altogether, and Dumbledore's influence there surpassing the one of Malfoy & co.

.

Of course, without knowing which story in particular you read, it's hard to say whether it makes sense. My experience is that probably most of the time, it does make sense, if feeling a bit artificial, wooden, one-dimensional or simplistic.
