It's a relatively common trope that Petunia is a squib, and thus is capable of making potions. (Squibs have magic --- they can see Hogwarts and Dementors, after all --- they are just unable to access it. In a world where the brewing process leaches the necessary magic from the brewer, squibs can make potions but cannot perform spells, even accidentally.)
