Petunia can't be a Squib since Lily is a Muggle-born. therefore her parents are Muggles and therefore they are non magical and therefore they cannot give birth to a Squib (someone defined in the books as non-magical born out of magical parents). The only "magical" thing about Filch is the fact that he has a familiar but otherwise we are not given enough information about him to know what he can or cannot do. Also, with regards to Hogwarts, it is only said to appear as ruins for Muggle seeing it from outside but I would be surprised that during Dumbledore's time, at least, no Muggle-Born had their parents come over (at least Moaning Myrtle's parents came to recover her body) so I think those charms were selective.
