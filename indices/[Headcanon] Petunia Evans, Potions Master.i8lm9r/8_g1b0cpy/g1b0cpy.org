There's a few fics that give Petunia just enough magic to brew potions, but not enough to attend Hogwarts.

Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian: linkffn(13308768) Petunia brews potions and does other little bits of magic. The Dursleys are nicer to Harry than in canon on account of magic not being as weird to them, and Dudley being a Wizard (he gets sorted into Hufflepuff).

It's incomplete but updated July 22nd so I don't consider it abandoned.

Another one is There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving: linkffn(13137899)

In this one, Petunia is a "hedge witch" - enough magic to cast a few first-year spells, nowhere near enough to attend Hogwarts. She basically ends up homeschooling herself. Fair warning, Dumbledore is /heavily/ bashed in this one - he's basically Grindelwald but as Headmaster of Hogwarts.
