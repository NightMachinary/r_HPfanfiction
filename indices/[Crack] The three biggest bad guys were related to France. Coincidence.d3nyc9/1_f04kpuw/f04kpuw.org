I think you're stretching it a bit - technically there are some Malfoy's running around in France, but it's not like it's anywhere near a common name - and Lestrange is much more 'British' than French IMO (and a google search in the same vein as Malfoy shows that).

In addition, even Malfoy gets renamed to Malefoy in the French version (in general places get localized as well, like Hogwarts -> Poudlard, and some names do - like Ludo Bagman -> Ludo Verpey, and other ones that 'frenchify' the names).

I'd say in Voldemort's case it's just a way to have an exotic sounding name that worked. It's a pretty funny one to realize it's the actual english name though when reading the french one ;)
