Personally I've never seen Lestrange for pubs or restaurants in France - and l'Estrange (another variation) isn't really found only in France from what I can tell. De Lestrange pulls a bit, but nothing much.

It might be of mixed old French and English, but I wouldn't call it particularly French personally. Maybe it's just not been in the areas where I lived, or found on the internet.

Malefoy IMO makes it read a bit more like an 'old' name - probably used to show he's from an old wizarding society?
