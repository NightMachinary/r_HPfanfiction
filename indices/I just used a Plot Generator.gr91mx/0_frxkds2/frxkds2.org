Harry Potter, the House Elf

In a castle there lived a sporty, loyal house elf named Harry Potter. Not a dark cunning, angsty castle, filled with maps and a Brave smell, nor yet a Daring, Passionate, Determined castle with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a house elf-castle, and that means Happiness.

One day, after a troubling visit from the gryphon Albus Dumbledore, Harry leaves his castle and sets out in search of three Ambitious books. A quest undertaken in the company of Wizards, Witches and resourceful Snakes.

In the search for the gryphon-guarded books, Harry Potter surprises even himself with his Intelligence and skill as a Student.

During his travels, Harry rescues a wand, an heirloom belonging to Albus. But when Albus refuses to try dueling, their friendship is over.

However, Albus is wounded at the Battle of Hogwarts and the two reconcile just before Harry engages in some serious dueling.

Harry accepts one of the three Ambitious books and returns home to his castle a very wealthy house elf
