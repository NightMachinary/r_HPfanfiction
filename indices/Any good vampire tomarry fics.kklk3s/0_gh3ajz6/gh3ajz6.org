It's been a really long time since I read it, but this story came to mind immediately when I saw your request: In Noctem, by windwrites

AU. After his parents' deaths in 1927, Hadrian Peverell is adopted and taught the art of politics. Years later, as war looms on the horizon and his very identity becomes his greatest secret, Hadrian has no choice but to trust someone almost as dangerous as he himself: Tom Riddle. A story of love and loss. A story of power, and of one too great to seek it. HP/TMR. DarkHarry
