What sort of other fics have you read? What's your favorite fic?

I highly recommend reading ABC to everyone. The plot is very well written and makes sense from start to finish. There is a little bit of mystery but I imagine that I in this thread and others elsewhere have spoiled it for you. There's a great bunch of action in the middle, and while it doesn't conclude with the epic battle, it's a pretty epic fight anyway. The humor is very immature in some places, but it's still funny anyway.

Harry plays a lot of roles in the fic but it's always true to who he is, as in the character doesn't sacrifice his backstory and relationships every three pages. It has some of my favorite characters in the entire fandom: Ginny, Ginevra, Sirius, Jimmy, Bellatrix, Tom, even Albus. It also has, and this is a minor spoiler so look away, my favorite of [[/spoiler][hover to reveal spoiler (sorry mobile folks)]]. And tbh it's only a spoiler because it tells you that one of the goals was achieved and I'm not going to tell you what the circumstances and result was other than fucking hilarious.

There's just too many good things in this fic, especially compared to the millions and millions of words written by kids who just don't even know how to write that clog up the various sites.
