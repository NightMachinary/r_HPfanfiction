[Ginny Weasly's Ghost Speaking] - from "A Black Comedy" "Voldemort announced that he'd honor that honest fear with a quick and painless death." Next thing I knew a bright green Killing Curse was headed straigt for Owen. I was wondering waht was taking my sugar-bear so long when I realized what I had to do. "oh no," Sirius mumbled under his breath. I thought about nothing but my love for Harry and stepped right into the path of the curse. I held my want firm and just as the death curse was a meter away I shouted "Love Shield!"

I nearly died laughing.
