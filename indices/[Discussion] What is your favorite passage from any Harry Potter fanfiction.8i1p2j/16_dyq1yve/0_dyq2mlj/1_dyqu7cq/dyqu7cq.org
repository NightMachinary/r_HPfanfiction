Gosh I was off by two whole fics! It's actually from the first in the series, Where in the World is Harry Potter? This is less of a passage and more of a scene which consists of half of the length of Chapter 11:

  "He's tricking us into confronting Professor Snape. Maybe even befriending him."

  "Oh Neville, he's not that bad."

  "Do you not remember any of my Potions classes at all?"

  Hermione winced. "I was hoping you might have forgotten those, but I guess not."

  Neville narrowed his eyes. "He used to be my boggart for goodness sake. It's not the easiest thing in the world to forget."

  "He's not your boggart anymore?"

  Neville shook his head.

  "Well what is?"

  "It's kind of personal and I'd rather not say."

  "Oh I'm sorry. Of course Neville." Hermione apologized. "Would you like me to come with you when you ask for Professor Snape's help?"

  "You bet your butter you're coming with me. Let's get this over with. Now." Neville exclaimed before leading the way out of the History of Magic classroom and headed down towards the dungeons.

  Hermione quickly caught up and walked with Neville. "Is it spiders?"

  Neville turned to her. "What? No. I'm not afraid of spiders. That's just Ron."

  Hermione kept walking and thinking. "Is it girls?"

  "No. Don't be silly." Neville said as they continued. "Hermione, did you just ask me that because you think I'm gay? Or because you think I'm straight?"

  Hermione shook her head. "Never mind." She was quiet for about five seconds before she asked, "Does it have to do with your grandmother?"

  "Hermione! I said I didn't want to tell you."

  Hermione pouted. "You never said I couldn't guess though. So, is it a plant?"

  Neville was getting frustrated and stopped walking. "Alright! Fine." Neville yelled. "Have you ever seen Little Shop of Horrors?"

  Hermione's face split into a smile. "Yes!"

  Neville looked her in the eye and said, "Well it has absolutely nothing to do with that." And he quickly turned and headed on to the dungeons.

  "Come on Neville. That's not fair. I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours."

  "Oh please Hermione. What's next? You going to pinky swear to be my best friend? And besides I already know yours."

  "You do not! It's probably changed since you last saw it anyway."

  "Yeah. I know. Now your greatest fear is to receive an ancient magical tome and to accidentally ruin it by writing grocery lists in it."

  Hermione was blushing now and getting angry. "Fine. So it is. But now you have to tell me yours."

  "Forget it Hermione. You've already got enough things to make fun of me for. And I still owe you for petrifying me in first year."

  "In fairness Neville, if we'd let you stop us that night, Voldemort would have gotten the stone and become immortal."

  "Oh geez. You hide behind that excuse for everything. It's always 'Voldemort would have won' or 'Harry would have died' or 'I don't care if they're enjoying it! No more House elf flying experiments!' I'll tell you what Hermione, you show me your breasts and I'll tell you."

  Hermione shrieked. "Neville! That is completely inappropriate to even ask! And it's crude and way too personal!"

  Neville just raised an eyebrow and stared at Hermione in response.

  Hermione just huffed angrily. "Alright. Fine. I get it."

  Neville smirked victoriously and was about to change the subject when Hermione quickly looked both ways down the hall and pulled up her sweater, shirt, and bra and flashed Neville.

  "Buh...err...duh..." He mumbled out.

  "But now I'm getting proof. We're going to Nicholas's office and getting a boggart." Hermione grabbed Neville by the elbow and quickly headed towards the DADA office.

  Professor Flamel explained. "Sure. Got a couple boggarts in boxes in the back. Let me grab one."

  He returned moments later. "Neville, you sure you're ready for this?"

  He was still occasionally making sounds with his mouth. "Duh...err..."

  Nicholas smiled and said "Works for me," before lifting the lid on a box and aiming it towards Neville.

  Professor Flamel watched the boggart shift forms and shapes before settling on something very recognizable. "Wow! That's a heck of a nice looking pair! Whose are those Neville?"

  Hermione eyes nearly popped out of her head as she let out a loud "Eep!" and grabbed Neville quickly leaving the room. She yelled back from the hallway, "Thanks Professor Flamel. Bye."

  "Somehow this is Harry's fault I know it. Argh!" an embarrassed and angry Hermione was yelling.

  "Erg...umm...homina..."

  Hermione couldn't take anymore and slapped the young man harshly across his face.

  "Ouch!" he yelled tenderly rubbing his cheek. "Umm...thanks Hermione. You know, for everything."

  Hermione just shook her head. "At the very least Neville, will you tell me what your boggart used to be?"

  "It used to be Professor Snape. You know that."

  "No! I mean after that."

  Neville giggled. "Oh, no, it's always been Snape. I was just lying and wondering if you would show me the twins. In seventh year Harry taught me a trick with your mind to focus on an image and control what a boggart becomes. But I'll call us even for the Petrificus now." Neville finished with a goofy grin and headed on towards the dungeons again.

  She was thinking 'I knew this was Harry's fault!' but continued to scowl at Neville.

  "Come on Hermione. Don't hate the player. I'm trying to get into a Slytherin mindset, so I can relate to Snape better."

  Hermione just huffed but walked beside him none the less. "I can't help but wonder if Harry's cheek is contagious and spreading."
