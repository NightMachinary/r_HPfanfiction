I've googled it a dozen times, checked Fiction Hunt, googled passages that I can remember, including most of my favorite quote.

It was a wonderful, if simple, story.

From memory:

Little Ginny meets Little Luna on the Hogwarts Express, where Luna expresses her desire to become a Ravenclaw, like her daddy and because "Ravenclaws always tell the truth." Ginny notices the /Quibbler/ and remembers what Arthur told her--that although the /Quibbler/ often gets facts wrong, they never actually print anything they know isn't true, which is more than can be said for /The Daily Prophet,/ which takes a kernel of truth and spins rumors and speculation out of it.

Most of /Chamber of Secrets/ through /Goblet of Fire/ is glossed over, but if I recall correctly, Ginny is grateful that Luna doesn't treat her any differently than she did before.

She's aware of Luna's strangeness, and the comments from their classmates, but Hermione urges her to take pride in her friendship, as it really isn't anybody's business who Ginny is and isn't friends with.

Ginny takes Hermione's advice, and stands up to Luna's bullies, but makes it worse when she accidentally says a nickname she has for Luna out loud: "Loony Lovegood is my friend."

Ginny is simultaneously sick with guilt but also frustrated that Luna doesn't seem to mind--at one point demanding that Luna be angry with her, only for Luna to say that she thought Ginny was more her friend out of pity than anything else, which frustrates Ginny all the more, because she can't believe how stubborn Luna is.

An argument ensues, only for it to finish with Ginny teaching Luna how to ride a broomstick and Luna singing a little song.

Glimpses of their friendship then are seen--studying together, sitting next to each other in class, Ginny noticing Luna's growing skills in Dumbledore's Army and thinking that her bunny Patronus suits her. Luna visits the Burrow early in the summer between /OotP/ and /HBP/ and late one night Luna reveals during one of Ginny's Guessing Games ("Luna, what's your pet peeve?") that she hates being made fun of, and she's grateful, almost to the point of tears, that Ginny stands up for her.

They fall asleep holding hands.

I don't remember any details about the War, though I think the girls just sat next to each other after the fighting was over.

The story ended with the quote I posted--though I did forget the part where Ginny turned to Luna waiting for the answer and Luna "twitched her nose in that rabbit-like ways of hers."
