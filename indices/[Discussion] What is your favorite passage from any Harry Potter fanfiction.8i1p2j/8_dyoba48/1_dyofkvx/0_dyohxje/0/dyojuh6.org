Is it this [[https://hp-fanfiction.livejournal.com/819326.html][one]]? Apparently it's just a x-post, and the original is deleted, so I'm not too sure, but I'm digging around to see if I can find it. The original LJ account is strange. The only post is dated to 2024, as an introduction.

Edit: interesting, one of the few other mentions I can find of such a fic is also on Reddit and is a post by you.
