I've got a bunch of different favorites, for various situations--Best Boggart Passage, Best Mauraders Jr. Passage, Best Sorting Hat Passages, Best Tearjerker, you get the picture. I may post those later, for the sake of discussion.

But my most favorite passage of all Harry Potter fanfic, comes from /Faith and Understanding,/ a medium-length one shot that focused on Ginny and Luna's friendship, and Ginny's musings therein. Coincidentally, it was my favorite fanfic as well. That I stupidly never learned how to archive and to my knowledge, it was never archived, and thus is lost to cyberspace.

In any event, to provide context, Ginny had developed a habit of asking Luna questions about herself and then seeing if she could guess the answer ahead of time. An attempt to understand Luna Lovegood that was usually in vain.

It's not stated outright, but I believe it was their seventh year, after the War.

Roughly paraphrased, since it's been at least a year since I lost it:

/It was during one warm afternoon of luxurious laziness where she and Luna were laying out in the grass near the Lake when Ginny decided to play one more guessing game and ask Luna a question. A rather personal one./

/"Luna, who's your favorite person?"/

/She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the right answer popped into her head. Luna's daddy. Her most talked about person. Surely, he was her favorite./

/"You are."/

/Ginny startled. She hadn't expected that. But then, who could expect anything when it came to Luna Lovegood?"/

/But that was okay./

/Luna was Ginny's favorite person too./
