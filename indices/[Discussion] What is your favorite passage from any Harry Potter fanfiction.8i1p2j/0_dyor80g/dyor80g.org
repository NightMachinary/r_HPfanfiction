It's from a fic by Resa Aureus, "The Last Marauder" where Hermione travels back in time to prevent Pettigrew from betraying the Potters. She gets into a relationship of sorts with Sirius. If I remember well (can't find the specific passage), when they are both naked in bed, Sirius tells Hermione he named her breasts Flourish and Blotts. A mortified Hermione exclaims "YOU NAMED MY BREASTS AFTER A BOOKSTORE?"

Another one is from the Innocent series by Marauderlover7. It's a conversation between Pettigrew and Lucius Malfoy "I have an Order of Merlin -" "For dying," [Lucius] said. "And you failed at that."

These crack me up everytime!
