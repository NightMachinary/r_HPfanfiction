  For me to be ended this way. For me to fall here. I have never deluded myself into thinking I am blessed to live a long life. My end is on the battlefield, bathed in blood and surrounded by the bodies of my enemies. My fate, my glory is there. The death will be quick, painless, and I will die knowing that I defied the foe until the very end. But here, now, this glory is denied to me. Against the dragon, my death will be lengthy and prolonged. It will suck the magic from my core until there is nothing left. I will be forced to watch my magic leave me, feel it draining away while I am helpless to do anything. For if I break the connection, the dragon will incinerate me as soon as it opens its jaws. So I kneel. In the dirt. Blood caking my face and hate welling impotently in my heart.

  There will be no victory here. All this defiance, all this courage will amount for nothing if the foe I struggle against cannot be bested. For a brief moment I recall the tale I told of the knight and the dragon. One that lives in a fairytale. The other surviving in reality. At this time I cannot help but think I would rather be the knight in the fairytale
