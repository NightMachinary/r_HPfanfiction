  "Young lady, do you see the sum I have written on this slip of parchment?"

  "Yes. I mean, yes professor."

  "That may or may not be around the sum I am paid, on a yearly basis, to fulfil my employment contract with Hogwarts. I made roughly three times as much for a dozen or so hours of work last term...merely for being polite to someone you have dismissed as being worthless to know. Now which one of us is the better Slytherin?"
