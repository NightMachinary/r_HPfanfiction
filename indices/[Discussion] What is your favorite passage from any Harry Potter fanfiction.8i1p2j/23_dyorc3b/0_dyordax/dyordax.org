Quoting Cauterize is just too easy I know, but still:

#+begin_quote
  George Weasley goes next. When Dennis displays the photograph, some ignorant critic finds fault with the framing. "Too heavy on one side...empty space on the left. Terrible photograph...missing something vital," he concludes.

  Dennis doesn't quite know how to explain, that's the point. These are scars of the war; the blank white emptiness of the backdrop on the right hand side of the photograph is the scar, more than the missing ear that's barely noticeable.

  Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point.

This is another fic that brings the imagery and horrors of magical war and makes them real.

Maybe one shots in general are too easy because the hopeful and nostalgic ending to Time To Say Goodbye tends to get me teared up too:

#+begin_quote
  Hugs were exchanged, tearfully in some cases, and soon enough the six of them stood in three distinct groups: Harry and Hermione, Ron and Luna, Ginny and Neville.

  "Stay in touch," Luna said. "Try not to let the Nargles get to you."

  "We'll try," Harry said, laughing good-naturedly. "Thanks Luna."

  A charged silence passed briefly between all of them. Neville shuffled uncertainly on his feet.

  "I guess this is time to say goodbye," he said.

  "I think so," Hermione responded, quietly.

  "See you soon!" Ginny said, and the couples parted. Neville and Ginny headed for the greenhouses so he could pick up one of his magical plants; Ron and Luna headed for the castle to finish packing; and Harry and Hermione headed for the gates so they could Apparate to her house.

  All six looked back at different moments, watching as the others faded into the evening light. Hogwarts was behind them and they faced only the unknown future ahead. They all were hopeful it would bring happiness.

It reminds me of how much has changed since I was in highschool, the sadness for things lost, and the joy for things gained.

Maybe I'll just keep all the one-shots to this one post, because he's my favorite 'quiet moment between two characters', which is really just the entirety of The Colour of Autumn:

#+begin_quote
  'Is this really happening?' Ron asked, truly wondering if it was a dream. Hermione smiled warmly, and they kissed for the third time. They pulled away, and both of them laughed openly, hugging each other, just as the wind gave a gust, throwing leaves into the air around them. They parted, and walking hand in hand, started back up the path, and back to Hogsmede.

  Hermione had one more reason to love the Autumn.

There's lots of monologues that i've enjoyed, many of them third-wall breaking dissections of canon and fanon plots, characters motivations, things like that. BajaB's subtle rant against redo fics in Gently Go is probably one of the best:

#+begin_quote
  "To go back, even if it is a different reality, would make all of my decisions, and the decisions of everybody else, worthless. I would be saying they were not good enough, that all of the work and all of the sacrifices we made are nothing to me.\\
  "I've had my chance. I don't know if I made more wrong decisions that right ones. I don't know if I made many people's lives better or worse, or if I made any difference at all. Hell, I don't even know if I made a good husband, father, or grandfather.\\
  "What I do know, what I am absolutely sure of, is that I don't want to find out. I don't want to know how badly I messed up. I don't want to have every fault, every mistake made obvious to me.\\
  "If I do this, if I 'have another go' and do better, or maybe worse, it can only make me regret my mistakes and lost opportunities even more. What then? Maybe I'll get another chance after that, and I try again, to make up for those times I dropped the Quaffle. Then maybe again after that, or maybe I'll be too worn out and just give up.\\
  "I'll not be that man, Albus," said Harry, standing up, the weight of his age sliding off him. "I have many regrets, but I have lived with them, and now I will die with them too."

I'm out of one shots I think, but remembered the saddest death that I've read in a long time from Restoring Hope:

#+begin_quote
  "You did it," whispered Hermione.

  "With help," Harry whispered back. They traded simultaneous grins as they heard each others' words from earlier.

  "It's over, Hermione," Harry continued after a moment. With the battle over, his body had decided it no longer needed to stand; he sank slowly onto the side of the bed, Hermione's hand still in his. "It's finally over. Oh God, we did it. We did it, love. Together."

  Hermione smiled happily, but even that small act seemed to exhaust her. She didn't move or speak, but her eyes never left Harry's face.

  It seemed to take a very long time for Harry to get enough breath to speak again. "When we're feeling better," he told her, "we'll go home with Hope. Not to the Place, but a real home. We'll be a family, love." He took another minute to catch his breath... he had to work hard to do it. "And we'll be married, and have more kids after Hope. And..." His voice grew fainter as he finished, "And we'll be together for the rest of our lives."

  She moved her mouth, but no words came out. It didn't matter: her shining eyes said it all. Of course we will.

  He could no longer keep his head erect. He let it settle onto the bed, his face inches from hers. They didn't kiss, but each could feel the other's breath on their lips. Harry managed a tiny smile as Hermione caressed him with her eyes. I love you, Hermione, he mouthed silently back.

  I love you, Harry. They smiled at each other, at total peace, hands still clasped, happy to be together.

  Then slowly, together, they closed their eyes.

It's one thing to die in battle, it's a whole other thing to get sick and just fade away in the end.

Harry's Fuck You speech to the Wizengamot in Dementor's Stigma is pretty poignant, as is the imagery of Harry's Memorial Tree, but I think the one thing that sticks out to me is that Ron is given a noble death and takes a whole bunch of the fuckers with him:

#+begin_quote
  "No," I said in denial. "No, mate, I can't." Frustration, pure anger and tiredness at the fact that everything had still led to this, as if it was always going to, leaked into my tone. "I can't save shit. After everything, I'm not... Fuck! Fuck. I can't. Save you. I'm sorry, but I can't. I just..."

  "Then let somebody save you," Ron said with determination, fighting through his pain. The pub, aflame with hungry fire and the spent chaos, reflected in his eyes. "Let me save you."

I like the early bits of Dunuelos's Lone Traveler series, and the best arc is the Building a Better Burrow series. The idea of someone so lost as his Harry being able to still have a home and family that loves him appeals greatly to me. The entire section is full of positivity and interesting uses for magic, but his speech at the end is probably the best:

#+begin_quote
  "Thank you. I'd protest this but I know Molly and I want to avoid the stinging hexes she is so proficient with." Molly looked smug even as the crowd laughed. "I didn't grow up here. I grew up in an environment much more saturated with fear and ignorance. When I first traveled here, I came upon a family who was just starting out and took steps to help them and to make certain they were safe. The things I did and the plans I made were almost entirely predicated upon ensuring they would be happy and healthy. It is would be a much darker world if we, each of us, didn't do what we could to help our neighbors and our community. That this led to Riddle's defeat was almost superfluous. I say almost because I will not cheapen the memory of those lost by so casually dismissing it."

  He paused then because he knew that he would soon be moving on.

  "I am a Traveler and I have seen much. I do my part here and there to help out. If we all did that, then this community, indeed any community, could never again be threatened with extinction. The community would never allow it. Be good to each other. Learn your history well and do not repeat the mistakes of the past. Hold compassion for each other and charity toward your fellow man. If you can do that, your future will be bright indeed."
#+end_quote

But this fic has some importance to me personally because I actually wrote an "ending" to it that still makes me cry every time I read it. Kind of egotistical I know, but the three people I've shown it to loved it and one cried, so nyeh. I could never publish it though.

--------------

I can't find a single quote that really sticks out as important to the character or fic, but I do have to say I have a weird thing for homicidal robots and Frank from Madness at the Gate and HK-47 from The Havoc Side of the Force amuse me greatly.
