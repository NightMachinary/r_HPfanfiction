Oh god there's so many I actually want to just spend the rest of my night remembering them. There's the easy ones, the ones that tell you everything you need to know about the characters in question, such as this from A Black Comedy:

#+begin_quote
  Albus frowned in thought. "Was the cost to you simply too high to pay again?"

  Harry considered the question before answering. "Yeah... I don't know. I'm not sure to be honest. But fortunately for me, it's not possible to pay again so I don't have to think about it."

  "What was your cost?"

  Harry was surprised Albus was asking so boldly. He let no emotion show as he watched the old man.

  Albus nodded in understanding and voluntarily admitted, "I sacrificed the ability to father children and then I lost the ability to fall in love."

  Harry hadn't known the specifics but guessed it had been something close to that for Albus. He knew how high that cost would be to a wizard like Albus. With a lick of his lips, Harry softly admitted, "I sacrificed my mother's everlasting soul."

  Albus blinked in shock. "And what did you lose?"

  Harry slowly shook his head. "My sacrifice was deemed sufficient."

  Albus couldn't even imagine what Harry felt. The word came out as a whisper. "How?"

and again when he reveals this to Tom

#+begin_quote
  Harry was watching Tom closely as he stated, "That was your sacrifice, wasn't it?"

  Tom showed no surprise as he turned to Harry.

  "I know you've researched the balance. Mortality was your sacrifice?"

  Tom's face betrayed no emotion. "What was yours?"

  Harry considered it a moment and shook his head. "Not today. Maybe some other time I'll tell you."

  Tom inclined his head in understanding, before his eyes lit up. "Was coming here to this world, leaving your own behind, your cost?"

  Harry smiled darkly, shaking his head.

  "Or do you not know yet?" Tom questioned. "My understanding is that some costs aren't realized for years."

  *Harry wore a pained smile. "My victory was hollow."*

  Tom's eyes widened. "Your sacrifice was deemed sufficient?"

  Harry nodded.

  Tom couldn't keep the look of sympathy off his face. He watched Harry for a few seconds.

The two most powerful wizards in the world are absolutely flabbergasted that Harry either had to, or else just did go that far. The bolded line probably sums it up best.

--------------

There's also moments of pure joy where you can feel how happy and thankful the characters are, and again I'll turn to Nonjon, this time from Browncoat, Green Eyes

#+begin_quote
  "Fawkes?" Harry asked looking at the bird in disbelief.

  Fawkes on the other hand could barely contain his enthusiasm. He was whipping his wings like an overexcited first year, just hovering in place brimming with joy. Fawkes squawked loudly at Harry's inquiring repeat of his name and with a burst of fire disappeared from in front of Harry, only to reappear inside Harry's oversized spacesuit.

  Harry began to yelp as he fell back, while the phoenix just wriggled itself against him in happiness. Harry was laughing his head off at how Fawkes tickling him, and seemed quite content to just press his body against Harry's in what could only be an attempt at a human hug. "What are you doing, you goofball?"

  Fawkes squawked something back that probably even phoenixes wouldn't have understood before snapping his beak on Harry's nose and mischievously biting down hard. Another burst of fire and Fawkes reappeared up in the sky.

  {Skip some for space}

  Fawkes just leaned into Harry pushing his head against Harry's helmet.

  Harry recognized what Fawkes wanted. "Okay, you crazy bird. Get in here."

  Fawkes let out a victorious cry and popped into a burst of fire, reappearing back inside the cramped spacesuit with Harry. Harry worked his left hand up to where Fawkes head was resting on Harry's chest. He began scratching the ancient bird in all his favorite places.

  Fawkes was relishing in the attention while Harry looked up at all the patient faces. "Fawkes here was the pet of my Headmaster and occasional mentor of sorts, Albus Dumbledore. First time I saw Fawkes, he looked awful, and he burst into flames right in front of me. I was twelve and scared the Headmaster was going blame me for killing his pet bird."

  Fawkes let out a happy coo, urging Harry to scratch behind his ears.

And another scene from the end of Act 3:

#+begin_quote
  "No," Harry replied, looking at the flashes of magic all over the surface. "I don't think I've ever seen this spell before, but I know I know it."

  The others were knocking on the thick bronze, ignoring the small barrier they weren't supposed to cross. They'd begun to attract a small crowd, wondering why people were climbing on the statue when Harry gasped and took a step back. "Oh heavens," Harry felt the blood rushing from his face as he finally recognized the magic. "This spell! This is my spell! That's why I'd never seen it before. This is my spell!"

  "Your spell?" Inara asked curiously. "You own one?"

  "No," Harry said shaking his head, as his face split into a wide grin. "This is the spell I created, the one that put me to sleep."

  "Hang on," Jayne said. "Are you saying..."

  "Yes, right here," Harry assured them all overflowing with excitement. "There are wizards, dozens of them."
#+end_quote

You can't help but feel for Harry as his quest finally comes to an end.

There are so many scenes where you can feel your heart being ripped out of your chest but the utter loss I felt as a former rabid Harmonian still makes this one of the most horrible ends to an HHR relationship I've ever read:

#+begin_quote
  Somehow, Harry wasn't surprised when Hermione knocked on the door of his wand lab and stepped inside, moving slowly and deliberately as she had to do now. Harry put down the various blanks he was working with---which included the new one he was making for himself---to focus on her alone.

  He saw it all in her face. In the way she stood, and the anguish and self-doubt in her eyes. "Luna told you," he said.

  Hermione nodded and hugged herself. "My parents said I could come home, to Australia." She spoke in barely whisper, as if the words burned her throat. "They've made a good life for themselves there, and I would be there to help my sister."

  "Do you want to go?"

  "No," she said. She wiped her eyes. "Do you remember, that horrid Christmas when Luna passed judgment on me? I love you, Harry. But...I can never forgive her for doing that. I know why she did---I know the custom. It was barbaric, just like the entire idea of polygamy. I love you, and I don't want you to think I'm doing this because of anything you've done, but I just..."

  "You want to live," Harry whispered. He wiped his own eyes. "Did you know, at the Orientation, you were the first child I ever touched who didn't jerk back? I think in a way you were my first real friend." He sniffed loudly. "I love you, Hermione. I love you so much, I'll let you go if that's what you need."

  She hugged him, and her kiss tasted salty with their mutual tears. "Then let me go, Harry. I love you, but I can't stay with you. Not if I ever want to live my own life."

  "I know."

  They made love that night, Harry and Hermione, and the next morning Luna quietly, and without any fanfare, severed the bond that joined Hermione and Harry through her. It was astonishingly easy for her to do so, and Harry secretly wondered if it was something Luna always knew about, seeing how she always seemed more informed regarding Aether magic than he was. She said she got it from Ravenclaw, but he wondered.

  That afternoon, with an Order of Merlin First Class and traveller's cheques Harry insisted on giving her to ensure she never wanted for anything, *Hermione climbed into a cab and drove away in a cool April morning toward Heathrow. It was the last he ever saw or even heard of her.*
#+end_quote

It was the only way it ever could end and still be true to Hermione's character but the complete lack of happiness at the end of that....

There are many fics that bring the magical world to life and give it such detail, but none have ever been the same mix of simple and powerful that this scene had in Holly Polter:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was more intrigued by a third depository table around the side of the house that was accumulating various small objects, with a written tag tied to each. At first, given the seemingly mundane and innocuous nature of the objects, he thought they might be used portkeys like he'd seen at the World Cup. Instead he was surprised to find gold and silver watches, brass devices, carved wooden boxes and the occasional distended envelope with something more than a letter inside.

  He picked one up and read its tag:

  'My tiepin. It was enchanted to ring like a bell at dawn, hoot for lunch, whistle for tea, & clap for the end of the work-day. Never realised Arthur was the one who made it so. Loved it before, would appreciate it again. ~ R. Perkins'

  Molly surprised him when she spoke. "You can see it either way, really. Are they being selfish to ask for something to be re-enchanted, or is it just a reminder and thanks of the good that he'd done for them? There is no guarantee of return so if the bauble is worth something, it's a kind way to give us - the bereaved - a little extra help without making it seem like charity. Most of the watches will be those."
#+end_quote

Its the details like that that really make the magical world come to life.
