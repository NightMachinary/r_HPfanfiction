Not sure if that's the first time but:

Harry's evening detention with Umbridge was made complete by it catching Voldemort's attention.

/I wasn't aware you were a masochist, Harry/, Voldemort said after watching for about ten minutes, as they both watched blood drip from the cut on the back of Harry's hand.

/I'm not./

/She just wants you to beg for mercy./

/I won't./

/Everyone can be broken, dear child./
