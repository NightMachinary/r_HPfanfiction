It didn't quite format right but here it is (from Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions):

Harry did as he was told, ignoring his audience, and shortly was pouring a stream of white soapsuds back out of its glass flask. It blinked open green eyes and blew bubbles at him with a birdlike chirp. “You are making me very angry, Potter,” Professor Snape said, staring at it blankly. “Well, I don't know either,” Harry said. “I just followed the instructions, I always tap my cauldron like that, it's not as if I was doing it on purpose.” You angled the strokes of your wand from the left, the center, and then the right, Voldemort observed. Creating the rune for life, algiz. Myrtle is also a strong symbol of life and fire, especially Myrica rubra, waxberry, which is what you used. ... “You just realized something,” Professor Snape said. “Spit it out.” “More like it... came to me,” Harry said. He had no idea what his expression was like. “I don't care if dancing elephants delivered it in a dream, Potter,” Snape hissed. “Algiz,” Harry blurted. “And waxberry. If that makes any sense. Please say that doesn't make any sense.” Professor Snape looked very blank. I am not wrong, Voldemort informed Harry. Potions may not be my strongest area, but I am capable of following a simple correspondence to its natural conclusion. Voldemort, Harry realized with a strange floating sensation, was a nerd. The potion with green eyes chirped at them both, drawing their attention to where it was trying to slide under the door of the potions ingredients cupboard. The floor, Harry noticed, was very shiny. “How do you corral the thing,” Snape said flatly. “Here, um, Bubbles! Come, Bubbles. You can stay in your nice quiet bottle for a little while and then I'll take you to the entrance hall for nice outdoor dirt.” Harry put the bottle down sideways on the floor, and the pile of soapsuds poured itself back into the tiny bottle in a way that did not seem physically probable. I can think of absolutely no martial applications for this, Voldemort mused. Do ask Severus if he can. He's quite creative. “I'm not asking Professor Snape questions for you,” Harry said shortly aloud. “This isn't your detention, is it. Don't you have people to murder?”
