  I won't go into the specifics. We made it past a mess of obstacles set up to allow us firsties to make it through, although Ron got pummeled by the Chess pieces- a small amount of poetic justice given how he abuses the pieces in his chess set. Hermione was stuck at the last task for only one of us could go forward. She suggested that I should go despite her voluminous spell knowledge. Her argument was simple, and I couldn't deny it.

  "I am just books and cleverness; there are more important things, like friendship and bravery and..."
