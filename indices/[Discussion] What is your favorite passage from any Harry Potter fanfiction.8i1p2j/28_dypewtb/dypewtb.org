linkffn(11180088) Coming Home, Chapter 13, has me laughing so hard I'm in tears every time.

"Accio - Re-Remus' . . . trouser!" she called out in panic, unsure exactly what would occur by using the first spell she had thought of.

"What the hell?" said James and Sirius together eyes bulging at her frantic behaviour, not to mention the fact that she had just summoned Remus' trousers.

Within moments there were squeals heard from students across the hall as Remus shot across the tables as though he were being dragged, clutching on to his trousers with all his might, as it looked as if they were trying to free themselves from his body.

"MERLIN'S FUCKING BALLS!" he shouted as his body whisked over the tables knocking plates of food and drinks covering him and other classmates in the process, before reaching the Gryffindor table and colliding into Hermione, both of them flying off the bench and onto the floor with a thump.

"Urgh," she groaned, more from the impact of the collision rather than the comfortable weight of Remus' firm body lying on top of her.

"What the fuck was that!" he cursed, looking down on the witch laying under him, Hermione's breath catching in her throat as his blue eyes bore into hers, shifting to amber when she let out a moan of pain that sounded a little more lustful then she had intended.

Their faces mere inches apart as Hermione felt his hand drift towards her face, pushing her wild curls out of the way from where they had escaped the confines of her bun, the quill having been dislodged on impact. Hands clutching at his chest, clinging on to his jumper from where she had tried to protect herself.

She drew in her bottom lip worrying it, noticing when the wizard above her gaze drifted to watch, licking his lips in the process. Her heart began to quicken as he began to narrow the space between them, when suddenly a ball of fabric collided with the side of his head, only to be followed with a number more fabric parcels to pelt them both, making them to break apart to defend themselves.

"Will someone please - tell - me...what in the love of - Merlin is - going - on" Remus managed to say in between being hit "Are these...these....these are my trousers! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO! PADFOOT, PRONGS!?"

"Wait a minute, it wasn't me!" cried James holding his hands up in surrender.

"Hey don't look at me!" Sirius said taking the same stance.

"Who was it then?" Hermione shifted on the spot, dusting herself off and trying her hardest not to make eye contact with anyone.

"So Remus, how was your lunch?" Hermione tried, she really did, but the moment Lily asked that, she couldn't help but burst into laughter at the ridiculousness of the whole ordeal. The moment she started to laugh so did Lily, which seemed to only confuse and irritate Remus more.

"How, was my lunch....How was my lunch....Seriously!?" said Remus now standing with his hands on his hips, reminding Hermione so much of Mrs Weasley that it only fuelled her laughter more.

"Someone here, might have accio'd your trousers," Remus closed his eyes and ran his fingers through his hair trying to calm himself down, depositing chocolate sauce into it in the process.

"Who Prongs. Who did?"

"Granger," answered Pettigrew a little too quickly.

"Rat" she spat.

There was an awkward silence for a moment, whilst Remus gathered his trouser and took a moment to calm down a fraction, Hermione noticing he had ignored the Rat comment. However he did have bigger things to worry about, as he stood there covered in food and drink arms full with the offending items that not two moments ago attacked him in the Great Hall.

"Hermione" he began after a moment "Please explain...I...I really don't understand at all," he asked, dumping his trousers on to the bench.

"Lily told me to rescue you," she blurted.

"Hey, yes I said we should go and rescue him, but I didn't say we should summon him," Lily managed to say finally recovering from her fits of laughter.

"Why did you summon me?" Remus asked turning now to look at a red faced Hermione pinching the bridge of his nose.

"Your trousers," interrupted James.

"Excuse me?"

"It was your trousers, she summoned," added Sirius "Hence the pile of slacks, you've just dumped down,"
