In linkffn(8484470) - Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy - there are too many such passages to count. I'll just give you the first one I ran across in Ch. 1 because it's too hard to pick out a good bit from the rest without spoilering the living bejasus out of it:

  "Well, there you are then. If /nobody's/ ever heard of him, I'll bet you a Jammie Dodger that whoever is /really/ running things, behind the scenes, is a Hufflepuff. The Gryffindors are too busy rushing in where angels fear to tread, the Ravenclaws can't pry their noses out of their books and the Slytherins are too busy politicking. So the prefects told me. Well, I say they told me, the Hufflepuffs didn't say much, they just sighed a bit. Do you know, I heard they actually machinate during dinner, Slytherins?"
