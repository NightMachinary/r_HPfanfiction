Well, I'm not sure about /the/ favourite, but I do very much like this passage from a particular story:

#+begin_quote
  "In a way, Tom, but only in a way, there is no good or evil, only power, and those too weak to withstand it. You can get drunk on power like a man can get drunk on firewhiskey, to the point where the whiskey controls him, drains him and eventually ruins him. That is what happens when we give in to the pull of the darkness. But harness your own desires, and it becomes a tool that you control instead of it controlling you, and you can do great things -- great, and magnificent."
#+end_quote

Getting enough of the thing outside of the quote to give context would require putting a whole page here, so I'll leave it at the quote as it is the central part. The story is “Last Chance” by Laume, a story in which Albus tries to do right by Tom Riddle, and this particular quote is from Ollivander. I feel it a great quote because of how it calls back to what Ollivander said to Harry in the first book.
