I'm always a sucker for worldbuilding and mystique.

  Malfoy considered that and turned back to Harry. "I presume, Potter, that you experienced accidental magic as a child, as most of us did." The boy nodded. "That is Wild Magic in its most simplistic form. You cast no spell. You held no wand. And yet, you wished for something and it came to pass, quite likely in a seemingly impossible manner. Magic in its raw form, freed of the restrictions placed upon it by the techniques taught here at Hogwarts and at other magical schools, can be summed up in eight simple words: 'As I will it, so mote it be.' Our kind have spent millennia striving to limit magic's potential, to ensure that magic is irrevocably linked to wands and incantations, defined as charms and transfigurations and potions, and restrained by the principles of arithmancy and runic matrices. The minute you picked up a compatible wand at Olivander's, those sparks that shot out represented your promise as a wizard that you would work magic according to the principles taught you here at Hogwarts. After that, I dare say you never experienced accidental magic again except perhaps under the most extreme provocations. Even if you should one day master wandless magic in some form, it will still be based on your sense memory of casting the same spells with a wand in your hand."

  "But ... why?" Harry asked in confusion. "Why go to all that trouble to ... bind Magic?"

  "It's like you said after we saw the Imago Dei, Harry. If every wizard or witch could work magic just by wishing really hard, it would tear the world apart."
