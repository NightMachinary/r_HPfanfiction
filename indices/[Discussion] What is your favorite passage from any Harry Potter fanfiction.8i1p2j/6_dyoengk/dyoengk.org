I've never been particularly skilled at remembering exact passages from fanfiction (published works are the opposite, strangely enough). However, the following from the most recent Shadow of Angmar update hit me in an emotional location.

  In his hand was a brand new wand. It was no beautiful thing like Ollivander's creations; in truth it still looked to be an unassuming stick, blown from a mountain Pine by the winter winds. Uncomely though it was to the eye, it was without doubt the most wonderful wand Harry had ever held. He could feel the power that hid within it, it was like a drumbeat upon his fingers, and reverberated through his body and through his mind.

  He did not know if it was simply due to his greater affinity with magic, but it felt like so much more than his Holly wand. Where his Holly wand had felt like a living thing, this wand almost felt like it had a will of its own. It cried out to be used, tl be unleased.

  Harry heeded its siren call. In that moment there was only one spell he could think to cast. His voice rang out across the valley, powerful and filled with joy.
