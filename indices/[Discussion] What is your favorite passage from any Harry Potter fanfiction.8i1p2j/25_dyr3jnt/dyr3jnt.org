  The Headmaster was regarding him with increasing graveness. "Harry, do you understand /at all/ why I find these events concerning?"

  "Honestly?" said Harry. "No, not really. I mean, of course Professor McGonagall would object to anything that breaks up the dull monotony of the Hogwarts school experience. But then Professor McGonagall wouldn't set a chicken on fire."

We just decided to have the Light side win. I know there are times where the boundaries of morality are uncertain, but in this case the line separating the villains and the heroines was twenty meters tall and drawn in white fire. Our intervention may have been /weird/, but it certainly wasn't /wrong/ -"
