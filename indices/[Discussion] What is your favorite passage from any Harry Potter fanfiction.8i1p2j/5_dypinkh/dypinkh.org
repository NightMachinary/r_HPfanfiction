"You're not coming back to Hogwarts, are you?" he said.

She shook her head. "The healers say ... " She swallowed. "My magic is gone."

Teddy felt the lump in his throat return.

"I know it must seem horrible to you," she said. "But ... it's not really so bad." Teddy frowned, unable to hide his disbelief. She was smiling at him, trying to look brave, though her eyes lacked the conviction of her words. "I'm Muggle-born, after all. I'm just going back to the Muggle world. And I did miss my friends from school, in London. It was very exciting, to find out I was a witch, and visit this ... wizarding world, where magic is real, and there are goblins and elves and ghosts, but my parents were never really very happy about it, you know. They won't say so, but I think they're glad that I won't be going back there."

Teddy just stared at her, not sure what to say.

"In the Muggle world," she said softly, "we have so many books and movies about children who stumble through hidden doorways or find magic chests in an attic or faeries in a forest, or something like that, and they get to go on these wonderful magical adventures. But they always return home, in the end. And that's what I'm doing, Teddy. Going to Hogwarts was like a wonderful adventure. And now I'm going back home, where I belong."
