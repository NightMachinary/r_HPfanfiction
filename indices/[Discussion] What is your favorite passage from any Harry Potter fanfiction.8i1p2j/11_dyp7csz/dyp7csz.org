I rather like the passage from The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts), in Chapter 13:

"His powers over the elements were good, he had modeled them after the Indian-God-Kings themselves, but he knew his abilities still paled in comparison to their power.

He could charge and release some electricity, while Indra could become a human bolt of lightning and lay waste to mountains. He could pull at the air, but not so quickly that it formed a vacuum, generating light and heat even as it pulled the entire population of cities inside out. That ability belonged to Vayu, Queen of the-Open-Spaces-of-the-World.

No, his elemental powers weren't so awesome and he knew that he would never match those legends, but his abilities could be impressive, even if they would always fall short of mythical.

However little it was, it was still enough to win."

Creates such a sense of wonder and awe toward magic.
