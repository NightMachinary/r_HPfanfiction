Alright then, I've got a few others.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

Both of these have fem!harry. In moratorium, Harry binds the horcrux in the diary to herself and he floats around Harry,invisible to everyone else.
