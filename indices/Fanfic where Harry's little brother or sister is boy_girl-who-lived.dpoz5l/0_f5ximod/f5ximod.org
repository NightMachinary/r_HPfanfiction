I am going through linkao3(A Different Perspective by ynmidk) and it doesn't seem to be completely horrible. Harry-gets-thrown-back-in-time-to-his-former-self time travel fic, except here Harry becomes a twin-sister Rose to the BWL Harry. A bit of gender-bender (not too much), and it seems to be developing into some kind of story. Still a bit early for much more assessment.
