#+begin_quote
  When Harry saw his godfather get stunned by Bellatrix and about to fall through the Veil, he tries to save him- only to fall through the Veil himself. Death has to send him back, however, as it is not his time to die yet. If reality has to be rewritten a bit in the process, it's no big deal to Death.
