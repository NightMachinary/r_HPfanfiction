I actually tend to agree with you on number 2. I think the Sirius/Regulus relationship would be at least very strained, if not outwardly antagonistic. Sirius despised his family's beliefs and it's hard to see him still being close to a brother who embraced it fully by becoming a death eater.

You're interpretation on #3 is just as plausible as any other. 20 year olds, especially those 20 year olds, are definitely likely to get caught up in the cleverness of their plan. I'm not really a Manipulative!Dumbledore fan either, so I may have to start thinking along your lines!
