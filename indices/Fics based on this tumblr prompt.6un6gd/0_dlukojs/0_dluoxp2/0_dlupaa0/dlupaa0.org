Ah, I see. I rarely touch Marauders-era fanfics, so I was unfamiliar with these 'givens'. My headcanon on 2) was actually completely different --- I always assumed Regulus and Sirius hated each other, increasingly so as the years went by and their morals/politics drifted further and further apart. As for 3), I see, but I don't really like Manipulative!Dumbledore so it didn't cross my mind --- my explanation for them not telling him would be more that it was automatic Marauder thinking at play: "Dumbledore's our friend but he's still a teacher, we just /don't/ tell him about our oh-so-clever secret plan".
