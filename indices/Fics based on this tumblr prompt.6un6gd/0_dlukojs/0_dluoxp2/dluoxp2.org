1) I believe Regulus was two years younger than Sirius and the marauders. We know Regulus was 16 when he joined the death eaters, and he died a few years later. Given that James & Lily were 20-21 when they died, and that Regulus died before them, it absolutely makes sense that he'd only be a year or two older than Harry.

2) Regulus assumes James knows what a horcrux is because the scene is taking place where a horcrux was kept. There's really no other reason for someone to be there unless they're hunting the horcrux. As for a first name basis, there's a lot more guesswork there. We have no information on their relationship, though we can reasonably assume they know each other's first names. In the stress of the situation(horxrux hunting, being revived from a like of inferi, etc), it's easy enough to pass it off as a Regulus just acting on instinct, without any judgment of their relationship. However, lots of people do assume that Sirius & Regulus' relationship was a lot better than Sirius' with the rest of the family. This leads some fanfictions to conclude that Regulus would've been a friendly-ish acquaintance of the marauders(which might be where the author of this post is coming from).

3) This is also the creation of fanfiction to a degree. Basically, the fandom has to come up with an idea to explain why James & Lily didn't tell Dumbledore about the secret keeper bluff with Peter/Sirius. Even if they didn't want to use Dumbledore as the secret keeper, it still makes sense to tell him as a precaution against the events of cannon unfolding. One of the most common explanations is that James & Lily discover that Dumbledore lies/misleads/manipulates something regarding the prophecy, which drives a wedge in the relationship. "Hate" probably stretches it too far for comfort, as we know they still follow Dumbledore's lead and work with him on the fight against Voldemort, but it's not too hard to get to a sense of distrust, etc.

I agree with your assessment though, this has potential as an extremely interesting story. I would love to read it in the hands of a good author.
