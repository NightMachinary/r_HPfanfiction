I am... very confused. This premise /is/ interesting, but, uhm...

- Wasn't Regulus quite a bit older than what you'd call a "boy" when he died?
- Why would Regulus assume James knew what a Horcrux was, or even be on a first-name basis with him? As far as I can tell, canon Regulus never turned full turncoat like Snape, merely found out about the Locket Horcrux and ran off on his own to destroy it.
- Why would Regulus think James and Sirius hated Dumbledore? Last I checked, adult-James and Dumbledore were very good friends.
