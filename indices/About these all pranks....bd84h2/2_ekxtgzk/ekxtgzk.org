Good pranks are funny, and also very hard to write. I know, since I'm seven chapters in to a story about the young Weasley twins' pranks. Doing light frivolity well is hard work.

I think writers who merely allude to hilarious pranks without describing them are cheating, trying to get credit for wit without actually being witty.
