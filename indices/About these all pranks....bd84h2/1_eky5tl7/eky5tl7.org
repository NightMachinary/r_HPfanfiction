well a lot of the pranks that are written in fics aren't funny or even pranks imo.

Giving Cho a truth serum mixed with a bragging potion so she spills how she molested Harry is for example not a prank.

Also targeting one particular person over and over (Draco Malfoy) is actually bullying, even if he is a racist or bully in your story. Especially if it is things like destroying their home work, changing their clothes, getting rid of their clothes, giving them a rash from itching powder...

Harmless things that disrupt the monotony of school life however can be fun. I can't remember the title put in one fic Fred and George made the stairs play different tunes when you step on them. Now that is in the beginning chaos but can lead to some fun scenes like playing the Hogwarts Song on them.

As someone who has worked in a secondary school as a teacher I am quite happy that besides pranks done by graduating classes, these pranks are seen by students as juvenile. They prefer making funny / snarky comments to make others laugh. +Well and the occasional cock and balls on the blackboard.+
