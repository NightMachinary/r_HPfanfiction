  In an effort to escape her captors, Hermione Granger attempts to go back in time two hours. However, she ends up in 1977, confused and alone. How will she navigate the past when she knows the future? Can she sit idly by and watch those she begins to consider friends succumb to their horrible fates? Timelines are tricky things.
