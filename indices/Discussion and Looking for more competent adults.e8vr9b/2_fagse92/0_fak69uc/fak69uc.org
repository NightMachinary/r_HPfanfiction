McGonagall gets a lot of shit for not hearing Harry and co out at the end of first year. The problem was that she was completely correct, but did not give any sort of explanation as to why the stone was perfectly safe whether or not Dumbledore was in the castle. From Harry's point of view she just dismisses their concerns out of hand.
