McGonagall: Admittedly dropped the ball in letting the kids run rampant. But she and the other adults were right that the stone was protected and Voldemort would not have been able to bypass Dumbledore's mirror.

Marauders: Happened in the 70's where anti-bullying was barely a thing.

Umbridge: Had the government backing her. They couldn't stop her any more than a school could stop the FBI.

Fudge: Is acting exactly as our politicians are about climate change. I get being annoyed by Mcgonagall and the Marauders but Fudge is /supposed/ to be incompetent. That's his character. He's an allegory about how willful ignorance and corruption endangers everyone.

Incompetent adults are a fact of life and stories are a reflection of life.
