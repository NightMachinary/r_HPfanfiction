From the summary. This lets the reader know that the author couldn't possibly be a virgin tryhard. /s

The best bits are in the form of a metre-less, POV-switching stream-of-consciousness 'poem' the author inserted before the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Harry has lost so many he truly loved, but in their stead he pledge justice.

  [...]

  Could you kill the people you love most on this earth?

  [...]

  But in the end, will you be a heroic Light Wizard?

  Or another bloodthirsty Dark Lord?

#+begin_quote
  Thalarian T.M. Productions Presents:

  Harry Potter and the Queens of Darkness, Ladies of Light

  *Epic Prologue: Ass to the Wall*
