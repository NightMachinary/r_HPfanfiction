You are being trolled. The OP has been doing this all week.

As for the list and fic in question: I can't speak for DLP (as I'm not a mod or seasoned member) but threads such as those are as good as fossils.

So yeah - there's your impression of the fic's reception at the time, but in the nine years since the last post in that thread, bookshelves worth of similar titles were stamped with 1-2 stars on sight. It's also worth noting that said thread is native to the infamous anti-slash period of DLP's timeline. I sincerely doubt that it is indicative of the forum's current collective tastes.
