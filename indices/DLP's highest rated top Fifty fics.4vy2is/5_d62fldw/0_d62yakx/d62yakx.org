Agreed, OP needs to step away from the keyboard for a bit.

That being said, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3092103/1/Queens-Of-Darkness-Ladies-Of-Light][Queens of Darkness, Ladies of Light]] was just too stereotypically Dark!wank /not/ to click on.

It's hilariously bad. I think I've found a new fic to recommend in the ever-present 'worst fic you've ever read' threads. At least some good can come of OP's grudge against you guys.
