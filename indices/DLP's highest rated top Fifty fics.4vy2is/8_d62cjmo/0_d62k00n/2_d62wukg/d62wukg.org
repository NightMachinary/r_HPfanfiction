The author of this thread has a history of writing inane stuff, be it anti-DLP posts (I don't particularly like their atmosphere, but this is getting tiresome) or threads about whether or not this-or-that story or author is the best thing ever since sliced bread (again, tiresome).

Once you see enough stuff by this person, you'll start asking “dude, why aren't you banned already?” every time you see something new, because it's just annoying useless ... nothing.
