I see the author of this thread and can't help but think that this is supposed to be some kind of finger pointing/snorting-under-my-nose dig at DLP: "look guys, some of the fics on this is are outdated, lol".

Yeah, some are. As someone else said on DLP, standards change over time, ratings don't. Some of those fics that were very highly rated years ago would be rated differently today. On the other hand, there are many on that list that have held up well and some that are more recent additions and are good indicators of the quality DLP looks for in fics today.
