Wow those characters.. read incredible not like anyone from Harry Potter.

I mean Man, Harry totally puts Man into every other sentence Man. We were one sentence away from "Bro stop that". And Ginny's 'That's my Girl' over and over again.

Not to mention Hermione has absolutely no agency in that first chapter.
