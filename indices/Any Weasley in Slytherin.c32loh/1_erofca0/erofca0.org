[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/][The Changeling]] is one of my absolute favorites.

i've been trying to type out something coherent on my thoughts on the fic's characterization of Ginny, its lack of kid politicians, its portrayal of boarding school culture... having trouble articulating myself rn, but it's a very good read and one i often revisit.

there are hints of the "secret Slytherin society" trope, but it's done quite well and not cringeworthy at all.

i also like that there's no real romance until later; the endgame is Harry/Ginny, but the buildup to it is realistic.
