You know, that is a good point. I suppose some things are rather unavoidable, but others could have been significantly altered or avoided altogether. However, it is not my story. I cannot decide how it is written, only whether to read it or not. Honestly, I read it for the characterization, because the author does a pretty good job of developing the characters and I hope to learn from their example.
