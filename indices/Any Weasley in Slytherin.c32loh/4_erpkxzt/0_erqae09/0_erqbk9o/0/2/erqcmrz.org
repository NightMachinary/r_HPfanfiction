I feel like the author might be trying to make a point of how often Harry and Ginny keep getting fucked over, and no matter what they do, they can't seem to escape from fate's clutches. It gives the reader (or at least, me,) that feeling of dramatic irony, because you can tell where the scene is going, the character(s) are completely oblivious, and you're helpless to stop them. Kinda like a horror movie.
