Nice to see you are supportive of people's right to read or not read whatever they like. No one said that slash = porn; the OP said they don't enjoy reading slash, and the only comment mentioning porn was an answer to a comment about disliking all sex. No one is saying those things can't or shouldn't exist, they're just saying that 'they' don't like them.
