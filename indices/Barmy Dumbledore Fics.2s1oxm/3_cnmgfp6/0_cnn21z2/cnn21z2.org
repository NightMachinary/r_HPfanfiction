Seriously. Imagine you're a seventh year during Harry's first year. The headmaster gets up and says "Nitwit, blubber, oddment, tweak." I'd be seriously considering making my way in the muggle world (provided I knew how) if this is the smartest wizard alive. It's a children's book, though, so it's hard to get hung up on specifics.
