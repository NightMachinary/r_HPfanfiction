Soup-pocolypse and the Great Curry Cataclysm. Post-war, very funny, well-written Veela Draco. Not your typical Veela fic though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310/chapters/37431866]]

A few wonderful 8th year fics: Azoth: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285]] Things Worth Knowing: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12922518]]

And I share the Man Who Lived whenever I can. My all-time favorite fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621]]
