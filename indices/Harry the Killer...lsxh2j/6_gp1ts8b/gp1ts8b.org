Kind of ironic, since in /canon/ harry was so firmly against taking other human life that he refused to even use Stupefy on a Death Eater actively trying to kill him in situations where falling unconscious /could/ lead to the Death Eater dying.

Actually killing other human beings is pretty hard for most people, and studies show that even actual soldiers in war hesitate or miss because of conscious or subconscious desire to avoid killing al the goddamn time.

OTOH I think there's a lot of people who have very low threshold for frustration with mental blocks on characters. You can get around it if it seldom comes up- for instance, people don't complain as much with canon Harry because in most situations Stupefy is nearly as effective as AK would be, but you seem like you want to make it narratively a big deal.

I guess I think there it'd be best to make sure everyone treats it as a big deal. If Harry's alone in his hesitance he sticks out and seems more unreasonable, so make it a point that almost all the good guys and even many of the bad guy are reluctant to actually kill.
