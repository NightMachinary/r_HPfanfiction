Length doesn't bother me so much as how well it is done. If it takes a long time but is done well, then awesome. If it takes a long time and was done poorly, then garbage. If it was short and done well, great, if it was short and done badly, then garbage. Then you have the whole range in-between length and done well/bad.

This question has no simple answer because the answer is going to literally differ from person to person.

Imo, readers don't want to see your characters be who they are supposed to be so late in the story that you don't see them being that person much because the story is about to end.

Likewise, if you have your character like that from the begining, it will look like your character has not grown at all over the fiction.
