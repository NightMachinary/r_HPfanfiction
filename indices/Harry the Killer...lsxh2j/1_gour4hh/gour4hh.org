I'd much rather read a story where Harry only kills to save someone else or if he has no choice. I understand the argument that he's been trained by Gryffindor, but I don't think that means he has to be a killer. Magic allows for someone to incapacitate an enemy without killing them, so I don't think it necessarily makes sense for Harry to just go around killing people. If you're writing Harry as a kind person (which I agree that he is) then I think you should definitely avoid having him devolve into a ruthless killer. That portrayal of Harry always turns me off because he no longer seems much better than the people he's fighting. That being said, it's your story, so write whatever feels right. Don't let the haters shape your story! If you like it, then that's reward enough!
