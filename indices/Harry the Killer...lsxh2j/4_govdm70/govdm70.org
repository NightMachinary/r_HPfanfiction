Problem you have here, he's being trained by a guy who lived in the 10th century or before, where the mindset of humans were far more primitive than it is right now or have been for the past 200 years.

Here his mentor is a warrior that wasnt born during the time where honor wasn't as valued, where pepole were far more racist than they are today aswell as had a diffrent world view.

He should have no hesitation in killing enemies that do the same to other pepole, simply due to a major influence in his life not living in the era where human rights have increased.
