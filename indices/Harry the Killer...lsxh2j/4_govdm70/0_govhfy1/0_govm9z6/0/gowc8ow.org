On the contrary, history suggests that people have never needed a justification to kill each other unless some outside system of morality - which is, in the broad sense, a religion - told them that they might need it. The default state has been that the strong simply take what they want from the weak, and kill them if they get in the way. Only by introducing the idea of external and unchanging standards of "right" and "wrong" are people motivated to even think that it might be an issue needing justification.
