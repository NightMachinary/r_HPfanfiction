I only read about half the story but Ginny and to a lesser extent Ron used a spell to make Harry and Hermione, respectively, fall in love with them. They learnt it from Molly, who it's heavily implied used it on Arthur.

It got pretty messed up and while I'm not sure whether it's true or not it's implied that Fleur has possibly also received the same treatment from Bill but I didn't read far enough to confirm.

I'm sure it's a decent fic if you like that kind of thing but it's definitely not my cup of tea.
