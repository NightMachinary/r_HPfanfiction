I'm listening to Mythos by Stephen Fry right now and got to the part where Daphne turns into a tree so Apollo will quit hitting on her and it made me think of the word "vegemagus" and I had the strong impulse to share it.

Also jeez I did not remember how very gay Greek mythology was. Cygnus was not Phaeton's good buddy, you guys.
