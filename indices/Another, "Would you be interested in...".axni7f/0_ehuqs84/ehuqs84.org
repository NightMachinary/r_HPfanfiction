  Hogwarts years stay semi canon. Harry befriends Ron and Hermione, defeats Quirrell, etc. Everything happens the same but different.

If nothing significant changed, skip to year 4.

  After the events of Book 4 Harry reconsiders Hogwarts and after Christmas in book 5 decides to leave.

That must have been a really dark year if she's willing to leave her friends. Also, where does she leave to? Durmstrang? Probably not an option since Sirius would veto it, given his background. Beauxbatons? Possible. But why would they be better than Hogwarts? They took part in the whole tournament stupidity as well, after all.

I guess my question is: What is the plot? "Harry gets shit upon for a year until she finally leaves" isn't much of a plot - nor an original one. Where do you see the story breaking new grounds?
