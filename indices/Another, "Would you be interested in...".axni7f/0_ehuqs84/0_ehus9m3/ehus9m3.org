  If nothing significant changed, skip to year 4.

Like completely or with some recap?

  What is the plot? "Harry gets shit upon for a year until she finally leaves" isn't much of a plot - nor an original one. Where do you see the story breaking new grounds?

Nah, Harry will be shit on but that's not the main plot haha. After the events of year 3 Harry studies for OWLs and passes them a year early. The plot has to do with the graveyard events in book 4 which spawn Harry finding out more about her Evans background ( the Potter side was well covered by Sirius and Remus). It's tied into the sci-fi genre and with the muggle family she befriended.
