If Harry passes her owls a year early, I guess Hermione, being smarter, does as well then. Would that strain their friendship with Ron? Or, how does that impact the plot? If it's just a "Oh, this Harry is more studious, so she's smart" thing, I'd suggest to drop it - it smells a little of "very special snowflake"-dom.

Also, what exactly is the main plot then? I feel a little confused if you ask if we're interested without actually laying out the planned plot. "It's tied into the SciFi genre" most certainly is something you should have mentioned in the OP.
