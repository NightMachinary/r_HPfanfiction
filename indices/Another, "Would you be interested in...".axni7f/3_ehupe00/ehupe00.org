First of all, write what you want.

Honestly I'd say just start in Year 4, when the story actually "starts," then refer to the background changes gradually/over time. You talk about "slight differences" a little too much for me to actually be interested in it as you've presented it right now. If you want adventure, how do you plan to keep it interesting in the buildup phase when you're incorporating so many fix-fic type elements? There are fics that can do this really well, but that's something that you really need to see in action.
