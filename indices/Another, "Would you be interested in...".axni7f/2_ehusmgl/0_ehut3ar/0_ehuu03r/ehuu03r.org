Especially Wormtail scampering off is very likely. Just imagine Sirius and Remus bringing fem!Harry to the Weasleys, he's gonna run immediately.

But the question remains, will he be trying to find Voldemort or not? Because in canon, he knew that from Trio's actions in Year 1. In this case, he doesn't really know and the Dark Mark is very much faded considering Voldemort is still a very weak shade at this point. So my take is that Wormtail will try to hide outside Britain for the time being, but not seek out Voldemort.

With Voldemort not returning, Sirius out-bribing Malfoy in the Ministry, and fem!Harry making friends with other magical kids, those few years before the school could be really fun times for her.

Another plot point can come from Sirius's feud with Barty Crouch. Sirius has to obviously go after Crouch, hard. Will that affect the status of Crouch Jr? If he ever gets free, all hell can break loose. This guy is a total fanatic and very competent. But I prefer not, because then the plot becomes very destabilized and very hard to write.
