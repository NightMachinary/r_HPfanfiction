  Visiting other magical kids is a good plot point, but I was thinking of going for the Manipulative!Dumbledore trope and not having her visit them too much. He'd insist that the blood protection should be taken into consideration.

If you have Manipulative!Dumbledore, he's obviously going to sabotage freeing Sirius in the first place. No, I think that's a very bad idea and totally overused trope. I would rather raise Voldemort's competence level and thus the overall challenge. As for how to improve Voldemort from his dumbed down/idiot ball canon version, think about how you would have done in his place, such as:

- Do you really want to risk impersonating one of Dumbledore's oldest friends for up to a year? How about letting Jr impersonating his dad, a high ranking Ministry official who has access to both the Goblet and the Minister? Furthermore, nobody else knows Barty better than his son, so they couldn't even ask security questions! An added bonus, not that Voldemort knows, is that this scheme even gets to fool the Marauder's Map.
- Suppose you let Jr go ahead to impersonate Moody, what would happen if his jig was up? Dumbledore would know your hiding spot immediately! Do you honestly believe you could resist a raid led by Dumbledore himself in your weak homunculus body? And if Dumbledore ever gets to capture you, do you honestly believe that your Horcrux secret would stay safe from him?

I especially hate rehashing the CoS plot, because that either assumes Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore or Idiot!UselessAdults!PlotDevice!Dumbledore. Both options are bad. Let's just consider this:

1) Dumbledore was very certain that Hagrid was framed.

2) Dumbledore had to know the ghost of the murder victim, Myrtle Elisabeth Warren, was haunting that particular bathroom.

3) Dumbledore could ask only a few basic questions to identify the true culprit and the entrance to CoS:

  "Please tell me Miss Warren, what actually happened before you died?"

  "I heard a boy hissing near that sink, and I went there looking. Then I saw a pairs of big yellow eyes, and I just died."
#+end_quote

This is not some highly sophisticated detective work, this is the most basic common sense. I even heard excuses that because she haunted a girl's bathroom, men could not go in to investigate. LOL, I mean what a fucking moron and negligent shit head do you have to be if you let such triviality impede a MURDER INVESTIGATION?

4) Now if Dumbledore asked and Myrtle absolutely refused to talk, multiple times even, then the canon plot had a little bit more excuse. But not by much, because the monster was called the SLYTHERIN'S MONSTER. What was Slytherin's symbol? A snake. What was Slytherin's specialty? Parselmouth. What was the King of Snake? The Basilisk! And what killed people without trace? The Basilisk!

See, the all wise and super intelligent Albus Dumbledore should at least be able to make this almost basic logic deduction, right?

5) Therefore, if the Dumbledore you are writing is not of the Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood type, you need to assume he knows it could be a Basilisk down there, and he would take immediate actions after the first attack, such as flooding the castle with roosters.

6) Finally, petrification in Basilisk attacks is the exception, not the norm. To get 5-6 petrifications is a chain of extremely lucky events and highly unlikely to repeat in an AU.
