My only advice: Stop rehash canon stations, even from Year 1.

There are enough fem!Harry fics that mindlessly rehash those, and I'm absolutely not interested.

Even before you begin Year 1, you have to make some major choices:

- Sirius free means people know Wormtail is guilty. I highly doubt Wormtail will hide as Scabbers at the Weasleys. He should have scampered off to find Voldemort. Could he have found Voldemort earlier? In the Books, Wormtail benefitted from the knowledge that Voldemort had been hiding in Albania before. In this AU, he has years to find the Dark Lord.
- How would the political landscape in magical Britain look like, considering Sirius is just as rich as Malfoy and knows all his own family's dirty tricks? Would Fudge even become the Minister?
- If Wormtail had found Voldemort earlier, even before fem!Harry started school, then what?
- On the other side, Sirius raising fem!Harry means they will get in touch with other Wizarding families. She should have known the Weasleys, the Tonkses, the Longbottoms, and the Boneses early on. In case of Weasleys, her best friend might very well be Ginny, not Ron. In case of Boneses, could Sirius have a relationship with Amelia, as many fics often alluded to? If Sirius hooks up with Amelia Bones, how would the balance of power in the Ministry and Wizengamot change?
- Will Sirius get 12 Grimmauld Place? Will the Curse Breakers he hires identify the Locket? What will happen to the Locket? What about Kreacher?

You see, the Wizarding could be a very different place before this fem!Harry even set her foot in Hogwarts.
