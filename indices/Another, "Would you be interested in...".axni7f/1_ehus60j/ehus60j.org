In my experience the Harry leaves Hogwarts stories are very hard to do well. When you are missing the backdrop of Hogwarts life most authors struggle bringing the story to live. The meat of the story seems to be how this changed Harry reacts to the events of fourth year, but it's a little hard to say based on that how interesting it will be.
