Well don't still call her Harry for a start, even if its short for Harriet.

There are way to many stories doing the first years canon compliant, not much point retelling the story again, unless you make significant changes to the 3rd floor corridor puzzles.

Being raised by 2 male wizards would make Harry drastically different to how she was in canon, play up the differences with how she reacts to the wizarding world and her self confidence of her rightful place in it.
