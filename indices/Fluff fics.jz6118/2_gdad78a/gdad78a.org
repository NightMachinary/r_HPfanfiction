If you want a lot of fluff fics on the next gen I recommend [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/NextGen]] there are tons of one shots on the Next Gen there. A lot of them are funny, I can link some of my favorites of those if you want, but I don't want to take the time to do that if you aren't into Next Gen stuff. They also have one shots of scenes missing from the series, and a few from Marauders as well.

One author who has lots of one shots that I like is HecateA on fanfiction.net
