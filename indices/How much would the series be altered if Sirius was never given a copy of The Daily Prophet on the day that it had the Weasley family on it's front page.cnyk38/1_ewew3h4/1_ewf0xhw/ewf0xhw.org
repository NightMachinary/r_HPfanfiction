I don't think that's a fair argument; the thing with /PoA/ is that no, it doesn't make any sense as a standalone story, but reading it as one is a mistake. For better or for worse. It's more of an illustration of the book, meant for people who already know the ins and outs of the plot but want to see the big set-pieces on the screen. If we're not told that Sirius read the newspaper, it's not that he didn't in this continuity, but simply that the movie assumed whoever cared enough to ask (HP fans) already knew.

Similarly, it's never quite explained who the Marauders were, but that doesn't mean that Prongs /wasn't/ James Potter, it's just that the movie assumed this went without saying.
