Crookshanks would /run him off/, yes, but that doesn't mean any humans would find out Peter's identity, so I think he'd just find himself another cozy place to hide. He went to seek out Voldemort when he thought it was his best shot at survival, but if his cover remains unblown, why take such an unncessary risk when Voldemort is /himself/ a potential threat to Pettigrew's life (just one he was willing to take when the alternative was Dumbledore getting him)?

I do agree that Voldemort would find some /other/ way to return eventually, but I don't think Pettigrew would really be a part of the picture.
