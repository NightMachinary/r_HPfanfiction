Ah, but even if Crouch Jr threw off the imperius and still believed the Dark Lord was alive, how would he find him?

Peter found him by using his Animagus form to talk to local rats, remember. At minimum, Crouch Jr would have had a much harder time and taken a lot longer to locate him. And without the convenient timing of Bertha Jorkins to extract info from, and the TWT to get ahold of Harry, he'd have a much harder time resurrecting the Dark Lord.

Eventually, inevitably, Voldemort would return, since he's an unkillable shade that can afford to sit in a tree and wait for a passerby to possess, as with Quirrel. But without Pettigrew seeking him out, kidnapping Bertha, and thus providing Volde with the info that Crouch Jr was alive, it would have taken several more years at minimum. Harry would have at least been able to finish his NEWTs before having to face him.
