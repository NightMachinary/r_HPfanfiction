I understand the annoyance that is felt by statements like these. It is extremely annoying when you or someone you know or something you like gets painted over by a very broad brush that ends up being nothing like the truth. I too have ranted about J.K. Rowling, Ron Weasley, Finn Mikaelson and others have been more or less shat upon by people.

However to give you some advice that I myself haven't been able to always implement, it's best to never give too much credit to vague statements. It's practically guaranteed that you can't tell what a person is actually thinking by some short statement they make. One thing I am very good at is always looking for as much detail as possible before making an argument. For instance, while I had some things you said in the original post that I could have ranted about but I read all the replies you made in the thread which provided me a clearer picture of what you were actually thinking.

Back to the original topic, I don't think calling something lazy and unoriginal is a valid criticism on its own but both those criticisms contain more detailed issues.

Calling something lazy usually means that the reviewer believes that not enough thought was put into making something enjoyable and believable.

Calling something unoriginal is pretty self-explanatory. Things can certainly be unoriginal, which makes the criticism valid, though whether the thing being called unoriginal is actually unoriginal or not is an entirely different matter.

As for calling certain tropes lazy, I definitely don't think this is right but what people usually mean when they say that is "[Most of the time, the execution of] the magical core trope is very lazy and unoriginal."

P. S. If by chance you disagree with my comment, try to think of what could make you call it lazy even though I certainly put effort into typing it out.
