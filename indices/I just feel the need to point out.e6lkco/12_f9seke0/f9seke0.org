When I first started writing I thought this too. However, I came to realise that people are entitled to their own opinion. Fanfiction is littered with stories so if you don't like the term unoriginal, try making your story better with more ideas/scenes that you have never read or heard of. Ask the reviewer why they think it's lazy or unoriginal and, if they answer with specifics, try to update and twist your ff with a new idea of your own. If they don't respond with a helpful idea they may not be worth your time. I have had stories with reviews that they love it and want more while others think its stupid and unreal. I know reviews like the ones you mentioned can be frustrating but try and either ignore them or work on making your ff even better. That's just my thoughts though and people might think differently.
