It's a touchy thing because, on the one hand, the reader is the audience. On the other hand, the criticism is directly sent to the writer in the form of reviews that are very easily accessible. You can watch any tv show or movie and think the director is shit and say it in the theater or in your living room, however, I can't imagine the director is sitting right next to you when you do it.

People should be able to say whatever the hell they want, in my opinion, but maybe they should think a second longer about their intentions before sending in bad reviews. Because honestly at the end of the day, the fics that I write are for me, I'm glad other people enjoy them and I like sharing them with others, but I write the stories because I like it because I enjoy reading it just as much as writing it.
