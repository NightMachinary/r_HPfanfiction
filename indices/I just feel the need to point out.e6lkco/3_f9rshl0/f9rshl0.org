Personally I generally hold to the idea that there are no bad plot devices, only badly written plot devices. Magical cores for example can be really good, really effective for the purposes for the story. They can also be really badly portrayed, really lazy writing where there would be more effective devices to use but which would take more world building, or more effort to explain.
