It's completely valid to call something lazy. Too often when I question a writer's reason for some characteristic or plot point, all they say is, "Because I thought it was cool, lol." That is pretty much the definition of lazy. If you want to make a change to an established character, that's fine, but please put some effort into the reasoning and setup. Too often fanfic readers are asked to accept some pretty ridiculous changes with very little effort put into the /why/ of the changes.

That's not to say that writing fanfic doesn't require effort, but one can still execute a story in a very lazy fashion.
