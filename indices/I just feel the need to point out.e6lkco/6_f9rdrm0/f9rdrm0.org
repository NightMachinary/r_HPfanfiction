Except a lot of HP fan fiction is full of tropes and ideas and the repetitive usage of them is lazy. Daphne Greengrass' fanon personality and description are good examples.

Using the idea of magical cores and removing a block to make Harry a super powerful wizard /is/ very lazy and cheap. We are shown in canon what makes a wizard talented/intelligent and it's a good way to develop Harry's character, but many refuse to do that. Indy, powerful Harry can work, but many refuse to properly take on the task.
