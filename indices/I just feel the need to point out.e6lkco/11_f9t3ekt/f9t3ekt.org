Some writing is lazy storytelling. Just because physically getting something on paper (so to speak) can be difficult, doesn't mean that you did enough plot planning where you've thought of a new way to tackle old tropes, character development where people face challenges and reach low points before they succeed, lifelike sounding dialogue where each character has a different voice etc.

If you don't put work into those areas than what you are doing /is/ lazy writing. There's way more to writing than typing out a story, and it shows when you don't put that work in.
