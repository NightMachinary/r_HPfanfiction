This is a touchy subject because I think ANYONE calling people lazy and unoriginal is kinda being harsh, as we're all here to have fun, not make money, and mostly writing for ourselves.

That said, if you don't write fic, you're still consuming fic and that gives you the ability to see where things go wrong. I'm not a politician, but I can criticize my local politicians, as I'm affected by what they do.

I don't make films, but I watch them, and if they mess up somewhere I have the right to point it out. It's not okay for me to be rude about it, but as a consumer of their media I see things from an outside perspective. That can help someone writing sometimes.

Like lots of editors and publishers don't write their own books. They just read books.

TL;DR it should be okay to criticize, but not okay to be rude about it.
