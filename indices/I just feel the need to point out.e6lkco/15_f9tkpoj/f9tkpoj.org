Lazy when it comes to the amount of effort you put into your character development and plot.

I've seen so many fanfiction where authors basical use the same old tropes and ideas.

For example. The Lord Black trope. The Time Travel Trope. The Political Harry.

Most fanfictions that use these tropes, have the same or similar plot. It's only an exceptional few that have original ideas.

Just because the most reviewed or favored fanfiction uses those tropes doesn't mean everyone should start using them.
