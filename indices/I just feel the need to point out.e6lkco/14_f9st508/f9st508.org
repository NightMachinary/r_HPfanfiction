People can use whatever vernacular they want. You're free to disagree or dislike however much you want, but your opinion is just that, same as anyone else's. Lazy is a perfectly valid criticism that some people deserve regardless of how much effort they put into a fanfic, be it 1000 words or 100,000. That's not to say the person themself is lazy, but that the implementation of a story element(s) they use is lazy. There's a fine difference between insulting someone and calling out a poorly thought out plot element in a story.
