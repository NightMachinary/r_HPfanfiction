Your overall argument is fair but I'd just counter that if criticism in general is ok, then calling a fic "unoriginal" is valid and not rude. Calling a writer "lazy" absolutely can come across quite rude, unless its contextualized correctly. But I'd argue calling a fic "unoriginal" is a perfectly valid critique.
