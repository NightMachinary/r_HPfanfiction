Ok, i feel called out.

First of all, writing fanfic isn't lazy. It might be a bad one, or a good one, regardless of quality it isn't a sign of laziness.\\
Now, throwing fanon tropes of rather big and influential ideas (i.e. magical cores and blocks on magic and whatnot), without even an ounce of original spin or change on top of them? It is kinda lazy.

If you write a fic, and then put it out there for others to read, you need to be prepared for facing criticism. Is calling an idea 'lazy' too far out there? I don't think so - it might be as valid as any other critique. There are some things i don't enjoy in fics, and i will say so if i read it, but stuff like 'Ooo, Dumbledore put a block on Harry's magical core because he's soo powarful" for the umpteenth time does seem not only to be annoying, but also lazy - we've seen the same dozens time before, no need to redo it.

And just FYI - i did write some stuff. I just later deemed it to be rather shite and scrapped it instead of publishing it. If someone decides to publish his work? Fine, just don't get mad if someone doesn't enjoy it or criticises it
