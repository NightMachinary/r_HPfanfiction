That scene in canon bugs me so much. "I know someone /supposedly/ entered you into the Tournament against your will, Potter, and they're probably trying to kill you just like every other year in the Safest Place in Wizarding Britain (TM), but somehow it'd still embarrass Hogwarts and Gryffindor if you didn't bring a date and open the Ball with the other Champions." "Okay, Professor, that sounds totally reasonable."
