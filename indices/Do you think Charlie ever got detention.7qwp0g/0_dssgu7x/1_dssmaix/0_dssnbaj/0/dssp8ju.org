Tom Riddle was an exemplary student, from what we know he was never caught doing anything bad and had stellar grades in every subject. The teachers all loved him.

James was not prefect before being head boy specifically because he cleaned up his act and stopped being so foolish after his 5th year, presumably because he fancied Lily and she thought he was petty and immature so he decided to wise up for her.
