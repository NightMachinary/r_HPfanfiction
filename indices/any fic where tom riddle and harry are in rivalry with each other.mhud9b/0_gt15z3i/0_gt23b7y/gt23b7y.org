that was good! I generally hate HP/TR. It's such a senseless pairing. It's palatable in this story because it doesn't try to treat it's scenario 'realistically' From the get go it's clear that the world is somewhat contrived. I admire how the fic doesn't flaw itself trying to justify it's plotholes and instead just plays to its strengths. Which are its brilliantly interesting main characters.

Sure, the weasley twins created an inderdimensional closet as a prank, but that doesn't stop the characters from developing!
