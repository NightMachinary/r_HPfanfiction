Same here. My favorite HP/TR fics are all set in Major or even Muggle AU's. Further works in the friendly rivals/not trying murder each other section:

Linkao3(Kudosed, Bookmarked, and Subscribed): Boss/Employee Muggle AU featuring Tom, Harry and ...J.K. Roaring. Unique Metafic.

Linkao3(Matchmaker by Tannintele) Muggle AU with Riddle as the investigator and Harry as a criminal. Manages to pull off the pairing somehow.
