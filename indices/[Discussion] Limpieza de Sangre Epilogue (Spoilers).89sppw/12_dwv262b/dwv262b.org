Not sure I would have ended it this way unless I wanted a sequel, but that's just me. I'm not sure the ending itself was my favorite thing either, but the ending opened the door for something great to walk through, and I'm always up for that. Overall, I thought the story was entertaining, and I hope to see more good work from this author in future.
