I was heavily disappointed. I've never been a big fan of this fic in the first place, but I never considered it bad by any means. Well, until now.

Nothing is resolved. Yeah, there'll obviously be a sequel for that, but the general rule is to at least have /something/ resolved before you hop on a sequel. The whole thing with Voldemort isn't resolved after Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but you still have the main plot get resolved. We know who was really after the Stone, why they wanted it, etc etc. We get none of that here. We got zero explanations.

Imagine if Philosopher's Stone ended right when Quirrell dies and Harry passes out. It would be incredibly unsatisfying. There was all this conflict building up and then it just... falls flat. The epilogue is just half unrelated nonsense and half about a generic powerful!Harry talking around annoyingly idiotic people.

Speaking of annoyingly idiotic people, it really irks me when authors make people stupid to the point where they're downright delusional. You have Harry telling the Board of Governors and Fudge that he didn't want to be headmaster for his entire life. And then Fudge asks him immediately after why he's applying if he doesn't want the job at all.

Like really? Is Fudge just that fucking delusional that he hears something completely different coming out of Harry's mouth? But then Harry corrects him... and then a moment later a member of the Board of Governors asks him the same damn question Fudge asked him, after Harry already gave his answer. Wtf?

This issue fucking plagues Harry Potter fanfiction, where Harry will be saying things and his "enemies" will act as though something completely different came out of his mouth, or like they just don't understand the incredibly simply words Harry is saying. You see it often with GreaterGood!Manipulative!Evil!Whatever!Dumbledore fics. While I've never been a fan of this fic, I still thought it better than 95% of fanfiction. So to see TE7 do this was just a big WTF moment. It is easily the most irritating thing to read for me.

The only thing I liked about the epilogue was seeing Dumbledore finally die, because his characterization was just terrible near the end.
