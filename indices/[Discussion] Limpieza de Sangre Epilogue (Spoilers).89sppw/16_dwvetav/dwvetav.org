I won't repeat what other people said, but I will say that I was disappointed. TE7 should've never killed off Emily, and should've instead dove deep into Harry breaking bad. Harry killing Dumbledore, doing bad shit, etc. Then, Emily revealing her true colors and turning on Harry once he filled his purpose. You could've even had Grindelwald coming back as part of that. A conflict between Harry vs Emily vs GG would've been interesting.

LDS was always about Emily for me. Harry was boring, mopey, and annoying. Which was fine, as I was expecting character growth (jumping 10 years forward w Super!Harry isn't growth, it's basically a new character). That never came, so ultimately Harry was just a waste.

So ultimately, it was an interesting premise pulled off well, only to putter and falter at the end.
