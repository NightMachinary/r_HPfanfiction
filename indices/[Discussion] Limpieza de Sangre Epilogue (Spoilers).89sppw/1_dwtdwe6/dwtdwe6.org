I'm just trying to picture if HPDH didn't have the /Flaw in the Plan/ chapter. Imagine it. Harry is in limbo, talking to Dumbledore, and then the next chapter is the epilogue. We don't get him waking up and finishing Voldemort, it's just straight to the epilogue. And then:

  The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.

  But then, as he watched the Hogwarts Express pull away, he saw someone waving at him from one of the train's windows. Any thoughts of this being a young fan of his were instantly swept aside and replaced with a sense of familiarity. He knew this man. He had seen this man, had seen him in one of Voldemort's visions from the war.

  Grindelwald!

That's kinda what this epilogue feels like.
