I usually don't respond to people that don't like me. I'm not going to change their mind and there's no reason to get into an argument about it. They've got their opinions on my work and they're more than entitled to them.

The vast majority of this thread has been negative, which makes me rather sad as I thoroughly enjoyed writing this last chapter and thought it was a pretty solid piece of writing on my part. But mostly I'm just not going to get into arguments with people who don't like my work. There's nothing that either of us gain from that.

Granted, this chapter was a first for me. I've never written anything with the intention of writing a sequel. So I perhaps thought I needed to try to hook too hard into what's to come. I've told people countless times that LdS does not have a happy ending for Emily and figured after that, they accept her death as the closing of her ark in the first story. After that, I wanted to focus on what's to come.

The sequel, if I ever write it, will be done in the same style of LdS in that there will be bits of the past interposed with the present. It will explore the scenes referenced in the epilogue and show how that changed Harry and got him to where he is now. The Harry that appears in the Epilogue knows a lot more than he lets on.

I don't think I'm internet famous. I'm more like esoterically HPfanfiction known about.
