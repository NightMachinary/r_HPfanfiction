#+begin_quote
  The vast majority of this thread has been negative, which makes me rather sad as I thoroughly enjoyed writing this last chapter and thought it was a pretty solid piece of writing on my part
#+end_quote

I enjoyed it! I personally feel that an ending really shouldn't answer every single question that comes up, seeing as how that doesn't happen in life and it was fairly obvious that this is a Story #1 in a series. Though I was mightily confused at first when it switched suddenly to Grindelwald's point of view due to the lack of any sort of page break.
