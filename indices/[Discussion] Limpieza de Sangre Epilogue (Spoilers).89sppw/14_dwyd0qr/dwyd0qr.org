Definitely not what I was expecting for an epilogue, and I wasn't the biggest fan of it overall (although I like it more now that there's basically confirmation of a sequel), That being said, I still enjoyed the dialogue in this chapter just as I have throughout the entire story, and I am really intrigued by all of the gallivanting Harry and Avery have been up to since the last chapter too.

Also, I never like to see an author sad because of negative feedback. I appreciate all of the authors out there who produce creative stories for folks like me that just /read/ and don't actually /write/ fiction. So, thanks [[/u/TE7]] for the time you've put into this story (and all of your others), they're always a pleasure to read.
