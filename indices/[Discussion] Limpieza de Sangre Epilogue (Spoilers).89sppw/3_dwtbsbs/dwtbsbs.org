I found this ending very baffling, and the whole turn that the story took in later chapters was disappointing and abrupt. What, exactly, is Emily planning? I assume she isn't actually dead, or there wouldn't be any point to her entire mission. We had all this interaction between her and Harry that didn't result in anything. We also had some kind of H/Hr romance that... also didn't result in anything. Overall, the author doesn't seem to know how to write a plot, and leaves all sorts of situations unsatisfying and dead in the water. I thought this story was going to be some kind of revolution/reform of the entire Wizarding Britain, and following Harry as he interacts with that seemed quite intriguing at the start, but then I don't know what we're supposed to expect now. A sequel where Harry has to defend against a revived Grindelwald movement? MEH.
