You don't. But you kinda do.

Hermione mentions she hasn't had a vacation since a trip she'd taken to Japan five years previously. Hedwig then hoots at her. You learn later in the chapter that Harry has been in Japan for five years.

She later reminisces about the oppressive nature of the air in Japan (which is implied in Emily's diary) from 'the last time she saw him'. And she correlates the magic she is sensing from Harry with that power in Japan.

I don't say it, but the implication (and truth) is that Hermione went to Japan to see Harry.
