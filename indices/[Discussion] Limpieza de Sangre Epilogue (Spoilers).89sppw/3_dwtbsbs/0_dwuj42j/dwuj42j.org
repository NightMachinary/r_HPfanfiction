Emily realised she wasn't going to succeed and found a way out of it, giving Harry a huge "victory" in the process.

The H/Hr stuff was explained too. Emily knew Harry fancied her, wasn't interested, and tried to deflect his attentions on to Hermione but with only partial success. In the end, Harry realised that he couldn't trust his feelings for Hermione: for all he knew the affection he felt could have been caused entirely by Emily. So he left to discover what he really felt about things. The epilogue makes it pretty clear that they've met since then. They're not together, so I guess they decided it wasn't going to work.
