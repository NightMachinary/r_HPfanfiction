LdS resolves Harry's childhood.

I was going to respond with something much more involved but there's a simple answer. Harry began the story as a boy and ended it as a man. He started as a victim and ended with a nonchalant attitude of power. Is that not enough?

Arthur C Clarke wrote in his Afterword to Rama II "In real life, of course, no story ever ends".

Does LdS wrap everything up in a package and seal it with a bow? No. Very few stories do. Tolkien couldn't manage it and had to resort to that time line at the end of Lord of the Rings. Clarke, Asimov, dammit the bible is pretty open ended.

I understand the wish for a "They all lived happily ever after" story. But this was never going to be that. There *should *be more to Fanfiction than who ends up with whom.
