I was hoping things would be wrapped up, questions would be answered, relationships resolved, but instead the entire chapter, and the one before it, were just setups for some sort of sequel. I liked this story, I liked the relationship between Harry and Emily, and how Harry changed throughout the story, but this just left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.
