I'm left a bit melancholy about the whole ordeal. I enjoyed the fic more than I expected, though I had no idea what I was getting into prior to looking at it. I hadn't even realized it was so popular a topic of discussion here as I don't browse here specifically much and most posts don't make it my larger frontpage. It was grammatically a bit rough in places and the lack of page breaks was irritating but the plot was decent for the most part. I read the entire story in about 4 days after stumbling on it over the long weekend.

I hadn't seen much like it actually, the take on Emily/Voldemort and the relationship with Harry. I enjoyed that part because it was very much different from what'd I seen prior, though I am only now returning to HP fanfic reading. I find myself wanting to read more stories with different relationships between Voldemort and Harry than mortal enemies because of it.

But I don't think we saw enough of Emily and her state of mind in the present for the conclusion with her to be satisfying. It explored her journey but did little to really explore who she was at the point of her ressurection and how Harry affected her. She presented as just a cross between the girl in her early years and Dark Lord later. It implied and even outright stated a lot about her passions and lack thereof and that explains the ending but being left wondering exactly what she thought of Harry and how she viewed him beyond her claims of manipulation was disappointing. Perhaps that was the point, to leave it up to the reader to interpret it but I find it a bit frustrating in this case. The lack of closure between them was irritating.

Perhaps a sequel will address this more. Before the return of the character at the end I would have been more or less content with the conclusion as it stood. I might have liked to see what Avery and Harry got up to and how their relationships developed over time in a spin-off or something but without that last section of epilogue it felt finished if a touch disappointing. Now I'm left simply hoping we might see more of Emily and how Harry views their relationship years later. How she might have viewed him during this fic.

I enjoyed the story in the moment and the during the reading of it for the most part. Some pieces of character were a bit tough going down but overall I was compelled in a way I hadn't been in some time reading HP Fanfiction. It has encouraged me to keep looking for stories in the fandom, as clearly I have missed more than I might have thought given how extensively I used to read and search out fics I liked. If I reread the story sometime in the future I will likely be ignoring that last section of epilogue until such time that a sequel is being released.
