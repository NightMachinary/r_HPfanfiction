I have to say that I understand why JKR put them together because that was what she initially envisioned. She started writing the story and planning out the ending, and she saw them paired together. As the story changed and grew and the characters grew up, her vision for the ending should have changed slightly as well to accommodate the characters that she had now, instead of the ones she originally had in her mind. I've seen this with a few long running series, where a side character changes so much that the writer has to change parts of the story to accommodate them. She may have stopped "listening to her characters" in order to push the overarching story forward. I mean it's all speculation, but in my own writing I've had characters change so much while writing that I've had to completely redo my outline. It's nutso. They really have a life of their own once you start writing them.

Plus, isn't it super rare to marry your school sweetheart and have a successful marriage? I feel like it's doomed just based on that alone. People change so much in those years.
