Agree 100% with what you said. JKR started out writing a kids book and she planned everything nicely in the end so it would all tie up together with a nice neat knot, but as the books evolved and the characters really fleshed out and acted on their own she should have adjusted her plans accordingly. Instead you had her stubbornly clinging on to her initial concept and having to run around for forced reasons like in the list to justify a relationship which in all honestly, likely wouldn't have lasted a year at hogwarts let alone a marriage for life.
