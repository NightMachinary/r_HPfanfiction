I never meant to imply that everyone married their high school so's. I never said that. Also, it's just statistics. On just a cursory glance at the numbers it's very rare (like 2% or less) of marriages are between people who knew each other in high school or before. It's a pretty antiquated idea. I know it fits with the universe but still. People grow apart and change. That's just life.
