I don't object to the realistic aspect of their relationship due to the childhood sweetheart aspect alone. It's so much more about how fundamentally different they are as PEOPLE, even AS teenagers and how I can't see them co-existing peacefully or happily for that matter in a marriage. Yes people DO get married to people they've known as kids and if it works out, great for them. I don't think it would work for [[/r/Hr][r/Hr]] though because I don't think they had even found their places in society or what they really wanted for themselves at that point before the epilogue. They were seventeen year olds thrust in war, they had no time to really grow and establish themselves as adults in a functioning society with a normal lifestyle. In that environment, I think they both would grow apart even more as adults. I can see that people that they /will become/ to stay as friends, but as life partners? Unlikely.
