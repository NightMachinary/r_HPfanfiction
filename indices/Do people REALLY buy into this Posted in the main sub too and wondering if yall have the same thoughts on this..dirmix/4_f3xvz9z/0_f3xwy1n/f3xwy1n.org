  Plus, isn't it super rare to marry your school sweetheart and have a successful marriage? I feel like it's doomed just based on that alone.

I strongly disagree with this sentiment in the context of 'Harry Potter':

- The wizarding world is very small, and Hogwarts is the ONLY magical school in Britain. Those kids don't have a lot of choices unless they are willing to marry Muggles or foreigners.
- Harry's generation was further bonded by the War. Most named characters in the Books went through hell and back together, and you think they were your AVERAGE Muggle high school teens?
- Not 'EVERYONE' married their high school sweet-hearts. We know that Harry, Ron, Neville, and George did. Luna married someone else called Rolf SCAMANDER. Cho was confirmed by JKR to have married a Muggle of Chinese descent. Draco married someone from the school, but not his 'sweet heart' Pansy. We don't know whom Dean, Seamus, Katie, Susan, Justin, Michael, Parvati, Padma, Anthony, Dennis, Terry, Romilda, Daphne, Pansy, and most others ended up with!
- In case of Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, they are best friends and war comrades whose relationships are closer than the greatest majority of your average high schoolers could possibly imagine.
- Even in our real world, high school sweet-hearts marrying and staying decades together is also hardly rare. My maternal grandparents did that (they stayed together for 64 years until the death did them apart). My best high school friend did. Even the previous homeowner from whom I bought my current house started dating at age 16 and has been married for 46 years.
