I can't reread the books for the most part anymore. Going back for certain scenes, yes. Rereading the whole thing, no. It's disappointing.

And after PoA, I really couldn't watch the movies either.

Some days it feels like I lost a crucial piece of my childhood. (Other days, I cynically remember I usually like fanfics that fix problems with canon better than the source material for most series and write it off as growing up.)
