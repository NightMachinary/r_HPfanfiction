To be fair, I think a lot of authors initially base characters off of real people they know. The difference is that they don't force the characters to conform to wish-fulfillment endings or stay true to the real life person if that's not how the character reacts on the page.

It's not easy. So many of my own attempts at writing die early on because the characters grow past my ability to world-build the repercussions.
