Yeah, there's nothing wrong with taking inspiration from real life, EVERYONE does that. But not everyone forces their characters into endings that follow wish fulfillment rather than staying true to their characterization :/

Yeah it is hard, once a characters really gets established, they have a mind of their own lol. That's why when you try to force them to do smth OOC it feels all the more weird to the reader.
