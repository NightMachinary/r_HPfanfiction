I don't think I can ever re read the books either. It's kind of sad bc I remember 10 year old me bragging to my friends abt how I've read the series ten times over and now, with all the knowledge I have of all the plot holes, all the inconsistencies, all the OOCness, I don't think I can go through without and feel that same magic. Everything feels too convoluted and forced.

I think a part of it also has to do with learning how much of the characters' actions was decided by JKR's own fantasies and strange ideas. Like her self inserting into Hermione and admitting that Ron was based after her allegedly abusive ex husband (?). I just can't take it seriously when the author's personal life or notions starts affecting the organic progression of characters.
