It makes the actions the characters take and the feeling in the book so ...fake and cheap...when she does that. Like the characters are moving like puppets to a preordained future rather than carving it out itself. And that loses a lot of the magic of the series for me, I realized as I got older and started considering parts of canon itself to be OOC.
