Kinda reminds me of a fic idea I've had for some time now. Occasionally, in case I ever feel like writing it down, I try to plan out in my head in more detail how it gets to the ending I want from the initial premise. However, whenever I do this, I run into trouble with a certain character not cooperating, because his character traits do not lend themselves to do what I want. The approach I've had so far is a seperate person calling him out on it, which is entirely plausible, and while probably not the obvious action of the person, is easy enough to explain. However, it always felt a bit forced to me, so I've sometimes tried to figure out a way to make it feel more natural.
