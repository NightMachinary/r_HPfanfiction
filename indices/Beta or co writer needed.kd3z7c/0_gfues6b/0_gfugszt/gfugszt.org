Well I had always liked the idea of Harry having a blood related sibling. Basically my thought was this. I had heard of stories were Dudly was also a wizard. Basically both the Potter brother were dropped off at the Dursley's after James and Lily died. ,Leon( my oc potter) never showed any signs of accidental magic while growing while Harry showed plenty of bouts of freakish things. This led to the Dursleys treating Harry as they did in canon(maybe a bit more abusive, I mean I doubt they could treat him with any sympathy if they had locked him in the cupboard) while they treated Leon like Dudley. (Dudly was never born, They raise Leon in his place.) That's is just the begining of course. I plan on giving about two or three chapters to their development at the Dursley's. I came up with it cause I was looking for a way for Leon to actually be antagonistic towards Harry. I mean James and Lily would never have raised a snot nosed brat. When they /both/ get their letters I plan on showing the hypocrisy of the Dursley's by having them keep their attitudes the same. "Oh my boy. You have done this family proud." Leon beamed at the praise from his father Vernon. And yeah. I think I just went and overexplained my idea. Oh well.
