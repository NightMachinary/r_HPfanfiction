I like the idea. So do you have any ideas on the personality of Harry, the friends of both, the opinions both of Leon and Harry, others opinions of them? And what side of the war he is on? What are their characteristics? What will they look like? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What house do you think they will go to? What about love interests? What about the Dursley's reaction to Leon when/if he gets his Hogwarts letter? What kind of magical outburst does Harry have? Just a few things to think about. Do you have any ideas for answers of the above questions?
