Well. For their houses I do have answers. I think I am gonna send Leon into Slytherin. His personality is gonna be kinda like Dudley's except more cunning. He will plan and use anything to get his goal. Harry is gonna go to Hufflepuff. For two reasons. This Harry is gonna be the kinda of person if you earn their loyalty they will go through hell for you but if you break it your not getting it back. Plus I feel Hufflepuff is underused. My plan for the war is for Voldemort to corrupt Leon and then be killed by Leon who becomes a Dark Lord. Harry is gonna try and spend his time in school gaining allies to fight with him. My plan is for them to kill each other. Can you guess why? Hint(What is on Dumbledore's finger the 6th year.)
