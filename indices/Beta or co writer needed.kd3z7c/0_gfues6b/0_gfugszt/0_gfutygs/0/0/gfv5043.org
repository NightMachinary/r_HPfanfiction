The Deathly Hallows. As of right now, I think I am willing to be your Beta. What about the school? Will they turn on one of them or the other? What will Dumbledore's opinion of them be? What will their relationship be with the teachers? In what ways will Harry be abused, and how will that affect his actions? Will anyone notice his abuse? (I am willing to beta no matter what your answers are to the questions, I just want to have a better sense of the story. Unless something comes up, I will) Also, what site are you going to use?
