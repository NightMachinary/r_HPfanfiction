True he is wearing the stone of resurrection. I meant more along the lines of the horcrux part. Dumbledore is in my opinion Dumbledore. While I personally dont like his choices he did what he did. If he could I think he would change what he did. So not bashing but not Good Dumbles. Leon and Harry will have an antagonistic relationship towards each other except at the end. My Idea is that the horcrux tries to take over Leon and Harry but Lilys scrafice also allowed Harry's soul to kind link with Leon to help fight off the influence. That is why Voldemort is able to corrupt Leon with the Horcrux since it is only be fought off by his and Harry's soul. But with them hating each other the soul link is weakened. Lily's scrafice is in a ritual she made in the Hope's of being able to create a bridge between souls in the hope of being able to help on another heal. So if a person was in a coma a person could be linked to them to then have them wake up. Make sense. I hope it does. The process of this ritual basically involves ripping the two souls from their bodies and then using the soul of a scrafice as the building material for the bridge. Lily's was hoping that if Voldemort tried to kill one her children then bridge could hopefully let them survive. Thankfully it did. Just not in the way she was hoping. The killing curse split itself in two when it hit Leon. One part of Leon's soul was killed and a part of Voldemort was killed. Then since creating a horcrux splits the soul there was two peices left. One went to Harry but was very small. The other went to Leon and was much larger. Ahhhhhh. See . I often overextend on certain ideas.
