I have been trying to find Fanfictions that feature the general philosophical consens of either Nietzsche, Heine, Strau√ü, Derrida, Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Spinoza or even Singer.\\
There definitely were a few attempts. Sadly though most authors were defeated rather quick, simply because Philosophy does not work well with how canon delivers the world of HP.

Singers Utilitarism is often attempted in fanfictions to point out why the Greater Good could not possibly work out well enough to attempt it. All ends in failure though, simply because the author never makes the step forward to offer a "radical" stance. For plot convenience the topic is abandoned or ignored.

I read a fanfiction in which the author tries to hint towards philosophy however little - maybe I am simply reading too much into it because I like his style of writing (reminds me of a few Authors I adore!).

Quoting from PM (preview of his new chapter)

  /We are but what we can think of. Thus everything we are, has its origin in our mind. Guided by our will, our thoughts create and form the world we live in/, or so they say.\\
  He wasn't too sure if he would want to live in a world that was influenced by his sometimes quite bipolar ideas. But then again, if the combined minds of all people were creating the reality they lived in, maybe his own thoughts didn't matter all that much after all.

Also I have to note that I imagine it being hard to add philosophy into your story - if you are arguing a philosophical point, there will be tons of text that may be really hard to read through. People lose interest fast. *shrugs*
