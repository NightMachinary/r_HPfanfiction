  Harry Potter doesn't know what to do anymore. Life is boring. What to do with all the time he got on his hands? Join him and find out what he's gonna do next. First english fanfiction. English is my third language. No Beta. Chapters are loosely connected to each other. Please leave a Review if you liked it. If you didn't like it send me criticism.
