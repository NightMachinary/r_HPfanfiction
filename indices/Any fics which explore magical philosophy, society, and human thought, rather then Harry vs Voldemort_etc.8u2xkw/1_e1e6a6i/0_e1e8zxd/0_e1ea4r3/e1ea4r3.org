Its a author who originally started writing fanfictions in german and then, because apparently not everyone speaks german (:D) started to translate his fics.\\
linkffn(Don't speak ill of the dead by GideonGermanicus)\\
There is not much content as of yet, but he updated a few chapters on some of his fictions today, so it seems he is steadily working on it.

I'd imagine a muggleborn who grew up in a household that didnt accept things at face value - someone who grew up with parents who helped along building up a healthy Skepticism - would find himself with a severe case of Weltschmerz rather soon, after entering the Magical World of Harry Potter.

Kek. I would imagine a fiction that displays Nietzsche as a muggleborn who got so fed up with the magical and muggle world, that he retreated into his almost ascetic life in the mountains, would be quite the read.

When it comes to might makes right. Guess what. The same author I linked you the fanfic of has a 1 chapter-fic (so far) of Harry Potter starting with a different mindset. My german admittedly is not the best, but I think HP in that fic (Ein hehres Ziel) is going to be a british Hitler. I'll ask if there is more to come.
