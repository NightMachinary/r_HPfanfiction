What really throws me is that over the Christmas Break, she decides to try to strike up something more with Harry. Then, when they're developing antidotes in Potions, she reverts to being a total bitch to him.

Why would any right-thinking man want her? This story's Hermione is just as bad as its Ron, just not as loud.
