It's hard to read a fanfiction where the author hadn't even read the source material but covers it up with it's called fanfiction for a reason. Why write HP fanfiction when you haven't read or watched it? Especially when you place it in HBP. The author had no idea about why Hermione was really pissed off about the Prince's book. (It was mostly benign comments and annotations, with one dark spell that was bloody well damned labelled For Enemies.). Couldn't really get into it.
