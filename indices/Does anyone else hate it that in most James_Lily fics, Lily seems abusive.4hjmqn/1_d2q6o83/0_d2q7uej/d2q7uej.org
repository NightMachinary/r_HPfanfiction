Well, in the movie, when Hermione warned Harry that Romilda Vane tried to does him with love potion, Harry cheekily answered that 'he was the chosen one', whereas Hermione slapped him with a piece of parchment.

Earlier in the same movie, when Harry went missing due to being stunned by Draco, Hermione slapped Ron hard with her books.

In the Books, when Ron returned from his absence, Hermione beat the crap out of him, much more violently than in the movie.
