Did I mention already that I hate the movies and the way they ruined the characters?

Now there's a slight difference between the Hermione/Ron confrontation in DH and hexing your friend because he joked about something you don't find funny, or voiced an opinion you don't like, like we often see in fanfiction. And the thing is, it actually makes the characters who do this look like stupid bullies who can't listen to something they don't like without resorting to violence.
