Yes. It's not even just Lily, any story that has a main female character who behaves that way irks me. It's not only abusive but also immature. It's one of the things that made me slow down on Anime, too. I've grown up and roll my eyes at that predictable behavior. Sometimes I'll ignore it, but if it's paired with bad writing I'll consider reading something else.
