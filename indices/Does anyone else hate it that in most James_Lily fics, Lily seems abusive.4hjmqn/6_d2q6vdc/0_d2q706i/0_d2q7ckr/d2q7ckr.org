People could extrapolate from that event.

Lily slapping or hexing James was not that out of place.

For example, Ginny hexed Zach Smith just because he asked a few questions about the DoM battle. I have no doubt that if Zach dared to ask Ginny out, he would be hexed beyond recognition.

I think Lily almost had the same fierce temper as Ginny, and that she despised James even more before their year 7. So I wouldn't be surprised if she hexed him for asking her out, and it's equally not surprising many other readers imagine the same.
