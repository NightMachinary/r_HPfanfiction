I mostly look past Ginny hexing Zach for asking about the DoM battle. For one, we don't know what he was asking, it could have been that he was being an ass-hat; saying that Harry got his godfather killed, that Ginny wasn't actually there, etc. And two, the DoM battle was likely a traumatic event for her, and she may have over-reacted to something he did during the conversation.

I'm just extrapolating this from my high school experiences, but whenever someone got into a serious event, it was like it was some rite of passage for dumbasses to do something to get a reaction out of the person. I could easily imagine Zach whipping his wand out like he was going to attack her, and getting hexed into a pile of mush for his trouble.
