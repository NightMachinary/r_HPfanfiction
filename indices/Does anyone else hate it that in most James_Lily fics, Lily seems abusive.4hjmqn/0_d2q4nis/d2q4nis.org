The fandom has taken the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentingTheHusband][Parenting the Husband]] trope to the extreme in the case of Lily and James, so I don't think authors realize just how stupid and abusive they make the relationship to be.

It's most certainly not a healthy relationship, but it's the easiest thing to write for authors instead of actually coming up with personalities for Lily and James. We already know James used to be a massive prankster (though it's made clear he matured a lot even as a teenager), and that Lily has no issue making her objections to his behavior known. They just ratcheted it up a few notches and called it marriage, probably because modern media has drummed it into children's minds that that is what marriage is.
