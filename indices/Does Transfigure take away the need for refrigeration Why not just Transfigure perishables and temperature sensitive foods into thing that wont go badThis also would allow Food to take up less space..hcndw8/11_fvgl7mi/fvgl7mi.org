I don't remember if this is canon or Pottermore stuff or fanon, but I remember reading somewhere that when a time traveller tries to return back crossing several years from the past, the body ages too rapidly and the person ends up dying. I feel the same principle could be applied to food. If you change an apple to stone and change it back after a month, you would get a rapidly rotting apple as a result.

If it is impossible to extend the lifetime a human without extreme feats of magic such as alchemy or necromancy, then it should similarly apply to plants and animals which are the primary sources of food. Perhaps it is possible to extend the lifetime of food but it requires a large sacrifice of magic and no witch or wizard is willing to pay that price.
