Ummm... I thought most people agreed that you cannot time travel to the future and it was one of the major bone of contention with Cursed Child. I didn't read it beyond the first few pages though, so I probably misunderstood something.

I found the source for my anecdote - it's on Pottermore. I couldn't get the actual link so I'll give this for your reference.

I guess it also made its way into fanon. Basilisk-born, which weaves a lot of Pottermore articles and other fantasy lore it, had a reference to it.
