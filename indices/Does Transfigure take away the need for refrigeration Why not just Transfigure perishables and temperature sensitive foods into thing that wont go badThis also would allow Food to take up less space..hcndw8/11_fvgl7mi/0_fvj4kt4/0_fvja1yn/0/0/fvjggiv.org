  It seems more likely that wizards would have continued to research food related charms as no death is involved?

But the incentive to do so is also less. When the magic involved is too advanced and there is a higher price to pay, the reward must be high. How much effort would I be willing to put into inventing an /extra-long food preserving charm/ and then use it on a day-to-day basis? I might end up expending a lot of energy and need more food than I required in the first place. All this hard work and I don't even get an extra five days added to my life. Tsk.

  It's also a highly 'secret' and therefore rumoured development.

From what I remember, Hermione was so 'excited' that she discussed the 'secret' time turner on the Kings Cross platform. I don't bother with Cursed Child stuff because of several reasons:

- The Golden Trio seemed to regress in maturity and cautiousness - Hermione was more secretive about her time-turner in PoA and Harry always used Muffliato since HBP, but they talk about everything under the sun in the presence of their children without any precautions.
- Harry being weirdly insensitive to his child - This is the guy who instantly forgave Snape, Dumbledore and wanted to give a chance to Tom Riddle for heaven's sake!
- Illogical time jumps
- Existence of child from Voldemort and Bellatrix around the same age of Harry's children - Just how did that happen? Did she drop from the sky?

Sorry for the rant! üòÅ
