I think the Principle Exceptions to “[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/gamps-law-of-elemental-transfiguration/][Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration]]” address this. JK Rowling had to put some limits to the limits of magic, if things like food and money could be perfectly duplicated without losing some quality there could be no Wizarding economy at all. From the book descriptions it seems like after a number of Transfiguration the food would eventually become unedible. This is like Leprechaun Gold, or the Gemino curse placed on items in in Gringott's - there could be hundreds of copies of an item but they are worthless fakes that eventually just disappear. I'd think food would be the same way, after thousands of transfigurations on the same piece of bread it would be have no nutritional value.

/Food is one of the first of five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur--- ... It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some” - Hermione/
