I mean storing the food in another state. And Only turning it back when it's time to cook or eat it.

Not transfiguraing food that has already gone bad.

Like if you transfigurer a fresh loaf of bread into a needle and stick it in a drawn and undo the transfigureration 6 months or Mabye even years later will the bread still be fresh?
