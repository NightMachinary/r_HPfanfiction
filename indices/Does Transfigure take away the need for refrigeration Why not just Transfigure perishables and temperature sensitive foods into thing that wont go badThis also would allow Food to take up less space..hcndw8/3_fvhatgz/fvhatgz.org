The problem with these questions is that HP follows a soft magic system, that can be twisted and turned to do whatever the author wants. JK made Gamp' s Law just to justify the misery of the trio during their hunt. Oh and, of course, so, /so/ many other things that readers know to ignore. She can make great characters, but designing a structured and consistent magic system was never her aim or fort√©.
