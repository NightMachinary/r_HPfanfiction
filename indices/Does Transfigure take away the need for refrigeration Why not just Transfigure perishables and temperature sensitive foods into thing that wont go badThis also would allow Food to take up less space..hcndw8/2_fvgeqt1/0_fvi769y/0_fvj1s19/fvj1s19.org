I'm not certain, I would say the idea that you could keep food items preserved infinitely is unlikely, but it seems within the realm of possibility that some sort of charm equivilent to a fridge exists.

This is because we know that more food can be transfigured from an existing amount, so it strikes me as being unlikely to exist only to feed more people.

Unfortunately, Hermione is rubbish at food charms so we find out very little about household charms. Molly Weasley is known to be excellent at them, insofar as Ron believed food could be created from nothing.

Of course, this is conjecture.

Regarding the idea of transfiguring food into a rock to make it more portable, I think a shrinking charm would suffice.
