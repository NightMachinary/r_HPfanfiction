Definitely splitting hairs but that's ok. I'm a hunter so to me a pig is food. Without a doubt I like your thought I'm just not sure that was what JKR intended with Gamp's Law. And the phrase "good food" was not in terms of how tasty it was but in terms of whether you got nutrients from it.

In other words the impression from the books I got was that you could "create" food but you would get no nutritional benefit from it. I.e., you couldn't create "good food".

I think the issue may be that you can not conjure food out of thin air but you could transfigure something into food (and by food I mean a substance that you get nutritional value from when you consume it).
