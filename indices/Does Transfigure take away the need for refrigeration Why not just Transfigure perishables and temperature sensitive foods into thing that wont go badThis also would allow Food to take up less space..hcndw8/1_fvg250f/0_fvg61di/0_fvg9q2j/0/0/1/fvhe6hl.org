I don't see the problem? We know that wizards can turn objects into animals e.g. McGonagall's desk into a pig.

The rule is that you can't use transfiguration to create "good food"; a pig is not food. It is an animal. A pig can be turned into food via butchery, but there's no rule that we know of against using transfiguration to turn items into things that can become food.

Note that the trio did not lack for ingredients in DH. In the conversation about Gamp's law, they have fish and mushrooms. What they lack is the knowledge of how to turn the ingredients into something palatable.
