You expect magic to make sense? I figure the food comes from the same place that all things conjured come from, magic. That'd only make it temporary unless you can use a mixture of runes, and conjurations to conjure permanent food. Maybe. IDK, expecting magic to make sense is an exercise in futility in my opinion.
