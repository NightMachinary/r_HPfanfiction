This is veering into head canon category but this is the way I think of it. Transfiguration change what an object is physically while charm alters the attribute of an object.

When you're doubling the amount of food you're using a charm that alters the “number” attribute of the food.

You can use charm to change an object attribute from “broken” to “fix” or add attributes like “lightweight” or “unbreakable” or “larger” or “cannot be summon”, etc

Duplicating food is just changing an attribute and that is doable.

But for some reason physically altering an inedible object to an edible one is not. There is something about food or the concept of food that can't be transfigured (or charmed as well)

You can alter the aspect of a food but once an object becomes a nonfood you can't turn it back into food
