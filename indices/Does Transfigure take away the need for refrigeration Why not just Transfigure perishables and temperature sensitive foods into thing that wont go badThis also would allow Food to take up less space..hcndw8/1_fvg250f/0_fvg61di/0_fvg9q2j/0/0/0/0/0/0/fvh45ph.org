Well first we have to agree that these are children's books and therefore there will be lots of gaps. I agree on the blueprint part making it easier, however the problem is where does this doubled food come from. I.e., you have one lb of food surrounded by air. You then cast a spell to double the food and now you have 2 lbs of food. So you basically just conjured 1 lb of food out of thin air which you're supposedly are not able to do.

On the other hand it suggests that Harry and Hermione while in the tent in the Forest of Dean screwed up as All they had to do was cast the spell to double the food they had and they would've never run out.

Like I said . ......gaps üòÅ
