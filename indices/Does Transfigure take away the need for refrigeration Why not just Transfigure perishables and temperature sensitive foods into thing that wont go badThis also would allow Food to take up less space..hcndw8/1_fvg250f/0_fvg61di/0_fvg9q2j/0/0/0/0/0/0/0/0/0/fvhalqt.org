Yeah that's the interesting thing. Physically and molecularly it's a pig and yet eating it gives you no nutrients, why is that?

The only explanation I have other than plot is that an inanimate to animate transfiguration creates what seem to be a living thing, but it's basically an elaborate doll. Give a transfigured pig to Muggle scientists to study and they'll swear it's real. It acts like a pig, it's chemistry and biology is exactly like a pig and so is its molecular structure. It'll stay like a pig for years

But it's missing elements that would make it a true living thing, like the fact that you can't eat it. It might also not be able to reproduce

I really wish JKR had expanded on magic throughout the book more it's just so interesting to think about
