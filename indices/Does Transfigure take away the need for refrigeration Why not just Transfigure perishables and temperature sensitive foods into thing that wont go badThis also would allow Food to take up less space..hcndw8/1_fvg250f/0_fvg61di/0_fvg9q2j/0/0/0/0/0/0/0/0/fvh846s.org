A little bit of beating a dead horse here but....we are told that transfiguration changes things on a molecular level. McGonnagall changes her desk into a pig, the students change teapots into a tortoises. It is heavily implied if not stated that they are real. Eg if you dissected them they would have the exact same physiology as a natural born animal. So if that is true then why can't you eat them and how were you able to do it in the first place as Gamp's Law states it's impossible.

I'll leave it with "plot device" and gaps in the details.

Fun discussion though.
