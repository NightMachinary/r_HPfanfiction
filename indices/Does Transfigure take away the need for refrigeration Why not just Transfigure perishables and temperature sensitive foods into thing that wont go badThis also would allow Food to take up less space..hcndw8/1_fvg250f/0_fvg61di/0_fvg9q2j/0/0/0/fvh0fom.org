Don't know, take it up with the magic gods, but gagasfsf is right here. I don't have the quote on hand, but transfigurations are permanent, unless some magical law says otherwise, rock to chair will stay a chair. It is still magically a rock, and casting finite will revert it back to a rock, but otherwise that rock will stay a chair until the heat death of the universe. I think transfiguring something into an animal, or food won't work, because your biological magic will screw with your "food," and cause a whole bunch of problems for you. I've always thought that buying cheap, nasty, but highly nutritious food, and then transfuguring it into something delicious would be a cool little work around. You get all the moment on the lips without a lifetime on the hips.
