I don't have the canon quotes with me but I am 99% sure hat transfiguration is permanent (hopefully someone will find the quote)

Transfiguration is physically permanent but not magically. If you transfigured a rock into a chair, that rock will stay a chair forever. Give it to a muggle and that rock will be a chair forever. However the rock is magically still a rock and a decent wizard would know it is a transfigured object and still be able to untransfigure it back to its original form

Conjuration on the other hand is not pernament

Transfiguration can do a lot but there seems to be some rule preventing inedible to edible transfiguration. Might just be a quirk of magic or there's something about food that magically can't be replicated by transfiguration.
