Quite frankly I don't remember but I believe that transfiguration is not permanent. Otherwise why wouldn't transfiguration of inedible to edible not work (well besides plot point). I mean if transfiguration is permanent and changes the molecular structure than why couldn't I change a rock into a live chicken, then kill the chicken and eat it?

And if you could transform it than no witch or wizard would ever go hungry. Also if I'm remembering correctly Gamps Law is more about conjuring food out of nothing not transforming food out of something else because I swear there was a section in the books that said you can transform it.
