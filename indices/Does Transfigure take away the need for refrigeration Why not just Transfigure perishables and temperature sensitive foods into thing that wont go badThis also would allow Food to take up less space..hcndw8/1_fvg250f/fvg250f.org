In other words you're looking at trying the reverse of Gamp's Law. Instead of transfiguring a rock into food (which would turn back into a rock causing you problems if you ate it) you're looking at turning food into a rock or some other inanimate small objects..

That sounds like a neat idea. The problem is chosing what type of object as most things still age and you would have to determine how that aging would impact the food when you tried to return that inanimate object back to food. Plus a transfiguration is fairly power intensive so you might have a variation in how long the food stays in that transformed state.

For instance, if you transformed food into metal how would rust (which can start to form in a few days) impact the reversal? If you transformed it into rock/pebbles how would them rubbing together losing dust impact the reversal?

If you did this i would think some type of high impact glass/plastic marbles would be best as they would be less effected by weather and time. You could even have the color of the marble denote the type of food (i.e., green for veggies, red for red meat etc.) Then your only issue is the power of the caster and how long their transfiguration would last. And storing the transfigured food in a spell resistant container so a simply "finite" does not reverse all the transfigured food.
