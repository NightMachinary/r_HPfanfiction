If you haven't noticed, I'm a sucker for Harry/Daphne, but there's some Luna and Andy mixed in there.

Though the two best ones in my opinion were already mentioned in this thread, Unspeakable Beauty is simply delightful with a unique Luna and so sweet that it hurts my teeth. And GYWM is my favourite fic of all time, of all genres and fanons. So there's that.

If you're into Cross-overs, there's 3 that I love, 2 are pretty similar to one another in the begining (one was inspired by the other with the author's permision) and they're both femHarry/Eragon (Helene) set after the war with Helene transported to Alagaesia and having a dragon egg hatch for her. It really goes indepth with how the magical systems work differently and together with one another, and though the romance takes a while to get going, it is a major point of the fics.

The third is a Harry/Rosalie from Twilight, after war (ofc, that's what you've asked) in a world where Rose didn't find Emmet and focused all her attention to try and getting Edward for herself, though they hate each other, she desperately wants a mate. Its set about a month after they get back from Italy after Edward's suicide attempt. Its a MoD Harry but with a lot of angst and a somber tone, though the romance IS the main part of the fic, there's some really cool stuff too. This is my favourite Twilight fanfic, even source material.
