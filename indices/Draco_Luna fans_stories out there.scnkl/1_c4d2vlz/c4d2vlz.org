I love Draco/Luna! But I've really only enjoyed one fic from the ones I've read. They are, I think, are amongst the hardest characters to write well, and I usually don't like the way they're portrayed and the rampant theme of 'love fixes all wounds~' grates on me. I am definitely love the idea of them though, because I love imagining their potential influence on each other.
