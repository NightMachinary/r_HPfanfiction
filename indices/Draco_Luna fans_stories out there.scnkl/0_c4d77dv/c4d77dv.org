[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset]] and [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise]] over Britain are the first to spring to mind, both serious stories and classics in HPFF. Over a million words for you there. They're key characters, but it's not a Draco/Luna-centric story.

Enjoy!
