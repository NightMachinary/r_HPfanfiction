This chapter of a one-shots collection has the first task going /spectacularly/ wrong. The Hungarian Horntail gets loose and goes on a killing spree which gets Ron, Draco, a ton of other Hogwarts students, the entire Durmstrang contingent, several dragon handlers, most of Hogsmeade, the other three dragons...

Unfortunately, though, it's only the event itself that's covered in the one-shot, and there doesn't seem to be a second part with reactions.
