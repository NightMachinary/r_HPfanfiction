  Isn't Harry destined to be killed by Voldemort? Is he possessing a dragon? Cuz that would be awesome

The prophecy was worthless drivel; it only became relevant coz Voldemort, Dumbledore and then Harry tried to make it come true. It doesn't grant Harry any sort of immunity from death.

  Really though, if the first three champions who are grown adults get toasted by lesser dragons, who really has the heart to send poor little Harry out to face a Norwegian Ridgeback?

They were already using Harry as bait in the tournament and as a patsy to draw away any negative press. The organizers are quite heartless enough already. And Harry faced a Hungarian Horntail, not a Ridgeback.
