Isn't Harry destined to be killed by Voldemort? Is he possessing a dragon? Cuz that would be awesome.

I think a story where Harry wins the Triwizard Tournament by virtue of going last would also be pretty good.

Really though, if the first three champions who are grown adults get toasted by lesser dragons, who really has the heart to send poor little Harry out to face a Norwegian Ridgeback?

At that point, if they were mandated to make the Champions go through trials, surely they'd have Harry face the model of his dragon instead.
