This actually wasn't one of my favorites. All the "in the past" parts were great- which, to be fair, is like 90%+ of the fic. But all the parts where this 3000+ year old woman is hanging out with her mostly-forgotten friends that she knew for a few years in childhood just feel completely off to me. I just keep expecting there to be some dissonance where Jasmine realizes that "oh yeah, I'm not an 18-year-old anymore, and don't really know how to relate to my former friends because I'm an entirely different person now", but it never comes. She reacts just the same as she would if she had just gone on a 5-year trip. I wouldn't expect an 80-year-old to easily slot back into the lives if her 18-year-old friends, so why would a 3000-year-old?

Also, as much as I love the backstory, I really want to see the "now what". For her entire lifespan (-18 years) she can't really do anything super-crazy, because she can't affect the timeline beyond just existing and getting steered by fate into almost-forgotten history. But now, she's caught up, so she can do whatever she wants- so what does she want to do?
