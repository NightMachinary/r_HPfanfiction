  But all the parts where this 3000+ year old woman is hanging out with her mostly-forgotten friends that she knew for a few years in childhood just feel completely off to me. I just keep expecting there to be some dissonance where Jasmine realizes that "oh yeah, I'm not an 18-year-old anymore, and don't really know how to relate to my former friends because I'm an entirely different person now", but it never comes. She reacts just the same as she would if she had just gone on a 5-year trip. I wouldn't expect an 80-year-old to easily slot back into the lives if her 18-year-old friends, so why would a 3000-year-old?

It's been a while since I read it, but I didn't get that at all. To me the disconnect seemed obvious and that she was having a hard time playing the part of the person they knew.
