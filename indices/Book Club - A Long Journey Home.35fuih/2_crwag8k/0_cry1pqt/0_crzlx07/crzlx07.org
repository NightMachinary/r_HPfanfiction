I think this is how Jasmine justified her reactions and interactions, but I felt like this was a point the author pushed and pushed in an unconvincing way. Most of the historic parts of the story were really good a showing us how and why Jasmine was reacting. But I felt the author took a "telling" tone for the present-day Ron/Hermione interactions that make them less than authentic for me.
