It took me a couple of tries to read this. I didn't like the first chapter at all, and I had (and still have) certain misgivings about the story. My primary issue with the fic is the interactions between Jasmine and her old friends.

In chapter one you've got Jasmine acting overtly and deliberately mysterious, in a completely unnecessary way. This brings to mind all those arsehole indy!Harry fics where he just goes around with a massively inflated head trying to look awesome and instead just looks like a dick.

Later chapters show that Jasmine isn't a dick, but there's still a lingering problem in her interactions with Ron and Hermione. On the one hand, you find it unbelievable that she would even really care to associate with them after thousands of years of life experience, especially as she's lost all her memories of them. And conversely, assuming we take her desire to interact with them as a given, she begins to revert to chapter 1 arseholeishness when she's around them, constantly name-dropping and place-dropping in what seems like a transparent and concerted effort to look impressive and cool. Somehow, I just don't buy that someone who has lived for thousands of years, is super-rich and phenomenally powerful still cares about looking cool.

With all of that said, I absolutely love the fic lol. Jasmine's character, when not around her old friends, is absolutely fascinating. I especially enjoy the way she regularly changes identity, adopting that life completely, including taking up new speech patterns and trying out new experiences. I like that she never seems to get bored with life, even after thousands of years: the world is a huge place, full of amazing people and places and things to learn, and even with thousands of years there's still plenty for Jasmine to do. The Dumbledore and Flamel interactions were the high points of the story.

I also enjoy the historical explorations. I'm not quite as enthusiastic about the Merlin sequence as many readers, probably because I'm a bit "meh" about Arthurian legend in general, but it was without a doubt engaging, well paced, and nicely detailed.

The humour in the fic is amazing, not least because it's the type of humour that's hardest to write. It's easy to write absurdist humour, where events and characters act in crackish ways. Most fanfiction takes this route, including many of my own attempts at humour. But this fic manages to achieve a much wittier form of humour that doesn't exaggerate situations or stretch realistic. The characters just say the right things at the right times to make us laugh, with dry observations on events, understated put-downs, surprising honesty and bluntness, etc.

Aside from the interactions with Jasmine's old friends, my only real complain about the fic is the magic, which I feel lacks the HP charm, drifting instead towards a more Dungeons and Dragons type feel. Jasmine and Merlin's powers were just too "big" in terms of scale, too flashy compared to the relatively subtle nature of powerful HP magic. It also lacks the eccentric charm of the HP magic system, where beetles are easy to transfigure into buttons because their names are similar.

Nonetheless, a hugely enjoyable fic.
