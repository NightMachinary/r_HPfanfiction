Everyone seems to enjoy this story, but personally I couldn't get into it. It is also quite.. boring. And slow.

It was very hard to get into, and while it had a great plot/hook, I feel like it didn't utilize it as well as it could have.

If I were to review it unbiasedly, I'd probably give it a 3/5. The writing is solid, the plot is original and the characters are handled well. However, its incredibly slow, overly angsty and.. nothing happens. The future parts are just.. droll.
