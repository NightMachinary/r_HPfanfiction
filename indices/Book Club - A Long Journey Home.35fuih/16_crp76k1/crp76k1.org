My only complaint is that the story jumps around too much, I would much rather prefer a liner progression through the timelines, would be less confusing.

Aside from that the story is brilliant, gripping and fresh. Hardly any tropes either. This is the type of story you show to people who think Fanfiction is for teenage girls gushing over Twilight...
