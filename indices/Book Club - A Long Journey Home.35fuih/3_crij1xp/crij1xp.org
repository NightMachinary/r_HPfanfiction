A lot of people have commented on things that I also found wonderful about this fic - the Myrddin arc, the handling of Dumbledore, etc - so I'll keep my comments there to a minimum.

Certain smaller things I liked were how Jasmine let her basis in modern times influence her actions all through history. I love the idea of her missing being able to drink tea, and developing herbs and leave to steep 1000s of years before the real discovery of tea. I love how she kept The Hovel clean per modern standards. I enjoyed the idea of her memories of modern magic guiding her as she broke the magics down in order to understand and teach them.

My hope for the fic is that she is finally able to age, now that she's back in her own time. I think she deserves to be reunited with Myrddin.
