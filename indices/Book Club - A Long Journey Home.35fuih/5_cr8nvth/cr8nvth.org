I am loving "A Long Journey Home". I don't read femHarry or immortalHarry as I feel that it is stretching the source material too far - even for fanfiction - but this has opened my mind. The author has a way with words that is better than some hardbook authors out there. I'm rooting for Jasmine Potter, hope this story doesn't get abandoned.
