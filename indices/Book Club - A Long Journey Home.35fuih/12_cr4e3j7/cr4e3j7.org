This is such a good one! I absolutely loved it! The only bad thing I can say about it is that it doesn't update too often. But on the other hand it has sort of seperate arcs or smaller stories so you still get satisfaction even if the fic itself isn't finished yet. Actually this one inspired me to begin writing my similar story. It's only 5k until one and that's only the intro, but still :D
