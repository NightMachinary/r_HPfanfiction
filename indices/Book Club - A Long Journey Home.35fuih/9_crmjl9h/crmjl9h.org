I have great affection for this story, but it has a rough start. The first chapter suffers from changes of perspective, indistinct dialog cues and a sort of 'promise one thing- deliver another' let-down. It kicks off in Indiana Jones mode but the story isn't about plot developments and action-suspense shenanigans. It's a story exploring character in the extraordinary situation of being the cause of history while trying to live life out of the way of events until she can return to her starting point.

I love the character, I love the 'history' despite disruptive anachronisms. My main criticisms would be:

- that the writer has a gift for plot situations but doesn't do much more than tempt us about adventures not told; and

- that there isn't more of it.
