This particular fic holds a special spot for me. Reading this fic, and enjoying the masterfully woven tale of Myrddin that Rakeesh has written, spurred me on to write some original fiction of my own. As a result, I've read this fic numerous times and it is my top five of all fanfiction, period.

That said, it has it's issues, and I am of the opinion that most of the story that takes place in the 'present day' is rather dull and uninteresting beyond the examination in character development and psychology that we are treated to.

However, most of the complaints I've seen are directed towards the first two chapters and chapter nine. At first glance and without the context of the rest of the story, the initial chapters depict a character that is a common cliche in the fandom: Arrogant, self-possessed and nearly godlike in power. I genuinely dislike reading fics where this trope is present without a logical reason and I fully understand why this initial chapter puts people off.

That said, I'm not sure anyone has tried this, but read the story in actual chronological order. Ignoring the new piece that takes place in Mesopotamia, start with the Merlin arc and go forward. When read like this, the Jasmine we see in chapter one is a logical extension of everything that came before. She is terrified that everything she believed about who she was and the people she has idealized will turn out to be false, and covers that with an arrogance and self possession that was apparently developed over thousands of years in the Egyptian court.

All analysis aside, still a 5/5 for me.
