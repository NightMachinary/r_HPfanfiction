Genuinely a brilliant fic. The way that Harry Potter canon is slotted into Arthurian legend is nothing short of fantastic (I think there was a parallel drawn between Uther Pendragon's use of "Polyjuice" and Merope Gaunt's use of love potion, although I'll have to reread it to verify) and it certainly has a great deal of potential for more. The modern day sections, I admit, I skimmed a little- not that they weren't well-written, but they lacked the ingenuity of the past sections. Curse those sporadic updates!
