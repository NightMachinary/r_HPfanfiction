  If you've been waffling on reading this because it sounds odd, or if you tried the first chapter and didn't like it, give it a chance. There are things in the beginning that would make novice readers say "huh?" and veteran readers start seeing cliche red flags, but keep going. Give it a chance.

I pretty much read this only because you added this little suggestion at the end of your post. As a vet reader, I would definitely have turned away based on red flags, so thanks for giving me the heads up to push through!

PS edit, I'm totally taking advantage of your top 20 fic-list. I think it warrants a post (or repost) devoted to it! Such a great write-up of quality fiction would be really appreciated in this sub, especially by new readers.
