This is in my top 10 and probably my top 5 stories in the fandom. I've pretty much covered my thoughts on it in my write-up of my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjpJsBshvv5sSTHsbHQ269e3DW2ZReBH20AT7NufJYw/edit][20 top fics]]. Quoting from the relevant section:

  This isn't everyone's cup of tea - fem!Harry is a deal breaker right up front for many, and many others will get impatient at the beginning (it takes its time setting the hook). But those who jump ship early, or pass this one up without giving it a chance are missing out. It's intricately, lovingly constructed, there's room to endlessly expand, and the characters are rich and full of life. The origin of Merlin arc, just by itself, would probably make this list as a short story. And the September, 1964 section with Dumbledore trying to track down Morgana is just... beautiful. Speaking of tough characters to write... a good, cheerfully meddlesome, inscrutable, good-intentioned Dumbledore is hard to write, and Rakeesh hit it out of the park in this one. I found myself wanting more at the end, and that may or may not happen, but this one is good enough that you're just happy there's as much as there is. We're getting into can't-miss territory here.

This is one of only a handful of fics that I feel personal connection to - the writing style, humor, and characterization just make my socks roll up and down.

If you've been waffling on reading this because it sounds odd, or if you tried the first chapter and didn't like it, give it a chance. There are things in the beginning that would make novice readers say "huh?" and veteran readers start seeing cliche red flags, but keep going. Give it a chance. This one sneaks up on you and gets really, really good.
