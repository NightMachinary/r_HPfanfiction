I didn't like it. It's hard to put my finger on why I didn't. It seems like a wish fulfillment story with a Mary Sue lead. Powerful, ancient, created the magical world, rich as hell, cultured, clever, beautiful. I don't think the author created a suitable disconnect between Jasmine and her childhood friends. I don't "buy" Jasmine's feelings of being out of place and out of time.

It would have been much more interesting to me, if Jasmine lived a long life, but not so long that she ever made it back to her childhood years.
