Rahkesh's Myrddin quickly became on of my favorite characters in the fandom. I loved that part of the story arc.

I also thought he handled the reintegration into Weasley family dynamics very well, and his dumbledore was absolutely perfect. Caring, kind, and we'll intentioned, however curious beyond anything else. Perfect.
