I'm similar in that I can't handle name changes at all. The funny thing is that most Harry's in most fanfics are just OC named Harry..... and I'm absolutely ok with that. But the moment the name is changed it just breaks the immersion for me. Ironic right?

In general I usually associate Henry/Hadrian with bad quality stories. Similar to "I'm not your boy Dumbledore" trope.

Not sure why writers do this, but they probably think it adds prestige to Harry or something
