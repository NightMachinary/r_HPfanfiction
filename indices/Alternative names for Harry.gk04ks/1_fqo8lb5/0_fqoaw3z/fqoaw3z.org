Its not so much that the name changes bother me (unless he's called Hadrianus), its more that I just didn't understand why. I understand why his official name might be Harrison and he just goes by Harry to his friends, but I just don't understand the reasoning behind the others.

I do agree though that I am starting to see a pattern in that Hadrian fanfics seem to be overpowered as fuck Harry and somehow the heir to Houses Potter, Black, and Slytherin.
