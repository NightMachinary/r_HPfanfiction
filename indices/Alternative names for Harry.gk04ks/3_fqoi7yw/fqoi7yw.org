Agree with all of these. Usually a sign of a specific type of fic where all purebloods/nobility have outrageously long names.

I've also seen it used in severitus fics or fics where Harry's identity is changed, i.e. if he gets adopted or finds out his dad isn't who he thought it was. Then the name change represents the change in his identity.
