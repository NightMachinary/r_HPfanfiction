Hermione is Muggleborn. Then there are pureblood wizards called extremely normal names like Ronald, Fred, George, Charles, William, Arthur, Molly, Marcus, Gregory, Vincent, James, Ernie, Hannah, Frank, Alice... and those are just from the Sacred 28.

Harry doesn't sound bad at all in any accent, btw. That's just your opinion.
