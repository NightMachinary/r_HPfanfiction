For most of us, Harry isn't fun to say. In any accent for the English language it doesn't really sound good to the ear. It's also not very magical-sounding when most other characters have names like Unctious, Cantakerous, Hermione, and Hepzibah.

Usually it's a diminutive of another name irl. So it can be a nickname for: Harold, Henry, Haraldr, Hadrian, Harrison, Horatio, Harriet, Henrietta, Hari, Harri, and many others which are all variations of Harry from different countries. Some people just have certain preferences.

A lot of fics just give a new name entirely, that isn't connected to "Harry" at all. It's a name of a fictional character. It's not enough to get snippy with people over. You wouldn't believe the amount of people who will attack you over having his birth name be something else even if his nickname is still Harry.
