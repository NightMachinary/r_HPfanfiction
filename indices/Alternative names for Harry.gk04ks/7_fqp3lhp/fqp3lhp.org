The only time changing the name of Male Harry makes sense to me is if A: It's a fic where he doesn't know his own name because the Dursleys left him at the Orphanage instead of taking him in or someone adopted him from the doorstep of Privet Drive. B: He's in hiding for insert reason here and doesn't want to be found by Britain, and C: He's the Reincarnation of someone and uses their name instead due to having no real attachment to the name Harry Potter in his formative years but having the memories of the Reincarnation character. Example: He's the reincarnation of Itachi, has Itachi's memories as a kid, and remembers a whole life as Itachi, he'd identify with the name Itachi before Harry.

Though if you name Harry after an Emperor, Nero Claudius Potter > Hadrianus Potter. Especially if Harry happens to secretly be a Saberface.

Female Harry is always a freaking flower name though. I prefer it when Female Harry gets named after a badass witch. Circe Potter, Medea Potter, Morgana Potter, a ridiculous badass from History or something.
