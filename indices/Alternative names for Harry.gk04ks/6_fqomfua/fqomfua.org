IF you asked why, I'd have said because every moron and/or child is free to write and post fanfics, but since you asked for a reason I'll have to say there are three that I've seen.

First one basically boils down to "the name Harry isn't cool enough."

Second one is "I've seen Harry was called abc in the fic xyz and I liked it so much I'm doing the same."

And the third one simply is "I'm the author and I can, so I did, for no reason other than I could."
