Hadrian is a sign you are reading a most likely poorly wriiten fanfic where harry is a purebood lord amd the story likely has all the same tropes those kind of stories rely on. I do not read a story if I see the name Hadrian.

In this fandom whenever a story gets popular there is usually a gilion copy cat fics of it. That's where the Lord Hadrian Potter Black Every House comes from,

Welcome to the fandom tho
