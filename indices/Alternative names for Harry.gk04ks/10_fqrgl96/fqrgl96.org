There's a lot of Hadrian haters out there. I see it as a case of somebody trying to go with JKR's "pretentious wizarding names" theme. But Aunt Petunia was quoted in canon referring to Harry as a "nasty, common name," thus implying that his name is actually just plain Harry.

Now, if we're going into the concept of Harry going into hiding and changing his name, then any derivative of Harry is a silly mistake. A false name should be nothing like your real name. Hermione may think wizards have no logic, but even they would be suspicious of James Evans when Harry Potter disappears.
