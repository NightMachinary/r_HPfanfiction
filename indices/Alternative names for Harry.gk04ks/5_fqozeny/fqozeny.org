Pureblood wank. Usually teenagers writing wish fulfilment fics of what things they think are posh and sophisticated. Reversing the point of the books entirely, which is that blood doesn't matter, they instead choose to make Harry the person who has the bluest blood imaginable. Hadrian is apparently an appropriate name, though how it's abbreviated to Harry is anyone's guess

Harry is at least an actual nickname for Henry, which unlike Harrison is a normal British name, so that gets a pass from me. Very few fics choose Henry, though, because apparently it's not posh enough either - despite being the name of 8 kings of England and one of the current princes
