some of them do it because 'Harry' is a) usually a nickname and b) seems kinda dull compared to other names in the wizarding world, if some of the more...creative attempts are anything to go by. Hell, I was reading through a particular authors work just last week and they use a different name every time, each a tad more ridiculous than the last.\\
Not a fan of Hadrian, myself. Henry or Harrison? Eh. fine. Hadrian? Ugh. It's not even that good of a name.

(maybe Hadrianus was the authors attempt to make it more latin sounding?)
