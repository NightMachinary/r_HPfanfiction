My fic has the DA as emphatically not Dumbledore's Army. (They're jokingly calling it the Dragon Army instead.) It also has Harry vs: Dumbledore, The Ministry, Voldemort, and several other factions. He's certainly building up a real army right now, but until he can fight everyone at once, he's trying to avoid attention. Poor Harry though , 'Potter Luck' is a thing in my fic.
