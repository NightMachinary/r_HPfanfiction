"I see you've found the Mirror of Erised," Grandpa Albus suddenly materializes out of nowhere behind me. The razor clatters to the bathroom floor tiled floor with a resounding echo not quite loud enough to diguise the... manly shriek I emit.

"Um. Hi Grandpa. Didn't see you there."

"The Mirror of Erised has a way of consuming our attention," he nods sagely at the bathroom mirror. A beard of white shaving cream and a long white beard reflecting side by side.

"That and you were invisible," I mutter under my breath as I examine my chin for cuts.... and hairs....

"I've been watching you for quite a few days now-"

"What?!"

"-And while wiser men than you have succumbed to the temptations of the Mirror of Erised, I urge you to not allow yourself to obsess over what you see. It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live."

"It's not a dream. There's really facial hair there, I swear. It's just taking me a bit of time to locate it, that's all."

"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow-"

"What?! You're taking away my bathroom mirror?! I can barely keep the mop on my head under control with a mirror, never mind brushing it blindly! Is this because I didn't thank you for your Christmas gift yet? I'm grateful. I really am, Grandpa. It's a lovely jacket-"

"Invisibility cloak," he corrects wisely.

"Right. Invisibility cloak," I agree hurriedly. "Can't even tell it's me with the hood drawn up. The point is, I didn't thank you, because you didn't sign it. I thought you were going for the whole Santa Claus thing. And even though Hermione told me Santa isn't real, I didn't want to ruin your fun. But I really am grateful for the... Invisibilty cloak. Please don't take away my mirror!" I beg from the bottom of my prepubescent heart.

"I understand, Harry. It's difficult to part ways from the Mirror of Erised. After all, how could we not want to keep our deepest desires close? Here, have a lemon drop. Let's discuss this calmly."

"Er, I just brushed my teeth... I was getting ready to go to sleep actually..."

"What do you see when look in the mirror, my dear boy?" Grandpa Albus asks as he plops down onto the toilet seat and pops a lemon drop into his mouth.

"Errr..."

"Perhaps, you see yourself with the loving family you have never known?," he watches me sympathetically.

I glance awkwardly at the mirror again. Where I can see both myself and Grandpa sitting behind me. "Um... I see my family...." I answer tentatively. I'm sensing another uncomfortable orphan speech, where my Grandpa tells me I have no living relatives left...What we do for family, ey? Entertaining their notions that they don't exist.

"I see my loving family," I affirm more confidently. "What do you see Grandpa?" I ask in return. And it feels like our own little secret handshake for 'I love you's. I smile affectionately at his reflection, and imagine him smiling at mine.

Grandpa Albus nods solemnly: "I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."

​....

"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People insist on giving me books."

...Right... So he didn't like the gift I got him for Christmas either...
