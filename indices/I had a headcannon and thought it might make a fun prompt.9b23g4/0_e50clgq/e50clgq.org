"Back from another training?" Ron asked, fixing Harry with a knowing look.

"Yes. Today was the story about the orphanage again." Harry sighed, sinking into the common room's couch. "You'd think with exams in the next few weeks Healer Bridgeworth would try and contain him, but it seems he's reliving something he doesn't want to talk about. This is the fourth orphanage story in as many weeks."

Hermione looked up from her essay, chewing on the end of her quill thoughtfully. "Has he told you the name of the orphanage?"

"No, not yet," Harry admitted, pulling out his Defense textbook. "Why?"

"Well what if the orphanage was a building he couldn't save during the Final Battle?" she countered. "Or maybe he had friends who worked there and they were killed somehow? You know there was a lot of devastation in Muggle London during the Battle."

"Do you reckon he should try and drag it out of his granddad?" Ron asked, pausing in his own schoolwork to look at his friends. "If it's that traumatic..."

"Maybe," Harry said, shrugging. "In any case, I have got to study for this DADA exam. Maybe if we had a decent History teacher we'd know the significance of the orphanage. You'd think Professor McGonagall or Snape would know."

Hermione nodded and returned to her parchment, scribbling in the margins.

"What, is that draft number three?" Ron teased, flinging a Bertie Bott's bean at her pile of books.

"Sod off, Ron," Hermione groused, flinging it back to him without looking up.

Well, slightly out of character, I think, but here's a quick stab at it. I hope someone enjoys! (This has not been Brit-picked.)
