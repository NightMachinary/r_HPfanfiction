I think the problem there is that they slap genre-savy on TOP of some (or multiple) ridiculous power-ups. I'd immagine a Harry who has no OTHER abilities but genre saviness. And of course, just because you know the genre you are in doesn't mean that EVERYTHING is foreseeable. After all, not all "Children boarding school stories" have the exact same plot and tropes.
