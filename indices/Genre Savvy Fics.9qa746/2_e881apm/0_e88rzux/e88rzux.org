Eh, the reason I said I'd prefer a non-main character (of the meta, not of the fic necessarily) is that I've read a few OP harry fics that flirt with this (usually as a 'my all-powerful harry who sweats diamonds and shits gold also knows the meta of the story he is in! Isn't he so OP?' Ugh.) I think the Gamer! ones like to do this.

And honestly, Harry coming into the world Genre-savvy would be less interesting than someone coming upon it in later years.
