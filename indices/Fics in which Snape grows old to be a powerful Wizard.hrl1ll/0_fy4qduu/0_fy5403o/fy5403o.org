Several LESS fics have this -- the idea being that a Snape that didn't end up with the Death Eaters would likely have used his remarkable Potions and spell creation abilities for the good of the Wizarding World instead if being stuck first with Voldemort and later with Dumbledore.

I could link you one, but IMO all of the fics that do this are fics with the ship that aren't very good (for unrelated reasons).

It's much rarer in postwar fics (gen or not), which I think is plausible enough -- basically with him tired of the war just want to be left alone with a Potions business or something.
