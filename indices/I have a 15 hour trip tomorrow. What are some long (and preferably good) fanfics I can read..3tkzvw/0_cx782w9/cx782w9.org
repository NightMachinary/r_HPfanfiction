Ooooh, you mentioned Worm fics. So, warning to people, I will later be recommending Worm fics, and the reasoning behind those may include spoilers to the main Worm story. If you've read it, congratulations on finding one of the best pieces of fiction on the internet, if you haven't, go check it out now!

But because this is HPfanfiction, I'll start by recommending linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). It's half a million words, and while it's very different from the books, I find it rather interesting, There's intrigue, strategy, and while Harry is still the protagonist, a lot of the cast are OCs.

Now, onto Worm Fanfiction.

If you haven't already read it, drop the entire trip until you're finished with Cenotaph and its sequels. Its so good that many people (myself included) were of the belief that several aspects of it was from canon, until it was pointed out in some thread that it actually wasn't. Notes, the author, is hands-down one of the best people at writing Taylor. I cannot recommend this enough.

Another very good fic that you should have read already, but I'll mention it just in case, is Copacetic by Materia-Blade. It features Taylor after Gold Morning, trying to find peace. Yeah, that's not going to happen. Here, the cape life chose her.

Alchemical Solutions by Gromweld is a truly massive quest over on SV (some of it is on SB too, but I'm unsure if it's still being updated there). To give an idea of how large it is, a chapter was recently uploaded to the story only thread, and it was /26k words long./ In addition to that, it's very well-written, and features some truly hilarious things that occurs naturally when quests are run on SV. It's a crossover with Exalted, but it can easily be enjoyed without knowledge of it. I didn't know anything about it when I started reading it, and I fell in love with it quickly.

Amelia by TanaNari is certainly long, and while I liked it, it can drag on at times. From what I've heard, a lot of people dislike it, partly because there's a lot of power creeping, but I like the character interaction and believable munchkining.

One of my favourite fics of all time is Weaver Nine. The premise is that Taylor and Jack Slash switched places - Taylor and Harbinger were the ones to murder King, while Jack is now Jacob Hebert. It might just have the greatest battle ever written in worm fanfiction.

Butcher's Bill is rather short compared to the other fics here (just 30k words), but it has a fairly interesting premise - namely that Butcher XIV is allergic to bees, which results in Taylor becoming the new Butcher, causing her to change her game plans utterly. There's another Butcher!Taylor story called Carnage by TheMAnWithaPlan, but I believe that its dead and buried. Both are good, and they don't really overlap.

Here be Dragons by Ryuugi is another of those fics I think that every Worm fan should have read, but again, I'll mention if on the off-chance that you haven't. Features Taylor with Lung's power and... well, let's just that things escalate, as they just tend to do around Taylor. It's only medium length, but it... ends, technically, but it is a very open ending that unfortunately hasn't received a sequel yet. It's also one of the fics that makes me hesitant to say that Weaver Nine has the best fight hands-down.

Another good Ryuugi fic is Zenith, which is, unfortunately, unfinished. It's a crossover with Exalted, but you don't need to know about it to enjoy it, as with Alchemical Solutions. Taylor becomes an "Exalted" - I'm still not sure what it means exactly, but she gets a very good powerset - after the Golden Morning and uses her new powers to influence the world in a better way. It's pretty awesome.

From what I can tell, a lot of people don't like Ack's stuff, and while I haven't checked out the stuff he posts on QQ, I read most of what he posts on SB. While most of it doesn't qualify for long, his story Recoil has about 250k words, and still unfinished. He's got some other stuff, with my personal favorites at the moment being Hostage Situation, Wyvern, Alea Iacta Est, and Another Way.

Maharal by joethirteen has Golem from a few months after Golden Morning sent back to the 1990s, with him eventually becoming part of the Chicago Wards. Plenty of awesomeness, but the character interactions are also very good.

There's probably things I missed, but that should last you for hours, if not days. :)

Also, I've got a question of my own. How much would you lose out on when reading To Be a Queen if you haven't read FSN? If it outranks Dire Worm, which is one of my all-time favorite fics, it's gotta be good.
