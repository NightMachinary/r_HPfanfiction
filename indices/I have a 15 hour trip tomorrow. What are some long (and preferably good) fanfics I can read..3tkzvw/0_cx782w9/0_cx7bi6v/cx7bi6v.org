I don't think that you'd lose out on that much if you haven't watched Fate/Stay Night. Personally I'd recommend that you watch Fate/Zero instead because it's got great action sequences and better characters than Fate/Stay Night. But regardless, neither of them are all that necessary.

All you really need to know for the fic is Gilgamesh's powers and personality. Over his time as a real person he collected tons and tons of treasures, from swords to armor to a potion that turns you into a kid. His power is to summon anything in his vaults whenever he wants. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bWJ6FKPakM][Here's]] him fighting berserker in Fate/Zero. It should clarify things if I messed up my explanation.

Edit: Admittedly my views of the fic may be a bit rose tinted since I think Gilgamesh is the greatest character to ever character, but it should still a fun read.
