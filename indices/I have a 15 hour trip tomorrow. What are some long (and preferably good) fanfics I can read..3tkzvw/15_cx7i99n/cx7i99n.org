A favorite of mine is Fate's Gamble (Harry Potter/Fate/Stay Night Crossover), it's just short of a million words, but whether or not it's good is up to you. As I don't feel I have any ability to summarize it without spoiling it I'll just say this, it was good enough that people write fanfiction about this story, there are two repositories for Omakes about it that are each over 300k words and at the very least two different smutfics about it, although the story itself lacks anything in the terms of smut within. linkffn(9586702)
