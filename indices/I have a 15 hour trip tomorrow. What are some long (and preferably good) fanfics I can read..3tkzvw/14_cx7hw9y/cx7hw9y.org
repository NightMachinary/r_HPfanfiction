I really hope you've read the entire Alexandra Quick series so far. It does get better after the first book, and the fourth book is my favourite fic in all of the HP fandom.

Other than that, I strongly suggest, based on what fics you /have/ read, linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool). It's not ultra-long, only about 77k words, but it's hilarious and clever and beautifully written and makes all sorts of allusions to other works that only magnify its glory. linkffn(Shadow Walks) is also pretty good, and again, it's not overly long (around 84k words) but it's Harmony /without the bashing and character derailment./ A fic that I nearly always rec that's on the longer side is linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) - it's about 150k words, the pairing is an unusually well-written Bellatrix/Hermione, and it's gut-wrenching (in the good way).

If you don't mind Avatar: The Last Airbender fics, there is one that's astoundingly good that I should probably rec. linkffn(Retroactive by loopy777) is a FANTASTIC fic that is really interesting to read, and 190k words long.
