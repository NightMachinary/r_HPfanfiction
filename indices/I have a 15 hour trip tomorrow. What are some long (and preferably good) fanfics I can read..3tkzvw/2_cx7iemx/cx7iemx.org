Well this list got larger than I expected. C'est La Vie and HP & BWL are my personal favorite fics. Rent-A-Hero and Fallen God are my favorite that are frequently updated.

linkffn(Out of the Dark and into the Green) Harry lives with an old man in a forest, no slash. Goes to Hogwarts years late.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) Harry gets pulled into an alternate dimension to help with their Voldemort problem. He is not happy about it. Divination Harry is a lot of fun.

linkffn(A Fallen God) Loki ends up a disembodied spirit and latches on to Harry since he already had a parasite. Humor later on is great, story moves quickly.

linkffn(Just Another Orphan) Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry is just another orphan. Slytherin Harry.

linkffn(In Bad Faith) A fanfiction dies and wakes up as... Draco's sister. I can't make this sound appealing no matter how hard I try. Just read it.

Fate offers Harry a chance at a new life and he wakes up at a 14 year old transfer student to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

linkffn(Growing Up Black) Recognized by a squib businessman of house Black, Harry is taken from Private drive and raised as Sirius' son.

linkffn(Broken Chains) Following Sirius through the veil Harry finds himself long long ago, in a galaxy far far away. Then he comes back. Sith Harry.

linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) The Dursleys abandon Harry near the woods. He lives in the trees and does magic. That means he's an elf.
