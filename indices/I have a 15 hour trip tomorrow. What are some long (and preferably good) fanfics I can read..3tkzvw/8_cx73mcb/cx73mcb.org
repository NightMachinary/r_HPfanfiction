*Roundabout Destiny*, linkffn(8311387): Hermione travelled back in time and was reborn as Hermione Potter, fixed up several well known "bad guys", and made things a lot better.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): it's one of my favorite HP fanfics. Harry and his three girls make an intelligent and powerful (but not overpowered) team.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), a Harry/Bellatrix story. I was very skeptical at start, but thought to give it a try based on 9000+ favorites. Now it has become one of my favorite HP fanfics. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650): Another one of my favorite. It's a very emotional story with excellent writing.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*: linkffn(10595005), pairs Harry/Hermione as ruthless politicians/revolutionaries. Bloodthirsty and vindictive readers will like it.
