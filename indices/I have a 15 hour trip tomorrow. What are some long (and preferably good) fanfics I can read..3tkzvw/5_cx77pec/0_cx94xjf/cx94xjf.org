This is an excellent story, and I second the recommendation if you've ever played Pokemon or watched the anime.

If you're open to other Pokemon fic recs, linkffn(Pedestal by Digital Skitty) takes a short while to get started but it's really good - and complete as well. There's a few weird spots where the author has randomly inserted crap (I think these were meant to be April Fools chapters at the time) but other than that it's one of the best-written and most entertaining stories I've read, and unlike most Pokemon stories it's not about becoming teh sooper hax0rs l33t trainer who wins every fight.
