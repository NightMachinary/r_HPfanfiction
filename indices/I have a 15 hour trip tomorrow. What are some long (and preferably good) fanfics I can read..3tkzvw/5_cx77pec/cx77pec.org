Hm, these may not be your cup of tea, but here are some good ones I recently read, all found on FFN

*Vitam Paramus* - TheEndless7 (200k+)

- Harry/Gabrielle. Very slow paced, but really in depth characterization. Doesn't really have much to do with magic , but it is one of my favorite reads on a friday with white wine and blankets.

*Team 8* - S'Tarkan (200k+)

- Naruto AU where he is on... Team 8 (with Hinata!! squeals) Sometimes explanation of certain character decisions is a bit cop-outy but not actually too bothering, and I say this as a reader with very strict requirements in regards to writing. I'm in the middle of this one.

*Game of Champions* - L. Lamora (120k)

- Unique pokemon storytelling. Haven't read any other pokemon fics that I've liked really.

*Ice and Fire* - AlSmash (350k+)

- Code Geass AU. Read this a long time ago but I remembered liking it a lot, but maybe I was influenced by shipping and youth. If this doesn't work out for you I think some of the ones with a high favorite count are good though.

*Coffee Girl* - Peacewish (42k)

- Yugioh, Seto/Serenity. Cute, cliched, and probably very flawed, but it was also written in 2004 and I love it because it was one of the first fics I've read. If you like fluff :)

I didn't like Wastelands or AQ, but I loved Worm, so who knows. No Mary Sues in the first 3 for sure. Also check the Gen Rec thread, though personally I found a lot of the fics there to not really be that great. I might update with some more fics to help you out, 15 hours is a lot.
