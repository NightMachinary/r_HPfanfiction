  Firstly thank you for reading the story. Secondly, critique is welcome flames are not. If anyone wants to leave a flame or like that leave it with an account (so I can return the favour with interest) or name or a BIG MIDDLE FINGER TO YOU, NOW BE A NICE COWARD, CRAVEN ASSHOLE AND USE YOUR MIDDLE ONE TO F*** YOURSELF.
