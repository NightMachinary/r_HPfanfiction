a) that question is asked every other day, so you should find plenty of stuff if you search for it.

b) I just gonna quote myself from the last thread:

#+begin_quote
  linkffn(Euphoria) is propably the best Harry/Fleur fic that is focused on the romance. Albeit the start of the story feels a bit too close to canon, the grade of divergence increases with the time and the romance between the two is simply beliveable, something most Harry/Fleur fics are missing.

  linkffn(Wastelands of time) is an extremly well written AU wich has a Harry/Fleur pairing, which however is never the focus, not even in the sequel heartlands where the pairing becomes a bit more important.

  Than there is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][jeconais Hope]]which is decent if one does not have a problem with overly fluffy stories.

  That pretty much where the really good ones. Else I can "recommend" linkffn(The British Reformation) is not completly terrible, but the moral choice done in this fic are hilariously retarded. linkffn(What You Leave Behind) does not feature H/F yet, but has promised to to so in the future - if the fic will ever continue, that is.

And if you search for smut [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me AKA: I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man (revised)]].

edit: Take note that Hope is Harry/Gabrielle.
