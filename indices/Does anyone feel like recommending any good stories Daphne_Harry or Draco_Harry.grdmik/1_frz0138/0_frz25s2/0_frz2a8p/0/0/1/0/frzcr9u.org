Well I don't know if you already do something like this but if I read a story I like I then look at the other stories the author wrote that contains the same pairing i.e., Harry/Daphne that i'm currently reading or the same genre (say marriage law fics or time travel etc). If the author says that the fic was inspired by some other fic I check that out.

I then look at the Authors that writer likes or the stories he likes (whichever is smaller, though i'll go back to look at the larger). I check those out to see if they have stories that match the pairing or genre I'm currently on or the summary of a story sounds interesting. If I like that story then I check out the other stories and pairings from that "recommended" author/story. And then quite frankly I just rinse and repeat.

My thought is if I like a particular author's story then there is a good chance I will also like the authors and stories that that writer likes. Now it doesn't always hold true but for the most part it has. Which has allowed me to expand the numbers of stories and authors I've read. Basically it's a noninvasive method of getting story recommendations.
