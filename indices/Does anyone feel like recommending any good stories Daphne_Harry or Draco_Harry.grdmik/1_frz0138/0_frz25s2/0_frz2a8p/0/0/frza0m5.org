Ah but what your hoping is that the person that is making the recommendation likes the same thing as you do and evaluates the stories the way you would. Otherwise, you get the "I really liked this Harry/Daphne story and you read it and think it's garbage".

Speaking of that you can try this story. Harry Potter and the Betrothal Contract by James Spookie.

The Bonding by LRThunder

For a post war harem/coven story that starts with Harry willingly marrying Luna and being tricked (by old magic laws) into marrying Daphne (who he does like) you can try Witches of Westfield by E J Daniel. It even has Harry being friendly with Draco.

If you want a little variation here is a Harry/Astoria story. Family - It's in the Blood by mjimeyg
