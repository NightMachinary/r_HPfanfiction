You know, I've seen one fanfic with Ron and Draco(in a throwaway scene), another with Ron and Millicent Bulstrode, but I've yet to read a Harry/Ron fic. Not that I'd actually go looking for it. Not really interested in it.

Well, back to the topic at hand. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Dragon-Chronicles-1-Muggle-Raised-Champion][/Dragon Chronicles: Muggle-Raised Champion/]] is Harry/Daphne.
