You mean mistakes in the writing style or in the tone of the story? Cause the main selling point for me in the original was exactly that Harry was only a hero by his own viewpoint and when he tries his indy shit it just backfires in progressively worse ways while when we see how the other characters see things it seem kind off obvious that it's Harry who is overreacting and going overboard with the tinfoil helmet and armor.
