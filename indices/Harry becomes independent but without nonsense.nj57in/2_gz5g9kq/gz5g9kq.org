That's one huge ask. I don't think the fic you're looking for exists. Just finding complete fics without kid politicians is hard enough, but no power wank or harems either? How about your own pet unicorn while were at it...

Actually, this one might be close linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them)

No riches, no 'kewl' powers, no romance and definitely no politics. It's even complete. The problem is that while Harry is definitely independent; lives alone, doesn't let anyone tell him what to do, is easily competent enough to be able to do his own thing, he ISN'T 'independent!' Harry by any stretch...
