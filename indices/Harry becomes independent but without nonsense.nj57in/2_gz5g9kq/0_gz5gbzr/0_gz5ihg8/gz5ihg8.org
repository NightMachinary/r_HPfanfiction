independent!Harry is cool (according to fourteen year olds), he probably has custom robes, a wand holster and maybe a tricked out suitcase that he could live in if he wanted to. But probably doesn't because he also has his own mansion.

Despite his frequent douchiness, people generally like idependent!Harry, he seems to rapidly become fast friends with a lot of people a surprisingly large number of whom are rich snobby purebloods.

independent!Harry eats his wheaties, goes jogging and practices magic every morning. This regimen is so effective that 3 weeks after he starts his new training montage, he can simultaneously defeat multiple competent adult wizards in a sorcerous duel.

Plain old independent Harry has control over his life, which is pretty impressive given that he's only a child.
