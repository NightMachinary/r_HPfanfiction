  I had my fill and got sick and tired of muggle-wanking very early on, so not only do I prefer to focus on stories with as little muggle influence as possible but also actively try to forget those

Same. I've never been interested in a muggle-wank. They are just soo ugh. Like why the heck would I care about anything muggle or their ways when we have a whole world of magic to be explored. I love magical world, world building fics, but good ones are hard to come by or they haven't been updated or been abandoned

Yeah I've read all of Taure stuff at this point who hasn't. I'd just wish Taure would update frequently but we cannot rush the genius, so I will be impatiently waiting and grateful that we have great fan fiction writers that like to write what I love to read.
