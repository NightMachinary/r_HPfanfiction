A couple, try to rec a few of the least well-known stories that I feel need some more love whenever the subject shows up. From the top of my head “Harry gets motivated” on ffn is hardly discussed but has the best training montage I've ever seen, “A Wizard's guide to Banking” is very cool, “The Closer you Look” and “prodigal delinquent” are both excellent portrayals of an overpowered, chaotic neutral Harry who is still a kid and /acts/ as such; “Prediction, no thank you!” is my go to for a wholesome story about personal growth and friendship while the “Mischief Heir” series by Mad_Faerie on AO3 (while with hints of bashing that thankfully never go too far) is one I read every time I feel like reading about some good space exploration along with the first 3/4 give or take from Darth Mars' “Invencible” and of course there is also “To Conquer” (crossover with Stargate, SG1 if I'm not mistaken) and pretty much everything ever written by Taure... really, tons of suggestions depending on the subject, naturally won't really be of any help in other cases, I had my fill and got sick and tired of muggle-wanking very early on, so not only do I prefer to focus on stories with as little muggle influence as possible but also actively try to forget those, the same for classical Edgy/Indy!Harry (classical 'cause there are sometimes diamonds in the rough which are worth reading) with the added problem of them just kind off blending together. Also really not interested in angst, if I want to feel bad about life I just have google what is the new disaster the president of my country is trying to put us into.
