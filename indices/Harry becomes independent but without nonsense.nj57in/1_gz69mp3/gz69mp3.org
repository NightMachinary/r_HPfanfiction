Closest I can think of from the top of my head is “The Hidden Kingdom” which started with this premise with Harry basically moving out to a nearby empty field as a kid and essentially using DIY stuff and a part time job to live on, he was a bit overly mature but up to the point it was abandoned there was zero talk or even interest in politics whatsoever (plus Gringotts was just a place where you could get a vault to keep your stuff instead of some super op government building, which is always nice). Regarding the actual story mechanics it was also surprisingly realistic, like, I can actually see a smart and resourceful kid doing those kind of things -not without reason, mind you, but with the kind of situation he was in and his available resources it wouldn't be impossible. The only nod to nobility was actually just a really cool and inconsequential bit of family history in which they were descendants from the last king of the English dynasty preceding the current one, even if he wanted to (which he doesn't) he couldn't really do anything with this knowledge, the Potters themselves made sure no one outside the family would know and the only real thing it changed was that every Potter had the first name of someone from the royal family, eg. Harry=Henry, James, Charlus=Charles... so basically just a nice bit of world building.
