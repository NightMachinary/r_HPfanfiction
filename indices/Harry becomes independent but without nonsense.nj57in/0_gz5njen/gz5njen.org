I know a couple of fics like that - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11692854/1/Bolt-Fashion][Bolt Fashion]] (Harry is an entrepreneur) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]] (Harry is more proactive, and he researches and learns magic just to rebuild his house. Literally). It's been a long time since I read them, but they're some of my most favourite fics in the fandom.
