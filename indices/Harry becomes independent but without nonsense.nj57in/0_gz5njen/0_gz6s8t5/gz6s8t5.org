I adore The House of Potter Rebuilt. It opens with Harry cleverly noticing that Ron has a lot of chocolate frog cards for someone without a lot of money. Where did the cards come from? Manipulative!Dumbledore? Chemtrails? Bill Gates' vaccine microchips? Then it's revealed that older family members passed down their collections and the entire rest of the fic is about Harry studying architecture. It's the inverse of the usual normal fic interrupted by Goblin Blood Testâ„¢ idiocy.
