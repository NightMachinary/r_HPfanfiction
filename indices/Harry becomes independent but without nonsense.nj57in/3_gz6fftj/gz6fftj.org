Linkffn(Sing a requiem) is my, rather odd, recommendation for "Harry becomes independent".

This independence is initially rather unwilling on Harry's part; forced on him by Hermione and Ron but Harry's growth and eventual independence is really touching. Romance plays a small part. And this fic starts sometime in sixth year.
