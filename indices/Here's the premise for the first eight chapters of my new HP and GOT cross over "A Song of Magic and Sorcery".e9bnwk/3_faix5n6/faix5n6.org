Erm... Okay. So. So. There's a lot to unpack here.

First: "Westeros is in my story a magical continent created by the Children of the Forest. It is connected to Greenland and the Northern Easternmost tip of Africa." That's A HELL of a large continent that you're going to have to explain away without using a fidelius consider that's like, a huge portion of the Atlantic ocean.

Second, your going to need to set up more backstory to explain how the two works are merged. Most HPxGoT stories are set in the GoT universe for a reason OR are just the characters in Hogwarts. There's something to be sad about jumping into a story but in this case, your going to have to establish your setting.

Also, this is a large change with Arya being Lyanna's daughter... Are you still planning on R+L=J? if so, again: you need to explain your changes other than you just like it that way.

Lastly, you need to figure out how Westeros magic works in the HP-world. A large complaint most readers have about these crossovers is that HP magic is clearly more versatile than Westeros magic. It's a solid concern that unless you write in reasons why your characters are as powerful as they are our what their abilities are, you'll be able to stomp over the First Men characters even with their greensight, the warning, etc.

Anyway; it's an interesting premise. Feel free to send a PM or reply if you want to talk more. Best of luck!
