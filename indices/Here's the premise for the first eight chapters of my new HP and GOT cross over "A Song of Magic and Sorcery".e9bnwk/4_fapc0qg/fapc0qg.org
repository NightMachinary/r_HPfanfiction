So I saw the map you posted on thecitadel and was confused, reading this just adds more questions. Without even incorporating the Harry Potter technology or abilities the placement of your continents greatly changes the make up of Westeros. With no narrow sea the east coast will have lost much of its wealth since trade routes are now much longer the north however has a nearby trading partner with Canada so they will be much more prosperous than in canon. The distance from essos to Westeros and having Africa in between also makes those plots eventually moving to Westeros difficult.

With Harry Potter tech and abilities Westeros has to be fundamentally different non magical and magical transportation from hp would be earth shattering the Westeros. I think there are some kinks you need to workout before starting the story or your plot will suffer when it seems like your ignoring established abilities for no reason other than to make your story work
