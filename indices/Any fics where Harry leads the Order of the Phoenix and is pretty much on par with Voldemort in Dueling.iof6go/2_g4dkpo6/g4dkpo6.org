YES there is a really good one by TAURE I think where Harry gets Dumbledore's memories and skills and takes over the Order and it's super wholesome and great because everyone is so supportive of him and relieved he got "special training" and it's so great because there is NO STUPID BASHING ANYWHERE!!!! :) :) :) :) :) OR NEEDLESS DUMBASS DRAMA OR CONFLICT IN THE ORDER!

BUT IT ONLY HAS 4 FUCKING CHAPTERS! :( :( :( :( :( So that's super sad. :(
