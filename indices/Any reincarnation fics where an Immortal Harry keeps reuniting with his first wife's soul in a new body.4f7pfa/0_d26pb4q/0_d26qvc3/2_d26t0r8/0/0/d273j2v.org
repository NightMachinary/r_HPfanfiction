Hah! My personal favorite story is a Bleach/Highschool DxD crossover. I guess it's something you'd expect, but the difficulty of getting the two backgrounds meshed together without defaulting to getting sucked into a dimensional port seems to be a high barrier for entry.

Well done DxD crossovers are my shit though, so I might be a little biased. I hate the shit out of the anime, but the world it's in is so fucking cool. It's the same thing with Naruto now that I'm thinking about it.
