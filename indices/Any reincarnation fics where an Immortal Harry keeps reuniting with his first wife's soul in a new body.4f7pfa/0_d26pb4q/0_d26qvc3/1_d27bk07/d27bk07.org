Haha, just finished writing an HP crossover where the count is currently at 4. (First HP fic, too.)

The first HP fanfic I ever read was a Harry Potter/Boy Meets World crossover based around the episode where the kids get stuck in the school with a killer. At the time I thought it was the funniest thing in existence. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2662032/1/Detention][Detention]]
