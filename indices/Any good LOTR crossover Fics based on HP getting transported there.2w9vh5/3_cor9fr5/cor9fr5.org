[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8879660/1/Doomsman-s-Herald][Doomsman's Herald]] is a truly fantastic start to a fic, and one of the most intriguing and captivating openings I've read in a long time.

...but it's only 4 chapters and 20k words in, and hasn't been updated in two years. What's there is top quality, but the plot hasn't really started yet, and I doubt that's about to change.

It's by Morta's Priest, the author of Wand and Shield, btw, in case you need any reassurances as to quality.
