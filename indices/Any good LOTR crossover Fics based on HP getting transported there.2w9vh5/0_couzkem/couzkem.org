There's some stuff in HP/Hobbit crossover too:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]] Which is a fairly vanilla HP-Hobbit insertion which follows canon closely but is simply written very well.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]] Bit of a strange one. Its claim to HP-Crossoverdom is rather tenuous and it's a bit of a Sue-ish insert to a Thorin romance but it has a lovely attachment to the lore of the LotR that I can't help but enjoy it. Also very well written in my opinion.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8250381/1/Forging-A-King][Forging a King]] I remember enjoying this when I read it. It has its issues but I'd still consider it a decent afternoon. Plays a bit fast and loose with LotR lore though.

Also, teensy bit of a shameless plug for my own fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] which is a bit of a fix-it fic rolled into a romance and unleashed upon the Tolkien lore without mercy.
