Hi, thanks so much for responding with the recs! I've read or attempted a few of these before. Loved communication errors and yes some of Meowmers stories (Restricted and Playing Cupid being my favs).

The longer stories I have mixed feelings. I've attempted Tied for Last twice and couldn't get into it (the author's note at the very beginning already made me think twice so I skipped to the end out of frustration and didn't like the feel of the ending). In time I might go back. Same with the experiment.

I didn't like the twist in Tempora Abducto, felt like a cop out to me.

Politicians I liked, seems like modern nomaj Tomione is my thing ðŸ˜ƒ Just Another Girl was cute too.

I think I'll enjoy the rest of Shark divers stories! Not a fan of Marriage Law but the crack tag intrigues me.
