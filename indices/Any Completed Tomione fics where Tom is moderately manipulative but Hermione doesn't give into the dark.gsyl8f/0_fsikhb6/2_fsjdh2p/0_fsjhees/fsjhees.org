Glad to help!

Regarding Tied for Last, I think the author is being a little too hard on herself in the author's note. It also has an alternative (happy) ending, it's posted as a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7235067/1/Tied-for-Last-Original-Ending][separate story]]. The thing that I love both Tied for Last and The experiment for is that Tom really feels remorse there. He's not compromising or admitting to making some mistakes, but genuinely regrets his past actions. That's not something you see often in Tomione stories.
