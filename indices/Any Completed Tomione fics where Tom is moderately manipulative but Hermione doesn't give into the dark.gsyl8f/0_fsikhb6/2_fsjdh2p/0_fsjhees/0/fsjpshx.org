I like remorseful Tom, my favorite epic Tomione hands down is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][unsphere the stars]].

The author note for Tied for Last mentioned repeated patterns of abusive behavior. I pictured him slapping her around and then getting back into her good graces by swearing he loves her or "never again" and repeating the cycle. A bit too... unpalatable for me.
