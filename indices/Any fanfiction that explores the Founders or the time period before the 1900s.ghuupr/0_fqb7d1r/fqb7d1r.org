/Of a Linear Circle/ is excellent for Founders' Era. linkao3(11284494) Parts 1 and 2 are set in modern times with Salazar Slytherin's younger brother arriving at Hogwarts. If you're only interested in the bits with the actual Founders in them, skip ahead to part 3 which goes back to the founding of Hogwarts. You won't be lost, because that's the beginning of a new storyline, but you'll spoil some of the plot twists in parts 1 and 2. Then pick through the rest of the series, as the stories alternate between being set in the 1990s and the 990s.
