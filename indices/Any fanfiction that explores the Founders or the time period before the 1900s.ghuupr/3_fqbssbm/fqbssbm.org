I'm writing a founders era fic right now! Rather than starting at the beginning of Hogwarts, it takes place a few decades in as some of the tensions are beginning to mount, set against the background of William The Conqueror's invasion of England and it's fallout.

Only one chapter is up so far, but I've written a lot more and should post a second around the end of the week.
