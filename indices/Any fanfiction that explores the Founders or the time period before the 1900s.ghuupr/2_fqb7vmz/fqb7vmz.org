I really like these:

- linkao3(The Friar's Calling by Chthonia) is about the Fat Friar in the Middle Ages,
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil by celticbard]] is from the time of the Salem Witch Trials.
- linkao3(Bloodstone by Northumbrian) ... just lovely one-shot from the time of the Fall of the Roman Empire.
- [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]] is slightly too long, but lovely story from that mythical year 382 BC.

And yes, there are really too few good historical fanfictions in the HP universe.
