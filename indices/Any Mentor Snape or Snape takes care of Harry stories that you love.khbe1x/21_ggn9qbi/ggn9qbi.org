In this story the Dursleys are abusive and after Fred and George find out, Minnie takes Harry in and Snape also helps take care of him. All the houses are friends, and there's a ton of great character development.

The story is really wholesome and I absolutely love it but sadly the series is unfinished (the author wrote up to hbp before it suddenly stopped updating)
