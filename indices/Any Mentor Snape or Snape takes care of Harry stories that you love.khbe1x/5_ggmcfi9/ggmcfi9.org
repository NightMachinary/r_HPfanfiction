Ugh, I'm actually looking for a fic like this that I read a while ago, if I can hijack for a second --

Snape stays over Christmas hols with a few students. Harry gets into a broom accident and Snape has to take care of him, discovers the abuse, and becomes a mentor. Similar to Kendra James's Perception is Everything - but not quite - I'm pretty sure Draco blasts a wall on him after break and Harry has nerve damage in his arm? Any ideas?
