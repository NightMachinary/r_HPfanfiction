Seconding this one so much. This fic has set the bar for me for all other mentor!Snape fics. I love how both Harry and Snape are in character. The understanding between them takes time and effort. It also is one of the few fics that allows both Harry AND Snape to grow in my opinion. Snape is NOT a well adjusted human being and can't suddenly become the perfect mentor figure for Harry. Theres a lot of stumbling and realizations that happen on both sides and the writing is absolutely superb
