This is a bit different from the rest because it's AU--it was started in 2005 so some post-2005 canon stuff wasn't mentioned; and the Harry that Snape needs to take care of is no longer a child. This Harry is someone who disappeared after defeating Voldemort and just recently came back to the Wizarding World because of a life threatening condition that could undo his defeat of the Dark Lord.
