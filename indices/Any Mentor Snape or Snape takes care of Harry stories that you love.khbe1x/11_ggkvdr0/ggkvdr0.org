I'm fond of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24102232/chapters/58018174][Crime and Punishment]] by melolcatsi. Severitus without spanking. Lots of psychology and the writing is actually good. Snape is Snape, warts and all, somehow they make it work. It's a WIP but worth reading what's already there.
