Was mostly saying that in my own humble opinion there aren't any good fics of the type you asked for. Guess I can respect your taste although I personally rather hate it. What's good in Mentor Snape fics? Nothing really. If you really want to go for a mentor, why not Dumbledore? Have read quite a few Snape Mentor fics and have to say I really wasn't touched by them. I'm not bashing Snape, but in my opinion he's a bit pathetic. Don't get me wrong, he was a spy for the Order and everything, which was a really "good" move I guess. (Can't describe it better, English is not my native language), but he could really have been a bit less of a miserable, pathetic man. Maybe that's the appeal of these fics? Making Snape an actually likeable person? Would really like to hear your opinion.
