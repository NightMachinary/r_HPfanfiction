The Days of the Flower ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6323959/1/The-Days-of-a-Flower):]]

Whoever thought that he, Severus Snape would be the perfect man to raise a child, was sick in the head and needed to be locked up and his brain removed and used for potions as punishment for even thinking of such a stupid thing...Lily thinks otherwise.

Four Seasons ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9239129/1/Four-Seasons):]]

Part 2 of The Days of A Flower: So, Severus survived the first year as a parent, the rest should be a walk in the park...right?

Blooming Flowers ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12183629/1/Blooming-Flowers):]]

Part 3 of Days Of A Flower: The children are now attending Hogwarts, they bring with them the usual chaos, much to Severus's mixture of exasperation and delight. While at school, the children discover more behind their Headmaster that could shed some light on the creature that attacked Harry all those years ago.

In the fanfic 'The Days of the Flower', Severus adopted Harry Potter though in the part 2 of the fanfic called 'Four Seasons', Severus blood adopted Harry. These fanfics are also slash and the Weasley's doesn't appear until the part 3 of the fanfic, 'Blooming Flowers' and they are super nice. And the Weasley's and Malfoy's also got along because of their children in that fanfic.

Edit: This is also a Volemort/Severus fic
