Sure, but at that point, Snape is a Death Eater. Taking advantage of a woman you have feelings for is trivial in comparision, especially since he's still a teenager (mind you, the issue is typically him being unable to say no rather than him maliciously and deliberately exploiting a vulnerable person). Not excusable, but still, he's already horrible at that point and you can't get much worse. To be clear, I don't mean to trivialize what he does. But rather, I feel that if anything is worth addressing first, it's the fact that he became a Death Eater. Only when this has been digested fully and properly resolved/redeemed (good luck with that!), it might be worthwhile to consider his side in the Severitus debacle.

I used to lurk Potions and Snitches in the past, and while the site has a great archive of platonic Snape&Harry, I found it somewhat annoying to navigate.
