Potions and Snitches is a website centred around Severus and Harry having nonsexual relationships.

I was hoping the OP would give you the go ahead to rec Snape adopts Harry. I /LOVE/ those.

As far as Snape being biological father, I read a few where Lily is pregnant before getting with James whether she knew it or not which don't paint any of them in a bad light. Imo, the cheater tropes paint Snape in a bad light too unless she lies and says she and James broke up, which just puts her in a worse light.
