  Would rather NOT have Snape is actually Harry's father.

Not even adoptive? Because while I personally always liked those fics, I was never really a fan of biological father!Severus. Mostly because it tends to include a rather disturbing past with Lily. The usual premise is basically that Lily, fed up with James' shenanigans, flees to Severus, has a night of passion only to return back to James later. It paints both Lily and James in a bad light, Lily for being unfaithful and wishy-washy and James for being bad enough to prompt someone to prefer an outright Death Eater, even if the guy is a former friend.

linkffn(The Best Revenge) is a decent fic that hasn't yet been recommended. It also doesn't have Snape as father, not even adoptive, unless that changed later on (I only read around 60% of that fic).
