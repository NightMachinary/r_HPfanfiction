Fanfic, over time, probably made me realize what a dumbass kid!me was for hating Ron as much as I did. Honestly, I'm not a Ron fan, but the ridiculous OTT nature of Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore bashing in fics I read at like thirteen made me draw myself out a bit and consider the characters more critically.

Bad fanfiction definitely motivates me to have better understanding of canon characters, and reading shitty fanfic as a kid forced me to take a more three-dimensional look at canon characters as I see them now.
