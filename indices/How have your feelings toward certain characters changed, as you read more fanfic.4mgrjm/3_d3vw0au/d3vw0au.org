I've read some really amazing HP/LV fics and they have changed the way that I think about Voldemort. To write that pairing you really have to think outside the box and I feel that most of the fics I've read have supplied well thought out motivations, flaws, and strengths for his character. I think while reading the books he was always just The Big Bad but now he's more dimensional. Authors will create a backstory for him that is so believable and beautiful. I think because of reading fics where he's made to be more than just the psychopath killing all of the muggleborns I've learned to empathize with his past more than I ever thought I could and to appreciate his character (in all types of fics).
