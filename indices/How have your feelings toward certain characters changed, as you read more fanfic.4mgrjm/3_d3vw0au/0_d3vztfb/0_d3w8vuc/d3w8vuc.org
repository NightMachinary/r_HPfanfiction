I really like this fic because harry himself doesn't idolize Voldemort. It really feels like they're in a relationship that includes compromise, something that can be lacking in a lot of fics with this pairing. linkffn(11652581) This fic is such an interesting AU. Warning: It's not just Voldemort in this fic. linkffn(9973394) This is one of my favorite HP/LV fics. It's so dark and twisted but so beautiful. If you end up liking the pairing I would recommend waiting to read this fic because it's hard to get through (but totally worth it). linkffn(3439784) linkffn(11685725; 10914532; 6953303; 3234179; 6621434)
