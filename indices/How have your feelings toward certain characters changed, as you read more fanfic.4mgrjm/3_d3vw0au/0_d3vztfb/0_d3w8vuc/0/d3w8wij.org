  Life had a habit of taking unexpected turns. No one knew that better than Harry. He certainly hadn't planed on the path he had taken. It could be worse. Being a professional hitman wasn't all that bad. It paid well and he could get rid of some truly nasty individuals. So, all in all, life was good. Then one day he got a hit for one Tom Riddle. Harry knew he shouldn't have taken it.

  LV/HP Voldemort has never lied to him before. Why would he start now? Harry reasoned that if Voldemort wasn't lying and Voldemort really loved him, then it was ok to love him back... Even if it meant the world had to burn. AU. Slash. Char Death.

  Fairytale AU. Loosely inspired by Beauty and the Beast. Some said he was once a man, cursed, and some that he sold his soul to demons and became one in turn. Others said that such evil as he could never have been human. That he was instead a nightmare, left lingering upon the earth a very long time ago. Harry just knew it wasn't safe to walk near the Riddle House after dark.

  1) The Cruciatus Harry used in the Department of Mysteries was successful. 2) Voldemort arrived just a little bit early. Two small shifts, that change absolutely everything -- and understanding is a more dangerous weapon than even Dumbledore could ever have imagined.
