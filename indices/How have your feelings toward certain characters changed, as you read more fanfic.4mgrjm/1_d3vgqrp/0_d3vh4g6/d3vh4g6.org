When I read the books, I didn't really care for Ron. I didn't hate him, but I wouldn't say he was one of my favorite characters either.

Then I saw how much hate he was getting from all areas of the fandom, and I had to point out that he was nowhere near that bad.

I've actually been enjoying Ron fics more than I would've without the hate.
