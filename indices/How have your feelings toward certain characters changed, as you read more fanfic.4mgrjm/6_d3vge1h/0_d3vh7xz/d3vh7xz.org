Same. I enjoyed book!Snape because he was a douche, but he was our douche. The reveal in Book 7 that he was secretly on Dumbledore's side while still being a douche was enjoyable.

Movie!Snape is obvious, Alan Rickman was great.

But now you look at pretty much any Fanon!Snape and he's either a complete utter pussy who'll do anything for Harry when reminded of Lily or he's actually a super edgy serial killer who rapes Lily's corpse on a daily basis while also crucioing whatever first year who happens to walk by.
