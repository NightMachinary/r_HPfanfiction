I liked "The Birthday Present". Basically, Snape is suffering from Brewer's Bog, which involves emotional volatility and irritability from over exposure to potions ingredients. Dumbledore treats him quite shabbily for the the greater good, and when Severus gets treatment (including mood stabilizers and anti-depressants) he's much more mellow. He doesn't have to interact too much with Harry (plot-wise) but instead cares about and tries to protect a group of newly inducted Death Eaters, including Marietta Edgecombe and Percy Weasley (who's spying).
