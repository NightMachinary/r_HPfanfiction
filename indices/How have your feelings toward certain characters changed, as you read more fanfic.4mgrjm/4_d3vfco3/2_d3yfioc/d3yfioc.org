Agree. I haven't read the books recently, so can someone tell me where the "smartest witch of her age / the age" stuff comes from? I remember Ron said something once, but that was probably because she figured out something difficult. Are there any grown-ups who referred to her like that? I remember someone (Dumbledore?) once said that she was remarkably smart / clever, but "brightest witch of whatever"? Is that canon?

TL;DR: Who in the books ever said Hermione was the smartest of all time?
