I dislike Ron more now.

Even if in many fanfics, his behaviour is exaggerated, I wouldn't be able to remain friends with someone who believes you're a cold-hearted fame hungry bastard when someone is trying to kill you (GoF) or you're trying to save the world without a clue of what to do next (DH).

Hermione still believes in Harry and tries to help him but Ron just leaves.
