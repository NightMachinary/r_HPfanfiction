I've come to realise that, canonically, most of the characters were fairly douchey and had their fair share of moments that made them unbearable, particularly as the series went on and became increasingly Dahk and Ejjy to appeal to the YA crowd.

I was once young enough to like most Indy!Harry, usually HHr, until I realised just how formulaic and just plain terrible a lot of the works in that genre could be. I liked nearly objectively bad things, back then. Now, I've moved away from Harry, because I realised that his role in the series was to be the camera with which we view the rest of the Wizarding World, and by extension, he doesn't have much of a character to call his own. He... exists, and occasionally does plot related things for often very sketchy reasons, because early HP books are basically Scooby Doo plots. A deep, compelling protagonist within a detailed, coherent, interesting world isn't really needed for a Scooby Doo plot.

I still prefer a proactive protagonist who actually accomplishes things through hard work and often personal suffering, but Harry is often used as a pure self-insert, so just about anyone else in that role is preferred. Usually Hermione seems like a good fit, though it's not completely in line with her canon characterisation. I'd still argue that her tendency to ignore the rules whenever it's convenient and be completely ruthless is one of her more worrying canonical traits, even if she's not the supergenius fanon often portrays her as. She's still the most consistently competent member of the trio, and she's involved in about 97% of the femslash in the fandom, so as an avid femslasher, I guess I'll have to put up with the fact that canon Hermione was... not that great, at the best of times. In hindsight, HP hasn't aged well.
