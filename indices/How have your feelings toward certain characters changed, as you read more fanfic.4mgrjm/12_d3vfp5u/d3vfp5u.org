I notice myself disliking Ron more. I read alot of Harry/Hermione and a lot of authors seem to find it easier to accentuate his flaws to get him out off camera or create drama. I understand the motivation behind it, they're writing HHr because they want to write about Harry and Hermione, not because they want to write about Ron, but it's annoying. Before reading fanfic, I didn't think much about Ron other than he's funny and a bit clumsy.

It's not just HHr though. I've read Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks a lot as well and Ron is usually presented as a bit clueless and annoying. A lot of authors don't seem to like Ron that much.
