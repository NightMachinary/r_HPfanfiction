I feel the same way about Hinata in he Naruto fandom. It's good in small doses, but when everyone and their mother writes it (always with the same old routine of "Wow Hinata loves me? Well I love her too now even though we only talked like, twice.") it just gets boring.

I've talked to some writers who put NaruHina in their story, and they admit they only do it because it's the most popular ship.

For Hermione, I just hate how they shoehorn her into being Harry's friend in everything. Nerdy Harry fic? Understandable. But putting her in a Dark Lord Harry fic where he was raised to hate Mudbloods?

I enjoyed linkffn(11674317) but even this winds up bringing Hermione back to Harry's side, along with a little monologue on how Ron was never her real friend.
