I can't really stand Hermione as a romantic interest anymore. Maybe it was the absurd amounts of H/Hr that I have to wade through to find anything different (yay oversaturation, try something different, +you fuckwads+ please), or maybe it's the fact that I just can't really relate to her character at all. Or maybe it's the way writers will make her so entirely overbearing that it just completely turns me off.

Or maybe it's just Emma Watson. Who knows.

I used to like Snape, too. Now I just find him pathetic.
