While I used to feel pretty indifferent about him, I've grown to hate Ron. His throwing jealous fits e.g. during GoF, happens practically every other fic and though, from what little of canon I remember it's in character, it's also incredibly tedious. That, in addition to the fact it's not unusual in Hermione femslash that she feels the need to stay friends with him, he's jealous, she agonizes over it, blah blah blah -also frustrating, are mostly what made my indifference turn into hate. Things go much smoother when he's dead/gone/marginalised.

Speaking of which, Hermione can often be pretty intolerable as well.

As can the weasly twins, simply because they're so often cast as the good weasly's. And every author has to do the twin-speech thing...

On the other hand, I like Bella a lot more, Bellamione ftw!

And Voldemort too, at least when he's not portrayed as comic book villain that keeps getting bested by an inexperienced child.
