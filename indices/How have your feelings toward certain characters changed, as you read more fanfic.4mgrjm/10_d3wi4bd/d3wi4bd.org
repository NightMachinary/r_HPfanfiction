I find myself annoyed at how many people turn HP characters into thinly veiled self insert characters. Obviously this is due to the age of many writers, but when people write 16 year old Harry sobbing and crying because he's in love with Draco, it just makes me want to headdesk.

As someone who has been working as a judge in a fanfiction competition recently, I've been running into a lot of this sort of writing, especially the kind where characters act weird for no reason or they just retell a story from canon in the most pedantic, boring way possible.

My least favorite thing in fanfiction has to be the really creepy house elf slavery fetishization thing that a lot of stories have where house elves are literally falling over themselves to be grateful for abusive, degrading treatment and it bothers me so much because it feels like it's glorifying slavery in general, which is gross.
