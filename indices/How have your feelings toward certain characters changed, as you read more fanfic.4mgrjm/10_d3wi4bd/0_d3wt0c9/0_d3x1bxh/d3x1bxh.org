TBH, Hermione wasn't "wrong," so much as she tried to force freedom on the house elves without there being any framework in Wizarding Society that would allow free house elves to survive or thrive. Even Dobby has to be taken in by Hogwarts.

The truth of the matter is that Hermione (at least according to JK), once she gets her job with Magical Law Enforcement, ends up doing a lot of crusading for non-human sapient magical creatures (house elves, centaurs, goblins) to give them more rights and choices. When she grows up, Hermione realizes that you can't force an oppressed class to make big, sweeping changes in a society that basically punishes them with death or exile if they rebel.

Abuse is obviously wrong, and yet I see so many fanfics that show house elves jumping for the chance to punish themselves. :(
