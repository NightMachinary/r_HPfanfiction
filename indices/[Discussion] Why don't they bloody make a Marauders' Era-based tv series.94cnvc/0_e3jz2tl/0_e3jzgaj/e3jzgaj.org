Yeah, I guess you're right, which is super sad:( I wish there was someone in the indistry who would stay true to the canon and the story and who could do it justice. It's just such a pity that even JK doesn't want to tell us more about the Marauders' Era and all we have is fic-established canon (which is more than amazing btw, totally not complaining)
