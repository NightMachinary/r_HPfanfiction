The dollar is king when it comes to these sorts of things. Hell look at what they did with the [[/r/Eragon]] movie. That absolutely ignored canon completely. Or the recent Hobbit Trilogy. As long as it is profitable they don't care what happens.

I honestly am ok with JK remaining silent on these sorts of things. Pottermore and the interviews aren't my favorite; the books are my canon. Some of the stuff she has said and decided after the books isn't the greatest and doesn't make sense.
