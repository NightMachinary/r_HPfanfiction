I don't know who has rights to it, but honestly I would be kind of nervous if they did. I really think the HP books are wonderful and trying to add to or change the existing canon is a bad idea.

I mean if you take a look at Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts, do we really want those people making something like this? They don't care about Harry Potter as much as we do, they don't respect canon enough to stay true to it.
