1. Pop culture has no place in HP. None.

2. Part-Humans isn't something I've really seen a lot. I'd say go for it if that is what you want to explore, don't do it if you're just trying to be different.

3. Super unique wands is a horrible cliche. Unicorn hair in birch/oak or something is fine and normal, there shouldn't be a big focus on the wand. One of the things DH is hated most for is making a more powerful wand. A wand should be a wand, all that matters is that it's properly matched.

Edit: If you'd like to workshop ideas you should join us on the IRC it works well for this.
