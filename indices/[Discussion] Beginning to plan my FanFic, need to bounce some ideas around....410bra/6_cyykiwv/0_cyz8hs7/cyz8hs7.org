  Pop culture has no place in HP. None.

I disagree... sort of..? I think it's not *"NO!"* but rather *"Do your bloody research, and then use it sparingly"*

I think there's *some* room for some 90's nostalgia references /while in the muggle world or interacting with muggleborn/

But, mostly, I think that wizarding kids are going to have their own pop culture references that would come up instead. The Weird Sisters comes to mind, as does the local quiditch match.

What has no place in a HP fanfiction is what we often see done instead where a reference to *current* pop culture or American stuff is used instead of an appropriate 90's British reference.
