1) I agree with an earlier poster. Unless you have a skill you need you character to have (vampire speed, etc), or unless you want to explore the restricted rights or others troubles a part human would have in the pureblood dominated wizarding world, avoid the half breed stuff. Do it for a reason, not just for kicks and giggles or to make your character unique.

2) Any wand wood is fine. Stick to a type mentioned in the books, and describe it by color later, then ignore. The wand is a tool, and if you don't want it to be a super wand, don't take time describing it in depth. Olivanders description and then a "wow cool I have a wand" scene would be plenty. If it's a longer series you could have him reminisce after a few years about all he has gone through with his wand, and the nicks and scratches that have accumulated.

3) The golden trio were pretty isolated in the books. Mention the events they deal with f your character is around for them. (Basilisk fear, joining the DA, etc) , but don't bother going in depth unless your character has a part to play in it. That said, if he isn't a part of the HP Canon plots, it may decrease your readership if it's during the same timeframe. Unless you have a solid plotline for your OC to be involved in.

4) Muggleborns make references early, but pureblood don't get them. They stop early on so they don't get made fun of. In a muggleborn heavy group/gathering Muggle pop culture may come back in in the first few years, but by year 5-7 they won't be up on Muggle pop culture, and will be so far removed from it they won't make many, if any, references to it.
