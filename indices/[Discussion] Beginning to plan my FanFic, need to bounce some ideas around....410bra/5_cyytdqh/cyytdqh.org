1. Not overdone in my experience, but something you have to be careful with. There are a ton of crappy vampire Harry fics out there, but not many half-creatures.

2. The wood only has a significance if you state one. Just use any kind of wood...and don't use Yggdrasil. So damn overused.

3. So this is going to be a story of mostly OCs? Those are rarely done well. Not saying you won't be able to, just saying it will likely be much more difficult. Also, a HP fanfic without many HP characters will likely diminish interest if that matters to you.

4. Pop culture references are just another thing that can be done well or poorly. I'd use them sparingly at best.
