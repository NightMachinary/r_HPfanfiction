  Do not make your first HP fanfiction OC-heavy -- it will almost certainly not end well.

I think it's a bit more complicated than that... A fic centered on an OC will have a different set of stumbling blocks than one centered on the canon cast.

Specifically, it's a lot harder to make readers give a crap about your OC. You have to be careful not to make them too good at <thing>, and other common pitfalls... But on the upshot, you can have them act however you want because we have no expectations of them.

On the other hand, running the canon cast gives you all sorts of characterization baggage that people will probably get cranky over if you get wrong (AKA Act Out of Character). But that's also the good news: You have a lot of the heavy lifting done for you characterization design-wise.

It comes down to what the author feels they need the biggest assist on. If they feel like matching canon characterization is going to be their biggest struggle vs. if they feel like making an interesting protagonist from scratch would be harder for them.

*I agree with you however that I think for /most/ people, designing a good cast of OCs is going to be the harder option.* For a first timer, it might be easiest to try writing a short oneshot that involves a canon character or two and a minor OC and see whats easier to write?
