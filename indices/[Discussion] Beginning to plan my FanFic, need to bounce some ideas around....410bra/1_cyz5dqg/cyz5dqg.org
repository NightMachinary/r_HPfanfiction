There is an entire [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][Pottermore article]] about wand woods and another about [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-cores][Wand Core]]. You can use the wood and core that matches the closest with your character.

As for pop culture, Wizards and Muggles have different pop culture. The books briefly mention Wizarding comics, singers and fairy tales. Pure-bloods would only get Wizarding pop culture, Muggleborns would only get Muggle pop culture and half bloods would know a bit of both.

Also do remember that the books take place in 1990s United Kingdom, so if a Muggleborn makes a Muggle pop culture reference make sure it makes sense with the setting. So no American Football reference, for example, because no one outside of the US gives a shit about that sport.
