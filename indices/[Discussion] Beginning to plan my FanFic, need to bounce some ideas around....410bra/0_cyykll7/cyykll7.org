1. Yes, way too overdone. AFAIK we know that Filius has some goblin ancestry and that Fleur's grandmother was a veela. We don't know enough to infer the rest of what you've assumed to be true. [If JKR has spoken ex cathedra on this, someone please chime in.]

2. I trust your central conflict is more well defined than a 'goal/problem/whatever.' Use whatever wood you like. Native woods might be more lore friendly, but you could also try something foreign for a bit more flavour.

3. It could be. But be careful about trying to run the Stations of The Canon. It can turn off readers.

4. Most wizards are wholly ignorant of Muggle culture, so wouldn't understand many references. One of their foremost experts can't pronounce electricity and doesn't understand what a rubber duck is for. Unless you want to break canon lore, you'd probably be best steering clear of Muggle pop culture references.
