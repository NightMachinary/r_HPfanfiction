  It could be. But be careful about trying to run the Stations of The Canon. It can turn off readers.

To elaborate on [[/u/MacsenWledig]] 's point, if you do plan on having canon events go off on schedule... it might be best to simply gloss over it. AKA... the 'troll incident' could be handled by the person next to your main character at breakfast the next day asking him/her if they heard about it... don't feel the need to have the OC *be there/be involved* More to establish time-frame than a major plot point.
