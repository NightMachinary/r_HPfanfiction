I won't go as far to say pop culture references shouldn't be used at all, because that's an utterly daft assertion, but if you do use references, they should only be used by muggleborn or muggle-raised characters. And if they use them in front of purebloods or wizard-raised halfbloods, they should be met with confusion, because the muggle world and the magical world are entirely different. For example: if we're talking about the trio, only Harry or Hermione should make reference to whatever it is you're making reference to, and Ron shouldn't understand what they're talking about, unless your fic features a Ron who has spent a significant amount of time in the muggle world.

I suppose the rule is inverted if you want to include wizarding pop culture, but there's not a lot mentioned in canon, so you'd mostly have to make it up as you go along.

As for using canon characters, it depends on your priorities: If you aren't concerned with low readership, then you probably don't need any canon characters at all. But it's very rare for a fic that doesn't feature any notable character from canon in some capacity, to get widespread recognition.

As long as you don't make a wand super unique sounding, you're fine. Remember, Harry's wand is actually pretty normal and is only special in context of its brother wand and the specific phoenix who donated its feather core, not because of some super-OP core material. Once you start using manticore scales and some bullshit Merlin-blessed wood or something or another, that's when you run into problems with OP wands.

Being a half-breed isn't a problem unless it makes things too convenient for the protagonist (Veela Harry and suddenly being able to seduce every woman he ever meets), or becomes an endless, exhausting source of angst (Werewolf/Vampire protagonist who spends every other paragraph complaining about how cold and empty his/her life is).

That's all I've got, hope I've helped some.
