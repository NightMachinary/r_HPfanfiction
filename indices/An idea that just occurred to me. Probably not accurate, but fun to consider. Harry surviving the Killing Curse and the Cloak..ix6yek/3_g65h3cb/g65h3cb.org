I would agree with you but we need a little more context than Voldemort's account of the events. If James truly sacrificed himself for Harry and Lily and not just caught by surprise, it meant that he "greeted death like an old friend"... so it means that the possession of the cloak went by default to Harry and thus he was immune to all those deadly situations until he was willing to accept death. In addition, Lily's sacrifice protected him from Voldemort's touch. So in fact it would be a pretty cool idea if both parents' sacrifice worked as a protection.
