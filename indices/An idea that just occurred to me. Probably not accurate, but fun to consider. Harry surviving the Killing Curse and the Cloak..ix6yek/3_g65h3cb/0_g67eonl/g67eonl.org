"lily take harry and run'' James shouted as ran to the couch to pick up his wand he looked at and sighed sadly "its the end of our adventures together old friend'' James stood up tall and faced the front door with a soft determination on his face 'lets do house potter proud''

James potter will later be found dead with a mile on his face. the smile of a man who faced evil knowing he could never win and yet he fought with such ferocity and tenacity a unknowing onlooker would have been conviced he was the superior fighter.

James potter stared death down and raged against it not for his own life but for the life of his wife and son.

Magic is a funny thing, as it turns out james potter was in possion of a special cloak that protected the master from some harm. Generally, the magic of the cloak was subtle it would protect against scratchs and nicks and small sicknessess but under certain conditions the magic of the cloak would be enhanced to extrordinary levels. The cloak was normally merely a very unique invisibility cloak with a few quirks that make it stand out amongst the others.

but tonight James potter actived some very special magic in the cloak for when a member of house potter willingly faces an early death to protect another member of house potter. the magic of the cloak would enhance and the next head of house potter would be immune to even the most evil of magic for a time.
