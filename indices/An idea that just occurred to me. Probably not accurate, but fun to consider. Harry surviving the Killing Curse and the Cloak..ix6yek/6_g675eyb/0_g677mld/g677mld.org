Certainly makes more sense than Lily's sacrifice.. You'd think there'd be previous records of people surviving the killing curse, thanks to the willing self-sacrifice of others, but no, that's not the case. Harry is the only one, and much ado is made for the fact Harry is the only one to survive the killing curse.

However, the Cloak, to my knowledge, is unique, thus could potentially contribute to the unique circumstances that results in one surviving when struck by the killing curse.
