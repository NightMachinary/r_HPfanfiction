What I see with this is that James still retained ownership of the cloak after Harry was born. The cloak is said to keep Death from seeing wielder of it. The reason that James was able to be killed by Voldemort was that he had willingly given the cloak to Dumbledore, thereby passing the ownership of the cloak to Harry at that point. As Harry was a baby and therefore unable to willingly give permission for Dumbledore to have the cloak, it was still his, and thus he was protected from the killing curse. As someone else stated, the reason the killing curse affected him in forest, was because he willingly gave up its protection, when going to face Voldemort.
