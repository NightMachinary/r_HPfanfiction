You're /allowed/ to ask pretty much anything so long as it doesn't invade the authors' privacy, but the authors are free not to answer if they feel uncomfortable with the question or don't want to share their reasons.

I personally wouldn't encourage it as well, especially since I want the AMA to be a fun experience for /everyone/ involved, and that wouldn't be possible if the authors are flooded with a bunch update requests.

However, if you do choose to ask update questions, be considerate. That's all I ask.
