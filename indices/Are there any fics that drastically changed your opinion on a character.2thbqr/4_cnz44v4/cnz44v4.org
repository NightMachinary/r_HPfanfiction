I've got two that really changed my view of a character.

So [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince Of The Dark Kingdom]] has to go down as the best Voldemort in fanfiction, and for a reason. The character is three dimensional, interesting, and yet very true to form. He's a much more /real/ character than what JKR managed to put onto paper. At the very least, he isn't certifiably fucking insane like every other fic makes him out to be.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning Of One]] really changed my view of Ginny as well. Now, I fucking /hated/ that character before this fic. I still don't really like her all that much. And even though this is very AU (it's a soul bond story for fucks sake), it feels like Sovran got Ginny down pat, in a way that actually made her likable.
