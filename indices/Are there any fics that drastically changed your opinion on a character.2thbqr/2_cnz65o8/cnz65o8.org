After reading most of the Prince of the Dark Kingdom, I liked Voldemort a lot more. He seems like a far smarter, and as others have said, three-dimensional character in that fic. It was great.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][*Prince of the Dark Kingdom*]] - /Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort./

 

Reading other fics - particularly Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, along with many other fics on DLP, have made me realize how completely clueless, unintelligent, and unambitious Harry was in canon. Santi's TBWL is a great fic, and so are others on the DLP forums.

*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][(Ch 1-12 FFN)]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=2][(Ch 13-17 DLP)]]* - /Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story./

 

And lastly, all the fics on my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L42j8DtQjwikqv0ggbwA-W25Ccl77V1E2nO96fThTyI/edit?usp=sharing][*review list*]] have formed a lasting impression on me, as well as all the fics in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/xvector][*my favorites*]], which I plan to do a comprehensive review of in my review list.
