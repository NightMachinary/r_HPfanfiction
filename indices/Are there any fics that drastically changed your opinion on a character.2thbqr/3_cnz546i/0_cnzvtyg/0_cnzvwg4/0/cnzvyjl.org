I agree up to Hogwarts, then there isn't any James Potter or Marauders and literally everything Snape does is with the best of intentions, his fight with Lily is a misunderstanding and he even has a truce with the marauders by the end of school. Even his Death Eater stuff is totally innocuous and he's just this poor misunderstood person with no hint of badness in him.
