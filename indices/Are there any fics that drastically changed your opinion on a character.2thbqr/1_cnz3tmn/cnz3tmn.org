This one isn't necessarily a fic. Maybe like a one shot but it was posted on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] I think. It was about Petunia and what if she had taken Harry in. I'm listening to Harry Potter on audio books at work and that drastically made me reconsider Petunia, even though it was not canon. I'm on mobile or I'd post the link.
