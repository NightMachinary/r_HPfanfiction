I have a strange relationship with Ginny. I didn't mind her when I read the series - she seemed strong in a way that matched up well with Harry - but I didn't think she was an amazing character or anything.

Then I started reading fanfiction, specifically stories featuring Love Potion Ginny - basically, the fanon version of her that's somehow developed the attributes she specifically /didn't/ have in canon: whiny, clingy, obsessed with Harry (past the age of 13 or so), and manipulative to the point of actively (magically) subverting/destroying people's relationships to get what she wants.

A bit of that fanon bias seeped into my conception of her. Thankfully, as I've read more and more fanfiction, I've come all the way back around to where I started: wanting to find fics that can nail the style, tone, and characters of canon.

These four fics were instrumental in developing (redeveloping, actually), my idea of Ginny:
