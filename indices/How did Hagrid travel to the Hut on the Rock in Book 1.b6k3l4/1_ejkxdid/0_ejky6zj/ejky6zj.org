Fly on what though? The only ones who can fly unaided are Voldemort and (possibly) Snape, Hagrid is noted as being too big to use a broom or ride any flying creature, and if he used the motorbike I'm fairly sure it would've been mentioned, as it was his character was first introduced. I'm kinda working on a Me-as-Harry SI fic starting the moment Hagrid shows up at the hut, and I'm almost tempted to retcon the motorbike as being there the whole time to fill in that potential plot-hole.
