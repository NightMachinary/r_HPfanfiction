I find it crazy no one has attempted it before (to my knowledge.) I found a few based around Quidditch but the plot always focuses around some sort a romance between Oliver wood loll and someone else. Do you know of any that focus on the team and the journey of a player from academy to stardom? I would be interested to read it.
