Normally I make [[/u/rpeh]] do this for me. I mean it's what I pay him for and all. But I think he's either dead or still drinking after whatever the hell that extra time was earlier tonight. I should send him a nice birthday gift. Someone get me his shirt size....

I feel like I should preface this by explaining a bit of who I am....but that seems exceedingly arrogant. But meh. Who cares?

There are a lot of inconsistencies in your story. I have a hard time, for example, believing a squib could fly a broom. I would suspend my disbelief on that point, but it rings false for me.

I also have a hard time believing a family that can't afford a quaffle and is struggling financially has enough throwaway money for the kid to buy a brand new broom oh and for his brother to have a Firebolt. The Firebolt strikes me as more of a Ferrari than, say a Honda Civic. Even if it's six or seven years after Canon as the 'Numbus 2007' implies. I doubt the Firebolt has depreciated as much. There's ways around that, sure. Maybe the Broom was a gift from a pro team as part of the academy...but that's not said in the text and if so, the kid is pretty blase about handing it off to his brother. Even professional sports teams keep track of things they give away to students. Seeing how people take care of their possessions reflects on them.

His 'natural talent' awakening is...unrealistic. You seem to have a sense that talent is just there to be drawn on and not something to be worked at. Nothing about his betterment of his ability feels earned. It all feels given.

There's very little interesting about the MC. There's not enough text there to make it so each chapter is barely a complete scene. And he comes off as insufferable and entitled to an adult.

My experience with highly competitive youth sports, which is granted limited to Hockey, also makes the time skip seem unbelievable. They would know if he quit. Those communities are often far more insular. You know a guy who knows a guy. A lot of times the youth leagues are playing against the same people their entire young adult lives. Someone would have mentioned something to them long before.

And then it rings false anyway. It doesn't matter how much 'natural talent' he has. Four years of 'training by himself' going against kids who have four years of highly specialized professional training....he's going to get his ass kicked. Which, maybe that's the plot. But it certainly doesn't seem like it. Again, this goes back to it feeling like everything is given and not earned.

Very little of it feels true to the situation you're attempting to write a story about. But you don't really focus on anything. It flashes around and it's like 700 words here 700 words there move on repeat.

There is probably something there but it needs to be flushed out a lot more than it is.

What you say doesn't come through in the text. There's not enough there to make it seem like 'an intense rivalry'. So his one brother is a dick, lots of older brothers are. That doesn't make them rivals. So he's a squib...that plot is resolved in about five hundred words of text and then dropped.

It goes back to what I said above. You're trying too hard to make the sport the main plot point when other things are far more interesting than it. You should spend far more time building up the relationship between the brothers. And you should spend far more time on what it means to be a squib. You drop both plot points almost immediately just to throw him in a youth camp. It never feels like he earns it.

Early on you have a lot of oddly formatted dialogue. Lots of mid paragraph random dialogue. You seem to drop that later, which is good. But it's jarring in the first couple of chapters.

The immense potential for a good quidditch story isn't....about quidditch. I mean shit I've arguably written four. Sport is boring to read about. It's dry. It's dull. Most readers will just skip to the end to see who wins. There needs to be compelling relationships built up to keep things interesting.

You have an interesting premise. There is a story to be written about brothers bonding over quidditch. But I would suggest you shift your focus from 'brothers' to 'quiddithc'. After reading it, I'm honestly not sure I could name all four of them. Hell, I know more about the toddler sister who feels more like a throw in character than I do the Brothers.

I don't want to sound too harsh. Your text here shows more ideas than what appear in the story. I'm more than willing to let you bounce ideas around. But really my opinion is that you really need to flesh out the relationship between the brothers. For the story to work you need the reader to care for the family. And at the end of eleven chapters I don't. I'd personally probably cull one of them too, but that's just my opinion. You introduce a lot of characters in not a lot of text and for the most part it feels like name vomit. As a reader it makes me wonder if any of them will be important to the plot.

The same is true for the squib plot. It's referenced plenty but the payoff boils down to.....nothing. You don't show what it means past an offhanded comment. There's more thought on it in your post here than there is in the text of the story.

I think that's about all I'm going to say for now. Please no one tell my beta that I spent four hour on this rather than writing Ithaca...
