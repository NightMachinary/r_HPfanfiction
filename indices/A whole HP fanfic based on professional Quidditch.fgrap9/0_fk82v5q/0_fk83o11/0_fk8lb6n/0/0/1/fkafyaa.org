Thanks for reading and I very much appreciate the criticism. I think it's essential to become a better writer

I was watching the match yesterday as well, although I was rooting for liverpool lol

First of all, I need to save some face, by saying this Airborne is the first creative piece, I have ever written. I also write it in secret, because if any of my mates found out I'm writing fanfiction...Joke. But yeah there will be some errors in writing and formatting here and there.

On top of the fact I don't really have a beta reader and feedback is sparse, I just trudge on in my style. I mean I'm willing to pay good money for a beta reader, so if you know any send them my way please.

Although I appreciate many of your points, I think some can be explained by the fact that the story is not finished. Whilst some are down to interpretation and are meant to be thought provoking

1. In terms of a squib having Quidditch abilities. Squib in my opinion is just a label. Hogwarts labelled the MC a squib as they did not believe he had any magical abilities. The thing is, he has to deal with that labelling. His brother, some of his team members , his manager, they all thrive of that squib status, as they obtain feelings of superiority. But end of the day it is just a label. I don't think you will read my story further, so I'll just explain what is coming up. MC is not a squib. He has immense magical abilities, but it is all manifested in terms of finesse and flair with a broom. There is a scene I plan to write, where he enters Olivandders with his friend and trys to get a wand but it fails horribly.

2. With regards to the expensive broomsticks. The family are not poor per say. They can afford Quaffles and have done before. They just don't like to waste them and save them for special occasions. I mention they do own a family business in Diagon Alley. This has only come under financial strife very recently. Which I mention. I feel that if the main hobby for most of the brothers is Quidditch, and the parents have professionally installed 2 sets of metal Quidditch hoops in their backyard, they can probably afford relatively old brooms.

3. I can see how the awakening can come across as given. I feel that is up to interpretation again. As I mentioned I will explain later, how MC is a very good Quidditch player. All his magical abilities went towards flying. In the 'awakening scene' he reached a point of depression, he was basically carrying out a suicidal move by flying off the cliff, but the his latent abilities with flying saved him. I definitely see your point, and I should probably spend a bit more time fleshing some scenes out. Which I definitely will from now.

4. The 4 years solo training lol. Again it's a matter of opinion I guess. In this case, MC has a magically binding contract until he is 16 to train at the Chudley Cannons Academy and no where else. The new manager and board members certainly don't want a 'squib'. But they cannot offload him as he signed the contract with the previous manager. MC also doesn't want to be there. so I feel like both parties agree it's better for him to stay away. Hence why nothing is mentioned for so long.

In conclusion (I feel like I'm writing an essay lmao) I appreciate your points, But I would not be a man if I did not defend a few of them loll. But yh I deffo need to improve some of my chapters and include more text. Naturally that will allow me to expand on some relationships, which will allow readers to engage with my characters more. I can also see how I could do a better job explaining some plot points. Once again thanks for reading! This was quite insightful.
