Oh yeah I totally agree. Sports at it's very core is not good for story telling. But it's the friendships made, rivalries that are birthed and the emotions that are seen in tight games that I think the Sports/Drama genre can shine.

On top of the fact that Quidditch is a magical sport, I feel there is immense potential for a good story. In my fanfiction, I start by introducing the family of the protagonist. With the 4 brothers introduced, 2 of them are already Quidditch prodigies. The protagonist is a squib and obtains his abilities later. There is already an intense rivalry there, with the brothers going onto play for different teams. I also focus on the aspect of a squib trying to survive in the magical world, because although he has a niche in that world, he is still stigmatised by his own family, peers and even his own team.

I don't want to ruin anything else, but I really like your well formulated argument and would appreciate your take on my story, if you have the time:)
