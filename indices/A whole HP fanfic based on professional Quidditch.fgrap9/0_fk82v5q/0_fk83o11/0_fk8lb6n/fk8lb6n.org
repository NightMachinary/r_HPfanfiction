Sport does not lend itsself well to plot.

Frankly, there isn't a lot interesting about sport itself for anyone who isn't a fan of the teams playing. You either win, or you lose and the emotions in that are pretty paltry and fleeting compared to a lot of the actual facts of life.

There's a reason a lot of the great Sports films aren't really about the sport but the human element involved in it. And the ones that are about the sport often end in Failure, rather than Success (IE, Sugar).

I've said before, Rush doesn't exist because the 1976 F1 season was any more fascinating than ones before or after it. It exists because of the incredibly human nature of the Rivalry between Hunt and Lauda and how Ecclestone's acquiring of the rights made F1 Must Watch from there on out. That season effectively changed how people view and consume Formula 1. There's a reason there's very little on track action in Rush.

Good sports stories often have sports as a backdrop rather than the focus because, frankly, the 'Job' aspect of sports are boring.

Very few people will want to read about the charcter getting up at six in the morning, eating a healthy breakfast of fruit and egg whites mixed with a protein shake. Going through morning calisthenics and yoga before going for a run. Only to return home to shower and go to the pitch for the morning team meeting to discuss strategy and review video. Followed by a couple of hours in the gym at the pitch to go through daily workouts. Then a few hours of running the same plays over and over and over again. Followed by more review. At it's core, for it to have any credibility, it becomes incredibly boring and monotonous.

Sport becomes much better as a backdrop to the plot than the plot itself. That's why there's so many more pieces that use something else as the main plot.

Even the movies cited in this thread are more about the community around the sport with the sport being secondary.
