It's not that hard to make him like Goku, actually. Just make him a very competitive kid who relishes the chance to pit himself against difficult adversaries no matter how dangerous it is.

He'd be if anything even more of a Quidditch freak, probably (help) start a more enduring dueling club, and he'd relish every chance to have at it with Voldemort and his cronies.

Goku!Harry would probably be very happy to be entered into the Triwizard Tournament and may permanently torpedo his friendship with Ron, though.
