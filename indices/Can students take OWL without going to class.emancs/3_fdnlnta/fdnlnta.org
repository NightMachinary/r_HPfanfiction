Perhaps they do it for every student that has a full schedule although it seems extremely irresponsible and unlikely. Then again besides being a necessary plot device I don't get how Dumbles could have just given a time Turner to a student who wanted to take every class. No sorry random 13yr old you can't physically take every class now pick a couple and study the others on your own time, sure I could give you a device to manipulate time but I'm not going to do that just so you can take extra classes why should I make an exception just for you and not for everyone else?
