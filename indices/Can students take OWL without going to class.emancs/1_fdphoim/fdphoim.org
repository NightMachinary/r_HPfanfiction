Probably, or else I don't see how Percy and Bill managed. Since the above examples were wizard-born maybe they had a better chance of studying the subject ahead of time (in the case of Arithmancy and Ancient Runes) or had more exposure to magical creatures (in the case of COMC). Or maybe they took some extra OWLs in 6th and 7th year (there's no rule against that in canon, I think. It's probably not used very often though.)
