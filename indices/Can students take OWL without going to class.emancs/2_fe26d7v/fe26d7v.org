Canonically, the implied answer is yes. Not because of Bill or Percy's 12 OWLs, but because we know that there are parents who choose not to send their children to Hogwarts and homeschool them. Therefore, there must be a way for students to earn those qualifications outside of the Hogwarts curriculum.

In the case of Bill and Percy, it is almost certainly a case of JKR not really thinking those numbers through.
