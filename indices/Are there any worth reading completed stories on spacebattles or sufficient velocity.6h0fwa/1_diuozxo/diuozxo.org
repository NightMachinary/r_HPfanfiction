There was or is one HP crossover with Worm(the current spacebattles fandom) about a Harry that has Dementor-Rogue(xmen) type power going on.

He absorbs their soul(or something, it hasnt been clarified) and gets their powers(if they had any). He is posing as a "good guy" while Dementor Kissing useful parahumans for their abilities.

Incredibly slow updating almost to the point of abandonment.

Another quirky story in the same crossover setting has Harry being transported to the Worm universe by Voldemort at the end of the Goblet Tournament because he knows the prophecy and the best way to deal with it is sending Harry away with corrected(by Voldemort) school material so the mediocre person that is Harry can survive and not die in a week.

This one harry is friends with Grues sister and they started selling Cheering Charmed lemon juice to people.

Both havent been updated in a month I think so I cant remember the names. Stupid authors.
