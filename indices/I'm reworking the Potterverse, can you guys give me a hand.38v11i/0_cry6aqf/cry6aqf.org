Funny you mention that, I'm in the on again off again process of writing a fic but i wanted to have a solid back story i could refer to, so i started writing a history book that harry is reading in in my fiction. Perhaps a bit unnecessary but hey i got side-tracked because it was intriguing to me to create this history.

I go into some magic basics, the origins, focii, the difference between dark and light magic. Admittedly i took some ideas from Raining Ink, but i messaged her and she gave me full permission to cannibalize her universe for the creation of my own. If you want I can PM you the file or i can upload it to GoogleDrive and share it
