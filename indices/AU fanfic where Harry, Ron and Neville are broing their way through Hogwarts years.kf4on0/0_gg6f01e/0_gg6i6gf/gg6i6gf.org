Very interesting parallel. That quartet would have been also interesting, a lot more interesting than Harry-Ron-Herm-Draco one, but the reason why I kinda want to avoid Hermione(the main reason being her popularity, and I am a sucker for underdog/more obscurish tales) in it is that she is kinda the mom/bossy one of the group(and the fact that most of the people who create a AU trio of Harry/Neville/Hermione don't realize that she would be the boss and they would spend most of the time in the library studying), and I doubt that Remus, as much as he was the 'bossy' one and a good boi, could have stopped James and Sirius' shenanigans(but that is actually mostly because Harry doesn't have an ego like his dad had when he was a teen).
