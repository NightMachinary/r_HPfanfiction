  By unleashing forces he couldn't comprehend or control, he defeated the unbeatable and slew the immortal. It was the only way and he didn't regret it. But to all things, there is a price. He thought this one would be his death, but instead he found himself falling down the rabbit hole. It's said that time changes all things. Does that include heroes, as well?

  Harry Potter wasn't surprised to learn he was a wizard. He'd been dreaming of wizards and magic for years. He was just surprised at what sort of wizard he was. Prologue is identical to "Death and Dreams". Dresden Files crossover.
