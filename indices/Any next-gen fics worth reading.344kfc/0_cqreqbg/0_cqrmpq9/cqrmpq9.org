As someone who /has/ read it, I assure you, Hogwarts Houses Divided is awesome and every bit as good as the Alexandra Quick series. I actually prefer it to AQ, Teddy Lupin makes a much better protagonist than pig headed Alexandra IMO, although opinions on the Alexandra as a protagonist vary wildly.
