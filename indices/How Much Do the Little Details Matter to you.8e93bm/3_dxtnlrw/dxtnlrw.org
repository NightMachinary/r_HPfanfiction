From a standpoint of pure technique, the little details are /vital/ for worldbuilding, as they contribute to atmosphere in ways that would otherwise demand infodumping, manifesting at its worst in as-you-know-bob speeches.

I think (cbb googling) it was Chekhov who defined realism as 'describing the thumb so well the reader imagines the hand for himself' and /that/ is the function the little details serve.
