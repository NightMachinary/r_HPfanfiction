That said, multiple comments together could become a plot detail later on, in an interesting way. However, to do this you need links the reader could theoretically make and a different and plausible explanation. For example:

- In book 3, the differences between animagi and werewolves is explained. This introduces the concept of werewolves. In addition, Remus Lupin misses several lessons. Finally, the worst fear of the D.A. professor looks like a white round thing. Thereby, the relevation of him being a werewolf doesn't fall out of the blue.
- Similarly the explanation of Sirius is linked to previous events. For me at least, I didn't see it coming but when I read it a second time I can see the clues.

It feels good to see the links you didn't see beforehand. Therefore, add many little details and make a few of them relevant. However, make at least three clues relevant for everything you want to foreshadow. This increases the moment of revelation when the reader figures it out.
