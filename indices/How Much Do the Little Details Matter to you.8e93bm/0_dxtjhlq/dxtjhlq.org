Given that I spend two hours looking up ferry connections from Britain to the continent, which streets were built along the route Brugge - Prague in 1996 and the local weather at the end of December 1996 just for a single paragraph for my next chapter, I'd say a lot.

Overall I find that these small details vastly improve a story. Not because you put everything you looked up into a story, but because you get a better understanding of what is important for a given subject and can make better choices what you want to include and what not. It makes the surrounding world seem more alive if something not related to the main plot happens (for example students X and Y becoming an item and suddenly there's no other topic in Harry's year for a couple of days).
