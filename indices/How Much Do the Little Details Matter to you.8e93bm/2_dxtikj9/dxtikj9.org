Stories without details are junk. Stuff like the canon goblin rebellions might seem like fluff at first but it builds suspense for the final book, readers are subconsciously influenced into expecting betrayal. Not so much that it lacks impact when it occurs but just enough to make the scenes interesting.

The best kind of details though are the kind that form sub-plots as the story progresses. Long fanfics that actually turn every chapter into a story are amazing.
