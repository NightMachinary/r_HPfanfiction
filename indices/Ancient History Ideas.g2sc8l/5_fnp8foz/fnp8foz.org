Not sure if this is exactly what you want but there is an abandoned story ~61K words called Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDUCK that explains the end of the dinosaurs when the great Eagles carrying their dead liege the Elder Dragon into a Volcano in Mexico.

There's another story that I can't think of the title that had Harry discovering (what was already known to the aurors) that the fidelis charm/ward had caused several airplane crashes. Often enough that the aurors had a short hand notation to designate the "magic" cause of the crash. With this info Harry devises a way to find fidelis protected homes and actually get around the protection.

When i get back i'll take a look to see if I can find it.
