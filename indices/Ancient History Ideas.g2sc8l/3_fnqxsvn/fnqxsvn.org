Fucking goddammit I had a post written up with a bunch of good ideas and sync just decided to close randomly. Fuck this app.

The gist of it was this

- The bronze age collapse was caused by undiscovered goblins, whose species was born deep, deep underground and was unaware of the surface digging out all the copper from below, making the only available metal be bronze scraps, brittle tin or unworkable iron.

- Stars in many ways resemble life - they reproduce, they live, they have a metabolism, they grow and shrink, they evolve and die. Add magic, and they turn into titanic, living sources of not just radiation, but also arcane energy. One of them, the sun, pelted the earth with chaotic bursts of wild magic and caused life to form in the primal waters, and until the chaotic magic from the sun stopped lashing out at the solar system, no planet could develop its own magical presence

- Magic use in humans came from neanderthal DNA mixing with homo sapiens DNA, these magical humans then passed down the gift through their species and across the entire world

- Magic use as an expression of the mind and soul came to be because all matter, even that living creatures are made of, is essentially Stardust. Stars being the first magical entities in the universe, some fragment of their unfathomable power is still contained within this matter, allowing humans to manipulate and channel their inner energies and the unique magical presence of the planet and system they occupy.

- Astronomy is useful because the entire universe is comprised of a magical network based on symbolism, myth, legend, culture and ideology created by the sapient magic users of a myriad species all working to imbue dots of light in the night sky with meaning

- Other astronomical phenomena like pulsars and black holes have measurable magical effects, and are useful in this degree. By for example invoking a pulsar, you can create an enchantment that measures time by its interval.

- The Maya studied magical transportation and built an archway, as well as a controller device that would allow them to create a portal to elsewhere in the universe. They used it to flee from some unknown threat, and the arch was discovered by a group of magical conquistadores. Instead of preserving it, they fiddled with it and succeeded to open a portal, but destroyed the controller in the process, creating a connection that was only an entryway, with no exit anywhere. A paradoxical hollow tube that has only one hole at the top, and sort of just stops in midair. Only that midair is whatever place outside of existence the tube runs through. What appears as a veil over its surface is really distortions of the air as it comes into contact with the charged event horizon of the portal. The whispers are anyone's guess.

- They also stole the secrets that formed the foundation of european magical transportation. These secrets were so advanced and based on such complex arithmancy and astronomy that the people who derived floo travel and apparition from it were like children in the sand. Those two are basically hacked-together parts of like ten different distinct forms of travel, all of which would be comparable to phoenix travel.
