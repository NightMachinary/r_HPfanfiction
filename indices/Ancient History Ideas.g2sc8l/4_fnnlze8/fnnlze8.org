Slightly early but the great Bronze age collapse 1200-1150 BCE (?). Most of the major Bronze age civilizations ended in a few decades. Weirder still, a bunch of ones in the new world ended in the same period.

Vaguely remember one in Mexico that was pretty much the ashes of their cities being swept into the garbage, which also happened in at least one of the Med ones.
