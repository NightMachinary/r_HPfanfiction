There is Mount Vesuvius' eruption in 79 CE which completely killed the population of Pompeii. The early days of the Bubonic Plague could have been has rough to the wizarding population as it was to the Muggles since I think it was the first plague introduced to Europe, but I'm really not sure. This isn't pre-Early Modern history, but we know there was an epidemic of Dragon Pox in wizarding Britain during the First Wizarding War which did kill Fleamont and Euphemia Potter. There was Atlantis and all that story, but I think it's way too old for what you're searching. The Mongols failed abyssally when they tried to conquer Japan with both time the elements battling them and two hurricanes destroying their fleet.

That's all I can think for now on the top of my head.
