I don't know the first fic that did it, but it doesn't really seem like an idea that would have a specific progenitor. It's roots are probably traced back to other works of fiction. I've seen it attributed to Star Wars before, but I don't know the validity of that.

It's one of my least favorite tropes. Like, Voldemort is only a Dark Lord because that's why he styled himself as. Grindelwald was referred to as the Dark Wizard Grindelwald. Dark magic isn't even a branch of magic like Charms or Transfiguration, it's just a label.
