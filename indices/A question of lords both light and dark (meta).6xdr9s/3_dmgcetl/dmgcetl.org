The first time I saw this concept was in Lightning on the Wave's 7 part series. I have yet to find a series or fanfiction that goes as far in depth as they did for their Harry/Connor Potter series. The depth of Light and Dark Lords, and the frequent inadvertently mentioned differences between good and evil in J.K. Rowling's canon, and associating evil with dark magic, makes sense that there is such a thing as light magic and Lords as well.
