Saaame !! If you generally like contrast stories with a more possessive female character vs Harry who is a bit softer I would also highly recommend

Rude to Stare Harry has always been used to staring, but recently a certain person's stare has an unusual emotion behind it. Now, if only he could figure out who it belongs to. ONESHOT
