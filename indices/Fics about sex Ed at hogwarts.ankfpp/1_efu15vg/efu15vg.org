The only stories I know have other students as "mentors" for the subject. Including mandatory practical lessons.

One is called "Hermione teaches the boys a lesson" and has Hermione teaching a bunch of OCs a practical lesson. Rather odd, and I heard people claim that she is, in fact, a teacher in this one. It is certainly set after the war, but no further specification is made.

There are a few more - no link due to underage - One is called "Training with the Quidditch Chasers" and rather cringe-worthy because it feels American (circumcision, overall language is not British) and the overall premise is the three chasers teaching the trio how to shag.

Even worse we have one where Harry is 13 and the story is of even more dubious quality - but if you really want to read/suffer through it, look for "Sex Education -- Hogwarts' Style" by the author Harry50.
