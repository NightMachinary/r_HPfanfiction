Linkffn(A Black Comedy)

Not a lot of interaction between Harry and Snape, like at all. Seems to be canon until fifth year, and the events between then and the current time of the story (about ten years later) are revealed throughout the story. It's a comedy (obviously) so if you're looking for a more serious fic it might not be for you, but it has the Veil being a portal to an alternate HP universe, with the first chapter showing Harry studying it to find out where Sirius went, and falling into it himself. I wouldn't call the characters OOC, mostly because other than Harry and Sirius all of them are from a different timeline, and Harry is from a decade ahead of canon time, though I do think the characters are written well and I really like the relationship between Harry and Sirius. The main complaints I've heard is that it's more of a bro comedy with too much American influence and the humor can get pretty crude, but the plot is well constructed and the comedy suits my tastes.
