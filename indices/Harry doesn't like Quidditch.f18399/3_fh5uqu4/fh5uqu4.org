Well - Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, from Methods of Rationality, dislikes Quidditch but enjoys flying. However, it's a relatively minor plot point in a very large story. And quite a lot of readers hate his guts.

He is, unquestionably, nothing like Harry from canon (and there is actually an in-story reason why he's so radically different, but you have to read most of the story to find it, and since it's over half a million words, the people who don't like him often don't feel like doing that). He's arrogant, too quick to dismiss people whom he deems less intelligent, and for all his talk about rational behavior, he does a lot of dumb stuff, which does come back to bite him in the rear. He is, however, loyal and generous to his friends, and genuinely cares about making the world a better place for everyone.

If you do want to try it, I recommend [[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-HPMOR][expanded introduction]].
