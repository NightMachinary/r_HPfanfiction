[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse linkffn(10685852)]]: The Order summons a MoD Harry who was basically a god.

That was the only HP story I can remember where Harry is god that isn't a crossover. For the crossovers most of these don't actually need context to understand.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fate's Gamble linkffn(9586702)]]: This is Harry ramping up into godhood, it's pretty long at 900k+ words. There's also an incomplete sequel which is basically Harry fucking around in another universe where he was summoned to kill Voldemort, it's pretty entertaining. This is a crossover with Fate, context is useful, but the author explains everything.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10067222/1/Black-Blood-Wizard][Black Blood Wizards linkffn(10067222)]]: This is technically a one-shot. Harry isn't a god in this, but he's the closest thing there is to a god in the soul eater universe. If you know soul eater this is a pretty good read since literally everything in the fandom is a soulxmaka story and this isn't.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/1/Blood-is-not-family][Blood is not family linkffn(11589304)]]: Again Harry is not a god, but basically is; also still technically a one-shot, just multiple endings. This is a F.E.A.R crossover, I'm pretty sure you don't really need to know F.E.A.R for this as it's a video game and I read this without knowing anything about F.E.A.R. If you do know F.E.A.R then Harry is literally just a second Alma.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10596643/1/Harry-Potter-God-of-Gods][Harry Potter: God of Gods linkffn(10596643)]]: High School DxD crossover. Harry is literally the biblical god. I feel context is probably necessary here unless you can make sense of convoluted anime plot lines without actually watching the shows.
