A few older stories:

I find them incredibly boring, but the million-word [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise Over Britain]] and sequel fit what you requested. A shorter piece by the same authors is /Parallels/.

Pretty much any novel-length story by [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] on the same site evolves into God-like Harry.

Also, linkffn(The Awakening Power by sib-ff).
