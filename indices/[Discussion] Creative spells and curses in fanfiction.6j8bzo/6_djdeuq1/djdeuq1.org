There are a lot of new spells in White Squirrel's /Arithmancer/ and /Lady Archimedes/, since Arithmancer Hermione keeps inventing them. Three examples: She weaponizes /Commotio Cordis/ with a spell of the same name, which makes the Death Eaters think she's managed to re-create the Killing Curse for a while. There's also a special Locking Charm that is actually transfiguration (welding the lock and padlock) rather than holding the lock in place like usual locking charms, which means no regular Unlocking Spell can cancel it. The latest chapter also had a Night-Vision Spell that increases the receptivity of the retina, allowing one to see all the stars in the night sky.
