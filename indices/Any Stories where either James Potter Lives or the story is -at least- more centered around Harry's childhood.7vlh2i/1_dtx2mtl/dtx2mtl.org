Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern). Not quite what you're asking for, but James figures into it.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dream Come True by grand admiral chelli). Voldemort banished James to hell, but he comes back. I didn't like this one.

There's another one I can't remember the name of, but Harry is the BWL and has a twin (or at least a brother). Lily doesn't love James, but married him at Dumbledore's urging. She wants to go with Dumbledore's plans for their safety, but James decides otherwise. He ends up raising the boys on his own.
