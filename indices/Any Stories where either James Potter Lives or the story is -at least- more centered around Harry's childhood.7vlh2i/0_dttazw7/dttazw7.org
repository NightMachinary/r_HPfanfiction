As far as whether I would read that story, it really depends on what the plot is. James surviving isn't really a plot, it's something that happened in the past.

As far as I know, there aren't that many people that will turn down a good story just because it has James Potter in it.

If James surviving is your only search parameter, off the top of my head, linkffn(2913149; 11191235)
