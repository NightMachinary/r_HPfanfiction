I participated in the QLFC for season 4. I was Seeker for the Falmouth Falcons. (My name on FFN is Sunne [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Esunne][https://www.fanfiction.net/~sunne]]) DoTheThingAnyway gives a really good breakdown of how the competition works. Participating in the QLFC was one of the most invaluable things I have done for my writing. It has made me think about plot structure and characterization differently and it has really improved my sentence structure. The people I have met are awesome and I love the team that I had. We really bonded and it really felt like a group of tight-knit friends despite the fact that we were literally around the world from each other.

It's intense though. You are writing a short story every 2 weeks and you have to really commit. The QLFC is not a short competition. Season 4 lasted a whole year (I'm told it's the longest this competition has ever run). You have to ask yourself if you are able and willing to do this for possibly a year because you have a team depending on you.

If you end up doing it though, spend time getting to know everybody. There's a lot of role playing in the changing rooms which is fun. Be open to feedback and constructive criticism. And have fun!

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me anything. I'm not participating this season, but I'll lurk.
