What would you like to know about it?

I helped run the comp for the first few seasons and then participated as a player in a season or two.

You basically sign up for a team/position before the season begins. You have team threads where you can organise things, but these threads often turn into just giant group chats when everyone becomes friendly. When the season starts, rounds will come out one by one. Your team will be assigned another team to "play" against. Each position will have a different prompt to follow or task to fulfil in writing their story. Seekers must get their stories in asap, first one in earns their team extra points. Every round is different, prompts are unique, and the rounds continue on knocking teams out week by week until the finals. Fics are scored by a team of judges with a set rubric, who will send the results to the current comp host. Scores are tallied, the team with the highest combined score wins, and continue on to the next round. I think rounds are two weeks long? But I can't remember for sure.

It's a lot of fun, and you make some really great friends. I have friends from all over that I still talk to daily four years later. Would definitely recommend taking part at least once :)
