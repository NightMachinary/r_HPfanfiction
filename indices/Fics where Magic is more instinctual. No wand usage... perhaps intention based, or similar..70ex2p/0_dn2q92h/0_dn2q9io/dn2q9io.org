  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

  Before Izaya was an omniscient informant, he was an omniscient informant in training. Naturally, he sharpens his technique by stabbing the rest of the population with it. Over and over. Collection of oneshots, wide timeline. Shizaya if you squint. Part 9: Shizu-chan was supposed to kill him. That was the plan. To be perfectly honest, that was always the plan.
