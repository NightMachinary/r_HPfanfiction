Do not go in expecting serious plot or really any challenge to Harry. I just finished rereading it and a few times he acts really bratty, basically just telling everybody that they're wrong and stupid and hers right and smart and good. Flat out sasses Dumbledore and yells at him like a 3 year old and he just takes it and does what Harry said to do.
