May as well join in. May I offer my [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][Harry of El]] series where Voldie keeps returning and since he uses a technique that lets him shred his victims souls and use the bits to fill in the gaps in his own, each time he returns, he's closer to sane and even more cunning.

Voldie even manages to team up with Grindlewald ^{in Book 3} and together, they recruit several Obscurials to act as their elite forces.

Oddly, due to a completely logical mistake with regard to a scrying spell that they used, Voldie and Grindle reach the conclusion that Harry is the Last Son of /Atlantis/...
