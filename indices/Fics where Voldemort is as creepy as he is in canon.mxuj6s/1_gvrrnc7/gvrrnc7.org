Voldemort from the Prince of Slytherin is /scary/, physically and otherwise. He's magically changed his appearance to be more snakelike, but even if he looked normal he'd still be terrifying for other reasons.

Oh also some notes on the fic:\\
* A lot of people (myself included) dislike the prologue\\
* James and Jim start out kinda shitty, but they do get better\\
* the story is /long/. Over a million words and we're only at the Quidditch World Cup before the start of Fourth Year
