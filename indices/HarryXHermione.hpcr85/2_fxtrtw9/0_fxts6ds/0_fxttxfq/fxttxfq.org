I mean, they do it in Escape, which has some of the better written Grangers (keeping with the theme of amazing side characters. Percy, Fred, and George also get in on this action.)

Off the top of my head, I can recall a few:

- 'Banking/Betting on Her', where he stays with the Grangers during GoF. It involves him going to a muggle ball in a tux instead of the Yule Ball? Romance the whole time.
- There is one where Hermione/Parents are nudists. Cause that is how you want to set up your romance ...
- I seem to recall a power trip Harry one that did this. McGonagall ends up committing suicide in a ministry cell? May also be betting on her...
- Pretty much every fic that does "Dr Granger recognizes abused child from medical training's thing with Harry?
- I also know of a few "Harry is adopted by Grangers", usually a subset of "Harry meets Hermione before Hogwarts". No good ones come to mind. Maybe Accidental Animagus if I recall? Vox maybe? I am sure there is a thread on this you can find. *
