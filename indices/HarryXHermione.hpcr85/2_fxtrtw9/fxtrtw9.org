I second Escape (see [[/u/crystalldaddy][u/crystalldaddy]] post for link). However, that one it is really the side characters that carry the day. Harry/Hermione themselves are a bit of a flawless power couple.

I also strongly req "Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire". It is also one of the fics that feels most 'canon-like' to me.

  Extra 'points' if you know of any where Harry stays with hermione and her parents instead of The Dursleys.

I have to admit, I dislike this setup as a romance. At least when it happens long before the romance (ie, Harry lives with the Grangersbfrom second/third year). It leads to either creepily young romances or way too strongly signaled romances.

I find that setup is better for 'BFF' Harry/Hermione, where they get super close but not romantically involved with each other.
