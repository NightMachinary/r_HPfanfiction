I've been working on a HP fic for a few months now and am introducing some new textbooks. I can easily see Hermione picking these up and reading them:

- Astronomy: /A Survey of the Heavens/ by Sete Bluege Lodol\\
- Care of Magical Creatures: /The Monster Book of Monsters/ and /The Monsterphobe's Book of Less Monstrous Monsters/ by Clete Tarragon
- Muggle Studies: /A World Apart: Exploring the Muggle Way of Life/ by Sunny Burton

I also have some non-textbook books that will appear. I'm only including the non-plot-related ones:\\
- /The Innate Famliar/ by Joleen Warton\\
- /Hell-Broth Boils/ by Ceit Hamet
