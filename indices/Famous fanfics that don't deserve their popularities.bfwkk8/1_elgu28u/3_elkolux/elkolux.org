I'm embarrassed to say that I read this right through while it was being written and gave it a number of good reviews along the way.

It was the literary equivalent of cooking frogs - it actually started pretty well and by the time it had become unutterably shit I was already too invested and had to follow through to the end. By which time I wasn't leaving good reviews any more.
