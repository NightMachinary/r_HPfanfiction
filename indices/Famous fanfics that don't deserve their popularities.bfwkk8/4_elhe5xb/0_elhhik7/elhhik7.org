I have a liking for Harry/ Daphne (always liked the idea of a lover from the other side) and I have a pretty big resistance to bad writing, but this fic is one of the few I was not able to finish.

I don't even remember anything to save with it (bad plot, lack of restrain with some scene like the one in the premise and the writing was . . . flat)
