I remember I followed this story like three years back and called the author out for having every female character in the story be bisexual, while every male one was straight. They gave some response about how Sirius was also but but just coincidentally had only been in straight relationships over the course of the fic. Yeah ok That said, the Triwizard Tournament arc in this story was actually one of my favorite 4th year fics
