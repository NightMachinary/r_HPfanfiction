I actually really liked the way she was written. I didn't find her passive, just more reserved than canon Harry in a way that is consistent with her being a girl and raised by the Dursleys. She still maintains strong loyalty to her friends, cares about others and has a people saving thing. She speaks her mind when it matters and still has the sarcastic and sassy side.

There are a lot of fem!Harry fics about that make Harry super OP and outgoing and I liked the fact that this fic didn't go that in that direction.

Although the main reason I liked the fic may be because I found her experiences as a girl to be very relatable. The way she experiences Hogwarts life and friendships as a slightly awkward tomgirl was well written and really captured growing up for me.
