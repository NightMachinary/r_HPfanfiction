Gryffindors---the type that brashly rushes in. Even Hermione fits (SPEW, for example). I never found the canon main characters to be relatable, but that's part of their character. Yes, normal people /are/ probably much more passive, but that's also why the biographies of normal people aren't published as bestsellers.

A more reserved Harry would probably /not/ belong in Gryffindor, and instead be in Hufflepuff. Think Cedric Diggory type.
