Well, the machine translations generally do botch grammar a bit for context-specific languages, which is one thing (and you can fix that some if you know enough and have access to a dictionary, though generally I think it's better to just copy-paste the whole thing into your Japanese text editor of choice and check the meaning of kanji you do not know and then just translate as you go), but the author botched basic spelling which is ... wow.

And, for the benefit of those who don't want to read it to protect their brains from it, I'm not talking about things stemming from differences in the romanisation used, but rather about things like “wa tashi” (“watashi” is a single ideogram, so separating that into two words is ... how does that even happen?) and “des” (there's no “s” syllable in Japanese, only “su” because when you want the last vowel to be inaudible you usually go with “-u”). The whole phrase in which it appears is clearly something you can only see in basic language learning books, with the whole “watashi no namae ha [insert name] desu”, so clearly the author hasn't really moved beyond the very basics that would require them to copy-paste, which makes it even more baffling. I could go further and dissect the whole thing by stating that it's also unrealistic for someone presented as a boy in mafia to use “watashi” instead of “boku”, or even “ore” depending on the age, and that the author seems to be lacking any kind of knowledge about Japanese culture and that they are treating it as more or less a fad.
