Quirrel is Voldemort (surprise, surprise.) Voldemort kidnaps Harry, throws Dumbledore through the mirror of Erised, steals the stone, brings back Hermione as Troll-Unicorn-Girl hybrid, then Harry decapitates all the Death Eaters with carbon nanowire. Then they make Harry essentially the king of Wizarding Britain, it turns out Sirius Black in Azkaban is actually Peter Pettigrew, and Harry fixes all the Wizarding World's problems.
