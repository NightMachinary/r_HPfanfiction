The funniest thing about MoR fics is that they're either horrifically mediocre or they explicitly incorporate pointing out how terrible MoR is.

For example, 1 MoR fic is called Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence and it involves Hariezer Yudotter founding a cult and trying to feed all of humanity to a basilisk.

Another is called Significant Digits, and within the first chapter Harry reflects on how his actions in MoR had "the confidence of a first year psychology student" and how the only reason he hadn't destroyed the world was because Dumbledore literally knew the future.
