Well, not exactly what you are asking, but there is this one. Here Harry and Voldemort travel to different universes/times and wreck havoc until eventually they end up back in their original universe just after Voldemort killed Lily. They then proceed to have some fun. Includes obviously different timeline and a very concerned Dumbledore(he doesn't know what's really up). It is slash, though it isn't a main part of the fic. Linkao3(full circle)
