When I first got into fanfics, I loved reading the cliche stories where HP is the first person to be nice to them ever, or like remembers Griphook and makes a goblin BFF.

Now, some of my favorite portrayals are them as bloodthirsty warriors who want to exterminate wizardkind. I like the ones where HP gets one over on them in one way or another.
