You've given me an idea; goblins who aren't a warrior culture, but an artistic one.

They purposefully practice painting, music, architecture, writing, etc, to undermine the 'brute caricature' that's previously been attributed to them by supremacist wizards; the ornate structure of Gringotts, marble and gold, their rhyming poetry, even the fine make of what weapons and armor they use...all with the goal to undermine the popular notion that they're a vicious and warlike people.
