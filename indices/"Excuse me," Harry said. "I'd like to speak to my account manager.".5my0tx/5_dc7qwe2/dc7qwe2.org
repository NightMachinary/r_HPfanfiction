Neither appeals to me really. I prefer goblin-centric goblin that are embroiled in an unending series of inter-tribal conflicts. Wizards are rather unimportant to them (except as possible tools in their latest campaign against whatever tribe they are fighting at that moment) and Gringott is merely a prominent trophy to whatever tribe controls the bank, with some added perks like easier access to wat meagre resources the goblins would be interested in the wizarding world can provide -- mainly manpower, mercenaries to fight for them (known to the wizards under the euphemism "curse breakers").

Strict rules of formal politeness wizards can't even start to fathom rule goblin interactions and wizard behaviour is unbearably annoying to them (the habitual politeness of British muggles somewhat less so) and scamming them is a casual pastime as well as a coping mechanism ("a fool and his money...").
