"Lord Potter-Slytherin-Peverell-Gryffindor, Heir of Black. You are eight-hundred-twenty-seven years overdue in your account maintenance charge, just as long in your guard-dragon rental charge, we have a six-hundred-fifty years old bill from your Account Manager and one fine for the illegal captivity of a sphinx as a guard under the Dark Creature Act of 1577. With the activation of your Lordhsips you have overtaken responsibility for all of this, Mr.Potter. With overdue-punishments, administrative charges and late notice charges, you owe us fifteen million, two-hundred thousand, seven-hundred and sixty nine Galleons, four Sickles and five Knuts."
