Unless it's like [[/u/ajford]]'s comment, where the goblins are nasty, xenophobic warriors with a fervent and unending desire to exterminate wizardkind. That actually seems closer to them in canon, and I prefer fics that characterise them as that. A race of hellish warrior midgets in near-complete control of wizarding Britain's economy makes for a good addition to any fic IMO.
