To be fair, in the first book Hagrid tells Harry that "goblins aren't the friendliest of folk."

Given Hagrid's warm-and-fuzzy feelings towards dragons, Cerberuses, acromantula, hippogriffs, blast-ended screwts, giants, and pretty much every XXXXX-rated creature in the book, perhaps Harry should have taken this for the 'big red neon flashing warning light' that it actually is.
