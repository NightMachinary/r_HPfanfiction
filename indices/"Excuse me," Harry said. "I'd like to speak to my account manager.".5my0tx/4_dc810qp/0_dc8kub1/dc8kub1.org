I mean, clearly one of Flitwick's ancestors must've treated Goblins with some sort of respect.

Probably.

Oh God. Now I'm considering all the horrible ways his first cross-species ancestor was conceived.

And it's quite likely that Dumbledore got heaps of rewards and 'thank-you' gifts for defeating Grindelwald and ending that war. Considering it was a war in Europe, and he was just a school teacher, things must've been pretty bleak. Granted, Dumbles isn't the type of man to /keep/ any of it, but if he were, then he wouldn't need to steal off little orphan boys. He'd be the type to end up with a regular stipend from the government as a war hero or something, milking it for all he was worth, if he were manipulative!Dumbledore.
