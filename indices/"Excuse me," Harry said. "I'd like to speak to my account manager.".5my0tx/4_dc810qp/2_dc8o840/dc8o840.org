I think the complicatiom arises when you decide how much, exactly, control they have over the economy.

It's not an exaggeration to say that throughout human history, banks have weilded tremendous power. Subtle power, but power.

Then add to that the fact that goblins explicitly have a nasty history with wizards (all those wars), plus the fact that neither race seems to trust the other all too much.

Even guys like (Bill, i think?) In DH tell Harry, "look, goblins aren't evil or dishonorable, but they have a different view of honor and morality than we do."
