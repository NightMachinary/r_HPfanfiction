Something else that's silly: you mean to tell me that in all of Goblin-Human history, not one person has treated Goblins with respect, nor has one person called a Goblin by their given name? That's just silly--even more so for an 11 year old to just waltz in, say some words, and then become Super Lord Percival Jesus Abraham Deus Ex Machina Potter Black Riddle Hufflepuff via the magic of Goblin bullshit.

I don't think Goblins are that complicated: they provide a crucial service (banking) with great benefit to themselves. To take a non-magic example: you're a banker, and for whatever reason, you're hated by your local community. A kid wanders in, says "Hello Mr Stiffdick" with a polite smile on his face. Sure, no one's ever said your name before, nor even given you the pleasure of a smile. Will you immediately bend over and pronounce this kid as the lord and savior of everything? No. At most, you'll treat the kid with the mirrored respect you receive. He is, after all, just another customer. Even if he's the King of England, Spain, and France--he's still just a customer, and you're still just a banker.

Or something else that bothers me in fanon: Dumbledore being the account manager and stealing money (with optional Weasley participation). As far as I know from canon and from normal banking laws, Harry's funds (inherited from his parents) would've been placed in a trust, accessible only once he turned 17, or by a guardian (the Dursleys, but they never went to Gringotts, so it's a moot point), or to otherwise pay for school supplies (I imagine there's a strict, binding credit limit on his account until the age of 17). Dumbledore was not Harry's guardian, and so unless if the late Potters wrote in their wills "Dumbledore can take money out FOR THE GREATER GOOD at any time for any reason", he has no way of accessing the money. Goblins to me would respect the harsh finality of wills and other contracts, which means that they would uphold the Potter will. Which, leaves out: why. Why does the most powerful living wizard need access to a few extra ducats? You'd think--with all his inventions, his salaries, and his just general awesomeness, that he'd be rich. Or, at least, well off enough to live without need of other's funds. Don't forget: Dumbledore lives rent-free, with zero expenses, at Hogwarts.
