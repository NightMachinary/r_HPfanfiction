Most stories that make a point of having Harry be attractive tend to err on the side of wish fulfillment, but here is a small list of stories that I think are palatable:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel][/Whiskey Time Travel/]]: Adult, Unspeakable Harry is thrown into the past.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]]/: Harry raised by Sirius.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][/Grow Young With Me/]]: Future AU where Ginny dies and Harry is left as a single father.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12240216/1/Rogue-s-Bet][/Rogue's Bet/]]: Tom Riddle never became Voldemort so Harry was raised outside of a war.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1300829/1/][Aren't Little Girls Made of Sugar and Spice?]]/: Harry becomes a quidditch star after Hogwarts.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]]/: An older story that hasn't aged that well, but is featured in the DLP library.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]]/: Adult Harry & Sirius engage in AU shenanigans.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]/: Harry being attractive is only mentioned once or twice, but I really, really like this story.

I was going to add /Salvation in Shadow/ by Odev, even with it being one of the ultimate guilty pleasure fics, but the author seems to have pulled it off of FF.Net. I have a .epub backup of the story, so if anyone wants it just PM me.
