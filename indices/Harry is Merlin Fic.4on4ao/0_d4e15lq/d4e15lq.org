The two closest fics I can think of are:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] linkffn(9860311) - Female Harry sent back through time. She isn't Merlin, but she is Morgana and incidentally, paired with Merlin. Would recommend reading this. I was a bit iffy about female Harry at first but I ended up really enjoying it.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6289435/1/Myrddin-Emrys-Returns][Myrddin Emrys Returns]] linkffn(6289435) - Not what you're really looking for but it is a Merlin Harry and I think Daphne is Morgana, but I honestly can't remember much about this fic. Its a pretty bland fic in my opinion but maybe you'll like it.
