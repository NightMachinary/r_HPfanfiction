Canon Slytherin seems to a shithole infested with rampant bigotry and racism. No one seems to be bothered by Malfoy's actions or the image that paints of them. Not one person from there wished to stay and fight against Voldemort, which on its own says enough about that house (and evacuating civilians from an area of imminent battle is smart and right, not discrimination).

In comparison, fanon Slytherin is the house of high culture.
