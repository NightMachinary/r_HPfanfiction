Ah ya you do have to assume that the Ravenclaws you see are representative of Ravenclaws at large which isnt necessarily true but you do get some good representation in slytherin and for pottermore if you count it at all your House letter is from Merlin. And Slytherin is the evil house so i think you can still extrapolate good qualities from the limited info you get.
