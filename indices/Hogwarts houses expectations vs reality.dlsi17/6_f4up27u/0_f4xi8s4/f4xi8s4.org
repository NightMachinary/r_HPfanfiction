I mean to be fair all the house traits are common things kids wish they had or do have. So I don't think based on qualities alone Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are more likely to be big.

But I think Hufflepuff might be the biggest because while each founder had qualities they wanted in the sorting hat song Hufflepuff said she'd take everyone. Yes everyone just and fair but also everyone who has no strong leaning towards any house. And while the other 3 houses have common enough traits to have many students , they are specific enough traits that might not fit many people too.

So yes this does give Hufflepuff the reputation of being the leftover house the ones that didn't fit in anywhere else. But that's not a negative thing . It means you couldn't be put into a box. It shows flexibility and being well rounded in indicates uniqueness and individuality .

Honestly I would have loved it if Hufflepuff had no defining qualities and were initially mocked but soon were shown to be really the best house as a result of being able to explore themselves without feeling the pressure to identify with any specific qualities and became known as the house of individuality
