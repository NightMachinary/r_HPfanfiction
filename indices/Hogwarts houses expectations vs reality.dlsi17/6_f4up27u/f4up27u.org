I've always had the head canon that Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are the bigger houses.

When it comes down to it they're boring houses. A normal person who wants to do well in their new school => Ravenclaw. A normal person who hopes to have a friend in their new school => Hufflepuff. You have to be a special type of person to go to Gryffindor or Slytherin, other than those who just default there for family reasons. Stories are about special people because regular people are boring. The moment you make them proactive with the knowledge/ability they acquired then they're probably in the wrong house. If they're using it for their own reasons its a Slytherin thing, if they're doing it because its the right thing to do then that is pretty Gryffindorish.

Since in my mind Ravenclaws and Hufflepuff are full of normal regular people who just happen to be witches and wizards then it makes sense for them to not interact with Harry all that much and we see 95% of the books from his perspective. Harry is special, he does special things. He tends to interact with special people.

Take fifth year, when the DA started is when we see Harry branch out a bit. We see some regular Ravenclaws, they come they study they leave. Its only the special/bizarre one who sticks around. Its not that they don't want to know more, its that they're normal people who are just more focused on academics than others.

Being sorted into Ravenclaw doesn't make anyone a genius any more than Neville gets over his fears instantly because he went to Gryffindor. Its about goals and values.
