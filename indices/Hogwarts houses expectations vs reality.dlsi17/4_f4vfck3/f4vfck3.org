I think that we see many of the more egregious examples of this house or that house, but rarely focus on everyone else who I think are in fact the majority. Remember how the hat goes about sorting Harry for instance? It doesn't say 'you have 25% courage vs 11% intelligence, therefore you go to GRYFFINDOR!' I imagine some people (see: Lily, Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy) have such exemplary showing of one house or the other, but in the overwhelming number of cases its the Sorting Hat merely eliminating each House to find the one that fits the kid more appropriately. Most sorted people are like Colin Creevey or Peter Pettigrew or Percy Weasley - that just appears to have been the best fit for their personality at the age of eleven.

And that doesn't even get into the effect of /being/ in one house or the other. Think about it - you enter a group at possibly the most impressionable period of your life, spending seven years within a group that is based specifically around certain virtues, ethics and behaviors. Of course you are going to become more like that just by existing in that (for lack of a better term) culture. And thats not even getting into the affect that peers with similar character traits will have on one another (the term group think stands out here for me). To be honest, the Houses are in many ways kind of an Orwellian nightmare of influence.

Perhaps one of the most poignant lines in all of Harry Potter was Dumbledore's "Sometimes I think we sort to early." Sorting has a profound affect on each individual, and in many ways shapes them along a particular path.
