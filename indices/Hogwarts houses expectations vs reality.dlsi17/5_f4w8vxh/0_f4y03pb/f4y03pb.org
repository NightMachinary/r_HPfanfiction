I mean wanting recognition and appreciation is knowledge for a different goal. It's a less dramatic goal than Riddle or Dumbledore but in my opinion it still is very Slytherin. Hermione might be smart but I honestly see her more of a mix of Griffindor and Slytherin than Griffindor and Ravenclaw that might actually be more like the Weasely twins. Very intelligent to be able to come up with their inventions but could care less about being recognized for good grades of applying themselves for any reason other than their passions
