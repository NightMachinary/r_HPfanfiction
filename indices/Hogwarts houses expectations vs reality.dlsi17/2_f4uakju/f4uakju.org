Hermione resembles few canon Ravenclaws because she's not an archetypical one lol. She's an archetypical Gryffindor swot. Look at Remus, McGonagall, and Percy. She fits right in with them. Intelligent and rational. Percy and Remus less so, but still.

Trelawney, Luna, Xeno, and Ollivander, who all probably are archetypical Ravenclaws, all have one thing in common: they're weird. Or eccentric. Oddballs if you will. Ravenclaw isn't just the house of wit and learning. It's also the house of eccentrics and creatives.

When I was younger I expected them to fit their houses perfectly. Only Tom Riddle and Slughorn do and that's perfect. Well rounded characters and it fits the choice theme like a puzzle piece.

If only we saw more growth...
