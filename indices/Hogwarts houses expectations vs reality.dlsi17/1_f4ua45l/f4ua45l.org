Honestly Ravenclaw gets the short end of the stick. You should have either academically savvy characters who raise their hand in class and otherwise compete with Hermione (I love hermione, but canon hermione isn't the only one who can read. There's no reason why every other student forgets how to answer questions) or characters that dive into esoteric branches of magic and otherwise push their boundaries. But they don't do literally anything except bully Luna in canon, which turns them into the mean group.... except that already belongs to the Slytherins. Do we even meet ravenclaws in the Order? Do they do anything? The fact that they're so interested in knowledge and somehow irrelevant to everything in canon is bullshit. At least the Hufflepuffs get Cedric and Tonks. I love Luna, but her personality is distinctly defined, and as a main-ish character she doesn't work well as an example of a good Ravenclaw. JKR dropped the ball
