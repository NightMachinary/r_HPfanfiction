Ok but up to (I think it was?) OOTP, you guys have got Cho. She's pretty much a jock - good at Quidditch, popular, gets the handsome boy (Cedric), and everybody generally either likes her or wants to date her. You guys also get Ollivander (which is arguably good/meh depending on your POV), so Ravenclaw isn't exactly dry on good/established characters. But I do get your point, they're not as great as the characters we have in Gryffindor.

Also, may I suggest the Anguis series by Slide (since this is a HPFF subreddit), she creates really good OCs, and in it is a spunky lil Ravenclaw called Nat Lockett - she's smart, popular, cute, and most importantly, doesn't buy very much into house biases and prejudices (but she's also far from perfect - see her traumatised characterisation in the Stygian Trilogy)
