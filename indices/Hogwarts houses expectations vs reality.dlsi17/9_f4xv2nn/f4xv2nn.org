There's Ernie, the pompous Hufflepuff. And the ones that were cruel to Harry during GoF. That doesn't seem to mesh with the general accepting, friendly stereotype they have.

It's difficult as a reader to think too long on the house system and make sense of it. Cause what we're told (by the hat, character preconceptions, etc) is mostly stereotypes and those obviously aren't great for truly understanding a group, in any setting.

Honestly, I like to think that the actual sorting doesn't say that much about people. Most 11 year olds are probably nearly blank slates in regards to their house qualities, anyway. The importance given to the specific differences between the houses is only so heavy because people (students, alum, etc) regard it as such.

I imagine the sorting hat sorts people in certain houses based on balancing numbers, staff availability, etc as much as anything else.

And in terms of attributes, I imagine it's like liberal arts colleges choosing students in essence - certain schools may value a person creative initiative, others may care more about the gpa's, others still may look for certain extracurriculars or legacies. That doesn't mean that there aren't all sorts of different people in all of these schools. I know it's not a perfect analogy, but it's the best I can come up with at the moment.

So the hat will consider a few things when sorting, but all in all, these gifts and differences are a lot less pronounced (at the very least during the beginning) than the school culture gives it credit for.

That's how I've come to (kind of) make sense of it, anyway. I know this doesn't directly answer your question but it felt tangentially relevant.
