Eight Times she had tried, eight times she had failed, in the span of two months, she had tried drowning, poisoning, electrocution, spell traps, snakes, wolves and even dropping a piano on him(how that had gone wrong would ever evade her).

And every single time, in some cruel twist of fate, she was the one who almost died.

And the worst of all, he /always/ had ended up saving her.

It was embarrassing, and now Tracey wouldn't even speak to her.

She would not be bound against her will to him. Even if he was stupidly noble, even if he always smiled at her or always had a gentle word to say, even if he never asked for anything after saving her life, she would choose her husband, no matter what.

She was finishing her next plan, it was bold and dangerous, but he would never escape that large quantity of blast powder detonating near him. And then she would be free.

"You know, I don't think that will work"

She immediately turned around, wand in hand, but there was nothing there, even the revealing spell showed nothing.

"I also don't think the library is a proper place to plan an assassination you know, Hermione would be scandalized"

She turned back and now /he/ was seated across from her, with that damnable smirk. How? And now he knew, what would he do? Had he called the Aurors, was he here to kill her?

She decided to pretend nothing was wrong.

"What do you want, Potter?" she asked with a blank face.

He smiled that secret smile of his like he knew something she didn't.

"Oh, I don't know, I just wanted to check up on you, to see if you were okay" She flushed.

"Bugger off, Potter!"

He crossed his arms and placed his elbows on the table "I also wanted to ask if you had plans for this weekend, you know, it's a Hogsmeade weekend, and I wanted to know if we can skip our weekly assassination attempt and instead enjoy a butterbeer?" he raised his eyebrows with an expectant expression.

Damn him! He knew! "What's your game, Potter, why don't you just call the DMLE to arrest me, or tell Dumbledore?"

His expression darkened for a second but then cleared "Let's just say I don't have that much trust in authority figures and leave it at that, Daphne"

"And now you want to take me on a /date?/" she spoke slowly as if to a child.

"Oh, yes, you know, you could have just told me that was happening, I was pretty confused at first, thought you were working for Voldemort, even if his crowd only tried once a year, and normally near the end"

She would never work for that man, and now she wondered if the rumors about Potter where true.

"But, imagine my surprise when I receive a letter, telling me of a pending contract with your family, involving me and you, and how only my untimely death would free you" he was so blase speaking about it, like he was commenting Quidditch results.

His expression then cleared "For what it is worth, I am sorry Daphne"

"What?"

"I never wanted this for us, I mean, arranged marriage? What the hell were my grandparents thinking?"

She squeezed her hands shut, knuckles white, that old anger returning, she had always been independent, with dreams of her own, and being bound to a loveless marriage was not one of them. Her eyes burned, but she refused to cry.

"So, now what? We go on dates, to "know each other", fall in love naturally and then at 19 marry with /love?"/ Her tone indicated how much she thought of /that/.

He shrugged "Well, that was Hermione's idea you know, Ron thought it stupid, but I think my idea is better"

She raised a mocking eyebrow "Oh, really, Potter, and what is your /brilliant/ plan?"

He chuckled "Well, it's simple really, we go on a few dates, to satisfy that 'know each other' clause, and then when I reach my majority and assume Headship of the Potter family I dismiss the contract under clause 14, lack of compatibility, if you want of course"

She frowned "There are only 12 clauses Potter"

He smiled again "Well maybe on /your/ contract, the bride`s, mine has 15, clause 14 lets the Head of House Potter dismiss the contract if he decided they are not compatible after a few tries to know each other"

The more he spoke the more her face paled, "What? I-I never knew. I thought..."

His smile broadened "Well, you never asked, had you, we could've skipped the whole planned assassination phase, though I admit I had fun."

"/Fun,/ are you mad Potter?"

"Depends on who you ask, but I know your heart just wasn't in it, I mean, snakes, you do know that as a parseltmouth I am immune to most poisons? And they didn't even bite me, you're not Malfoy, so you certainly remember the Second Year"

She nodded, flushing, the last four attempts had been half-hearted she had to admit, but she was too prideful to do it.

"I honestly thought you didn't care, until my lawyer explained my contract was different, being the groom's family or something, very unfair if you ask me, but she also told me it was common practice and that the bride's family knew about that"

Daphne blanched, "I-I never asked my parents"

Harry laughed "Wait, so you read the contract, and immediately jumped in to try and kill me? Are you sure the hat didn't make a mistake?"

She flushed again, "Shut up, Potter, I am sorry if I didn't think thoroughly upon knowing I would be married against my will to someone I never knew and thought hated me"

She did not want to say the last part, but it came out before she could stop it.

He raised his eyebrow and looked into her eyes with those damnable green eyes "I never hated you, in fact, "he blushed" I always had a bit of crush on you"

She huffed "Really, Potter, not you too"

"Hey, it's not only because I think you're beautiful, because you are!" She did /not/ blush at his sincerity, it was anger "You're bloody smart too, and you don't lord it over everyone, and you've got this quiet confidence I find really cool, and that I envy a bit, I admit." he babbled a bit, before looking her in the eyes "Also, the way you protect your friends, especially Tracey, it's really cool"

She flushed again and averted her eyes "She's my friend and Blaise too, I don't care about this whole blood thing"

"I know, Tracey said so, apparently you've been doing it since second year, I only saw it a few times, my favorite one was when you kneed Malfoy between his legs, that was awesome!"

"That wasn't really har- Wait! You spoke to Tracey?"

He laughed "Oh, yes, when you were in the hospital because of that potions accident, Malfoy and his cronies tried to bully her but found me first"

She gaped "That was you? But Malfoy shot first. And he was in the hospital for a week"

Harry grinned, and Daphne thought she should be scared because it was not kind, nor merely mischievous, but she wasn`t, instead, she smiled back before she could stop herself.

"For all his talk, Malfoy is incredibly easy to rile up, sometimes all I have to is pass him by the corridor without acknowledging him, or just dismiss him outright when he starts spewing his nonsense"
