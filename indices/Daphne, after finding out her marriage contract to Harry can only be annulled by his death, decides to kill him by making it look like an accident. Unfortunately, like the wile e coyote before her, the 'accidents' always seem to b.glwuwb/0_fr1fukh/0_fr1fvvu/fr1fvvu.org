Part 2

She nodded, Tracey had been cagey about who helped her, but she should`ve known, yet, there was one question that was nagging her.

"Why?"

"Well, you know how I don`t like when he starts offending other people with all that bull-"

"No, not that" he raised his eyebrow

"Why help me?" She gestured around them "Why save me all those times, why didn`t you let me die?" The opportunity to free himself was certainly there.

He smiled a bit, and took a deep breath before looking into her eyes "Because I understand you"

"What?"

"I know what it is to have your choices taken away from you, you may not believe it, but ever since I was born, people sought to remove my choices, my freedom" he closed his fists and she could swear his eyes got a little more bright "I rarely get to do what I want to do, Voldemort, Dumbledore, my relatives, for good or ill all they seem to end up doing is locking me up, one way or another"

He closed his eyes and released a breath, she did it too, the tension had become too high back there. When he opened them he smiled, with such sincerity and intensity in his gaze Daphne couldn`t look away.

"So I can empathize with you, and who knows, maybe next year Voldemort does end up doing me in and you`re free, but before that, I would like to know the Daphne Greengrass, the girl who writes essays by day and sets up snake pits by night."

She looked away from him, she wouldn`t deny she was interested, and if she wanted to be honest with herself, she knew she wouldn`t succeed, somehow Potter always escaped, like he knew she was there, and when he didn`t he just escaped in a spectacular way, or she just botched the whole thing and then had to be saved. Perhaps there`s a better way and if anything she could just poison him during dinner.

"Fine."

Seeing his earnest expression she continued. "Yes, Potter I will go out with you this weekend, but you will dress well, no school robes, something to match a green dress and you will take me to a decent place"

"And do I have your word that you will stop trying to kill me?"

She hesitated for a moment before nodding with a sigh "Yes, I swear to stop that"

He nodded, and then the secret smile returned "Good, I wouldn`t want you to activate clause 15"

"15?"

"Yep, it's a whole paragraph of legal stuff, but Andi said that basically if you willingly kill me, even indirectly, you die too, apparently you weren`t the first to think of your solution, though she said sometimes witches just didn`t care and went with it"

Her eyes widened, she never knew that! Why wasn`t that on /her/ contract? Were they supposed to be read together? The lawyer she consulted via owl never said such, but they also said they didn`t have experience with high level marriage contracts, she had decided not to ask others because she wanted to avoid leaving a paper trail.

She felt a hand on her shoulder and looked up at Potter who was looking concerned "You okay?"

She nodded "I will be, thank you, Potter"

"Good, so, are we still up?"

"Yes, Potter, we are, be at the Entrance Hall at 4 pm on Saturday"

He smiled "Awesome, and please call me Harry, see you later Daphne, nice talking to you" he rose from the chair and went to the entrance.

She nodded still shaken "The same Pot-Harry" she tested the name, and then looked down at her latest plan, the formulae and diagrams mocking her before she ripped the parchment in little pieces and then vanished them.

She released a massive breath, the stress and tension finally coming out, she didn't know why, but she believed P-Harry.

She rose from her chair, picking up the books, she needed to talk to Tracey, then write to her parents, and then sleep for twelve hours.

2 YEARS LATER

Daphne stood with Harry at Gringotts, a white golden parchment was in his hands, he was dressed in formal black robes, his golden signet ring was glinting in the light, but he still had that same smile.

"Ready?" he asked.

Her breath caught, and she held in her tears, they were free from Voldemort(who had died buried by bricks while distracted by Harry flying in a Hebridian Black, her one assassination plan that succeeded).

"Ready" she choked.

"I, Harry James Potter, Head of House Potter, dismiss this contract," he said before his ring gleamed and the contract started burning from the center with blue flames, in a few seconds it was gone, only ashes remained.

Harry cleaned his hands, "Done, Daphne, we're free, you are free" he looked at her then, she looked back, her face blank.

She was free, after months of stress and lost sleep, two months of trying to kill him, two years of an emotional rollercoaster, of fighting Voldemort, and now she was free, she could make her own choices, she could do whatever she wanted to do.

So she kissed him.

Too fluffy I know, but that is just my mood today.
