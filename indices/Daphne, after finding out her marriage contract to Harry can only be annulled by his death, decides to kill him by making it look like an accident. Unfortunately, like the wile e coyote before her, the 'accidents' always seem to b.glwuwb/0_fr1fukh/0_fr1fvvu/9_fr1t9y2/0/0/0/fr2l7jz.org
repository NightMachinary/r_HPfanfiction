Ah, I get it, I think.

I just imagined this Harry as being awfully skilled, having things like the Cloak and Map, Daphne absolutely panicking and under lots of stress(that's why her traps were so bad) so by the second month they were just playing a game and Daphne's heart wasn't in it.

Harry was also supposed to have a crush on her since Second Year, it only increased when she was only one of the half a dozen non-Gryffindor students who never wore a Potter Stinks badge.

He was about to take her down(because he had the Map and knew it was her) but then received the letter, hired Andi on Sirius and Tonks recommendation and things evolved from there.
