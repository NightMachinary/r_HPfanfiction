Simp, according to Urban dictionary:

#+begin_quote
  A man that puts himself in a subservient/submissive position under women in hopes of winning them over, without the female bringing anything to the table.
#+end_quote

And from a slightly more neutral source, Dictionary.com:

#+begin_quote
  Simp is a slang insult for men who are seen as too attentive and submissive to women, especially out of a failed hope of winning some entitled sexual attention or activity from them.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure where [[/u/CuriousLurkerPresent][u/CuriousLurkerPresent]] came up with the definition they provided.
