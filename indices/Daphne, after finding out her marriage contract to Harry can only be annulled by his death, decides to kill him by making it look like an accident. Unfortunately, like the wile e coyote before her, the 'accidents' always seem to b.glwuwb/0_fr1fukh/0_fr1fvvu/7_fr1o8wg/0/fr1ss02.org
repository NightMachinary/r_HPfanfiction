Wow, thank you for that, really. I really enjoyed writing this.

Both one-shots? I don't understand. Do you mean one for their talk and another two years later? I might actually revise it and publish it once I figure out how to do it on [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] and AO3

I am writing two stories at the moment, one has this pairing but without the contracts and all the attempted murder parts(they become friends earlier).
