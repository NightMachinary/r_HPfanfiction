Thank you!

No, I haven't published anything yet, I am trying to figure out how to do it and format it properly on ffn.net.

I am writing two stories at the moment, both long, one has this pairing, the other is a bit more complicated (Time Travel with Harry's soul going to be reborn as James' cousin, born to Charlus and Dorea) and requires lots of background search and worldbuilding(he's going to travel quite a bit), I will probably publish it by July/August.
