It doesn't make sense in the way its portrayed in fanfic though, they are pretty much always arrangements made generation in the past by people who would never see the marriage and wouldn't be able to benefit from it, defeating the entire purpose of an arranged marriage. And even then babies or small children are almost never used for arranged marriages, unless there is a very urgent need.

So no, neither marriage contract would make sense.
