[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: all three of them went back, the reason they could afford to do that was because [[/spoiler][they killed more than 60 Riddle minions between Dumbledore's death and start of the new school term, so that Riddle ran into serious personnel and logistic problems]]
