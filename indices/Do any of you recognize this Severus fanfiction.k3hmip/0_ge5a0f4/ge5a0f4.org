I kinda remember either this story, or a similar one. Bad news is I can't find it. I have a vague recollection of Snape either being in a hospital or mental institution. He is treated with injections and occasionally restrained. I believe the doctor treating him was a male but was acting on someone else's orders. He is rescued but is somehow recaptured. Sharing these details to see if it helps at all.
