Bit of both really. Magic with a decent explanation that isn't just "Harry trained and trained and blew Voldemort away" but rather had clear boundaries that are followed.

The main problem i'm having is actually that one spell will be focused on rather than an entire topic, so Harry will learn a really obscure spell really well and use it constantly rather than wide ranging world development.

Actually the best example I can think of are his magical arms in A Black Comedy; restrictions laid out, not too powerful other than that and he never exceeds his limitations. Voldemort even finds a way to use them agains him.
