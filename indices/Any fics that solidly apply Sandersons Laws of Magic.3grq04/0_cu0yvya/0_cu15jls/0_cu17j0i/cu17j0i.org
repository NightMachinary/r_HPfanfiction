Could well be. But yeah /my/ guess is OP is looking for something that goes in a bit into magical theory (first law- explains/sets up), doesn't make Harry godlike/OP (second law- puts Harry in a situation where the theory/knowledge/talent of the First is made null and void... only for Harry to make clever use of said theory to get around it), and expands on something canon doesn't (most everything) ie. expecto patronum has been covered but transfiguration hasn't (Third Law- no real need for inheritance, necromantic, ancient sumerian magic when the magic we know of has barely been brushed over). Though honestly that Third Law is really the biggest and probably the hardest since you know Rowling wasn't writing with the idea of fully grounding say the economy or little things like summoning water, and duplicating food/materials, altering and creating new creatures via transfiguration etc. etc.

OP - To try and provide some help- (I can never remember specific fics well enough) I think the closest you can get in general is look at Taure and the DLP- their library (5star?). In general they will have more stories relevant to the Laws/ of the magical theory expounding and try to cultivate good stories (ie. limit Harry, and expand on how magic effects the wizarding world) I'm pretty sure Taure's story Alexandra Potter(?) goes into your interests and he has a best of doc which probably has a few leaning in your direction. Otherwise search for magical theory, particular magical subjects, or certain things like wizarding world, enconomy etc.
