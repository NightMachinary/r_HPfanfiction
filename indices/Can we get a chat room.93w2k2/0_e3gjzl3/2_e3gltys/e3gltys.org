Yeah, but this is directly on reddit. Less friction. Practically zero. No one needs to install any apps, or find out the name of a group, just the mods setting it on the sub, and us using it.

EDIT: I also just have to ask, what does excessive mean in this context? How does this bother you in any way, shape or form, if it were to be implemented?
