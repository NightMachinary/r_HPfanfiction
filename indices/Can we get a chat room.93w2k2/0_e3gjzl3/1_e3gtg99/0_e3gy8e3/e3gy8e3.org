Discord and IRC are, in easy teram, chatrooms of different complexity.

IRC is really simplistic and functions in practically every browser there is with no issues. Discord on the other hand is a complex environment for chatting, with a lot of options to enhance the chat experience of its users. It can also be accessed by the browser, but it only reaches its full potential when used with the App.
