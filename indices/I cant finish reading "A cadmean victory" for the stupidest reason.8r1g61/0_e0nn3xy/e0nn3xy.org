Is your curiosity going to haunt you? Won't you just want to know how it ends? I won't lie, I've left stories before when I've not been happy with the direction the story goes in but do you think you won't be plagued by wondering what happens. I'm not sure you'd enjoy how it ends. I didn't particularly like how it ends, then again I'm not a huge fan of that story at all.
