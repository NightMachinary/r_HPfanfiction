It is true that he will lose a lot, but it won't be in vain. It is sad but entirely worth it. This fic is unique in that wgen do finally get to the end you have no idea what could happen and then you read it and realize it couldn't have happened any other way. It is incredible and my favourite fic of all time.

Finish it. It is worth the pain.
