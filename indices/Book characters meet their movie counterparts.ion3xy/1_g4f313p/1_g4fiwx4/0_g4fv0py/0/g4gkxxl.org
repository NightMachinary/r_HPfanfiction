Book Luna is also social akward aside from her conspiracy theories. There are moments in the book where she laughs at inappropriate times and much to loud. She doesn't seem to have a internal understanding of things which are appropriate to say and which are not. The dreamy Movie Version of her had cut much of the characters substance that I really loved in the books.\\
Edit: Oh, and Neville isn't her love interest in the books like in the movies.
