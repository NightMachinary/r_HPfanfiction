Movie!Luna is actually a fair bit different.

She doesn't mention any conspiracy theories.

She is much less argumentative...largely because there's far fewer of her conspiracies.

There's no Luna commentating the Quidditch match.

She also has her shoes stolen so she has to walk barefoot--In the books, Luna is never described as barefoot. Her clothes are sometimes stolen, but the implication I always got was that it was stuff that could be easily missed--a hat, gloves, a scarf, etc.
