linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14824227/chapters/34306017]]) Disturb the Universe has Harry being adopted by Tony DiNozzo from NCIS, and is fantastic.

linkao3(591278) This fic is in a similar vein but it's Hermione being raised by Hotch from Criminal Minds. One of the most well written fics I've ever read in any fandom.
