Just make the Hallows normal items that are the best they can be. Say that legends puffed them up more than they are.

Or, make their true purpose be soul-based. Wand can empower spells to find/destroy souls (Dementors/ghosts can count here). Stone summons deceased souls. And the cloak can hide your soul (Dementors/wraith cant see you, Avada Kedavra doesn't work if it hits the cloak)

This would repurpose the Hallows into something useful, but doesn't make him an OP killing machine. He would still have to duel Voldemort.
