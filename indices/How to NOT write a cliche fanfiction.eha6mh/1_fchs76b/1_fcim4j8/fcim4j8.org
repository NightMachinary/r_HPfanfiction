To add to this. Avoid bashing. If you want someone against Harry who's on his side in canon build that character in that direction and try to still make them an interesting character.

Make the antagonists competent. If they're useless, they aren't engaging or threatening. If they're useless and still a threat, the protagonist becomes useless too, by default.

If you plan to bring in sentient magical creatures (like goblins, veela, centaurs and so on), explore how they're different from humans. Don't ignore that they aren't human and really don't shove them into a singular behaviour as if they aren't people.

If you're going to make Harry powerful, make it a gradual growth rather than flipping a switch. And avoid god mode in general, remember the above point about useless bad guys? That's still true even if they're only useless because the protagonist is untouchable.
