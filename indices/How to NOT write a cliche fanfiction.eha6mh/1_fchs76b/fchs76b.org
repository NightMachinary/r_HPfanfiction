- A 20 page will that shows EVERYTHING. Like who their secret keeper was, who ate the last piece of pie, etc. 20 bajamillionkazillion galleons. If you make him rich, don't just have it sitting in the vault, have it invested in businesses and properties. I refuse to believe that Gringotts would leave a vault of one of their biggest customers idle for almost two decades to wait for the sole beneficiary to become an adult.
- A dozen lordships. Pick two. Peverell and Heir Black. Those are plot relevant AND are the most believable of the rest. That, and they are higher ranked than the others. The rest can be traced back for other people.
- Heir of Gryffindor/Slytherin/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw. If you HAVE to go this route, don't give him a lordship. Give him something interesting, like veto power over the Board of Governors and/or Headmaster. Don't make it blood heir, magical heir maybe? He did pull the sword out of the hat. Also found the chamber of secrets + parseltongue. This is a good way to veto Umbridge. Or the Dementors.
- Multiple Animagus forms. I've only found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][ONE FIC]] where multiple forms was a thing and was believable. He took the hard way to get his form AND has to put in the same effort for every form. It wasn't some flick of a switch and BOOM! I have 20 forms.
- If he has a bind on his magic, or you want the soul fragment found early, don't have the Goblins find it. That's overdone. Create an accident that forces him to St. Mungos and then you can introduce the Goblins. You can use the basilisk venom in his blood. Have Aunt Marge's dog bite him and the dog dies from the venom. Have the blood splash some more and no more Durseleys. Can you imagine that letter? "Dear Ministry of magic. This dog bit me and now everyone in my house is dead. Who do I call? You would think that they would have a class on this for muggle born/raised students. Love, Harry Potter"
- Dumbledore. I personally enjoy every flavored Trope of Dumbledore there is. My favorite one is where Snape was manipulating him with potions, charms, etc.
- Ron - Don't intentionally dumb him down. Make him manipulative, make hima prick. Do anything with him. Just don't dumb down his character.
