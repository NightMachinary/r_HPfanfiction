  I refuse to believe that Gringotts would leave a vault of one of their biggest customers idle for almost two decades to wait for the sole beneficiary to become an adult.

You are confusing Gringotts with a Modern Bank. Vaults in Gringotts are not like account in the real world, they are more like strongboxes. You pay an opening fee, plus a maintenance fee (and even this is not confirmed in canon), and in exchange, Gringott provide you with a vault, and the promise it will never be robbed. Apart from that, Goblins could not careless about what you do with this vault, you could stack it with gold, treasures, or even shit, it's all the same to them. They do not have any access to the inside of the vaults, and even if they did, the way they treat Harry (and all the wizards they meet) during canon make me think that if they could invest for Wizards, they would intentionally select terrible investments out of spite.

For the same reason, I also dislike helfull Goblin, pretty sure that even if Goblins could deal with Horcruxe (that I already find it doubtfull), I think they reaction would be either "You have a soul fragment stuck inside you, guess you will die" or "We could deal with this soul fragment for a price sir, but you have to pay first and you only get 5% to survive the procedure".
