Yeah, no gringrotts blood adoption shenanigans or them fixing horcrux stuff. It's a bank, go to the ministry and seek legal consul and go to st. Mungos(or invent some private research hospital, anything but goblins having all the answers).

Bank wouldn't have anything to do with that business. Deeds/will/inheritence would also be under legal consul, banks have no jurisdiction aside from holding the accounts.

That's like the #1 pet peeve trope. Animagus forms also get a little crazy and super overdone. If your doing a retelling, introduce new solutions and really canon diverge. It makes no sense reading different scenarios if the problems are solved the exact same way as the actual book.
