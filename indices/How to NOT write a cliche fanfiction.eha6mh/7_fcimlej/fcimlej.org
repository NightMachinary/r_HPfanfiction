There are some cliche I like some I don't I hate Hermione loving books like a drug addict loves crack that's just stupid also her admonishing everyone for their language when they say stuff like "crap" and she'd shout "Harry language!" Oh Lord however I also detest when Ron is the bad guy (which is fun sometimes) but not fun when suddenly Malfoy is the good guy?
