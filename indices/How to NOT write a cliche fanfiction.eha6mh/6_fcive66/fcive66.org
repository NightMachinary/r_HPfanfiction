Here's an odd mix of chiches and my personal preferences.

1.) Snake familiar - You can easily tell if a snake familiar is well done or cliche'd. I like that one fic where the snake helps Harry with healing magic.

2.) Goblin-friend!Harry - I dig immersion and culture, but having goblins just waiting to shower the first person who's polite to them with benefits is unbelievable in the extreme and reminiscent of the Fountain of Magical Brethren.

3.) Bashing - Outlandishly evil Dumbledore/rotten Weasley characters (almost always Ginny, Ron, Percy, Molly)/ suddenly snobbish Hermione - highly entertaining, but lazy (and frankly, quite laughable.)

4.) Billion-galleon account - I think it is reasonable to assume Harry is wealthy, but his family isn't overly old and with the exception of Henry Potter, not incredibly political.

5.) Lordships - this is more of a recent attitude of mine, but Lordships are getting a bit pretentious and drab. Give me a good election cycle for the Wizengamot any day. If you must, please keep it modest and don't give Harry sole control over half the seats of the Wizengamot.

6.) Inheritances - again, avoid Billion-galleon accounts. Also, making Harry the sole beneficiary of age old accounts belonging to Merlin or Le Fay... et cetera. If you want to, though, I have seen scenes where Harry inherits the money and possessions of families that have died out without any heirs or next of kin. In these instances they put him in their will as thanks for taking care of moldywarts.

7.) Nicknames - avoid the words: 'moldywarts', 'moldyshorts', 'dumbles', especially while not using dialogue. Using these a few times in dialogue is forgivable, but please don't overdo it and only let the twins, Sirius, James, or another comedic relief use them. Utilizing 'Tommy-boy' in reference to Voldemort is an unforgivable offense.

8.) Following canon - seriously, I'd rather read the books.

9.) Animagus - Personally, I can see Harry being a bird (which is what he mostly is in fanfic) but I want to see more four-legged mammals. Maybe a fox or a dog. The fanon process of gradually working up to a transformation, limb by limb, is just as good as the canon process (and in some fics the fan-made process is even better.

10.) Magical core - no. no. NO.

11.) Talent - don't make Harry an instant prodigy. Write him as one and develop him properly.

12.) Marriage Contracts, Veela-bond, Soul-bond - avoid the latter two if they make your characters objects or nullify their free-will. Unless you describe a magical process or they include an artifact of some sort, don't make age-old contracts magically binding.

Magical oaths - if you use these, I will roll my eyes and sigh inwardly, pretending they never happened. So mote it be. The only exception would be ceremony. Oaths of marriage or of office, even then - don't make them binding. It's a cop-out.
