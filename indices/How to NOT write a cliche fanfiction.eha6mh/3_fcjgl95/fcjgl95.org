A lot of people have mentioned it, but I'll say it too because it's all too common. Avoid bashing, it's fine to paint otherwise good characters in a less favorable light, but their personity should still be recognizable to their canon one, and they shouldn't have only negative traits, one dimentional characters are just boring and baly writen. I recently read a fic that was okay except for the bashing, after the author had Ron rape a 12 year old that kinda killed the fic for me.

Authors also tend to result to bashing to facilitate a break up. It is actually possible for a breakup to happen without one part of the couple being the actual worst.
