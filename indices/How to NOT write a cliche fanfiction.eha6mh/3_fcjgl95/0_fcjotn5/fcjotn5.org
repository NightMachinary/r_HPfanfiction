I feel like instead of bashing people by inventing crimes like this they should just make their protagonist dislike people. I mean you can just use the traits characters possess against them. Like to bash Hermione you can just increase her comments and "know-it-all" behaviour a little bit and then make your mc dislike the hell of it. Or with Ron just use his ambition to stand out in his family. Show the negative side of it. If I read one more fic in which Dumbledore is evilly munching on a lemon drop while plotting evil deeds.... Just make his motives a little more "for the greater good" while he doesn't want to hurt Harry make him believe that Harry's death is a necessary deed to finally defeat Voldemort and highlight that. If Harry is your Main character it's obvious that he might be pissed about that.
