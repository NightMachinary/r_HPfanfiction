Agreed absoultely. I don't even really consider leaning on negative traits and making the MC dislike another character because of it to bashing exactly.

There is a big difference between saying "Molly is frequently overbearing, so I dislike her", and making her flaws all there is to her, ignoring all her good traits, and saying "She and Giny are giving him love potion!"
