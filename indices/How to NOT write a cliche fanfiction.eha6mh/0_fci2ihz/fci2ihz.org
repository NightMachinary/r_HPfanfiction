It all depends on what you want to write, but I think by avoiding these 3 cliches, you can automatically avoid many bad tropes:

1. Don't try to rehash canon plot, don't try to follow JKR to resolve everything by year's end, and don't try to force something happening each year. You should especially avoid the canon COS plot because it's actually the epitome of the "useless adults" trope. Also, please avoid the Moody impersonation plot and the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme. It's nauseating to see them repeated thousands of times in fanfics.

2. Don't let Harry get all the credits for winning. The series says friendship is great, and I think that's a great message too. But for god's sake let his friends be useful and make contributions. Apart from Hermione's awesome research ability, let Ron become a good tactician or strategist since he's so good at chess, let Ginny be his ultimate sidekick, let Neville be his voice or diplomat with the traditional Purebloods, let Susan be his Ministry contact, let Justin be his money man or Muggle relation expert, let Tonks be the ultimate spy and infiltrator, and let Dumbledore do something cool too. There is absolutely no need for Harry to outduel Voldemort in a straight fight. War is all about deceptions, fighting unfairly, and maximizing your own advantages anyway.

3. Don't dumb down anyone to jam through your plot or manufacture unneeded drama. Canon, being a children's book mostly, is especially guilty in this regard. There are countless moments in DH where bad guys are dumbed down into oblivion so good guys could pull off a Pyrrhic victory. And please don't use surprise Deus Ex Machina to screw over anyone.
