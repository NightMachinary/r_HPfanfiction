Don't be afraid to take inspiration from the movies as well, they are the best example of what things would look like visually. The books are your best friends, as they are an encyclopedia of the events surrounding the boy who lived. Make sure to write in character for every single character. A sentence from a character such as Ron weasley should not have the same speech pattern as a sentence spoken by a character such as Severus snape or Dumbledore. The books are a good way to get a feel for character's speech pattern and personality.
