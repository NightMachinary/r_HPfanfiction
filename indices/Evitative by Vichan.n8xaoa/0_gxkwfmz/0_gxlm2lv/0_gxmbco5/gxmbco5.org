I have to agree with the poster here.

I read your first book, and while the writing is good and the magic is unique, I sincerely felt the characters were whitewashed and made far less interesting.

All the Slytherin characters end up being misunderstood children who /aren't that bad/ and /only supported voldemort because they had no choice./

You are taking about Draco Malfoy who in COS was fine with muggleborns dying. Who actively supported voldemort until he actually realized what this meant (in half blood prince). Here all this is forgiven and forgotten. It would have been far more interesting for half the house being for Voldemort and against Harry. That Draco, over time, realized he was wrong. It happens far too quickly here.

Its the same with Sirius. Sirius is heavy against black magic and anything to do with his family in Canon. It's completely out of character for him to have stayed dark. It immediately took me out of the story. What I had wanted to see was Sirius being the counterpoint to why Harry /shouldn't/ be dark. The one who understands what Harry is going through and how it's not worth it. Yet, when Harry did decide, Sirius would have sighed and hated it, yet supported him. He would have found Andromeda to mentor Harry and guide him.

Instead, we have a magic system built that makes me wonder why everyone isn't using it. There arent really any downsides or costs to use it. You have Dumbledore, one of the most well read and knowledgeable wizards, not know anything about it (even though he once dived deep in the dark arts theory as a teenager).

Then you have Harry who doesn't have a single reason not to use dark magic. Every argument against it seems to be flawed in a major way to the point you wonder why everyone isn't using this magic. There hasn't been a good consequence for any of Harry's decisions. Everything has worked out far better than it has in Canon.

All this being said, I do enjoy the creative approach you took to your magic, and that your bashing is far more limited and a little more nuanced. Your writing has improved loads from the beginning and overall I think it's still better than 95% of fanfic out there. I do want to thank you for writing this and hope you continue it. I hope I wasn't too harsh as I don't mean to be. Just because this fic isn't for me doesn't mean that countless others have enjoyed it.
