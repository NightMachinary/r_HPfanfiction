This is going to be a roller coaster of a reply, and I apologize.

I have gotten feedback along your lines before. I have also gotten feedback that says the exact opposite. And I'm not just talking about the completely positive, “Vichan can do no wrong the fic is perfect chef's kiss muah” comments; I'm saying I have gotten very negative feedback that literally has the exact opposite stance that you have.

I've had multiple people say that the bigotry and prejudice portrayed in the fic was more than what they were prepared for. One very memorable comment said that it was triggering for them, which led me to slightly alter the tags on the fic to hopefully better prepare future readers.

And then I have people that are more in your camp, who are telling me that it's /completely/ whitewashed.

I've had quite a few people say that they were angry and disappointed that Harry couldn't cast his Patronus anymore without feeling terrible. I've had people be angry and disappointed that friends couldn't stomach what he was messing with.

And then I have you telling me that there is no real consequence.

And bashing. My god, I am at the point where I'm just completely sick of hearing the word “bashing.” I've had more people than I can even count beg me to bash characters. People think that I'm not portraying Ron as a big enough asshole and /him showing any concern at all for Harry is totally out of character/, that Dumbledore is even more wicked than Voldemort and /why haven't I had Harry kick Dumbledore out the window yet/, and that Hermione is the worst and /why is Harry still friends with her/ or /how dare I give her any attention in the sequel/.

And then I have others say that the fic is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill bashing fic. (Adding to this particular conflict are positive reviews saying that the portrayal of three-dimensional characters is a breath of fresh air.)

Even in this very thread, one person says that the Slytherins are still bullying people, while you say that they're perfect angels.

If a whole lot of negative feedback is all saying the same thing, that's probably a good sign that I've done something wrong. I can think of quite a few places in the fic where I could've done better. The issue I'm having is that the negative feedback I've gotten has no consensus. Like, at all. (There's no consensus even with my own negative feedback about it!)

If I'm getting all of these negative viewpoints that completely conflict with one another, is the truth actually somewhere down the middle? I don't know. Seriously, what am I even supposed to do with all that? Who do I listen to?

I think the popularity of this fic has really driven home the fact that every single reader is looking for something totally different in the stories that they read. It's what made me realize that a ton of criticism about fic is very often “this person didn't write the story that I wanted to read.”

So all I can do at that point is just continue to write the story that I wanted to write.

I suppose it's worked out okay so far... though I have a pretty good feeling that people who loved certain aspects of the first story are going to rage-quit in the sequel.

For whatever it's worth - I do lean more towards your feedback. Some of it is quite valid.

(Though I have been in love with the idea of a darker Sirius for literally 20+ years, so... sorry that's not for you. I adore it. The fic is also intended to be canon divergent, not canon compliant. But this also is just another thing that reinforces the fact that every person is looking for something totally different. Liking something or not liking something will always be subjective.)

I think quite a bit of what you took issue with was an unfortunate side-effect of me being determined-as-fuck to stay in 3rd person limited (I personally cannot /stand/ omniscient - it makes me immediately hit the back button), which in turn limited my ability to tell the full story that was going on in my head. I was purposely limiting the writing to Harry's perspective, which isn't 100% reliable. It's barely even 50% reliable, and that's partially from his own doing and partially from other people trying to influence him or straight-up lie to him. (Kinda-sorta unreliable narrator, but also not really?)

Could I have tackled it all a different way? Absolutely. I haven't written something of this scope before - the longest completed piece I wrote prior to this was barely 50k words. But I also want to leave Evitative mostly as it stands now because quite a few of those issues play a bigger role in the sequel. (I don't want to say which ones specifically, but I'm really, really excited about exploring two of those issues in particular. :D)

One thing I want to explain more in-depth: my exploration of the Slytherins - Draco and Blaise in particular - is based on my own experience with one person I went to school with. I saw someone go on a journey from being incredibly prejudiced - which was inherited from parents and their parents before them - to unlearning that prejudice. In my mind, Draco is still stuck in the “don't say these things in polite company” part of a journey that I witnessed as it unfolded. He's filtering himself for Harry's benefit and it's definitely not going to stay hidden. (It's a huge reason why I decided to introduce multiple POVs for the sequel.)

I mean, to be completely blunt about it - the portrayal of the Slytherins in the books always bugged the shit out of me as being very boring, mustache-twirling cliches, and I wanted to portray their prejudice in a way that I had actually experienced. (“Write what you know.”)

I know my fic isn't perfect. Not by a long shot. I will be the first person to say that my fic is totally overrated and I have no fucking clue why it's gotten as popular as it has. I started writing it with no intention of ever showing it to anyone, and then it became my outlet for dealing with the horrendous ending of a relationship that included cutting a metric fuckton of toxic people out of my life. I wrote it when I was very lonely. I have no intention of ever writing professionally, so... it is what it is. I'm still mostly happy with the story I've told, and I'm very excited about where the story is going. That is more important to me than trying to please people who all want completely different things. It can't be done, so I'm not going to bother to try.

All this said.... as someone who is very much not in favor of public negative fic reviews (it used to be taboo and I miss the days of ‘don't like, don't read'), I'm just glad it's my fic getting thrown under the bus and not someone else who might have had a completely different emotional reaction. I really wish this sub wasn't so into it.

​

Edit: I just read this back and realized that I probably sound a bit arrogant. While I'm happy with it, there are so many fics out there that are so so so much better than mine. I just want to reiterate that I truly don't believe it deserves the attention it's gotten. That attention has in turn led to the most negative feedback I've ever gotten in my life. It's offset by the good and I can handle it. But the amount of completely contradictory feedback has kinda led to me throwing my hands up in the air and saying "fuck it."
