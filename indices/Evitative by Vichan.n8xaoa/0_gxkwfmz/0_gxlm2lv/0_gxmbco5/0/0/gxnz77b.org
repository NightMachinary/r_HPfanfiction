No, no, you are fine. You don't sound arrogant at all, rather just frustrated at the different comments you are getting. I do get where you are coming from. The fanfic world is insane and you can't please everyone. The only one that matters is you and how you feel about it.

I think what makes this fic rather divisive is /when/ it takes place. It comes across as canon until 5th year, then something happens, and you start seeing the ripples. Many readers go in expecting canon personalities with the expectation that people will change as the fic goes on. That, however, isn't the case. It's more of an AU than a canon divergent.

Sirius is the perfect example. I went in expecting canon Sirius and that wasn't what I got. Thus, it felt like a sudden personality shift in order to fit the stories narrative. I don't mind a dark Sirius at all myself. My issue was that I wasn't expecting an AU Sirius. This is the same with the Slytherins. I expected far more fighting, misunderstanding and solid rivalry between Harry and at least one other. When that didn't happen, it felt more like whitewashing because of what I was expecting. Now that I'm talking to you, these changes do make more sense.

I'm sorry about how harsh I might have been before. Sometimes words fail me and I have trouble explaining /why/ something isn't working. Your post made it finally click.

As for what feedback you should listen to... It's hard to say. Anyone who takes time to write paragraphs are always solid choices. Outside of that, hp writing groups. I have my own private discord for some of the top HP writers (taure, annerb, bolshe, manatee, etc). Having other writers you can get feedback on does wonders. It's the main reason I'm on DLP (even when they can be butts). If you are ever interested in joining a writing discord, shoot me a pm and I can send you invites to the few I know, including my own.

I do want to wish you good luck and good writing. At the end of the day, it's what you want to do and screw everyone else. I do hope I haven't ruined your day, I certainly didn't mean to.
