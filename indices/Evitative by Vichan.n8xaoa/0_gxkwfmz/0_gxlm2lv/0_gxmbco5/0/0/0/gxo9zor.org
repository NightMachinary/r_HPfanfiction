  It's more of an AU than a canon divergent.

I can see that, but my brain flip-flops when I think of the fic as an 'AU.' (AU has always made me think of coffee shop AUs and high schools/college AUs, etc.) I wonder if it's because a lot of fics that were the most influential for me came out while the books were still being published without any benefit of hindsight. At the time no one was calling those fics AU and I still don't think of them as AUs.

I think I accidentally cherry-picked from canon AND the idea of canon-in-training or speculative-canon or whatever it was called... and I think I did that because I'd been wanting to write a "Harry gets resorted to Slytherin" story since sometime around OotP came out. Some of my earliest ideas were probably conceived way back then, so maybe my brain just did a time warp when I was plotting things out?

  I'm sorry about how harsh I might have been before.

No worries at all. Yours was much, much kinder than most. And I'm sorry for completely unloading on you - I think this has been bubbling up for a while.

  As for what feedback you should listen to... It's hard to say. Anyone who takes time to write paragraphs are always solid choices.

I wish, haha. I've been sent a coherent mini-essay of all the reasons why Dumbledore is the worst and why he needs to be completely eliminated from Harry's life. Well-written, but still a 'nah' from me. :D

You did not ruin my day. I think this was actually pretty helpful - this is stuff that has been actively distracting me from writing lately, and it felt great to finally put some words to why it's bugging me.

And I will likely be getting in touch with you. This has been the most pleasant negative feedback exchange ever. :D
