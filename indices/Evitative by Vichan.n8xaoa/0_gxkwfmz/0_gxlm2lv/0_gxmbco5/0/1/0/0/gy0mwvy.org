Well, I disagree. If u post something online and have kept the comments open, then the feedback you get is not unsolicited. Comments and Reviews section is for people to express their feelings on the fic ( provided they don't harass or abuse the writer).

You can't expect only positive comments on the fics you have published. If a person doesn't want unsolicited critiques, then they should close the comments tab, or state that they don't want critiques
