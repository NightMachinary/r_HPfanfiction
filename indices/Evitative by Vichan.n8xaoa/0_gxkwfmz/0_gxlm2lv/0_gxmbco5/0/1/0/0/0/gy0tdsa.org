And I disagree with you. Complaining about something that you willingly chose to consume and was provided for FREE is immensely gross to me. You are not critiquing a professionally published work. You are critiquing somebody's hobby.

It used to be an inherently understood part of fandom etiquette: if you encountered a fic you didn't like and the author didn't ask for concrit, you hit the back button and moved on. I will never understand this new attitude and approach to fics. It's FREE. You get what you paid for.

Oh, man. Knowing the state of fandom today, that sounds like ASKING for abuse. Nobody should do this.

Edit: I'll throw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/ma2yv8/no_one_is_the_saviour_of_badly_written_ficsor_why/][this]] in, too, because it sums up my feelings pretty well. Unsolicited concrit is a waste of your time and the author's time. Save your energy for someone who asked for it.
