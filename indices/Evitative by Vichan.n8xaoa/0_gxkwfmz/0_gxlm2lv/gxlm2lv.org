I'll probably regret this, but whatever.

Sorry I didn't write the story you wanted to read. Bit of a bummer to hear that you thought it was black and white - I tried really hard to make every character nuanced and I am /very/ anti-bashing. I just tried to write every single character with real flaws because that makes them more interesting to me.

The way prejudice is portrayed based off of my own experience in high school, and that aspect is getting explored more in the sequel. I went for 90s realism. Guess it didn't work.

But then some of your other complaints legit make me wonder if you're mixing my fic up with someone else's.
