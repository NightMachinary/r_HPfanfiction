It is insanely black and white, even more so than canon.

The Slytherins are perfect misunderstood angels who immediately accept Harry without fail. Of course, they still treat others outside the house like shit, the Inquistorial Squad is still a thing they gleefully take part, they still call others slurs, but Harry (and us) is supposed to look past that because "ZOMG dark magic!1!1! Like FFS, Zabini is mocking Neville in the literal last scene. ETA: 2nd to last

And of course Ron and Hermione are bashed and made look unreasonable for not falling in line like good doggies. Ron in particular is treated like shit throughout

One of the more egregious moments is Harry bashing his own dead father for not liking dark magic /like an hour/ after he starts learning about it's capabilities. And apparently the healers in this world would rather let people die or be scarred for life than use dark magic, even though it's apparently not actually bad in the slightest?
