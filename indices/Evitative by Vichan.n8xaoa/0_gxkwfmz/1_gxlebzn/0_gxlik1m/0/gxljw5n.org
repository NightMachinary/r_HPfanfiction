Well, linkffn(The Changeling) isn't my personal favourite (because Ginny is so often unhappy), but I do think it did a good job of explaining and redeeming Slytherin.

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) looks inside Slytherin house a bit, but also it's about a very Slytherin protagonist, and contrasting his approach with others like Lily. Despite his burdens of guilt and shame, he is brave, and loyal, and clever, but above all resourceful and cunning and patient. Very long, but I enjoy how it studies his character and how he very gradually softens up.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a much more positive depiction of Slytherin house than canon, although there's still more caution and more focus on appearances than in other houses. Part of the change may be because there was no war, and non-Purebloods aren't allowed at Hogwarts any more, so the blood purists aren't on edge and don't cause as much conflict. Harry herself definitely belongs there, though, not for her views on blood status, but because she is driven and ambitious and keeps secrets. She wants to learn from Professor Snape and become an outstanding Potions brewer. The differences in Draco are interesting; he's overall pretty friendly, though still self-important and often scathing to people who don't impress him.
