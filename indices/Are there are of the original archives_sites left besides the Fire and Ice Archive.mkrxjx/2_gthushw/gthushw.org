I know that is exactly against what you are talking about, but AO3 is run by the non-profit organization exactly for the purpose of archiving third-party archives (and yours wouldn't be the first to be mirrored there).

- [[https://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/en/]]

Otherwise there are still other archives than FFnet, AO3, or Wattpad: SIYE, [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]], and others are still around, but it is true, that it seems like those big three are pulling all oxygen from air for anybody else.
