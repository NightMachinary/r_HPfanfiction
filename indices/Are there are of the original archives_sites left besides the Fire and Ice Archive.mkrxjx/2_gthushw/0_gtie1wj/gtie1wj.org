I think AO3 is great-- I remember the day FFN decided to get rid of all the explicit fics, and given that these things happen all the time, there absolutely needs to be a huge archive that's an alternative. But I'm very unwilling to let FIA go that way. I literally just got an email from Open Doors last week saying that they are still a looooong way from hosting Fictionalley's fics, and only 79 of them are actually on AO3 right now. (I don't know why it's taking so long, and nobody else seems to either, but for whatever reasons, the process started in 2018 and that's all there is of it that has been completed to date.) So that's one reason, but a much bigger one is that the FIA archive has meant so much to some people for so long. I don't know what I would have done without it at certain points. It's saved my life. No matter what, I'm keeping it alive. But it's good to know that it's not the ONLY early survivor still standing.
