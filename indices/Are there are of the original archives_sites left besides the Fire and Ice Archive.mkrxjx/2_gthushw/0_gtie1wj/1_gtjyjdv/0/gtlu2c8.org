Well... that would require somebody who both knows something on the techie end AND was putting time into it. I'm in the second category, but not the first! ;) It's a LONG story, but basically, there were a zillion volunteers when the original creator started the archive in 2004. They really started to kind of fall away in about 2011 or 2012. I didn't get FIA until 2014, and if I hadn't stepped up, it would be long gone by now. By that time, it was me, a couple of mods, and exactly one person left who had any tech knowledge at all. She's doing a couple of things, but the reality I've had to face is that she's done with it aside from very basic help. She was one of the two people who originally started the archive, but she's just not into it anymore at all. I'm grateful for the help she does give. I have IT friends who've worked in very different areas from keeping ancient websites going, so they help as much as they can, but it's not really what they know. I've actually thought about paying someone to just sit down and talk about what WOULD need to be done in order to make the site viable in the long run.
