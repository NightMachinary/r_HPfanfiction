It is a very sad site: of course, I understand it is all-Severitus all the time, but I cannot understand why all stories are EXACTLY THE SAME (Harry is almost tortured to death, saved by Snape, super-sentimental scene of fake reconciliation without any true repentence). Just one story which seems at least a bit original is “[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2878][Dear Aunt Tuney]]” by Manfredd and that is unfinished. And then there are incredible things like “[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2744][The Harry and the Ivy]]" by slytherensangel26, Lady Destiny: I have never read any pureblood married Snape with The Snape Manor, it looks really bizarre.
