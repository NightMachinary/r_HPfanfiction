[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. Set in a world where Hogwarts is Harworts, a school for James Bond-style spies (with Q Tech), covers all seven years and is complete. Part of a crossover universe that includes canon HP in earlier and later works. Follows roughly canon, but with enough deviations to keep you wondering. Great Dumbledore there, too.
