If you don't read in incompletes, you're missing out on some of the best stuff out there. You could easily look at them as a long, long, /long/ slice of life fic, or something where you're supposed to imagine your own ending, or just assume all end with Voldemort defeat and happily ever after, lol.

After I finish a fic, the ending isn't what sticks out in my mind. It's the best scenes and conversations and startling ideas. I guess it's otherwise for you, but it's so crazy to me to skip ahead and stop reading a fic you really enjoy just because it's not wrapped up with a bow at the end. What about all the parts you could've loved from here to there?
