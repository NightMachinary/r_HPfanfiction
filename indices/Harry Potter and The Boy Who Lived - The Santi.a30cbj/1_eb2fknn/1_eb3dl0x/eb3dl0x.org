I honestly couldn't disagree with this more lol. Starting an old fic I've never read before, only to realize it hasn't been updated in 5 years not because it's finished but because it's incomplete/abandoned, is the most maddening thing to me.

To me, it would be like reading an amazing book, and at some point half way through just saying "ahh, whatever" and putting it down and never finishing it.
