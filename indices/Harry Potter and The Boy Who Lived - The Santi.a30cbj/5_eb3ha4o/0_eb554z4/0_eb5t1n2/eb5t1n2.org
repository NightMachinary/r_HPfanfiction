DLP's "Work By Author" section, where the chapters are posted, is a forum for writers to receive feedback on their work (like betaing by community, covering both content and technical writing). Santi never uploaded them to a fanfiction host because he did not consider them ready for consumption by the general public, being first drafts not the finished product.

He always planned to incorporate the feedback given in WBA to edit the chapters into a final form then post them. But he said that given the choice between editing draft chapters to make them ready for posting and working on the draft of the next chapter, he would always choose the latter. So the chapters just stayed in draft form permanently.
