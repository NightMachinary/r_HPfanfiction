Its prolly my favorite Hary has a twin who is the BWL trope, since so so many of those go with Harry being abandoned at the Durselys and forgotten about until hogwarts. Which while theres a small number I like of that type, still seems wildly out of character for Lily at the very least, since pretty much the main thing we know about her is she was willing to die for her baby. To then the very next day be willing to throw away one of said babies just seems unlikely.
