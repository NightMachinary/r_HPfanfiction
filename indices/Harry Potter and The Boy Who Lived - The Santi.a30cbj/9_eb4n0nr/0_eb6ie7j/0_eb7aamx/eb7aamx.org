I couldn't agree more with everything you said.

I'm in my 30's, and I'm an OG Harry Potter fanfiction reader. Its great to 'meet' someone else who has been reading as long as me!

Although I have to admit, I had no idea Jeconais had a real name, and even less of an idea that his name was Tim. For some reason I find that hilarious.

YOU MAY CALL ME..... TIM?

I hope you keep reading and enjoying fan-fiction for a long time to come!

Edit: Holy Shit - I just looked at HOPE to remind myself of what it was about... and I haven't actually read it. Wut....

No idea how I missed it - I'll read it now. Thanks!
