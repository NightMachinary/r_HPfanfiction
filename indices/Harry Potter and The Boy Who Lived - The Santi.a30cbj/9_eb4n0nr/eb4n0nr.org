If you love Jeconais then you've probably read my favourite FanFic of all time. Perfect Slytherins.

Its fucking incredible, and I love it.

It 'ends' at a pretty good point, but it still open for more, and I wish more than anything somebody would write the next couple of years of it.

I want to see Wednesday slowly become more 'normal', then destroy the Munsters, and then travel to the stars
