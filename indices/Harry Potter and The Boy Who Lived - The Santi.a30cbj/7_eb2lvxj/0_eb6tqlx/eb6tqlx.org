I haven't read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (though I just downloaded it for my plane ride tomorrow) so I'm not sure if this one compares, but a Durmstrang fic I enjoyed was The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow. It's not complete but is still updating, however it is going in a Tom Riddle/Harry direction so it may not be of interest.
