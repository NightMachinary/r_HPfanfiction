Lol, it's probably the best hp fic as far as my preference goes, as I don't like the traditional pairings and it really tried to show other aspects of the wizarding world that weren't part of the main story as realistically as possible, author was doing great work..knew it was too good to be true.ðŸ˜‘..anyway, sorry I don't really know any other hp fanfiction that stuck with me, the only other fanfiction I consider awesome are the stories by lux dragon but those are in the mass effect universe.
