That's the exact opposite of most writing advice, including professional writing advance. Said is an invisible world - a word that is both small and so common it is effectually invisible. You don't actually read it, your eyes skim over and the meaning jumps right to your brain. Saidisms (words used instead of said) break flow, slow down writing and generally give a cluttered feel.

Look at a popular professional book and you'll notice very few saidism. Most of the time they'll say 'said' and when they don't it will be other common words like 'asked'.

TLDR: ignore the OP. Use said.
