Hilariously the vast majority of criticism I get is the overuseage of Said in dialogue and not describing every detail of the characters. Both of which are signs of amateurish writing.

Most young writers and critics don't understand that every version of 'said' that isn't 'said' has a specific connotation that is often not the intent or just seems weird if two people are having a conversation. Using them wily-nilly simply lessens the impact when you need them to serve a purpose. Which is something a lot of young writers don't understand. Said is your friend. OP is hilariously reactionary to an opinion and an article he clearly didn't read. Or he'd have noted that his own source says 'there's nothing wrong with using said'. Because there isn't. Use it. And use it a lot.
