Then perhaps the problem here lies with the reader and not with the writer? It's generally not the writer's job to make their texts sound natural to the non-native reader.

And as a non-native reader myself I do prefer authors to use well-known words since while I really like learning new words it kinda breaks the flow when I have to look up another one of the 300 alternatives for "said" every few lines ;)
