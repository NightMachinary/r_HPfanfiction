Its about being repetitive you skronk. If the author keeps using "said" over and over and over and over and over again. There is no balance at all. It simply shows that his characters are void of all emotions.

I learned writing in a different language than english, and we were specifically told by our professor to NOT overuse the word "said" when it comes to dialogues.

tl;dr your opinion has been noted and ignored.
