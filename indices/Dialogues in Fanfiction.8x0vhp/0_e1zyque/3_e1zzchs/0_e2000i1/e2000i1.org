  If the author keeps using "said" over and over and over and over and over again. There is no balance at all. It simply shows that his characters are void of all emotions.

No, it really doesn't. A character's dialogue and actions should convey how they're feeling without the use of said-isms.

Presumably your professor was teaching English to non-native English speakers. That is very different to people teaching writing to native English speakers. Where vocabulary can quickly go past purple into urple. Cutting 'said' forces you to think about what your characters are doing to /show/ anger or sadness rather than just tacking on 'ranted' or 'sniffled'.

God knows you speak a foreign language better than I do, and my writing in a foreign language would likely have far more issues than which word I used to denote the tone of speech.

Just as you are relaying what you have been taught, we are conveying how /we/ have been taught.
