Yeah... not learning new stuff. That's DEFINITELY what it is. Not that using said is a helpful tool that keeps things from being diluted by trying to find fancy words where none need be used. What the hell do you mean the "american way", you hoity toity ass? It's not being lazy, it's simply refusing to bog down good writing with useless synonyms. Yes, there are some instances where said should not be used, but most dialogue is better with said.
