Grow Young With Me: linkffn(11111990)

He /starts/ brokenhearted in this one - it's post-epilogue, Harry had a happy marriage with Ginny that ended with her death when an experimental racing broom malfunctioned during training with the Harpies, leaving Harry to raise the kids.

The pairing is Harry/Muggle!OC, it's a relatively slow romance (Harry's still /very much/ hurting over Ginny).
