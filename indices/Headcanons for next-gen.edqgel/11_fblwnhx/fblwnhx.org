So I'm sorry to do this, actually you know what? I'm not sorry at all. It is my firm opinion that no epilogue should have been written. It tied down the characters too hard. It made for a worse.... I don't know the word. It just made it bad.

In my headcanon, Harry never married Ginny, or maybe he did? I don't know. I prefer it to be a mystery.
