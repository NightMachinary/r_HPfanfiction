The Cursed Child does *not* exist.

- Teddy Lupin: Hufflepuff, Prefect.

Teddy Lupin, son of Remus and Nymphadora, was raised by his grandmother Andromeda. He has a close connection with his godfather Harry. He is very cordial, especially with students who lost family members to the War. Has an /extremely/ strong sense of justice that drove him to be an iron fist of defense against bullies. He joins the Aurors, but this is due to a desire to be a part of the /cause,/ rather than actively seeking battle.

- James Sirius Potter, Gryffindor

Delighted to be the son of heroes, James Potter is more than a little obsessed with glory. He is talented, but also lazy, riding in part of his family name to get ahead. Popular with classmates, but distant from many of his cousins. While never straying anywhere near blood purism, James fancies himself better than others--but this comes to a head when Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins. This becomes transformative when he watches Dudley's eldest son break up a fight despite being out-numbered four-to-one.

- Albus Severus Potter. Hufflepuff

Unlike his brother who delights in their family name, Albus is terrified of not measuring up to the past. Not just the name "Potter," but also the names "Albus" and "Severus." It takes him a long time to find his niche. Amusingly, he is dreadful at Potions, but he becomes very skilled at Ancient Runes.

- Rose Weasley, Hufflepuff.

Joined Huffepuff /by choice,/ out of fidelity to her favorite cousin. Rose is markedly different from her parents. She's distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry. Rose, by contrast, despises government and bureaucracy in general. Her very favorite subject is Herbolgoy and she has a special bond with Neville because of it. She loves reading for its own sake--often falling asleep in the library, though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. Rose goes barefoot at every opportunity and carries at least one textbook and one storybook constantly.

- Hugo Weasley, Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He has a passion for revolutionaries and carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook. He is meticulous and organized, though rather than direct this to schoolwork, his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement. He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her laugh, and how to make her cry. Hugo was able to out-wrestle and out-rough-house her by the time he was six, and he never misses a chance to tease her. Their dynamic is not completely antagonistic though--as much as he likes making Rose squeal and scream, Hugo and Rose are frequently seen in each other's company, reading books.

- Fred Weasley II, Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think Fred's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot. He finally manages to pull the absolute perfect prank--jinxing every single student and staff member at Hogwarts simultaneously the day he graduates from Hogwarts and thus immune from detention.
