Hmm. Lemme see:

James Sirius Potter: Oldest son of Harry Potter, grew up loving the attention. Very, very extroverted, somewhat boorish at times. Quidditch player, of course. Red hair like Ginny, brown eyes. He can be domineering but he goes out of his way to stand up for his buddies and tries to keep a straight moral compass, although strong emotions can lead him to behave irrationally. Skilled in DADA and is (weirdly) into divination as well. More passionate than skeptical. Gryffindor, of course.

Albuz Severus Potter: Looks just like Harry and James always slightly resented the attention that Al got, and picks on him a lot. Al resents it, too. He's very insecure about his place in the world. He makes friends with some Hufflepuff kids on the train and ends up getting sorted into Hufflepuff with them. The tabloids were completely abuzz, but Al just tries to lay low and focus on his studies. His grades are alright, he ultimately likes potions the best. He ultimately turns out to have inherited his parents' skills in Quidditch, though, and goes on to go head-to-head with James during the matches. He ultimately enjoys the loyalty and patience of Hufflepuff and being with his more humble and friendly classmates.

Lily Luna Potter: Tenacious to the point of petulance, the most academically gifted of her siblings (and she knows it) Lily feels the burden of being her father's only daughter and youngest child. She wants to prove that she's just as capable as her dad and brothers, but she's also more proactive about her desire for independence from her dad's shadow than Al. Al just wants to live a good life. Lily's determined to be someone in her own right. She's perceived as annoying by her siblings and cousins, who mock her that she's going to be the first Slytherin in their family. Harry encourages her to go to whatever house suits her, even Slytherin, and that's just where she ends up. She's especially skilled in potions and arithmancy, although she earns high marks in all her subjects. She also inherited myopia on her dad's side, which led to her needing glasses. She's not thrilled with the idea at first, but eventually takes to them if they make her look smarter. She struggles socially due to many finding her rather insufferable, although meeting a few other students who are just as talented as she is knocks her down a peg and she falls in with their group. Unfortunately, she is not skilled in Quidditch but is supportive of her jock brothers.
