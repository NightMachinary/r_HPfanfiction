I write them mainly in young adulthood, so my headcanons about them are mainly focused on their personalities as developed by their 20's (except Molly and Lucy, whom I have also written in their teens):

*James Potter II* affects kind of a bro demeanor but can be really introspective and sensitive. He became a professional Quidditch player but suffered a career-ending injury. He's best pals with his cousin Fred, who is a few years older than him and whom he looked up to like a big brother. James is also a huge football fan.

*Albus Potter* is an old soul, studious, introverted, and can be pretty tightly wound. Becomes a Healer.

*Lily Potter II* is a bit mischievous and as the baby of the family definitely has a manipulative streak. Becomes a journalist and will rabidly pursue leads.

*Fred Weasley II* is quite studious and type-A, but also gregarious, witty, and a goofball at times. He's a great chess player and sucks at Quidditch and flying in general. When Hermione published a revised version of /Hogwarts: A History/, Fred couldn't stop raving about it. Fred was the announcer for Quidditch matches at Hogwarts. Becomes a radio host on the wizarding wireless network. Under no circumstances does he want to go into the family business, much to his dad's chagrin.

*Roxanne Weasley* works in an apothecary. Has a sibling rivalry with Fred that has lasted into their 20's and is generally sick and tired of his shit. Great Quidditch player (Chaser).

*Rose Weasley* is smart and studious, social justice- minded; also has wanderlust and is a bit of a free spirit. Spends a good portion of her 20's traveling the world, working different odd jobs and for various causes.

*Hugo Weasley* much to everyone's utter confusion, is something of a lady's man. His cousins can't get over this. Has a beautiful singing voice. Becomes an Obliviator.

*Molly Weasley* seems a perfect child at first but in her teens develops a stubbornness and a willingness to go toe-to-toe with her dad. Rebels a bit in her teens but really does care about her achievements. Ravenclaw. Great Quidditch player. Thick as thieves with her cousin Rose.

*Lucy Weasley* is quiet, gentle, compliant, and conflict-averse. Hufflepuff.

*Dominique Weasley* is a dude who is really annoyed that people always assume he's a girl due to his gender neutral French name. Becomes a journalist and works for /Witch Weekly/ and will thank you not to make smart comments about it.

I haven't actually developed significant headcanons about Victoire and Louis.

Also I headcanon that Teddy Lupin loves video games and is a really skilled gamer.
