Teddy Remus Lupin Hufflepuff Head Boy Chaser Loves his Metamorphis' ability, and enjoys turning into people like Harry or Ron to scare the living daylights out of his cousins, into making them think that they're in trouble. Is raised by his grandmother Andromeda, but Harry and the Weasley's have a large part in his life. Eventually Marries Victoire and becomes an Auror

Victoire Gabrielle Weasley Gryffindor Head Girl Prefect Fiery attitude, best to stay away when she's pissed! Her aunt Ginny tought her the Bat Boogey Hex, and she's not afraid to use it! While she may be Head Girl and eventually Prefect, isn't afraid to get back anyone who bullies her or her family. She is often getting into disagreements with her mother, and is a total daddy's girl (Though she would deny it!). And the only people who are allowed to call her Vicky, are her father and Teddy; thank you very much! She once even cuts her hair, in defiance to her mother's ideals. Gets many different jobs, before eventually deciding to go and join her uncle Charlie into training dragons.

Dominique Brielle Weasley Gryffindor Beater Is a Tomboy, loves to play Quidditch because it makes her feel free. Eventually becomes a Beater for the HolyHead Harpies. Secretly likes romance novels, (though she'll deny it if anyone asks). Is always willing to try a new dare or be a test subject to her uncle George's Joke Shop.

Louis William Weasley Ravenclaw Head Boy Prefect Gets very annoyed at all of the loud noises that come from his sister Victoire, and his mother. Is often seen locked up in his room or underneath a tree, reading or painting. He loves to paint; it's a past time that eventually turns into a job for him, later in life. But he knows that for most artist you don't get rich or famous until after you're dead, so he ends up working as a Curse Breaker like his father.

Rose Katherine Weasley Ravenclaw Head Girl Prefect: Is very competitive, hardly backs down, can sometimes be insensitive but doesn't mean it. Loves Chess and reading, but often rolls her eyes at Quidditch. (Though she will play occasionally). Often gets into fights and dares/competitions with James and Fred (Much to the annoyance of Hermione, Albus and Scorpius (And much to the amusement of Ron, Harry, and Hugo).

Hugo Xander Weasley Hufflepuff: A quiet and softly spoken boy. He's probably the most "well behaved" Weasley in the family. But is often dragged into whatever his much bolder cousin and friend; Lily Luna has on her mind. Without Lily by his side, he'd likely be a loner, often by himself, holed up in his bedroom or a library. But because of Lily, (as well as several other annoying cousins); he's often out causing mischief; even when he doesn't want too. Is most fond of Herbology, Potions and History, and is seen with Professor Longbottom in the Greenhouses, more often than not.

Frederick Robert Weasley II Gryffindor Social butterfly; loves to be the center of attention, and is always showing off. Can come off as arrogant or even rude; but is pretty caring and considerate deep down. Found a fondness for building things, and likes to build things in his spare time, even eventually going into the construction business in the Muggle world; and builds houses there.

Roxanne Olivia Weasley Slytherin: Was a surprise for everyone when she was sorted into Slytherin, Is more of a quiet sort, but has a thirst to prove herself and plenty of ambition. Will do what she can to go far in life. Is a quick thinker, thanks to being around her dad and her uncle Ron's joke shop, and often thinks outside of the box to get things done. Ends up becoming a Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor.

Molly Christine Weasley II Weasley Ravenclaw: She loves her family and would do anything for them; so when she found out that her father had left the family, because of his disagreement with him, she had been furious with him! She holds grudges easily, and is difficult to get to forgive you. Ends up being fascinated by Runes Magic

Lucy Ginevra Weasley Hufflepuff A shy and quiet girl, she's a great listener more than she is a talker; often getting tongue-tied and blushes easily. She also gives out great advice to people and is very empathetic towards people in general. She ends up being interested in magical and non magical creatures, and decides to go around the world looking for them.

James Sirius Potter Gryffindor Seeker, Smart, Charming, Competitive, is often seen making bets or dares with everyone and anyone. Isn't afraid to say no (Though that has cost him more than once). Is very loud and adventurous; everyone thought he'd join Harry and Teddy and become an Auror, but were rather surprised when he decided to become a Professional Quidditch Player.

Albus Severus Potter Gryffindor Head Boy Prefect Is often annoyed by James (and to be quite frank; many of his other crazy family as well). Gets along quite well with Louis (despite the age difference), Teddy is his favorite family member (not that he'd admit that aloud!). Is often the voice of reason between his cousin Rose and best friend Scorpius (though they often don't listen to him, anyway). Becomes a Charms Master

Lily Luna Potter Slytherin Seeker Everyone was the most surprise (Except for Ginny perhaps) when Lily Luna was sorted into Slytherin. James wouldn't talk to her for weeks, Albus would look over at the Slytherin table worriedly, as though she were some sort of next Dark lord? Or she supposed it'd be Dark Lady? But honestly with so many family members, and with her and Hugo being the youngest in the bunch; she had a thirst to prove herself, as well as the ambition. She's very bold and daring, isn't afraid of breaking the rules, but figures out when a "right" time for rule breaking is. Often gets Hugo, and Roxanne in plenty of trouble along with her. (Despite Roxanne being a year older than them). She surprises everyone even more later on, by becoming a Healer. (Always do the unexpected) is her moto.

Lorcan Harold Scamander Gryffindor Chaser Is very Adventurous and loves when his parents take him to a bunch of places. Would love to travel around the world forever, if he could. But his parents eventually settle down in Britain, right before he and Lysander are to go to Hogwarts. Ends up becoming a explorer.

Lysander Neville Scamander Ravenclaw Prefect He loves seeing new places and learning new things, he would much rather stay in one place. He is often seen trying to combine Muggle objects with magical, to see how they'd work. Ends up being an Unspeakable.

Scorpius Abraxias Malfoy Ravenclaw Head Boy Prefect He's sarcastic he ends up developing a love for pranking people, thanks to Albus' relatives. (Much to Draco, and Albus' horror). He's one of the smartest boys in his year, and is often very competitive against Rose and Albus when it comes to grades. He doesn't agree with how his family acted during the war, and later on in life he donates money to St. Mungo's regularly. Ends up becoming a Healer.
