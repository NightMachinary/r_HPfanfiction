i used to write a lot of next gen fics. the details varied but some of my constants were:

- neither albus or rose were sorted into gryfffindor. i'd switch between hufflepuff and ravenclaw for rose, but albus was always a slytherin

- this is hugely rooted in the fact that albus does want to carve out an identity for himself that's separated from being a potter. i headcanon that since he's harry's spitting image, he feels the burden of being a potter a lot more than the others which both leads him to being pretty reserved about who he hangs out with as well as encourages him to make a name for himself. despite this, he is still really close to his dad and loves him a lot

- aaaand this leads to his passion for quidditch. he loves it and works really hard at it because he genuinely wants to go pro. i imagine him aiming for the montrose magpies since they're the most prolific team in the british & irish quidditch league

- james is always a charmer for me. i imagine that he's a bit cheeky, the sort that endears him to teachers despite the fact that he pushes the rules. he's also much more social than most of his cousins. i remember a lot of next gen fics would paint him as someone who gets around, but i never felt strongly for that

- i also really like the thought of him being best friends with freddie weasley. meanwhile, albus is closest to rose in the family, though his best friend is fellow slytherin scorpius malfoy

- scorpius is pretty well put-together and i imagine he's very conscious of how he comes across due to his family's reputation. he tries to juggle the ill name with his family's innate stiff upper lip so can come across as reserved but is a genuine friend

- teddy lupin was 100% a hufflepuff and head boy. everyone loved him

- i don't include CC as canon whatsoever and i know that jkr really queerbaited with that one, but i have firmly shipped scorose since 2012 so that's another one of my headcanons

- dominique looks completely like a delacour while louis follows his father and victoire is a happy middle
