I'm also going to delve into what they look like.

James looks similar to Harry (but has auburn hair), and has Ginny's brown eyes and has freckles - he is not a carbon copy of either of them. James emulates Harry and the stories of the Marauders, combine that with all his Uncles and James is a handful. He goes into Gryffindor naturally, but he is more like Ginny in school. He is intelligent, but not near perfect, and he likes DADA, Transfiguration, and Charms (all of which are very physical classes). He plays Quidditch as a Chaser or Beater starting in 3rd year.

Albus looks identical to Harry expect his hair which is not as wild, it's more Ginny's texture, and he likes to keep it long. Albus goes to Slytherin partially because he grew up under his parents limelight and wants to be independent of them. He likes Quidditch and plays as Seeker from 4th to 7th year, but he isn't captain --- his best friend Scorpius is and there is a huge but friendly rivalry between Scorpius and James. He is more studious than James and makes near perfect grades, but that is not his sole defining quality (he is up to mischief if the need arises).

Lily has Ginny's hair (but it is slightly Auburn like James') with Harry's wild texture and an inability to tame it, but has hazel eyes. She hates that she has hazel eyes and not completely “Weasley-red” hair because she feels left out from her cousins. As she grows up she learns to love herself. She is sorted into Gryffindor, but just barely avoids Slytherin. Lily is like her mother and loves Quidditch, she makes it on the team in second year (before both her brothers) and becomes Captain in 5th year. She loves the physical subject like James but also greatly enjoys astronomy and potions like Albus. Her quidditch and grades struggle to take priority so she makes mostly O's but some E's.

Rose is very similar to Hermione in her need for perfection, but she struggles because she also had Ron's laid back nature. She has Hermione's wild mane, but has freckles, blue eyes, and Weasley hair. She is sorted into Ravenclaw because she asks for it and values being like her mom even if she feels inferior. She later regrets making the hat put her there and ends up spending most of her time with her cousins. She still maintains her loves and pride for Ravenclaw, though, and she is a Keeper during 5th year and up when she finally admits to herself that it's okay to be like her dad. She aces all her subject expect potions and care of magical creatures and she even takes divination, she thinks her dad may have had some diviner skills and wants to see if she does as well.

Hugo looks very similar to Rose. He has wild red hair and freckles, but one of his eyes is blue and the other is brown. He is smart like Hermione as well, but did the opposite of Rose. He avoided is for years in an attempt to be like Ron and it was only though talking to Uncle Percy that he realized it is okay to be different. He was sorted into Gryffindor, but he finds it really loud. A lot of people think him and Rose should be in each other's house. He hates Quidditch, but loves to fly around on a broomstick, go super high up, and watch the world from above. He favors potions and arithmacy, likes DADA for the theory, but doesn't like Transfiguration very much.

All in all, they are good kids who were raised in a better world than their parents. They have some of their best qualities because their parents were so terrified of fucking them up and they wanted them to have amazing childhoods. But, even though they are protected from the spotlight, they all feel like they are hidden in their parents shadow. This causes big issues for James, Rose, and Hugo until they can grow up and learn to talk through these problems and worries.
