Read the first couple of chapters, seem to be going a little too fast; plus the author is purposely spelling Dolores' name wrong, the fact that he/she even said that they were going to spell it differently just kind of takes me out of the story a little bit. I mean it's not bad, but maybe not quite what I'm looking for.
