Hmm, I wonder if anyone ever did a Umbridge self insert. I remember two Lockhart self insert, one of them never finished. I remember a Dudley one, but I was dissapointed because the Dudley self insert got to be magical and a non-magical character trying to help out Harry with only future-vision/book-knowledge would have been so much more interesting.

Let me have a look if anybody ever did an Umbridge self insert.

It looks like this one starts well before the point you would like to start at, though.
