This is a very good idea that I would love to read! :) Yes I would love /rare self inserts/ like Umbridge or Quirrell or Peter Pettigrew or Shacklebolt or Seamus Finnigan or Dudley Dursley! :) It would be so interesting to see how they would maybe change or fix canon and save the world without being around the characters that everything important happens to. :) They would maybe have to get in close with the Order or something to be close enough to make changes.
