Self inserts typically have several huge problems, especially if you are inserting yourself into a cannon characters brain.

First, I would recommend against just becoming someone already in the HP universe. You are probably not as interesting or beloved as whomever you take over. It might be passable if you become background Hufflepuff #107, but even then you have the problem that people have a lot of fanon surrounding those characters and them being you will mess with peoples heads.

Second, people typically want to do self inserts so they have the power fantasy of living through Hogwarts and experiencing all the events that come with it. You want to live through the troll, the mirror, the chamber, the whomping willow, the tournament the graveyard ect ect. This is quite frankly boring to read. Your SI should drastically and dramatically alter the world just by being there, forget acting on your detail knowledge of events. Say you really love Hermione, and become her BFF in the first year. Instead of going to the lav on Halloween, she finds you. Then she never becomes friends with Harry and Ron, because she thinks they're dunder heads and they never act bravely to save her. That's only a minor example, but basically six months after your SI shows up if it still follow cannon closely you're doing a crap job.

The last problem I'll talk about is that SI's need a reason to exist other than a power fantasy or escapism. Why, exactly, is your character in the world? Is there some message or important story you wish to convey? Avoid giving your SI super awesome magical powers. If anything, this should be a terrifying and disturbing experience for them, unless they are somewhat mentally ill and are that dead set and seeing everything they know and love vanish into mist. Have your SI really explore some aspect of the world outside of the narrow confines of the book. Think about what themes and experiences you want to convey so that your readers are invested in the story.

Now, after all that, I'll say that I have written an SI, and while it's still early days I could very well be falling into the very pitfalls I mentioned, so take what I said with a grain of salt. And remember, at the end of the day, what really matters is if you had fun with it. Some people may not like what you write, but as long as you enjoy the journey the reviews don't matter.
