I don't think he'd hate Quidditch itself, if he had a way to watch without being outside maybe he'd find it quite interesting. It's /playing/ it that he would hate.

I know this sub kinda hates them, but I could see this sort of Harry getting one of those extended trunks. Just a small one, so it's all nice and cozy. Like, it's big enough to hold one comfy chair, a light of some kind, and a small space for some books or something.

The "Harry lives out of his trunk" thing is a bit overdone, yeah, but I think it could work. Portable safe space for him. If he gets overwhelmed, and I imagine a Harry that hides under his bed from people /would/ get overwhelmed, he can just retreat into his trunk for a bit.
