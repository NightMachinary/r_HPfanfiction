Thanks. I could totally see Harry deliberately measuring it out, so it's not too big.

And I mean this thing is like, cupboard sized. A large cupboard maybe, at most it's a walk in wardrobe, but this isn't a /room/. Harry gets it /because/ it's small and compact. And then puts stuff in it to make it feel even smaller.

This Harry likes small spaces.
