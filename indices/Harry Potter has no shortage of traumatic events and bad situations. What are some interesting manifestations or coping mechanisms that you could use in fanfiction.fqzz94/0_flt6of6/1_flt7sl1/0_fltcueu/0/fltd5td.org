That sounds hilarious. Whenever I actually get around to writing the fic that goes with this discussion (and who knows when /that/ will be) I'll have to remember to do that.

You know, this Harry would be /terrible/ in Potions. Someone who gets so overwhelmed they try and hide in broom cupboards isn't really going to last long against Snape. Or Umbrich, come to think of it. Not that anyone can really deal with Umbrich, but this would be worse.
