Ooh, that's a nice one. Extreme introversion combined with the Agoraphobia and trust issues I talked about would be really interesting. I just imagine Harry hiding under his bed at Hogwarts because it's nice, dark, and he doesn't have to deal with people.

Low expectations could work nicely as well, especially if it's of himself. Give him something to really overcome, seeing just how good he really is after "ten dark years" of being beaten down.
