One of my headcanons is draco having an inferiority complex and developing an eating disorder because of it. Maybe it's a lot of projection from my part but it fits quite well. While yes, outwards he's an arrogant twat, but maybe it's more of a fake it til you make it/don't let others see your weakness thing? We see lucius shaming draco for having worse grades than a muggleborn, and i do think there was always a strong expectation hanging over draco to do well. Only son of lucuis malfoy and narcissa black, purest of blood, etc. Why shouldn't he be the top of the top in everything? But harry beats him in quidditch, hermione beats him in grades, and in hbp he realizes he can't kill dumbledore. He can't do anything well enough and striving for perfection develops into an eating disorder. We see draco being sent food from home by his mother, which could very well be a worried mother making sure her son eats /something/. Also the choice of friends in crabbe and goyle could be a "look at how smart i am in comparison to these two" thing.
