You might get better recs if you spelled out what you like and dislike.

I personally love "Fate is a Four Letter word" by philo for its portrayal of 40-something Harry and the relationship with his almost-adult kids especially James as well as the fact that it is a great who-dun-it that keeps you on the edge until the end and has some serious character development on all fronts. But it is slash, rare paring and features Snape in a prominent role and for these reasons many go "eeewww, not gonna read that".
