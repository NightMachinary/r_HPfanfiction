IDK if this works in english, but in my native, Inferi's singular, Inferius, the word itself implies command, and not an infernal zombie monster walker. So I thought that in some languages, they might've translated TO Inferni, even if Infernius is kinda lame, making so many people reffer to them as such. IMO, I really dislike reading a fic when the author purposely writes Inferni, simply because the singular seems foolish, even when they get reviews correcting them.

I think its the same with Patroni vs Patronuses debate. Really annoying, to my eyes, but sometimes you just gotta take it if you want to keep reading.
