Possibly, and in my case specifically, people are confusing the word with /inferno/ or /infernal/ - specifically, the definition of infernal that is:

#+begin_quote
  relating to or characteristic of hell or the underworld.
#+end_quote

If you think about that, Inferi are quite infernal in nature. It doesn't help that Dumbledore drove them off with an inferno.

It's natural that people tend to blend words together or add sounds or whatever when you've got similar or related words being used in a similar context.

Besides, if I wrote "Inferni" instead of "Inferi" when I'm talking about a hoard of Harry Potter^{^{TM}} brand zombies, you'd still understand what I'm saying.

And yes, this is me completely admitting that I'd been calling them inferni in my head for basically forever.
