When I read the books first I thought Hogwarts students had invented an entirely new game in "honour" of their least favourite teacher. I loved that it never was explained further and thought it was a pretty clever little touch.

I was very confused, and then disappointed, when I first read one of the books in the original.

While you are right and it is pretty cool, correcting the error may make sure no other readers are dissapointed that way.
