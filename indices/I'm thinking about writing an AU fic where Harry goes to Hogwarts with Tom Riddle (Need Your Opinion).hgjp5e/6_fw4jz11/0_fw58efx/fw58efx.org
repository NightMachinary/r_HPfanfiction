The thing is, I have already read this in a lot of fics. I don't know, it's just that Tom is always better, more smart, powerful, etc. while Harry is the typical Gryffindor. And somehow, Tom always 'falls in love' with him.

And I really don't understand that. I'm sure that if Tom had to feel something akin to 'love', he would only recognise somebody who is as perfect as him or even more. Is it preposterous to think that Tom is narcissistic? ðŸ¤” I don't know, but I would assume so.
