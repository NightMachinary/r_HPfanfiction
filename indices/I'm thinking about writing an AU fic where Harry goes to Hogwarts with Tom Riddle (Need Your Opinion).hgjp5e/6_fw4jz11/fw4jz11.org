I think it would be more interesting if they were more equal, but Harry's side comes more from luck? So Tom is more charismatic, but perhaps Harry has his feats of heroism saving others from bullies or whatever plot you have. And then perhaps Tom is the perfect student, but Harry throws caution to the wind and puts too much power in all his spells making him look better. So he's not just a better Tom, because Tom is very powerful and smart, but Harry in canon put in a different time period I think would aggravate Tom to no end.
