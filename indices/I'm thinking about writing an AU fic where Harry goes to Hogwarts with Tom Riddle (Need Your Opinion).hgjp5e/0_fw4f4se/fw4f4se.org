Dumbledore described Tom Riddle as one of the most talented students in Hogwarts' history, and as an adult, "the most dangerous dark wizard of all time." Making Harry significantly better than him sounds like a boring, OP Harry. Being a 'genius' isn't enough for Harry to be enough ahead of one of the most powerful wizards in history to see him as 'mediocre'.
