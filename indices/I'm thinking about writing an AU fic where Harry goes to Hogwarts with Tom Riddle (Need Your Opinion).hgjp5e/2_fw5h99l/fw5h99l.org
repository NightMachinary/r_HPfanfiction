Sounds like OOC Harry not just in intelligence but also character - I don't see him being so dismissive of his classmates abilities (remember the DA? He doesn't really think he's special, even when he has genuine grounds to think so). I also believe he'd take notice of someone as talented as Tom, who Dumbledore said was 'probably the most brilliant student' Hogwarts had ever seen. Also, I'm not sure where his reckless/investigative streaks are, or his temper.

Maybe you can make Harry better intuitively, but Tom better understands theory and knows more spells? And Harry is held back by his adventurous and less studious nature so they are more evenly matched. Tom would still be obsessed because he can't stand the thought of someone being as good as him, and because he knows Harry could be better than him if he wanted to.
