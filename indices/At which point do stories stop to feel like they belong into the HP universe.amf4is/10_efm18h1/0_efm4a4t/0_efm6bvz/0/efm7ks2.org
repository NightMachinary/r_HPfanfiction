that's the point. dumbledore does have inside knowledge of his life, because that's all there is to his life. he was a baby sociopath in a orphanage

this is another instance where legilimency is simply too OP an ability to be used consistently. we only see three legilimens in the series- voldemort, dumbledore and snape, and none use it as effectively as they could
