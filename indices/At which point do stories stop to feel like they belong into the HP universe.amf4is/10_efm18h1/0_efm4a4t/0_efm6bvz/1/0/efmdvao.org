But why should he? No other child was a threat to Voldemort at that point, and that was before his regular magic.

The Blitz didn't happen until after Voldemort's second year (and there was no way he could have predicted it in June when the year ended at Hogwarts because at that time the Dunkirk evacuation was just finished). And after 1940, attacks were sporadic since most of the offensive capabilities of the Luftwaffe were bound at the Eastern Front. It's not like Voldemort lived in Berlin or the Ruhr Area were massive air raids were a common occurrence for years.
