What was he supposed to do? He was simply the kid's principal, it wasn't like he had inside knowledge like he did of Harry's life. Riddle killed pets and traumatized children before he even met Dumbledore.

Sure, he shouldn't have lit the closet on fire...that was fucked up. But as far as he knew the kid had a place to sleep, food to eat, his own bedroom (unlike Harry), and wasn't being abused. There's probably more of an argument that Slughorn failed.
