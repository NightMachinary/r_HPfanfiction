I think Dumbledore did some truly shitty things, but when authors make him out to be truly evil and blame him for every wrong it feels less like Harry Potter and more like random bashing. Like I've seen people blame him for Voldemort turning out to be a homicidal maniac or Snape joining the Death Eaters.
