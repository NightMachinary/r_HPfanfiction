voldemort would kill the potters without giving lily a choice, then likely wipe out the longbottoms to be on the safe side. let's say sirius is still framed and sent to azkaban. wormtail would return to voldemort after his faking his death since he's still active. so it's now voldemort vs. dumbledore and the world. things are bleak, but can still turn around. you can have slughorn shaking off his cowardice and telling dumbledore about the horcruxes, dumbledore picking off the prominent death eaters. though, things could still go wrong if dumbledore fucked up with the ring again
