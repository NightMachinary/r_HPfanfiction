There's no such thing as bad ideas, only bad execution. You can mock "the power of love" but you'd better be very funny and a very good writer to make it work.

Death Eater apologism can work, but only if you make it AU enough that Death Eaters aren't literally homicidal magic-Nazis. Although at that point, you're far enough away from the HP universe that it could feel like "not Harry Potter anymore."
