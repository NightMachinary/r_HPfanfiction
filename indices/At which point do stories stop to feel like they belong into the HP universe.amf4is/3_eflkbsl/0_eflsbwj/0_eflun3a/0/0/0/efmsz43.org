Especially if the minority has no fucking choice.

Hermione was born in England, and she didn't /chose/ to have magic. Fuck her needing to assimilate, it's her life.

I mean, I do get the complaint when people voluntarily (or even semi-voluntarily) go somewhere else, but in this case a Muggleborn that is against being murdered never could make any choice.
