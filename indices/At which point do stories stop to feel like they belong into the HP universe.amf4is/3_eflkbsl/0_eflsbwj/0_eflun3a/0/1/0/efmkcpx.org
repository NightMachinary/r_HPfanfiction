Is it acceptable or good? No but One of the bigger parts of the death eaters is blood matters. Ability matters more. And that they didn't indiscriminately kill or something. I. Can't remember how they described it and I might have mixed another story in there but the author hasn't gone far into it yet but both sides used propaganda and Harry is sitting there playing both sides in a way. basically what I'm saying is it makes the whole thing more gray in which side is better, especially since it implies and shows dumbledore as doing nearly anything for the greater good.
