  and maybe even act as in a relationship, but love potions do not create love. They are just advanced rape drugs.

I would say they create some "kind" of love. Particularly Amortentia. Though clearly JKR believes in some kind of ideal, or maybe better, transcendental love that goes further than this "base" emotion (similar to how christian theologians like to describe God's love).

It's a shame that she didn't manage to put any reflections of that "true" love on the page though. Most of her romantic relationships don't really make the difference between them and the Merope/Riddle Senior relationship very clear. The closest we get is maybe the entirely 'off-screen' realtionship between James and Lily. Aside from that JKR seems to relish sacrificial love & martyrdom more than romantic - I actually have my doubts that she believes as strongly in romantic love as she likes to imply with her plot devices.
