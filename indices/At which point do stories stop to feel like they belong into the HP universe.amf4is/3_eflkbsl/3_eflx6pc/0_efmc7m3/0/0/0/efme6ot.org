It was certainly enough for Metrope to rape Riddle Sr for a year. That's what that line is about. It does not create true love. It makes the victim desire you sufficiently to have sex and maybe even act as in a relationship, but love potions do not create love. They are just advanced rape drugs.

[[/u/deathcrow]] would have a field day with that line. To make a long story short, Ron does not show a lot of love in the series (or any emotions not centred around anyone else). His interest in Hermione is not so much her well-being but if Harry banged her.
