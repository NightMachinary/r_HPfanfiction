I'd argue that it can be done well as long as you don't take it too serious. If your plot is Harry getting pissed with a few of the DA to spite Umbridge and somehow wake up in a pile of naked girls, that obviously ain't a serious story but can still be entertaining without violating the HP world. But if you suddenly insist that all the girls instantly love Harry and live to please him, that's an instant no.
