Some of the fics that are labeled "pureblood culture," along with some of the ones that focus on the Black family (and I like Black family stories a lot, but it's a bad trope that pops up in some of them). Some of the fics that try and turn Snape into a dark Gary Stu sort also do it.

Like, okay, I get that some people are fascinated with the idea of a upper-crust society and all, but some folks go way over board. One of the fics was a female James/Lord Voldemort and Sirius/Lily fic that just seemed like an allegory for thinly veiled racism. Lily was depicted as stupid, dumb, dirty, etc. and so was Sirius for consorting with muggles and other muggleborns.
