Read it a while ago and I can't remember the name, but I remember it was tagged something like "pureblood culture" or "pureblood traditions" on A03, but not Lily/Sirius. I believe it was only 3 chapters.

I don't normally read the "pureblood culture" stories, but I thought I would try it for a change and was going through the tags and was interested in the unusual pairings after I read the first chapter (which weren't identified on the front)...and then was pretty horrified at the story.
