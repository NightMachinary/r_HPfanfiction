What are some other types of weaponry you could see being deployed? Missiles and drones?

The only way I see it being useful, in any case, is if it's a wizard using muggle tech against wizards. If it's muggles v wizards then the muggles won't even be able to find or see their foes.

Edit: and I mentioned bullets because guns are what I could see Harry and co. realistically considering if they decided to you muggle weapons. I don't see Harry swooping in on a stealth bomber, you know? Also, remember that YOU were the one that initially brought up sniper rifles.
