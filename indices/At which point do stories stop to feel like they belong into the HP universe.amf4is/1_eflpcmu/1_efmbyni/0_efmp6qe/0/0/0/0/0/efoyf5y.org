  Yes I did mention them. Because I really don't know what Riddle could do with a Hornady A-MAX .50 (.50 BMG) round slamming into his chest, that he doesn't know is coming, from 3,540 m. I guess the whole "Notice me not" thing is gonna come in handy.

Let's just assume Muggles can't even find Tom for this example (notice-me-not charms or whatever reason). So instead you've got Harry on a ridge trying to snipe Tom. Whoever wins this fight depends on if Tom is aware of the possibility of guns, and if he knows Harry will employ them. I do agree that the first time a Wizard is killed by a gun, it'll be successful because it'll surprise them. But after that, I doubt a wizard would get killed by a gun again.

Ok. Like I said before, if shield charms are able to stop bullets, than Tom will have his own cooked up version of the Weasley shield-charm hats. Probably much better enchanted and with a much stronger charm, and with fail-safes built in.

If shield charms don't stop bullets, then Riddle has other options. He could disillusion himself, or wear an invisibility cloak, or he could even transfigure a bunch of inferi to look like him so Harry doesn't know which target to shoot.

Hell, maybe he could even come up with some standardized, always-on banishing charm that just repels any bullet that comes within a certain distance. Magic is about intent, after all. And it's incredibly versatile.

  Well in a full on war, yeah, I would expect a Muggle army to crush Riddle in pretty swift order.

Riddle would never allow a full tilt battle with two sides facing off in a field to happen. Muggles would essentially be fighting a guerilla force, only 1000x scarier. Imagine the USA's struggles against the Viet-Cong, only now Charlie can impersonate anyone, turn invisible, move silently through any encampment, heal incredibly fast, hide in a place that you can never find, convince your leaders to turn against you, unleash devastating fire that is nigh-impossible to put out....I mean I don't like the army's chances here.
