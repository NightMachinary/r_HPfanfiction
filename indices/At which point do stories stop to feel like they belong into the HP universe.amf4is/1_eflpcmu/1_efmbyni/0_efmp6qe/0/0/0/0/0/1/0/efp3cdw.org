You're right, canon Riddle is not creative in his magic. He's a plot device rather than a dude actually bent on world domination. But any situation in which you're pitting wizards verses muggles you're going to have to make Riddle uncreative if you want the muggles to win.

Just apparate into the residence of whoever has access to nuclear codes, imperious them to disarm or scuttle the bombs, and you're good to go. Or give them veritaserum (or Legilimency if it's Voldemort doing this), learn of the location of the nukes, travel there with your teleportation, and transfigure the nukes into butterflies.

  Even beyond that, Riddle would still be fucked. Statue of secrecy is gonna pop, and his territory is going to get carpet bombed in a way that makes the Blitz look tame.

Why would he stay in one spot, he has no need to stay in one place. And you really think the Powers that Be on the muggle side would just start bombing random places hoping they'd get a hit?

And we don't even know to what extent wards are useful in protecting against physical force. Maybe wards are worth more than just keeping Muggle attention focused elsewhere, maybe they can make a carpet bombing seem like a light rainstorm.
