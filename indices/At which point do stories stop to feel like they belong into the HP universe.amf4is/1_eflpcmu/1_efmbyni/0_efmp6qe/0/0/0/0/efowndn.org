Well in a full on war, yeah, I would expect a Muggle army to crush Riddle in pretty swift order.

Oooh, not being able to see or find would be an issue...on both sides. Last thing Londen needs like....the return of Napalm.

Well if it's just what Harry and Co can get their hands on, I don't know England's gun laws, but I know it's a lot stricter then the US. I'd imagine Double Barreled Shotgun to be about it. Bolt action rifle maybe.

I could see Harry and Co getting military support if he could somehow meet with the PM or the Queen. That'd be a story in and of itself. Of course, with them, he's just some kid.

Yes I did mention them. Because I really don't know what Riddle could do with a Hornady A-MAX .50 (.50 BMG) round slamming into his chest, that he doesn't know is coming, from 3,540 m. I guess the whole "Notice me not" thing is gonna come in handy.
