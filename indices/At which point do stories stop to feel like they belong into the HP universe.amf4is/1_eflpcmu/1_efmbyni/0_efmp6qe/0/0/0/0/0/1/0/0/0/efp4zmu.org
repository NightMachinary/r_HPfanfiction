  It's Riddle and what he has vs the entire world. He's gonna lose. He doesn't have the numbers in the end.
#+end_quote

Only against the world's militaries, which, if he operated in secret, he could pretty easily hamstring. Imperious/kill high ranking officials, destroy important tech, weapons, and vehicles.

Also, Riddle doesn't want to rule the world, just magical Britain. He would only fight Muggles if they actually found out about him. Even when the British PM took notice of the killings/etc in the later books, the muggles had no real recourse. Riddle wants to uphold the Statute of Secrecy if at all possible.

  Also, because Riddle and his people are TOTALLY up to date on everything muggle.
#+end_quote

As soon as you /Legilimens/ a few important people, you'd be extremely up to date.

  Transfigure the nuclear weapons into butterflies. Dude...not even Rowling decided to go that stupid.
#+end_quote

Fine, transfigure them into stones and drop them in a lake. Not sure why you're hung up on /what/ I decided to transfigure them into rather than the fact that, as a wizard, nuclear disarmament is triflingly easy.

  Also, yeah dude. I really do think they will start bombing the fuck out anywhere they think he might...because we've kinda been doing that for 19 years during the "War on terror."
#+end_quote

British government is /probably/ less amenable to indiscriminatley bombing their own country than glassing over the Middle East.

  That would be explosive force, vacuum force, extreme rapid increases in temperature, radiation, shrapnel, and all the other delightful ways "ordinance." ends life.

Military tech has to work within the bounds of physics and reality.

Wizard magic does not.
