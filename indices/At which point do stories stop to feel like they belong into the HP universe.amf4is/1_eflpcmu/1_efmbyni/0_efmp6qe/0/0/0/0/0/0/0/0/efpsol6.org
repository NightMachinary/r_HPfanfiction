  Wearing a shield hat takes away the need to constantly worry about having to get a Protego off. Or as I said, keep yourself disillusioned or under a cloak. Perhaps cloak the battlefield (or any area they'd be exposed to gunfire) in darkness or smoke.

These are all things which would've been incredibly useful in canon and yet we never saw them invented/implemented. So in a canon-compliant conversation I'd assume that they're not easy or quick to do.

  So much of the trouble against jinxes, hexes, and curses in canon is that there is such a variety.

Wait, a shield charm doesn't block all of them? I thought it did.

If it doesn't, then I think your idea of a banishing charm for bullets could work.
