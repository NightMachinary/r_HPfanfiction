  You're right, canon Riddle is not creative in his magic. He's a plot device rather than a dude actually bent on world domination. But any situation in which you're pitting wizards verses muggles you're going to have to make Riddle uncreative if you want the muggles to win.

It's Riddle and what he has vs the entire world. He's gonna lose. He doesn't have the numbers in the end. That's even looking aside internal problems. Assuming he has all of what he finds acceptable in Magical Britain behind him, he can't afford to lose much. How is he even going to feed an army anyway? Hell, he doesn't even HAVE an army.

  Just apparate into the residence of whoever has access to nuclear codes, imperious them to disarm or scuttle the bombs, and you're good to go. Or give them veritaserum (or Legilimency if it's Voldemort doing this), learn of the location of the nukes, travel there with your teleportation, and transfigure the nukes into butterflies.

Because you can totally apparete across the entire ocean, to the exact people you need to get, at exactly the right time. Also, because Riddle and his people are TOTALLY up to date on everything muggle. Real experts in muggle society. Hopefully he manages to kill every single solitary person in magical Britain that could give information about him and his side.

Transfigure the nuclear weapons into butterflies. Dude...not even Rowling decided to go that stupid.

  Why would he stay in one spot, he has no need to stay in one place. And you really think the Powers that Be on the muggle side would just start bombing random places hoping they'd get a hit?

Where else is he gonna go? How is he going to hold Britain with his tiny amount of followers if he isn't there? Kind of hard to rule something if you're constantly on the run. Where is he going to get his supplies? His food? His shelter? Is he going to magic up every single thing he needs every moment of every day? Given how important the support of people like Malfoy, to give up their homes and money to his cause, I'm guessing not.

Also, yeah dude. I really do think they will start bombing the fuck out anywhere they think he might...because we've kinda been doing that for 19 years during the "War on terror."

Even more so if he's somehow managed to take out every single member of the nuclear chain (HA!!).

  And we don't even know to what extent wards are useful in protecting against physical force. Maybe wards are worth more than just keeping Muggle attention focused elsewhere, maybe they can make a carpet bombing seem like a light rainstorm.

That would be explosive force, vacuum force, extreme rapid increases in temperature, radiation, shrapnel, and all the other delightful ways "ordinance." ends life.

The assumption that every other countries internal magical communities don't get involved to support.

And again, Riddle can't lose ANY people. How's he going to get more? Just gonna grow soldiers? He's gonna be really, REALLY fucking busy doing all this.
