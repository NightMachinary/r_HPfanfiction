  Let's just assume Muggles can't even find Tom for this example (notice-me-not charms or whatever reason). So instead you've got Harry on a ridge trying to snipe Tom. Whoever wins this fight depends on if Tom is aware of the possibility of guns, and if he knows Harry will employ them. I do agree that the first time a Wizard is killed by a gun, it'll be successful because it'll surprise them. But after that, I doubt a wizard would get killed by a gun again.

Well, I'd say Riddle is safe anyway. Harry certainly isn't an experienced marksman, and with his vision, I doubt he ever would be.

Though that does bring up something that could get scary. Some manner of magic enhanced gun/bullets. Mmm, not very Harry Potterish though.

  Ok. Like I said before, if shield charms are able to stop bullets, than Tom will have his own cooked up version of the Weasley shield-charm hats. Probably much better enchanted and with a much stronger charm, and with fail-safes built in.

Mmm...possible, though from canon Riddle? Doubtful. For his all power, the guy doesn't seem to have much creativity. Though, given the usually efficiency of the Killing curse, why waste time?

  Riddle would never allow a full tilt battle with two sides facing off in a field to happen. Muggles would essentially be fighting a guerilla force, only 1000x scarier. Imagine the USA's struggles against the Viet-Cong, only now Charlie can impersonate anyone, turn invisible, move silently through any encampment, heal incredibly fast, hide in a place that you can never find, convince your leaders to turn against you, unleash devastating fire that is nigh-impossible to put out....I mean I don't like the army's chances here.

1000X scarier and a BILLION times outnumbered. A charlie that can do all that? And has conquered England? If you can't see that, that entire island is going glow in the dark for the next hundred years I'm going to laugh. Also, we aren't exactly sure just how infalible magic is once muggles REALLY start looking for them.

Because that is exactly what would happen. "Can't find them, can't find them, can't be sure who they might be? Well...as the song says, nuke the site from orbit, only way to be sure."

Even beyond that, Riddle would still be fucked. Statue of secrecy is gonna pop, and his territory is going to get carpet bombed in a way that makes the Blitz look tame.

Him and his how many followers? 1000? Maybe? Vs....every army in the world?
