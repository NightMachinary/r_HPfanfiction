  Riddle couldn't easily kill a child, despite trying his ass off. He couldn't kill ONE old man (Albeit probably the best Wizard in England) Another child, Regulus, figured out his horcrux gimmick.

These are other wizards. A wizard could easily win against muggles, not so easily against other wizards. This is the core of my argument.

"He couldn't kill ONE old man" you say, well of course he couldn't, because as you point out that old man is an incredibly powerful wizard. Wizards are incredibly powerful.

"He couldn't easily kill a child" because the child was protected by magic, something no muggle has access to. He is defeated by magic. I never tried to prove otherwise.

  Because it was literally the dumbest thing you said until you said it would be 'triflingly easy."
#+end_quote

Again, why? Why is it hard for a wizard to transfigure a bomb into something that's no longer dangerous or useful? Why do you think that is stupid?

#+begin_quote
  Because he totally knows who those people are, where they are, and can get to them easily.
#+end_quote

If he casts legilimency on the PM, he has access to the entirety of their thoughts. Same for any world leader. Go far enough up the chain and you've got all the information you need. He's not on a timetable here, because when he starts his war the muggles have no idea he exists.

  wiping nuclear codes (Which would just get changed)
#+end_quote

Doesn't matter if the codes are changed, the bombs are gone. He changed them into butterflies or stones or poker chips.

  NOT get shot to death on site by the outnumbering guards.
#+end_quote

Invisibility cloaks. Polyjuice. Disillusionment charms. Confundus charms. Why do you assume the guards could even see a wizard who was trying to sneak in?

#+begin_quote
  across the fucking world
#+end_quote

Apparition means distance doesn't matter.

  AND LETS NOT FORGET that Riddle's crack army couldn't even beat a ragtag bunch of school children and teachers.
#+end_quote

Who were wizards, and who also had God-Rowling on their side.

#+begin_quote
  Never saw Riddle or any of his supporters do anything half as impressive as Military tech. Air support would have wiped out Riddle's entire force before they could even rush Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

TIL time travel, invisibility, transporting instantaneously through space, reading minds, seeing into the future, creating an infinite source of water from nothing, changing the fundamental nature of objects, flying without any means of propulsion, and healing broken bones overnight are less impressive than air support.
