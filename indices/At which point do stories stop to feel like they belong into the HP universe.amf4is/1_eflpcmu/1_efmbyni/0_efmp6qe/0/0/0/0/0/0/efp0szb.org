  But after that, I doubt a wizard would get killed by a gun again.

I doubt they'd manage to be that consistently aware and prepared. Considering that we see wizards hit each other with spells due to poor shielding in canon, I can't envision a world that's canon compliant where they are consistently and always ready to defend against potential sniper fire.

The bigger issue I see is Harry and co both learning how to fire consistently accurately from great range, and being lucky enough to find their opponents out in the open or near a window every time.
