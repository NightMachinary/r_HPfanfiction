  Only against the world's militaries, which, if he operated in secret, he could pretty easily hamstring. Imperious/kill high ranking officials, destroy important tech, weapons, and vehicles.

  Also, Riddle doesn't want to rule the world, just magical Britain. He would only fight Muggles if they actually found out about him. Even when the British PM took notice of the killings/etc in the later books, the muggles had no real recourse. Riddle wants to uphold the Statute of Secrecy if at all possible.

There you go with that "easily" crap again. Riddle couldn't easily kill a child, despite trying his ass off. He couldn't kill ONE old man (Albeit probably the best Wizard in England) Another child, Regulus, figured out his horcrux gimmick.

Magical Britain is going to collapse pretty fucking quick. Especially give that most of his supporters are of the pure blood nobility type. I can't see any of them knowing how to, or be willing to do, the hard work of keeping a society running. House elves better have their shit together.

This also entails that magical Britain in no form or fashion lets the rest of Britain know what's going on. Also that Riddle can, or have someone, play nice with Britain's government. He can't hope to mind fuck every single person that gets elected, or hope to keep a puppet in power.

  As soon as you Legilimens a few important people, you'd be extremely up to date.
#+end_quote

Because he totally knows who those people are, where they are, and can get to them easily. Also, Riddle blew himself up in 1981, how much of the wider muggle world does he even know about at this point? I can't see him keeping up to date, so even if he HAS the information. Does he even understand it? Because I guarantee his Pure blood regimen are going to be just as clueless as Arthur Weasley. Then there is the question of trying to Legilimens minds that aren't filled with the same language that he understands.

  Fine, transfigure them into stones and drop them in a lake. Not sure why you're hung up on what I decided to transfigure them into rather than the fact that, as a wizard, nuclear disarmament is triflingly easy.

Because it was literally the dumbest thing you said until you said it would be 'triflingly easy."

He also has to do all of this himself, as who on his side has the skill and power? He also has to pop into a secured military base that he knows nothing about, across the fucking world, and NOT get shot to death on site by the outnumbering guards.

  British government is probably less amenable to indiscriminatley bombing their own country than glassing over the Middle East.
#+end_quote

I don't think anyone is going to care what the British government has to say if they've been conquered by some snakey nutcase who, in your scenario, is wiping nuclear codes (Which would just get changed) trying to mind fuck entire governments worth of people, and somehow vanishing their weapons.

Panic easily leads to "Fuck em."

  Military tech has to work within the bounds of physics and reality.
#+end_quote

Wizard magic does not.

Never saw Riddle or any of his supporters do anything half as impressive as Military tech. Air support would have wiped out Riddle's entire force before they could even rush Hogwarts.

AND LETS NOT FORGET that Riddle's crack army couldn't even beat a ragtag bunch of school children and teachers.
