Wearing a shield hat takes away the need to constantly worry about having to get a /Protego/ off. Or as I said, keep yourself disillusioned or under a cloak. Perhaps cloak the battlefield (or any area they'd be exposed to gunfire) in darkness or smoke.

Or, again, a bullet-focused banishment charm. Bullets are a constant, not changing like spells. So much of the trouble against jinxes, hexes, and curses in canon is that there is such a variety. With bullets, you know what you need to repel, all you gotta do is enchant your underwear or Prince Albert piercing to do it.

You make a point about the bigger issue is teaching wizards to effectively use the guns. If they're trying to divide their time in between learning to be better wizards and learning to be better marksman, they're just going to fall further and further behind "full" wizards.
