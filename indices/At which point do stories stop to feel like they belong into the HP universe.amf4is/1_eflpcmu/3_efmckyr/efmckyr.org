I do think that muggles can beat the wizards through sheer power of mass destruction through icbms and other kinds of missiles. Not easily and at no small cost, but doable.

BUT, I don't think any government would ever go through with that simply because there is no way to know if you got them all. Maybe some were overseas or managed to get away in time.

Then they would have to forever worry about people who can go invisible, teleport, mind control and so on coming for revenge. It is just not a realistic risk any government would ever take unless the wizards really fucked up.
