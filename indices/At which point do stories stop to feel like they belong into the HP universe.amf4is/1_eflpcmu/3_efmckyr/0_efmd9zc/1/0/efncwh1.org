Stalin started the purges because he suspected the military was full of traitors. He didn't know if he would get all. He knew that there was always a risk. But that didn't stop him. Mao carried out "reforms" which killed tens of millions. If he had to sacrifice a few millions as collateral damage to ensure a successful purge of the magical population then he would do it.

And dictators like them were the +Senate+ government. If they decided to purge the magical population then there would be a purge. And neither cared very much about causing a few million of their own people to die. The death tolls for their own population are estimated up to 20 millions for Stalin and 68 for Mao.
