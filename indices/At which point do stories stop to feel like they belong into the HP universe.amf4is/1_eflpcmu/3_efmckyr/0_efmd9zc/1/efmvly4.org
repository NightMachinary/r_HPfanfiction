You misunderstood my point.

I am not saying nobody would do it because they are afraid to kill people.

I am saying no government would do it because then they would have no way to know if they got them all, so they would have to live the rest of their life worried about the survivors, people who can teleport, go invisible, mind control, kill with a word and so on, coming for revenge.

Mao and Stalin didn't have to worry about that, unless someone is hiding a really big fucking secret.
