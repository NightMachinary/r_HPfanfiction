Most of non-magic AUs feel that way. Most of the time, they don't even try to incorporate canon backstories and events. I mean, if the setting is different, and the characters don't have the same background, then it's just original fiction with canon names slapped on.

On the other hand, when fics delve too deep in "pureblood culture" as they see it, adding pagan religions, making the conflict with Voldemort all about traditionally Dark vs Light families/magic, whatever that means, and having everyone act like they are in a Victorian drama.
