I can handle next to anything besides certain kinds of plot structures and tropes. Outside of something done phenomenally well (if it's ever even happened), anything involving kids talking about or getting good at "politics" not only feels out of place it makes me feel stupider. HP should be about mystery and adventure, otherwise I tend to lose interest.
