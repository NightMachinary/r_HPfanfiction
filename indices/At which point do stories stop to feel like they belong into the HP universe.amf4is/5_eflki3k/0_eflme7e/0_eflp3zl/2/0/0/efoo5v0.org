The legwork of any activity is dull. It's not like the reader actually accompanies Harry and co when they spend 8 hours in the library looking for some information they need to solve the mystery. The point of a story, if it's been written competently, is to shape the narrative in a dramatic fashion.

There are plenty of political dramas out there that are very successful, and spread across a variety of sub-genres. For example:

- Serious political drama: The West Wing, The Good Wife, House of Cards

- Political comedy: Yes, Minister, The Thick of It, Veep

- Political action thrillers: Fair Game

- Historical political drama: Amazing Grace

To be blunt, it's somewhat absurd to suggest that politics cannot be turned into an interesting story.
