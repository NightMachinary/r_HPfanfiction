  To be blunt, it's somewhat absurd to suggest that politics cannot be turned into an interesting story.

What I said was that it could be done well but almost never is in HP fanfic, it's just a thing that's technically present in the story but in a very boring way. The user I responded to was referring to characters "getting good at politics", not political shows or shows with a strong political element to them (which often are about the interactions of the people in politics and their interactions, as opposed to the political process).
