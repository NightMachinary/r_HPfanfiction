The actual process of politics I mean. It would be incredibly boring to actually participate in the US Congress, for instance. For some years now they've passed a historically low number of laws, a significant amount of the actual "work" of a congressperson involves calling lobbyists for support (money), talking on news outlets and occasionally calling people before certain committees (CSPAN is usually suuuuper boring to watch).

So what I'm thinking of is something like the Wizengamot is going to either be boring in a fanfic or it's going to be a bit over the top with what happens. It could be made fun, but only if used very sparingly I think.
