I do like politics when done well, but if it gets into the boring nitty gritty of politics, or if political power moves are the norm then it feels a little silly to me. A good way to use politics, I think, is to show the different ideologies (and this different goals) of the various factions in the story so you can avoid just saying what they believe or what group they are part of.
