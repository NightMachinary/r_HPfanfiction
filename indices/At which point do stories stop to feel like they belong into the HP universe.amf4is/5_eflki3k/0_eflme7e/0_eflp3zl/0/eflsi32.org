Almost everything, realistically, is boring and dry. Even the most exciting job in the world is still like 98% just filling out the fucking paperwork and complaining that someone left an old tuna fish sandwich in the fridge at work.

Political thrillers can be fantastic, and there's no reason they can't be set in something that's nominally the HP universe. Although at that point, it sure doesn't feel like HP anymore.
