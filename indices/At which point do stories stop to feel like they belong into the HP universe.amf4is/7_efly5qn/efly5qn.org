When the story features Harry as the protagonist, but the author changes Harry to the point where he's not even recognizable anymore.

They change his name, he moves to a new place, he changes his hair, his personality does a complete 180 with little to no reason behind the change etc

I can't even remember which story it was, because I tapped out before the first chapter was over, but there was one story I read where Harry was picked up by a Japanese family when he was a child, they changed his name to HERI (fucking kill me), he started wearing kimonos everywhere, grew his hair so long it reached his legs and grew up to be extremely feminine and graceful

It is so goddamn obvious they just want to write a story with an OC main character, but they know it won't get any hits, so they just change Harry up, knowing more people will click if he's involved. JUST WRITE A STORY WITH AN OC. CHRIST. STOP FETISHIZING AN 11 YEAR OLD BOY AND MAKING HIM A WEIRD SEX GEISHA
