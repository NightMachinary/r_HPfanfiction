"system"?

lolwut.jpg

The magic in Harry Potter is in no way a system. It doesn't function by rules and limits in a Sanderson-esque way. The magic is more about flavor and tone and style and feeling. It pushes the plot in certain directions, helps us understand the people in this world, and provides a framework for Harry's transition from downtrodden child to sort-of-everyman to self-sacrificing hero.

First, you shout some faux-latin nonsense to cast a spell. Until you don't have to anymore.

First, wizards use flying brooms to get around, until they don't anymore because the floo is objectively better. Then the use the floo until they don't because portkeys are objectively better.

First, Harry is famous for something his mother did, and no dummy, but is otherwise magically unremarkable, until he casts a Patronus that repels dozens or hundreds of dementors at once, a feat beyond any but the very greatest of wizards. But that's kinda OP so let's just go ahead and ignore it for the rest of the series.

But okay, sarcastic asshole-y comments aside, I agree with your point about creating and using magic that doesn't "feel Harry Potter." It's less about following a certain set of rules in a system and more about creating a feeling or vibe to magic that is at odds with the quirky, idiosyncratic, non-system of Harry Potter.

I'd even say that when authors TRY to turn Harry Potter into a "system" that can be gamed or rules-lawyered, then it stops feeling like Harry Potter magic.
