Portkeys are single use and set up in advance, not to mention apparently regulated by the ministry: they're not really used all that much, just when you need to transport large numbers of people.\\
Brooms are mostly used for sports, but also serve as a mode of transport when you need to go somewhere you haven't been before (so you can't visualise it for apparition) that doesn't have a fireplace (for floo).\\
Floo is probably the most common method, it's limited in that it's one at a time and needs a fireplace, but seems to be the default. It's safer than apparition, faster than brooms and far less hassle than a portkey.\\
Apparition is the second most common, if you know your destination it's probably your fastest option. But it's not as easy, you can injure yourself quite badly if you mess up, and you can't do it until you're an adult, so not great for families. Side along is an option, but not for many people at once.

The incantation does seem to matter, but it turns out that it's thinking the words, not saying them, that does it. Clearly pronunciation and such matters, so teaching verbally first is a must if you want to be able to correct people, and it's likely much easier to focus on the words by saying them aloud.
