Adding on to this, when they introduce complicated new magic that doesn't fit in with the book magic systems. It's fine to add new stuff if it feels plausible within the Wizarding World universe, but if you make the whole thing about angels and demons or have one person suddenly magically bound to marry eight people, it jumps the shark. Don't get me wrong, I still might read it, but it definitely stops feeling like the Wizarding World to me.
