That's the thing There are distinct limitations but also we never see the limits actually pushed, we're told that FiendFyre is dangerous, but we see no other wide spread dangerous spells or effects, Inferni are at most considering evil and super dangerous dark magic but seem to be at most a inconvince for a wizards with even a bit of forewarning or even with a bit of a cool head (Harry failed because he was freaking out over Dumbledore and possibly breaking the old man's mind with the potion) the wizards can protect themselves from them.

HP's magic system makes sense when you just accept that they are localized Reality Manipulators, but once you ask what they can't do or what's the worst you can do it becomes a shithole
