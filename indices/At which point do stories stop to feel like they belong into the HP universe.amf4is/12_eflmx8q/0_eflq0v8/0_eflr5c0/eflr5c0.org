Actually, you got me there-- I wasn't thinking about FB fanfiction. But no, I generally wouldn't consider stories that aren't at least tangentially about Harry to be part of the HP fanfiction realm anymore. I'm not personally interested in reading about OCs out on their in the wizarding world, though it might be someone else's cup of tea.
