That's quite interesting to me. I get that feeling quite a lot on this sub. I know all the books are 'Harry Potter and the . . . whatever', but for me, 'Harry Potter' is synonymous with 'the wizarding world'. I want stories about other characters, but it seems you wouldn't call those Harry Potter fanfiction at all? Perhaps there should be more clearly delineated divisions between HP fanfiction, WW fanfiction and FB fanfiction. That would work for me. If I could look for 'wizarding world' fics I might find it easier to find things I want to read.
