I'm cool with Harry/Henry/Harold/Hadrian etc etc. Even if some of them are a bit pretentious. I mean more like when it's "Harry Potter" but he changes his name to Varani and moves to Canada and has no further interaction with any of the other HP characters. Which is my vague collection of a fic I have nope'd out on before. I'm sure it was lovely and others liked it, but not for me. There are some exceptions to this, of course (like Basilisk-born), but in general...
