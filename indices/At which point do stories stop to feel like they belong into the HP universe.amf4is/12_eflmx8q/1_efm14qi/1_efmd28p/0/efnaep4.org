I think I just got a bit tired after I read a story that had him called Hadrianus or something mad like that. Like Hadrian I can even understand, if it is a bit pretentious, with the nickname "harry" but Hadrianus was something else.

TBH Harold or Harrison or Henry or even Heinrich would make more sense with the rest of the characters. Ron is named Ronald, not Ron, James full name is James, not Jim, etc. But it does take me out of the story a bit, unless the character is nicknamed Harry.
