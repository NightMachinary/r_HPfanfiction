I don't necessarily mind when they change the first name because "harry" does seem rather plain in the Wizarding World (even Ron is Ronald Billius) and it's commonly a nickname for Henry or Harold or so on. But his name is changed, it becomes weird when the author doesn't refer to him as Harry as as nickname but always refers to him as Henry or whatever.

Also, Hadrianus or Hadrian or Hieronmyus make me roll my eyes.
