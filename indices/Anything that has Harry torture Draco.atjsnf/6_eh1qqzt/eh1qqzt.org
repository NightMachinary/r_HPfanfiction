Linkffn(One Wizard Too Many by KUcrow1997) - Harry pulls out his teeth with a pair of pliers.

Linkffn(An Incomplete Potter Collection by Racke) - Tiny snippet at the top of chapter 9. They're dueling and Harry uses a combination of mostly basic spells to prevent him from yielding, then hurting him. Eg. breaking a rib then using a forced laughter jinx.
