There's one where Harry unknowingly takes after his mother's method and tortures and kill Death Eaters (the muggle way) later with the help of other students wanting revenge. I seem to remember Draco was one of the first to be interrogated but I don't remember the title. Someone might know it from this description.

If I find it back I'll be sure to update
