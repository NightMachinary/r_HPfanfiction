#+begin_quote
  Harry has always thought that he was a normal boy. Then Hagrid came and told him that he was a wizard. But that can't be right, can it? When he learns about House Elves, though, Harry is sure that he has finally discovered what he really is. And surely working at Hogwarts will be nicer than staying with the Dursleys...?
