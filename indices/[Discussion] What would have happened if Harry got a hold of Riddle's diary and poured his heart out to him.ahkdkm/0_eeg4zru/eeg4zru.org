Only God knows but logically given enough time, both the dairy and scar would merge and take over Harry. This new Harrymort would then attract and absorb the corporeal Voldemort that flew away at the end of the first book.

I'd say given how the dairy and the scar were unaffected by whatever Lily Potter did, it is fair to assume that protection only fights against physically present Voldemort. Horcruxes are high-level meta things, aren't they?
