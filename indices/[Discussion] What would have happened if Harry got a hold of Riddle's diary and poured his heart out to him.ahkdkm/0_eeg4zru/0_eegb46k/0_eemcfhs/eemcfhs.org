  should feel remorse to merge together again, shouldn't it? And that's highly unlikely of Voldemort

That's a good point you make. But also consider this. Why would Voldemort spread his Horcruxes if he was so sure that no one will find them or get past his defenses? I'm thinking that these soul shards are volatile and have a tendency to merge together into one Horcrux. [Now he might have to feel remorse to have them merge into his main self. But this is all our speculation] Yes, I know the other reason is to have multiple redundancies in case one fails... but Tom Riddle has always been arrogant.
