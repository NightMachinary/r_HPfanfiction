  That is considered to be a plot hole because by all logic, the shard should have been BBQed.

Not really a plot hole. It's perfectly consistent with the rest of canon.

Harry touches many horcruxes without anything happening.

Harry's protection in PS burns Voldemort's physical shell, it does not attack the spirit of Voldemort itself.

Voldemort makes himself immune from the blood protection by placing a protective power into his blood, a physical, bodily protection.

In short, the blood protection manifests itself against:

A) Only Voldemort himself, not his horcruxes, and

B) Only Voldemort's physical shell, not his spirit.
