There's nothing new with the whole bashing experience. The Weasleys have been giving Harry and Hermione love potions? Oh no! Harry's been lied to by Dumbledore, and Dumbledore has been stealing money from him? Oh no.

Harry is actually heir to Potter/Malfoy/Black/Weasley/Dumbledore/Gryffindor Et Cetra and has a seat on the Wizengamot? For what reason? Harry has a trillion galleons, the majority of which he will never use, big whoop.

Harry is nice to the Goblins and suddenly the Goblins are nice to him? The Potters had a secret will, that says specifically that Pettigrew was the Secret Keeper that Dumbledore knew about, but kept hidden? Oh No!

Harry is a secret Animagus form that hasn't been seen since the times of Merlin?

Ron is the biggest idiot, who calls Hermione a Mudblood, and only wants her for her looks? (Which in these Hermione is often just replaced for Emma Watson) Snape's hatred of Harry is taken even more extreme then it was in canon?

Just why? Why all of that? It's been done to death, it's just for shock value or OP wank, if there were different takes on it, or expanded upon takes it would be different, but it's just not written well at all, for the majority of the time.

Bashing is more often then not used as a crutch, something that a writer uses when they can't think of a proper story themselves.
