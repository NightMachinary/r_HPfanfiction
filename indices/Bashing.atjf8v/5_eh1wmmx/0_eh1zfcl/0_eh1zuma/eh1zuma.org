And then the very obnoxious Hadrian Potter and the like, just why?! Just why, I don't understand it. I mean we have a Prince Harry, if Harry is a good name for the prince, it's a good name for a Potter!

And the thing that really irks me is that the will thing, like Pettigrew is Secret Keeper, if we're dead then that means Pettigrew betrayed us, go get him! That's not a reasonable response for a will to have.

Also the only Lord that we know of is Lord Voldemort, and that's just a name that he thought of himself, do you honestly think that if Lords were a thing and that Lucius was one, Draco would keep quiet about it? I highly doubt so.
