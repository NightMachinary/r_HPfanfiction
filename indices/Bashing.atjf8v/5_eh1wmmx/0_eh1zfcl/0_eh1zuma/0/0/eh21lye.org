The please check on Peter because he might be in danger, is at least a lot better of a phrasing then if we're dead that means Pettigrew betrayed us! Which is something that I've seen in those Harry betrayed by people he used to look up to trope.

I just don't see James or Lily assuming that if they died then that means Pettigrew betrayed them. That's a bit too much, for me.
