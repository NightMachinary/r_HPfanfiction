I consider it bashing when one of these three things occur:

1. The character is written as stupider/meaner than in canon, while eliminating his/her positive characteristics, without any explanation as to why the character has changed. ("Molly cast the Cruciatus Curse on Luna, telling her 'that will teach you to interrupt my lunch.'")
2. The narrative takes constant, gratuitous shots at the character but not at other characters. ("Molly heaved her fat bottom out of her bed and waddled to the kitchen, leaving a puddle of drool on her pillow.")
3. The people who canonically love the character suddenly despise him or her for his or her canon behavior. ("Arthur had always hated Molly for refusing to get a job outside the house. He also hated her because she yelled at Fred and George when they blew things up. In fact, Arthur hated everything about Molly and was carefully plotting her demise.")
