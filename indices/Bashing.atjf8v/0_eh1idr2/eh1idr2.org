For me Bashing is Bashing when a writer can have written the chapter and then goes back to figure out where he can throw in some snide remarks and a quick little display of power throughout the chapter.

Like Ron's eating habits whenever Harry and Ron end up being remotely close to one another as they eat. Or Harry and Ron are remotely close to one another when a Slytherin friend/LI comes over Ron can't help but butt in.

Or Something happens somewhere else and Ron or Draco is there to throw a snide comment at Harry and he quickly slams them into a wall or stuns them before leaving.

As soon as a minimal amount of actual effort is made it is not bashing any more, it is just dark/evil/Non-canon characterisations.
