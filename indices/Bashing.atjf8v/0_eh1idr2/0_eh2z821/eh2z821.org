Ron's eating habits are always interesting, and his apparent tendency to butt in, or just get jealous and leave, can be tricky to work with.

I think the difference between bashing and just portraying the character, is how their negative traits are shown. Bashing would be focusing on any irritating or negative traits as an example of how they're the worst person in the universe. On the other hand, portraying the character as flawed and imperfect, but still worthwhile, would be done by showing these traits as flaws, that the character does have, but having those around the character see them as things that aren't of great import, can be worked around, or are even endearing.

Does that make sense? I'm tired AF today, so I don't know.
