The difference between bashing and villainizing a character is that a villainous character does not have to be a loser or universally hated. A villain can still be a fun and engaging character, as well as being treated with respect from the narrative.

Bashing means that you through your story keep telling the reader "This character SUCKS!" It's a way of declaring your hatred for a character and insisting that the reader should hate the character too. You don't even have to turn a character into a villain in order to bash them... plenty of Ron-bashing fics don't turn him into a villain, they just turn him into a pathetic loser with no redeeming qualities whom nobody likes.

So, to take your idea with a capable puppet master Dumbledore... well, turning Dumbledore evil often goes hand in hand with bashing because it doesn't come from a "what cool story could I tell with Dumbledore as a villain?" mindset... it comes from a place of anger, loathing and a hint of revenge: "Dumbledore SUCKS and he HAS to be a villain because all the crap he did to Harry so I'm going to write a story where Harry becomes super-powerful and exposes him for the total monster he is!"

And so, the "evil Dumbledore" story becomes not an interesting alternate take on a canon character, or a legitimate exploration of his darker sides. It just turns him into a cardboard figure who's really only there to be taken down by (a usually overpowered) Harry, while being told how much he sucks.

Turning a character into a villain without bashing requires a LOT more effort. For one thing, if you just want to turn them into a villain in order to see your fave characters beat them cause you feel they deserve it, that's going to be bashing no matter how you put it.
