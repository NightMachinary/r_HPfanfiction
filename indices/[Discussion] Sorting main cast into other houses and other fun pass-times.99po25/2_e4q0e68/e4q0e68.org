  I would like to see how a main cast from different houses would interact with one another and overcome their differences.

First for a related rec: linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity)

Whatever the Sorting Hat said in his songs should be taken as advertising. I think the qualities of the Houses are more reflected in what the new student finds important in life; what they value, even if they don't have it.

EDIT: which apparently [[/u/averysillyman][u/averysillyman]] already said, but I'm not the first person to bloviate in agreement around here.

Gryffindors value popularity and positive attention. It rather explains why Peter Pettigrew and Neville were sent there.

Hufflepuffs value involvement and participation. They're the ones who want everyone to be attended to. Even the shyest of them would be motivated to make sure that they 'did their part'.

Ravenclaws value being right. Not righteous, mind you, but to have the correct answer - to be /proven/ right. The slowest of them still aspire to be there with the right information when someone asks about what they find interesting. It's the most competitive, isolating House. They tend to travel alone or in pairs (for how can you be right unless someone else is wrong).

Slytherins value influence. They don't have to be the most powerful, but they enjoy flexing their resources, especially if it might get them more. It attracts bullies as much as business magnates or dark sorcerers.
