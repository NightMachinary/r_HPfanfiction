  how did Hermione end up in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw?!?! I would argue her most defining characteristic is her desire for knowledge.

It's always been my headcanon that the Sorting Hat places people in houses based on what they /value/, not what they /are/.

The kids are eleven years old, for crying out loud. You can't really have an eleven-year-old that is super cunning and political (despite what some fanfictions may lead you to believe). And it's hard to have a brave eleven-year-old when the vast majority of kids would have never been in a situation that would require them to actually face their fears and stand up for what they believe in. However, it is definitely plausible for an eleven-year-old to /want/ to be smart, or cunning, or brave, or... hufflepuff. This would also explain why the majority of people get sorted into the same house as their parents, as a child's values are often heavily influenced by those of the parents.

For example, despite how he turned out later, Neville was clearly not brave or courageous at eleven years old. However, you could definitely argue that being brave was one of young Neville's biggest desires, and thus would make him a perfect fit for Gryffindor.

Likewise, despite Hermione being "smart", you could argue that some of her biggest character traits are that she's very big on standing up for what she believes in and doing the "right thing", even if that means working tirelessly on some elf campaign that nobody cares about, or following along with Harry/Ron's stupid plan to investigate the third floor corridor at risk of being expelled.
