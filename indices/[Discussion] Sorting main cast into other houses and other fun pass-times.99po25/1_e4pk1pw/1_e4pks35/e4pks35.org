I think she has both desire for knowledge AND bravery and courage in equal measure. I've seen the argument that she had already embraced the intelligent part of herself developed and her bravery needed a good environment to grow in. Hence, Gryffindor. The only issue with that is that implies that people in other houses can't become brave because their house isn't MEANT to develop that trait. Or any other trait. Hufflepuffs won't develop intellectual curiosity because they aren't in a house that fosters it, Slytherin and loyalty and Ravenclaw with hard work.

I think she should be in Ravenclaw and STILL find the part of her that is a Gryffindor rather than be in a house that mocks her for being smart while she grows some courage.
