As to other houses for characters, I'm always a bit troubled by what people come up with.

Harry fits pretty well in Gryffindor. He's not particularly cunning or ambitious so no Slytherin and he doesn't value knowledge above all else so no Ravenclaw either. Maaaybe Hufflepuff, but it'd be pretty difficult considering his hot-headed "my way or the highway" attitude. Not that it wouldn't be valuable for him.

Ron: Really, where else should he go? He's a simpleton and a proud ignoramus, so Slytherin and Ravenclaw are right out. In Hufflepuff he'd probably be stuck to the ceiling the first few nights for being a bully. Not sure if he'd ever learn to be a team player, but I have little hope that he has it in him.

Neville: Could maybe be a Puffer, but his bravery arc is one of the stronger elements of the HP novels for me ("don't judge a book by it's cover", "silent waters", etc. yadda yadda)

Hermione: She's the only one I can see in any of the houses. I don't think I've ever seen a fanfic that put her in Hufflepuff, but I blame that solely on HBP. I've pointed out plenty of times on this subreddit that any Muggleborn Gryffindor as smart as Hermione but not as loyal would have gotten her and her parents out of Britain after GoF.
