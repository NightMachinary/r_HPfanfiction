If I'm reading a fic that's bad, then I can tell it's bad without looking at what plot devices it's using. And if the fic is bad, I won't read it. I've long since stopped looking at what tropes a fic uses to give me an indication of quality. It's like asking what ingredients went into a cake to figure out when it's good. I'd rather just taste it.
