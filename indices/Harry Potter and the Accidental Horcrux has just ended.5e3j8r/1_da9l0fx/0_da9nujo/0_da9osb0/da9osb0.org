98% of the time it's used to say that Harry's is inexplicably hundreds of times bigger than Voldemort's and there's no reasonable explanation other than 'fate' which is just a deus ex machina. There's also never a rational relationship between size and stamina, nor is there a reasonable explanation how the size of one's core affects one's ability to learn and reproduce various feats of magic. It's just Harry's is bigger therefore everything he does with it is automatically better and he's just got some amazing instinct. It comes out looking like a bad dick joke.
