To add to this: every fandom has its own tropes that the better authors don't want to use, because of the associations. Larger fandoms tend to have more, and as HP is probably the largest it means that there's a much bigger list of tropes that make the reader go 'oh well, looks like this is a chance for the author to metaphorically (and sometimes literally) jerk off to their super awesome Mary Sue'.
