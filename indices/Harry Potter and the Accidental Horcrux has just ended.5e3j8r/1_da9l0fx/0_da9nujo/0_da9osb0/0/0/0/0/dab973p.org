I would like to see a fic where Harry's "core" is tiny, and he does terribly in his first year at Hogwarts. Then he learns to compensate by drawing magic from around him, which most people don't do because they have reasonably sized cores. This makes Harry in tune with magic, but only powerful in very magical places like Hogwarts, Diagon Ally, etc. Everywhere else, he is barely more than a squib. This both handicaps and helps him while fighting Voldemort, and could be a great plot device in the hands of a skilled writer. (which I am not)
