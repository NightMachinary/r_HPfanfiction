It falls under the category of tropes that new and/or bad writers like to fall back on like a crutch. Each one on their own are indicitive of others likely being present, and in combination always result in a fic with a shitty plot.

It's like starting off the story with Sirius's will reading. You can automatically expect: a manipulative Dumbledore which is a horrible characterization, helpful goblins and infinite wealth which take away several points of hardship and potential character growth, and a shopping trip that is so horrifically procedural it makes you question your sanity.

It's just one of those things that have been absorbed into steaming pile of garbage ideas. If you play with those garbage ideas, it'll take a significant effort to clean and repurpose them or else your fic simply stinks.

Most of us are wary of getting involved in incomplete fics that even glance at those tropes because the vast majority of the time they either devolve into that sort of garbage procedural or get abandoned without presenting anything truly unique or interesting.
