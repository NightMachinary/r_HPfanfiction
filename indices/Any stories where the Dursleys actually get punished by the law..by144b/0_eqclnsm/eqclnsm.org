Bar Linkffn(Petrification Proliferation), other fics usually take the abuse to extreme levels before 'justice'. In canon, there was no physical abuse, though lot of emotional. Is there any fic with /canon compliant/ abuse and proper inquiry in it by police? Not by Dumbledore or Snape. Both obviously knew and Dumbledore thought better alive than happy. In canon Snape never showed concern for well being of non-slytherins, getting him sappy for Harry would be too off-character.
