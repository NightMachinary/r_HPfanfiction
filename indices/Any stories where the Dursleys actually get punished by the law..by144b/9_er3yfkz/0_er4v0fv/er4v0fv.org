  Harry is weird. Even for the Wizarding World. He can ''see'' the past, the future and your true heart. He makes it his law to never interfere directly or indirectly in the life of people, as all his ''prophecies'' or ''visions'' are self-fullfilling. This is his first year at Hogwarts and he can't help but ''see'' what a disaster it is going to be. With little to no choice, Harry has to protect Neville Longbottom, the Boy-who-lived, Gryffindor's Golden Boy and suicidal idiot from dying before the end of the year.It would be so much easier if he wasn't in Slytherin...
