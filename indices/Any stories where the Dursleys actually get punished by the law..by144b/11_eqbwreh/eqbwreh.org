For what? The absolute most that would happen is maybe Harry would be taken away by government. You're thinking fanon abuse. In canon, the worst they did to him was make him use the cupboard as a bedroom. Yeah, Petunia told him to "look after the bacon" in Philosopher's Stone, but my mom had me stirring food and keeping an eye on the stove from around that age as well.

Any physical abuse came from Dudley. You'll recall the scene in Philosopher's Stone where Dudley, Vernon, and Harry were all scrambling to get Harry's Hogwarts letter. Harry literally jumped on Vernon's back and was grabbing him by the neck. All Vernon did was send him to his room.

All the abuse from the Dursley family (apart from Dudley) came in the form of emotional abuse. They didn't treat him like a slave (other than locking him in the cupboard from time to time), they didn't smack him around for fun, and there's no evidence that he was even malnourished, other than his skinny appearance. Really, by the time he was 17, he was the exact same height as James Potter. The only time he ever complained about being starved was summer before 4th year when Petunia forced the whole family on a diet.

Harry was unloved. That's absolutely horrible, but not illegal. As far as I can see, the only illegal thing they did was lock him in his cupboard. And I that's not really jail worthy. Maybe a fine for safety reasons. They clothed him (regardless if the clothes fit well or not), they fed him, and they housed him. They did the minimum required of them as guardians, basically.
