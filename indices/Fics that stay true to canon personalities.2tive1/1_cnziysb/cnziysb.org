[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] does this, with the caveat that it's taking Harry at the end of CoS, introducing a significant divergence, and seeing how Harry and his friends develop from there. It has a lot of Original Flavor, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] does an excellent job at nailing canon personalities, though Harry himself is heavily influenced by Dumbledore's memories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard]] is a one-shot, but it just absolutely nails Original Flavor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] centers on an 11-year old Teddy Lupin and his friends, but Harry is a supporting character. The style and tone of this one nails canon so well that I believe if you gave the 7 Harry Potter books to someone who'd never heard of the series, plus Hogwarts Houses Divided, they wouldn't bat an eye when they got to "Book 8."
