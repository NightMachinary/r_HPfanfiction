[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1633060/coffeeonthepatio][coffeeonthepatio]] has a number of good stories. From the Corner (and extra one shots), Acquittal, and Be Little are three of my favorites from her. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8455295/1/An-Unwritten-Future][An Unwritten Future]] by Aurette is another that I enjoyed quite a bit. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490903/1/The-Princess-of-Gryffindor][The Princess of Gryffindor]] is another by Aurette that was a good read - and Victorious Voldy something I tend to avoid like the plague. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7454117/1/Just-to-Be][Just to Be]] is another great story, and one that I've not seen done before. I was very impressed with both the writing and the story line. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11333405/1/Useful-No-More][Useful No More]] by Kallanit is a longer one-shot... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788107/1/Another-Dream][Another Dream]] by Dragoon811 is one of my favorites.

Happy reading and I have more if you want them...
