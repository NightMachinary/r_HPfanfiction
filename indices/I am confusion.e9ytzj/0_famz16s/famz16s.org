Firstly, I think the vast majority of the people in the world already don't read fanfiction, so by definition, it would be Not Sheeple to read it.

Secondly, Sorry to break this to you but in the world of literature, there are No New Ideas. Everything has a trope. The entire meaning of a trope is that it's a figurative/metaphorical use of words, phrases, etc. Everything that anyone has ever written has certain archetypes and tropes. That doesn't mean everything is the same, just like no two wands are exactly the same no two pieces of literature are the same even if they have the same components/tropes.

Thirdly, Why waste your time caring about what other people read? If you like a story and you think it deserves more recognition then share it with your friends, share it as much as you want. That's the only way to get more people to notice it, not by shitting on what other people like.
