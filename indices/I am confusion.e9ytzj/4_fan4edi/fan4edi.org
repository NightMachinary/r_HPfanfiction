Nah, you're just pretentious. You're like *some* people who love prog rock or movies like 2001: A Space Odessey or Stalker and think that makes them better/ smarter than people who enjoy just rock or Star Wars. Even I was one of those people for a time. But now I can simply enjoy stuff without looking for some deeper meaning or life lessons. It's really great, you should try it. The fics with most favourites are *entertaining*. Not necessarily good or original, but *fun* to read.
