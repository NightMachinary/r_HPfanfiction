Sites will come, but it takes time, since I'm basically learning Python again on the fly while developing this. On top of that, I have a lot of IRL things going on.

I'll add it, but just a question - are there any subreddits that might benefit from the addition of FimFiction? If so, I'll also have to add them to the defaults list in the program.
