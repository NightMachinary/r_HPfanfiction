I would love this, but I don't find it to be my experience in reading the canon. In most Harry/Hermione fics (if desired, I can provide an exhaustive list) Ron becomes either a peripheral friend or an outright antagonist. Even my favorite writings sort of relegate him to an occasional friend. Very often, Neville or Luna take Ron's place. White Squirrel is probably one of the best and most dedicated HP fanfiction authors out here, and it's a little enlightening to see how little they engage Ron as a character.

I can't blame fic writers because Rowling did very little to inspire a love of Ron. And where the films gave Draco an edge, I think they took away from Ron. But Ron is the quintessential “middle sibling” (even though he's not quite the middle) and I would love to see some fics where Harry ends up with Hermione while Ron finds his own way.
