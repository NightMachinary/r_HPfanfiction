One of the reasons why we love jkr's writing is because how real her characters often feel. The same is to be said for Ron. Ron is a typical teen unsure of his own body and feelings. He is loyal, even if he struggled with it. he who had nothing shared everything with the boy he met on the train. He who left, wanted to return immediately. He who told Sirius that he had to kill him first. They were always three best friends but Harry loved Ron more than Hermione.
