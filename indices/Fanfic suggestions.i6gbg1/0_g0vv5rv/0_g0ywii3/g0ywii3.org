People really don't recommend Pureblood Pretense the right way. I put off reading it for two years because I thought it was going to be some slice-of-lifey fluff about fem!Harry dealing with living with boys. Absolutely not that. It's got some of the most intricate worldbuilding I've seen, period, delightful characters, politics actually done well, suspense every chapter...highly recommended.
