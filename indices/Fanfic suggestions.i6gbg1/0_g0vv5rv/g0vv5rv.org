Ah, Grow Young With Me is such an excellent example of a story that /really needs a better summary/...

The linkffn(Innocent) series has a summary that's not especially misleading, but is very insufficient to really describe it. The first book is half a million words, and the series is over a million and still actively updating. Sirius escapes from Azkaban early and raises Harry. No secret Black family magic, no Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-British, no character bashing, but lots of heartwarming scenes of Harry getting a parental figure and at least a few years of a childhood - albeit in sometimes stressful circumstances, as the country searches for the "kidnapped" Boy-Who-Lived, and their efforts to clean out Grimmauld Place put them on a collision course with the Locket and the dark magic protecting it. The following books are at Hogwarts, following some canon stations but with many events accelerated or otherwise altered.

And the summary for linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is reasonably accurate, but undersells it. Yes, it's a female Harry in a situation comparable to Alanna the Lioness, but the author has not simply blended the two stories. It's a whole new story of its own, with the identity swap being merely a jumping off point, and it keeps revealing more and more depth as it continues. The main character is powerful and skilled enough to make for interesting times, but that power always comes with a price; high magic reserves make for poor control, drawing attention puts pressure on the pretense, and gaining influence means that more powerful people will try in turn to influence you. It's been a few months since the last update, but I think that's mostly because the author writes /mammoth/ chapters, 20-30k words or sometimes even more.
