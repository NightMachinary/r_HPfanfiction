Fortunately, there are indeed some gems out there, and a variety of them. Pick what floats your boat.

*Stygian Trilogy* by Slide. Adventure next-gen trilogy with a dash of romance. Lots of globetrotting and historical nods in the second and third books. Long (700,000 words).

*Alexandra Quick* by Inverarity. Debatably a fanfic. No canon characters. Brash Americana. A bildungsroman of a precocious, annoying, impulsive teenager. Five books complete (~1,300,000 words), sixth in progress.

*Forging the Sword* by Myst Shadow. Minimalist mastery. Everything stems from a single divergence. A better-than-canon interpretation of Ron Weasley. Incomplete (170,000 words) but worth reading.

*The Accidental Animagus* by White Squirrel. A soap opera with terrifying villains. A sibling relationship between Harry and Hermione. A cat animagus Harry. Complete through four years, fifth year in progress (600,000 words)

*Victoria Potter* by Taure. Polished. Precise. Compact. Creative. An intricately slightly AU retelling of canon, with the divergence that Harry is a girl. Second year in progress (180,000 words)

*The Pureblood Pretense* by murkybluematter. As someone else said, avoid the summary. This series has it all. Mystery, magic, duels, politics, pranks. Cap it off with great writing and execution. Complete through three years, fourth year in progress (a stunning 1,300,000 words).

There are of course more, but I'll leave you with these...linkffn(Ignite by Slide; Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle; Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow, The Accidental Animagus, Victoria Potter, The Pureblood Pretense)
