Appropriated First Nations culture, just to be clear, to adapt real world legends into the greater canon on Pottermore, right? It's all part of making it seem like the stories we hear are the leftover hearsay after the statute of secrecy, right?? The same has been done with Vodun, animism, mysticism of all sorts of types - /especially/ in fanfic, and people usually love it. You can think it insensitive, but calling her a shitty person for it is over the top. And let's face it, she was in a difficult position if she wanted to expand her lore to North America: either ignore First Nations culture, and get bashed for it, or include it, and get bashed for it. Please explain how you would have been inclusivist in your approach and how it would have been much better than what she did.

Knowing that nobody is a saint or perfect, how do you think this balances out with her objectively paying for the closing of orphanages and other institutions, taking thousands upon thousands of children out of hellhole environments to grow up in and placing them with host families? Is that something someone shitty would do? She has transformed their lives for the better.

Not only that, but she's paid for the advocates and lawyers who make sure that the practice of institutionalisation of children - something that has been researched as being undeniably bad for their development and can cause serious harm in the furure - is being combatted not only through charitable work, but legally. I work in this domain in Romania and I could not call the work Lumos does as shitty. They've had a tremendous impact, and have one of the most noble and important goals in child protection. It's insanely important stuff. And yes, I know she doesn't pay for all of it and people donate like they would to anything else.

I can'T argue with the Tony Blair bit, he's a piece of shit.
