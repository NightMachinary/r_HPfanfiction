Arguably Blair had a lot of successful policies (education reforms for one) that were drowned out by the absolute shitshow he unleashed in the Middle East. Being a political centrist doesn't make a person complete garbage, although I'm surprised Rowling isn't a Lib Dem in that case. There's a lot of irrational paranoia with regards to Corbyn, but the political opinions of a writer (unless expressed in the story they write) shouldn't affect your ability to enjoy their writing.
