The backlash against JK Rowling is ridiculous. Just because Dumbledore isn't explicitly gay in the next film (she even said it would be addressed in a later film) she's the devil and her life is garbage. No one thinks 'Hey, maybe Dumbledore is too busy with this whole World War thing that's brewing and stopping a dark wizard who is trying to take over the world to pursue a relationship with anyone right now'.

Edit: Now that I think about it, working at a boarding school would make it very difficult to date anyone no matter what your orientation. You're always on even after hours. I'd go mad.
