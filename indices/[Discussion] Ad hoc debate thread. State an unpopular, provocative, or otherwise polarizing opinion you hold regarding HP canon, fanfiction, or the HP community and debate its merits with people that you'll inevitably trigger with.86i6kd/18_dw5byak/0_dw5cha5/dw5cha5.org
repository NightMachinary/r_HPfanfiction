Thank you for adding paragraph breaks. My god that wall of text was bad.

- @ Ginny: I agree she could have used a major dose of character development. I think spiteful and mean is a bit of an overstatement. You say shoehorned, but Rowling always intended for her to end up with Harry because of an experience she (Rowling) had in her youth. Just saying.

- @ Fanon bullshit (wards, cores, bonds, etc): I don't think this is too controversial. You'll get a lot of head-nods at this.

- @ Dumbledore isn't manipulative: I think there's a very good argument against this, but as it's not a particular passion of mine, I'll let somebody else handle this one.
