I think Fleur wasn't insulting it so much as saying she wanted some French food, and the traditional English food was too rich and heavy because of how much it diverges from what she's used to. In GOF, she is away from home, and she is perfectly within her rights to want her own food/cuisine rather than something she doesn't like. In HPB onwards, she's away from her family, her culture, and in the midst of her fiancee's family, none of whom are doing anything to make her feel welcomed or at home. They call her Phlegm, and are generally resentful and distrustful. She fell in love with an English wizard and is choosing to stay in Britain, to get to know his family, to be part of his life, to let him continue to live in his home country--giving up all of this, in the face of the distrust and disgust many feel towards "half-breeds" and Veela, and yet they are so unkind to her. Ginny is especially awful, and for no good reason.
