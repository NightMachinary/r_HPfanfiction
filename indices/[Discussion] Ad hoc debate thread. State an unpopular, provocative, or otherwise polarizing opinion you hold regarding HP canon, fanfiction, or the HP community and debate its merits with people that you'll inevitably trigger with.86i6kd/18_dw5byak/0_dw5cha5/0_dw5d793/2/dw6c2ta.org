That's an exaggeration. I mean, it was Fleur who was being vain, condescending, and rude, and this even in /Goblet of Fire/, before we see Ginny act negatively towards Fleur. Hermione saw the same thing (apart from her jealousy with regard to Ron's reactions). No wonder Ginny doesn't like her and feels that Fleur treats her like a three year-old.
