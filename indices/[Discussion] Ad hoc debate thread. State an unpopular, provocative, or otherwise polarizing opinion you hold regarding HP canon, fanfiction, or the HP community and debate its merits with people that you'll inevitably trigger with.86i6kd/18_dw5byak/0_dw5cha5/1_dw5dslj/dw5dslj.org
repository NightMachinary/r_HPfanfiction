Sorry about the wall of text, I'm on mobile, usually am honestly, and it doesn't look the same but I try.

As for Ginny, I think I've read the books upwards of 10 times, on the /very/ conservative side. This opinion is in no way based on Bonnie Wright or the movie portrayal. I blame neither of those things. I mention that because I want my opinion clear, I do not like the character, books/movies/parallel dimensions, whatever. I do recognize that Rowling intended this pairing from the start, and I'm sure her intentions were good, the same as her Hermione/Ron intentions were. However, even she admits that that particular pairing was based on a personal ending. I'm sure Harry/Ginny was as well. I say shoe-horned because Harry was an ‘honorable Weasley' until he married Ginny. Then he was an ‘actual Weasley' and I think JKR, along with a lot of fans, wanted that. That's not necessarily wrong, I just disagree. I may be overstating it with “spiteful and mean” but I don't recall Harry saying that Bellatrix was a ‘former beauty' while she was torturing Hermione. Even though it would be correct. When Ginny was terrible or frightening, she might as well have been a kitten smacking a Great Dane for all the consequences she suffered. She was almost always peripherally rewarded or commended for being mean. Additionally, even people that should hate her still talk about how pretty she is like she's some sort of siren or goddess. It's unrealistic and makes me want to gag.
