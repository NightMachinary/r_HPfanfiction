How many hexes did she actually throw at people who annoyed her? Does she snap all the time? You're correct about her comment towards Luna but she does change and defends her a year later. I think Ginny shows some of the greatest growth of any character, though unfortunately it's mostly off-page.

I firmly disagree with this notion that she never gets over her fan girl phase. First, a lot of her crush is actually more about Harry himself than the boy-who-lived stuff. She is excited to meet him, as is practically everybody in the wizarding world. But after she saves his life, her crush is more about Harry himself. But she absolutely grows out of that. In Goblet of Fire, when Ron and Harry are laughing about Neville (I think), it's Ginny who chides them both. She gives Harry the business in OOTP and frequently talks to him as a friend throughout the series from GoF on. She dates other boys to move on and not keep pining after him. I don't see how from at least Year 3 on, she tries to win him over. Please provide examples of that. Yes, she always liked him (and why not?). But a fangirl would not act like Ginny does. And remind me where she enjoys his fame in the book. Even in book 2 she seems to understand he doesn't want any fame and tries to protect him.

I agree it probably would've been better if Ginny was maybe given detention once in a while for some of her stunts, but I think that's a relatively minor issue. It doesn't bother me whether she gets punished for her flaws if the reader clearly sees them as such.

Finally, I think we simply have a different interpretation of the fight with Hermione. I think Ginny when she is defending herself or someone she loves can get vicious, as we see here. But remember the context. Harry is feeling awful and Hermione is just making it worse, since she needs Harry to know that she was right all along. Of course Hermione cares about Harry, but in this moment, it really doesn't seem that she is trying to be supportive. Ginny correctly assesses the situation and sees that Harry doesn't need a nag; he feels bad enough on his own. He needs someone to have his back, which Hermione arguably has not done that year. So she sticks up for Harry, perhaps going a bit over the line in doing so. This scene says a lot about Ginny, both good and bad. Most importantly, it shows her understanding of Harry and why she is a good match for him.
