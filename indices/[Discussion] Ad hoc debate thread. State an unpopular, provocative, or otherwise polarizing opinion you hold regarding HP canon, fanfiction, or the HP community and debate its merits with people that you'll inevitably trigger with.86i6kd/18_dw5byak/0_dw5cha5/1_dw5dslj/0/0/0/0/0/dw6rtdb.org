True, and again everything Ginny does is from Harry's POV. Harry, who likes Ginny and thus would not view her actions in a negatively light.

I mean, I do understand the perception that Rowling just turned her into this perfect character for Harry. She didn't /need/ to include the scene where even the Slytherins talk about how pretty she is. She did enough to suggest Ginny was pretty as it. So I get that. And she's awesome at Quidditch and really funny etc etc. And this all sort of happens in the 6th book. But people do forgot that Rowling does show Ginny negatively in the books too. So it's odd to hear people complain about Ginny being awful one second and then going on about how she's made to be perfect the next. I personally feel that if the reader can easily identify flaws in a character, just because she isn't called out on those flaws doesn't mean they don't exist or she's a Mary Sue.
