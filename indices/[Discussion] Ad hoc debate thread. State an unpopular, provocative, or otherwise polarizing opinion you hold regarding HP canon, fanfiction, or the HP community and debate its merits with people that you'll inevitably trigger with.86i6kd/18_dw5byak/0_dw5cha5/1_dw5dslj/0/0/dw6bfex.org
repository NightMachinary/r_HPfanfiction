I disagree. I don't think I'm overstating how mean she is. Ginny is the first person in the series to make fun of Luna, she often hexes people who annoy her, she snaps at people all of the time, at one point I think she tells Hermione â€˜don't act like you care about quidditch, you'll embarrass yourself.' That's incredibly mean, Hermione is Harry's best friend, she cares about him and that's why she's worried about him with the potions book. When Ginny behaves in these horrible ways her character is admired or rewarded instead of admonished or recognized as out of line. There is no retribution for her bad behavior.

She is more than jealous and immature, she is small and loves Harry Potter the idea more than the man. The only reason she stops acting like a fan girl with Harry is because Hermione tells her to. She spends her entire teen years trying to win him over, which is more fan girl behavior. This speaks to her inability to truly understand him as you describe. If she truly understood him she wouldn't appear to enjoy his fame so much.

She does have great moments, and they're uncomfortable and put in in an attempt to force the audience to like her. The same way every death eater, Slytherin, student at hogwarts, etc, is meant to suddenly think she's this unstoppably beautiful goddess, who can play quidditch, throw every hex perfectly, laugh with the boys, etc, etc, etc. I think Harry deserves a real character. I don't see Ginny as real, she's a bully on her worst day and a Mary Sue on her best. I'm glad people do like her though and I understand your feelings, I just find her frustrating and shallow.
