I think you are overstating how mean she is, as you are ignoring all the times she is kind. I agree that she can be mean and a bit of a bully, but I think this makes her a flawed and well-rounded character. Ginny is shown to be jealous at times and immature. Fairly typical behavior for a teenage girl. While you might be right that she doesn't pay for her flaws, its different than saying we aren't supposed to see them as flaws. I mean, when Ginny gets jealous of Cho, I'm pretty sure the reader is supposed to view her as a bit jealous and petty.

But Ginny also has a lot of great moments, like her bravery in fighting, comforting that girl as Harry walks past her, and being loyal to Harry when he needs it and putting him in his place when he needs that.

Also, while I'm not necessarily excusing all her actions (well maybe I am), most of her mean moments are a reaction to something. Fleur treats Ginny like a little girl, which is Ginny's biggest pet peeve. So of course she won't like her. Zacharias Smith is shown in canon to be an ass, so is it really surprising that maybe he pestered Ginny for info in an insulting way before she hexed him? And while she went over the line with Ron after he caught her kissing Dean, he did imply she was being a slut.

Finally, despite how one might feel about Ginny, she absolutely works well with Harry. They share interests, a sense of humor (very big point), a noble streak, and a shared dark experience. Ginny can reach Harry like no other character and she represents a life after the war. And so what if he has a firmer connection to the Weasleys through her. Getting along with your in laws is an important reason why a couple work well.

I think perhaps Rowling did go a bit overboard in making Ginny too perfect for Harry (she was sort of the "Cool Girl" trope). But I think Ginny gets a bad wrap as a character and as Harry's love interest.
