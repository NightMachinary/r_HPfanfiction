First of all, I love the way you worded this, I actually laughed. Well done. I will also try to do my very best answering you.

HP Canon: Ginny Weasley is a garbage character. She's spiteful, mean, bad-tempered, and boring. Harry should never have ended up with her. Her most outstanding trait is a hex that is not even clearly defined, and her beauty. Her bad behavior and rudeness is never called out or reprimanded and she was shoe-horned in as a love interest. There's no believable relationship development between her and Harry, and there's no believability behind Harry falling for the “sporty, pretty girl.” Harry notably doesn't enjoy the attention he receives. Ginny is awful.

HP Fan Fiction: I wish I could say there was only one thing. I'll start with, FFS Snape is not Draco's godfather. Jesus, where does this BS come from? Even if Snape and Lucius were close in the series, which they aren't, it would've come long after Draco's birth. They barely attended Hogwarts together, being so far apart in years, and they were not born in the same socioeconomic ‘class.' Their only real “relationship” is through Voldemort, and the fact that Snape teaches Draco. Additionally “wards, “wolf mates,” “magical cores/signatures,” “soul bonds,” and “floo openings,” are not things. Hogwarts has /enchantments/ that project it. Those enchantments are not /keyed/ to people, they're just enchantments. JKR compares being a werewolf to being afflicted with HIV/AIDS, pretty sure that doesn't come with a soulmate or ‘bond.' Mr. Weasley mentions that he connected the Dursley's home to the floo network for the afternoon, not that he keyed it to a Weasley specific /signature./ Presumably, for that time, anyone who chose to floo there and knew the location would be capable. Like connecting a phone line, if you know the number, you can call. Magic cores are from something I've obviously never read/watched/played because Harry gets injured constantly and his “magical core” doesn't deplete like a fucking energy bar. /gagging motion/

HP Community: Dumbledore is not a manipulative bastard. Dumbledore is a man who can see the bigger picture, he's a man who has made mistakes and carries crippling guilt over it. He's a man trying to atone for his sins. He knew Harry wouldn't die if he let Voldemort kill him. He did play chess pieces, and he did use people, but (aside from Harry, arguably) he did not knowingly lead anyone to their death. He loved and trusted Harry and he gave him the only information he had. His time was short, and he made certain things the priority. Harry is not being fair by being upset he didn't know about Dumbledore's past. Obviously, it was tragic and Dumbledore could barely face it himself, it's unfair to expect him to share it with a child, even one he cares for. It's unfair to judge Harry for his anger either, IMO, Harry is a teenager, of course he's upset. He named his son Albus, because, again my opinion, he grows and changes and understands that there are certain things you don't want to share (because of shame, or whatever), that kids aren't ready for.

Also, for the Snape haters, I disagree with you too. Lol. This comment is long enough though.

As a side note: I adore this post and I am really hoping everyone on this sub answers, please answer. There are tons of fanfic authors and readers on here and your opinions are valid and helpful, please give them!

Edit: boy. I didn't realize I needed to get so much shit off my chest lmao. Thanks.
