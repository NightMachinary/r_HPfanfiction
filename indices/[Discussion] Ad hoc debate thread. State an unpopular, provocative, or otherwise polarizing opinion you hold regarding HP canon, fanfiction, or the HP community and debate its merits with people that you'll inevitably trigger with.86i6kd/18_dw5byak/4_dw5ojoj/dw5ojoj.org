I prefer the word wards. It looks better, and using the word specifically opens up the possibility that they consist of more than just waving a wand.

The floo signatures thing is just common sense, and it's not directly contradicted by canon. Weasleys had to connect the Dursleys because they weren't on the Floo Network, security is a completely different thing.

Magical cores I agree on, but I've see magical signatures used pretty well in some stories for Auror investigations and shit, so I don't dump that.
