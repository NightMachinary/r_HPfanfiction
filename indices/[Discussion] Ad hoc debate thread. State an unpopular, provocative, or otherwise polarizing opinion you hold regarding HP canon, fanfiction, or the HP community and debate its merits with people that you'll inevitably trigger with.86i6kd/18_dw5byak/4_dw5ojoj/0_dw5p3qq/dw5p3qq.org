I disagree. “Wards” doesn't look better, it's lazy. It /looks/ like an easy way to invent your own magic instead of writing based on the source material, which is the entire idea behind fan fiction.

I think turning werewolves, house elves, etc, into essentially animals ‘for the sake of porn' is gross, they have a name for it actually, beastiality. I think turning an affliction, whether you relate it to AIDS or not, into a fetish, is gross. Also, if that doesn't bother you, it's in direct conflict with the source material, so write fan fiction for different sources if you can't respect the universe.

‘Floo signatures' is just nonsense, if for no other reason than it invites ‘magical signatures.' The floo network exists and can be used, or doesn't and can't. Again, respect the source material or find new source material and write for that.
