Okay. This doesn't make a lot of sense. Either way, I'm actually done responding on this particular thread. I've more than defended/explained my opinions. You're welcome to disagree and I'm sorry if I've offended or upset you. They're just opinions. You don't have to like them but if you require further explanation you can read my other comments. Best of luck.
