Again, I just prefer the word. If you want to get pedantic, Hogwarts can have "enchantments" against specific things without ruling our the presence of wards.

Most of the "mate" porn I've seen has the wolf having its own kind of intelligence, thus making it more about the physicality than "turning an affliction into a fetish." Bestiality... sure, whatever. It's hot.

Why the fuck would you want anyone to be able to just barge in through your floo if they happen to know your address? Give these wizards some privacy! In my mind there are probably some places (like the Leaky Cauldron) that have public floos, while most private homes have a method (whether magical/Floo signature, a password, etc) that ensures that they won't just have random people able to walk in. Not nonsense, common sense.
