Tropes and Cliches exists for a reason. They work. How they work is up to individual authors. Where one author just checks boxes another subvert them or overt them to make them different from the mold. As most fanfiction authors are rookies, do it between original projects or heavy workloads they won't always spend 10 hours to work out how their interpretation of something will work.

In fact for my original project I've spent a total of 10 hours working out how the magic will work right now. I expect once I've wrapped out the first draft I'll spend 10x that before I reach the time to draft out the 2nd book. Mostly because magic will be a non entity in the first book, remnants of it will be seen but nothing real will be done with it in that book.
