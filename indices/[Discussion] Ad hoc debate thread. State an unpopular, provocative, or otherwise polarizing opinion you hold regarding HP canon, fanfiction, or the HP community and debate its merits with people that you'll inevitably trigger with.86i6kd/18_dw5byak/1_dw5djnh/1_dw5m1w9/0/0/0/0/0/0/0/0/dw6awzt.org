Wards is just a word. Is it really that lazy if you use a single sentence to say that house is now protected, instead of using a paragraph to list all the spells that protect it. Wards is simply a word used to avoid long and tedious lists.

Personally the only usage of wards i hate are the ones that are treated as Rune-Javascript Star Trek shields, since that goes against the actual concept on 'wards' that Rowling used. (Saying wards is also easier than saying protective charms, jinxes and curses)
