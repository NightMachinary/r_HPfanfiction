"Wards" is a common fantasy term for "permanent magical protections", predating Harry Potter by decades. And that you should be able to protect your home in a way that lets you and your family/visitors enter without letting others in is pretty much self-evident, or people would steal from other wizard homes all the time. If you can't restrict your floo connection, things would fall apart unless you're fond of the stupid "no one ever thought of abusing that" trope.

Dumbledore isn't a tragic character. He's a plot device who acts and remains inactive in the exact way the plot needs him to so Harry can be the hero and the book's plot will be resolved at the end of the school year, and not before. Like every other adult, he is useless for the most parts of the early books so kids can have important adventures.
