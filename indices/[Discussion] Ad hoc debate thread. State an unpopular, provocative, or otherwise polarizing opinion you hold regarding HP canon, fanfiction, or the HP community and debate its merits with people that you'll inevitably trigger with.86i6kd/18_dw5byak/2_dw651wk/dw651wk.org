I mostly agree (especially on Ginny, what a garbage character), but a few things.

The likely origin of the godfather Snape thing is Narcissa asking Snape to Vow to protect Draco in HBP.

Also, I get the hate for magical cores and soul bonds, but what's wrong with wards? Wards are, in many fantasy series, simply protective enchantments.

Also, Dumbledore is manipulative in canon. He alone decided the life Harry would live up until and even after he entered Hogwarts, knowing beforehand (as per HBP) that he was condemning him to "ten dark years". He conveniently gave Harry the invisibility cloak, telling him to "make good use of it" and later said that he didn't care if scores of other people died so long as he kept Harry alive (though, apparently, "being alive" was as far as he was willing to manipulate Harry's circumstances). Now, we can debate the relative justification for those actions (and no, I don't think they were ill intentioned), but there is no argument supporting the idea that it wasn't a huge case of manipulation.
