How is the idea of wards lazy? Nearly all the time it's simply a term used to refer to what canon calls "protective enchantments", persistent defensive spells applied over a location. It's just easier to write, so I don't see any laziness, calling them wards doesn't even explain anything about them.

What I mean about Dumbledore is that he did literally the bare minimum where Harry's housing and well-being were concerned, and knew beforehand that he'd be in a dark place for more than a decade. And there was at least one other option, one that Dumbledore suggested before so we can't say the idea was unreasonable: Have someone cast Fidelius and make Dumbledore the secret keeper. The Fidelius didn't fail, they just picked someone untrustworthy.

This is more a commentary on where I think the story logic broke down. We start off with Harry being in an abusive home, placed there at Dumbledore's discretion. So later explanations couldn't do much more than say "Well you survived right?", which makes it pretty much impossible to put Dumbledore in a good light. It's not like he couldn't have checked in from time to time (2 flavors of Apparition or Portkeys). And since we aren't told of any threats getting stopped by the bond of blood magic before Hogwarts (Voldemort mentions he wouldn't be able to breach it in GoF), it's hard to completely accept that there was literaly no other option. Oh well.
