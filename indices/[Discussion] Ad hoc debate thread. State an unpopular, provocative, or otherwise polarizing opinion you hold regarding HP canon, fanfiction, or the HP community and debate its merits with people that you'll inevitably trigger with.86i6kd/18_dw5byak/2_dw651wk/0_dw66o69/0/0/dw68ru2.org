The idea of wards is lazy because it doesn't explain the enchantment and the vast majority of the time in FF it is used for something like ‘only Ron and Hermione can apparate into my house because wards!' No. A location can have a fidelius charm, it can have an anti-disapparition jinx, it can have a muggle-repelling charm, it doesn't just have ‘wards,' in whatever vague, never-to-be-defined way the author wants to lazily throw on it.

In Dumbledore's letter to the Dursley's he asks them to raise him as their own and that's what he expected them to do. You're right that when he realizes they aren't, he could've found another way to protect him. Up until the point that Dumbledore takes Harry to the Dursley's, his blood connection to Lily's family had been the /only/ thing to successfully keep Harry safe, it's not unreasonable for Dumbledore to want to exploit that for Harry's safety. He also tells McGonagall that he's better off in the muggle world, the Dursley's are conveniently muggles. Leaving him with the Dursley's was a mistake, but I don't think one mistake makes him an ass. I think with or without Dumbledore's choices, Harry's life was never going to be easy and you can't lay all of the blame for that at Dumbledore's feet. Like I said, that sentence was final when he survived the first killing curse. The best that anyone can arguably do for Harry is keep him alive. He was always going to be hunted and suffer attempts on his life. Dumbledore definitely could've done more, but his failure doesn't mean he doesn't care about Harry or that he sees Harry as a disposable tool for his cause the way a lot of the fandom likes to paint him. It just makes him flawed, like al good characters.
