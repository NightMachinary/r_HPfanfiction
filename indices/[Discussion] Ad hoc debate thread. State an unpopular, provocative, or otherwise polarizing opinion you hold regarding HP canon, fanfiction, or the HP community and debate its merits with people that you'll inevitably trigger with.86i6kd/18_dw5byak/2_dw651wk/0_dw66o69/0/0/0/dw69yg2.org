  , it doesn't just have â€˜wards,' in whatever vague, never-to-be-defined way the author wants to lazily throw on it.

This is what confuses me. Maybe I'm reading the wrong storiew, but I never see the notion that there's just this "ward" thing, but that there are wards, specific spells cast to stop the things you mentioned. Anti-Apparition wards, for instance. It's literally, usually, just a renaming of canon's "protective enchantments", which could easily be deemed vague under your criticism.

  In Dumbledore's letter to the Dursley's he asks them to raise him as their own and that's what he expected them to do
#+end_quote

Come on, that's extremely silly. "Hey.people whose moral character I know nothing about. Take him and treat him good". But it's actually worse than that since in HBP he said he knew the Dursleys weren't good beforehand (hence the knowing he would have "ten dark years" comment). That's a pretty massive mistake, or rather purposeful action. It's much worse than being an ass, in nearly any court in the developed world that would probably make one an accessory to child abuse, or at the very least make most people disgusted at that person. My issue really comes to a head when we realize Dumbledore can teleport there (even disguised or invisible if needed) to check up on him occasionally. He picked nearly the worst possible option. A child with some arrogance is preferable to one getting abused for over a decade, I would think. (This is a bit off topic now i suppose, as I already said I thought Dumbledore wasn't ill intentioned, even if he was knowingly negligent).
