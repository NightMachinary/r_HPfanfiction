Well, I guess I just read different stories. The example you gave doesn't seem bad. All it is, is an anti-Apparition jinx that has a few exceptions to who it blocks. This could have been canon, as JKR said that in hindsight, she should have made it so that the headmaster could Apparate in and out of Hogwarts. I don't see how this is anything but renaming protective enchantments. Even Fidelius allows those with the secret in (including Apparition) while blocking all others.

That's untrue. The Fidelius /did/ keep Harry safe. The charm didn't fail, and according to Hagrid and Dumbledore even Voldemort couldn't breach it. The charm didn't fail, they unwittingly picked a death eater.
