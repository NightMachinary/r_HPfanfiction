You're right about why people like Snape as Draco's godfather. There is just nothing to support that belief and it gets so old.

Wards are not a thing in Harry Potter. Wherever else they exist and whatever they are within those universes, they can stay there. I find them to be a lazy way for the author to just explain anything away. In the established universe, enchantments must be explained, anti-disapparition jinx, fidelis charm, anti-muggle charm, saying they're â€˜wards' is a lazy way to make them do whatever you want without explanation.

You're right, I should've phrased that better. I should say, despite his manipulations, I don't think Dumbledore is an uncaring asshole. He may manipulate events but it's not his fault the prophecy was overheard. Harry's sentence was final on the day he received his scar, it's down to Dumbledore's manipulations that he's alive at all. And I do think he cares about Harry, whether or not he uses him doesn't mean he didn't love him.
