My headcanon is that magic is a skill like any other, some people are just naturally more talented then others. However, wizards still need to go to school to perform it, so hard work and intelligence can make up for a lack of natural talent.

Overall, I think magic is a function of technical wand skill and understanding. Great wizards such as Dumbledore and Voldemort are very intelligent and have a great magical intuition - a deeper understanding of magic- which allows them to perform powerful magic.

Magical cores are a lazy way out and it makes magical power feel unearned. If Harry has a magical core of over 9000 and is naturally able to stomp everyone that's boring and lazy.
