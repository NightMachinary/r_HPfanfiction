I like to think of the core/power vs skill debate in terms of wood and gunpowder. Wood has far more energy per pound than gunpowder does, but gunpowder can explosively release all its energy at once. Big Core = wood = massive reserve of energy. High skill = gunpowder = explosive and controlled release of energy.

Cores would thus be a function of biology (or whatever counts as biology in regards to magic) and/or endurance training, while actual potency - skill - is a function of one's magical education. They're not mutually exclusive.

And even the most arbitrary magical systems can always be quantified. Assuming you have people even the slightest bit curious about it, it inevitably will be quantified, at least in relative terms (i.e. "I can cast that fire spell for twice as long as you before exhaustion. I probably have twice the magical stamina.").
