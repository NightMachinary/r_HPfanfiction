It's clear in canon that there is some kind of quantifiable power scale (Voldemort even set up that Boat enchantment in HBP to move only when some with a large magical power was onboard (Dumbledore refers to it as looking at the "amount" of magical power), but I don't think fanfics need to give explicit numbers. Just say X's magic power is higher than Y's and be done with it.
