If you dislike the concept of a magical core, how do you prefer authors quantify the obviously different power levels between witches and wizards. If magic was some arbitrary thing that everyone could use equally and didn't deplete, then dealing with dark wizards who are leagues more powerful than everyone else wouldn't be an issue.

I've tossed around the idea of magic being a force that doesn't reside within the bodies of the wizard but in the environment, with the limiter being the witch or wizard's efficiency at channeling such an energy. Manipulating too much of this ambient energy for ones skill level would obviously exhaust you, but it honestly seems like the same principle with a different skin slapped over it.

Is your problem with trying to explain magic in general or the concept of a 'magical core' not making sense?
