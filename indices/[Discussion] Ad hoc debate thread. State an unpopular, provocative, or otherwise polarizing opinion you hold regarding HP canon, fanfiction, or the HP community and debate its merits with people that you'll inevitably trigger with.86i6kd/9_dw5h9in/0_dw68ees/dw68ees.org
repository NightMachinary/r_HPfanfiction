I agree so much with this. I don't like the black comedy for that exact reason even though it's one of the the most recommended fics on here. All it seems to be is a bunch of sex jokes and juvenile humour which I hate. Harry is also portrayed as an annoying asshole who I have no desire to read about.

I do love humour in stories though, it's just that the type of humour that I do like is rarely found in fics that people consider comedy. Thankfully there are some amazing hilarious fics out there that do manage to keep everyone in character and not rely on sex humour to be funny.
