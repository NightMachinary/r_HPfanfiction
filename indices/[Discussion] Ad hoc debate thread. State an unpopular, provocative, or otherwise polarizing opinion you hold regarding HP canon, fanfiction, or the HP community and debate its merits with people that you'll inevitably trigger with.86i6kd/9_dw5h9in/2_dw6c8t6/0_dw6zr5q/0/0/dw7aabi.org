True, but I feel like it's different stereotypes. US media seems to reach for e.g. casually sexist stuff in a way that comedy where I'm used to doesn't. It just feels very trashy and old hat. Comedy that crosses a line, where, in the UK, the /crossing the line/ in and of itself would be the source of the humour, e.g. Frankie Boyle style. Like, the person crossing the line is shocking and a source of humour, but in the US, the comedian is encouraging you all to cross the line with them, that the line shouldn't even be there because it's silly, or something.

Not to say that the UK (for example) /isn't/ at all sexist, but it wouldn't be so blatantly brought up or used as a source of joke material in the way some US created-material will just go in with "haha it's funny because she's a woman so she must be stupid/useless/a whore" etc. I just can't imagine a joke like that flying on modern British TV, for example.
