  Is it uncommon for humor to be juvenile and/or poke at stereotypes? I don't see any problems with this. Who cares as long as it's funny?

Actually this brings up another issue, so it's interesting to raise it. It's /not/ that uncommon... in the US. It's pretty much incredibly uncommon outside of media and stories aimed exclusively at very young kids in the UK, where HP comes from and is set. So as a British person myself it's a really unfamiliar element that completely breaks my suspension of disbelief.

But I can completely understand to US readers it seeming just like another element that canon was oddly missing for some reason. It's just another way our cultures vary and some things don't translate, and we each don't realise because we assume certain things are universal.

For example the vast majority of US standup comedians' acts and personas are actively offputting to many in the UK, and it might well be the case vice versa as well.
