The trace is in the underage witch/wizard, not the wand. This is also supported by canon (books 2,3,6,7).

(Riddle used Morfin's wand so that Morfin, a known muggle-hater, would have had the smoking gun to go with his confession. Riddle Jr didn't even live in Little Hangleton, so the trace could have been triggered by anyone. His last name, however, would have brought him onto the list of suspects, and the aurors would definitely have used priori incantado on his wand.)
