There is also the possiblity that Trace doesn't work properly with the killing curse. I mean, that doesn't sound like something they'd be able to test. Also, it is entirely possible that the detection of the charm used is a recent-ish advancement (a lot could have happened between 1943 and 1992).

The RIddle case tend to be used as /the/ proof for the Trace Charm on the Wand theory.
