Sure it's slavery, but Rowling does a pretty good job of showing how fucked up it is in Chamber of Secrets, and she allows Hermione to explain all the good reasons why it is indeed slavery and why it's wrong.

Who cares if there's some humor associated with it? Are you not allowed to joke about slavery because it's wrong?
