So because only one person opposed house elf slavery that somehow means Rowling espouses slavery in some way?

Sorry, but that just doesn't follow. Rowling goes out of her way to both show and explicitly explain (through Hermione) why it's slavery and why it's wrong.

It's not like somebody one day just realized "oh crap house elves are slaves!" No, it's spelled out for the reader in the texts.
