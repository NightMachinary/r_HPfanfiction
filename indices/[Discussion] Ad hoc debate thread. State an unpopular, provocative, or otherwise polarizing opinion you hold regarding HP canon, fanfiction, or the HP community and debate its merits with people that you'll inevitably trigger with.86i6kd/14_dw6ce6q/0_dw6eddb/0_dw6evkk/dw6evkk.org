I would say that the narrative position, given through Harrys POV, is one of comedy and humoring Hermione until she moved on to a new topic of conversation. The default position is to think she's expressing herself in that kinda cringy phase of that first teenage political activism when the wizarding world has thoroughly internalized the justification for sentient bondage.
