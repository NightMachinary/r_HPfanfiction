Complete:

- Linkffn(Getting Too Old For This by ManMadeOfLasers) <- An utterly fun and amusing roflstomp. The best complete ME crossover

- Linkffn(Ascension by Ulstem) <- Well written and enjoyable, but nothing much really happens IIRC.

Incomplete:

- Linkffn(Lost Magic: First Contact by MightyFish) <- My favorite ME crossover. One of my favorite fics period.

- Linkffn(Beyond the Veil by NaniteSystems) <- This one is okay. Not my favorite but definitely readable.
