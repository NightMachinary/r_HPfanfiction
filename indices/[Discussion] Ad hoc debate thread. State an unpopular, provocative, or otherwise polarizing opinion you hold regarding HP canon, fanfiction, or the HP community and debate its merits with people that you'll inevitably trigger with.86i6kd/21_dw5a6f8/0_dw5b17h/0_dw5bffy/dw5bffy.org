The author commits almost every novice writing mistake its possible to make. I'm not saying that mjimeyg didn't make great strides in becoming a better writer. Nor am I saying that completing 280k word piece isn't a great accomplishment. I'm not even saying that fic isn't an enjoyable read.

I'm saying that it's bad.

The story is absolutely littered with grammatical mistakes and/or typos. The author doesn't even attempt to make anything resembling consistency with either HP, ME, or reality as we know it.

The characters are puppets on strings that have no autonomy or motives, just fulfilling whatever role the author needs at the moment to accomplish whatever is necessary to show how cool and geth-like Harry is.

I managed to push through 20+ chapters of this because it's an original, unique idea, and because Mass Effect and HP are my favorite fandoms, but it was a slog the whole way. There are plenty of other Mass Effect crossovers that are better, so I can't understand why this one gets such praise.
