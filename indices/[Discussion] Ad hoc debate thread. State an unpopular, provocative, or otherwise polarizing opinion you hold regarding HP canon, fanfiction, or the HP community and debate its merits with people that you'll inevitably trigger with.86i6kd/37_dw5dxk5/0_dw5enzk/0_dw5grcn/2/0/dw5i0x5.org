  Minato Arisato has never been normal. When he awakens to the power of Persona and joins SEES, he learns that he possesses the power of the Wild Card, access to the Velvet Room, and a second god watching over him. Includes new social links from other SMT games. Includes 'short' PQ story at 157X; knowledge of the main story is not required to enjoy it, but it does help a lot.
