This is a huge pet peeve of mine. The Quibbler is being blackmailed (they have LUNA) and the Prophet is a ministry mouthpiece. Potterwatch is more concerned about keeping up hope and spirits and giving a bit of help--but they have to be careful in case a Voldy supporter tunes in somehow. HOW are they supposed to find out about the Order doing anything?
