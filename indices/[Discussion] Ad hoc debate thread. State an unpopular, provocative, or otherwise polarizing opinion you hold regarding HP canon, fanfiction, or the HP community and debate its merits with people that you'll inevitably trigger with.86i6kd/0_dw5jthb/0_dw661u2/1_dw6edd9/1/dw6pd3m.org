Okay, lets go through each point.

The purpose of the "seven potters" was to through off Voldemort. This was Snape/Dumbledore's idea, a way of ensuring the Voldy thinks Snape is reliable and has good info (the date) without giving away too much and letting Harry get through it.

They can't directly help him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made the decision to essentially go off grid and do this on their own. They have bigger things to worry about--getting muggleborns and family, squibs, etc. out of Britain. The Weasley's were critical to this, as were other Order members--by staying in the Ministry, they know what is happening and can help.

I think the Trio's attempt to get the locket makes this glaringly obvious. Because they have no "in", no mole, they had no idea what they were walking into, what was actually happening in the courtrooms with muggleborns being tried for "stealing magic", etc. They were completely blindsided by a lot of what they saw...The Weasley's are the Order's eyes. People are so used to dismissing them as incompetent, poor "bloodtraitors" that they don't consider them a threat. And despite Voldemort being in charge, they still need normal ministry people to do the regular day to day work of keeping the government running.

From potterwatch, it's clear there is some level of outreach going on, even if it is Fred and George--who are part of the order now. Also, the Order has no clear organization remaining at this point, just a bunch of members trying their best to keep helping in the periphery. They can't be too obvious about what they're doing and get caught because they can do a lot more good just moving people away and keeping them safe, and out of sight. Also, keeping the Taboo in mind, and the ministry's ability to track magic AROUND an underage witch/wizard--how can the Weasley's leave? They can't really go into hiding with Ginny, who is still underage, because the Trace tracks magic around her, and would allow them to be found. The law mandates that all school age wizards MUST go to Hogwarts, so they can't just keep Ginny at home--Ron has to pretend to have spattergroit, an incredible contagious and dangerous wizarding illness to get out of going to Hogwarts. And, in a VOldemort run ministry, you can be sure that the rest of the family leaving or doing anything blatant would see them punishing Ginny, Arthur and Percy, the family members they have the easiest access to. If you recall, Ted Tonks is going around helping others on the run from Snatchers. Does that not sound like the Order doing something? The Ministery--DMLE, Aurors, Dementors, Misuse of muggle artifacts office, Underage magic office, etc.--are in charge of the wizarding world. I think people here/in fanon forget what that means because they assume that Fudge being incompetent means every last person--of which there are literally hundreds--in the Ministry is equally incompetent. The people who monitor underage magic will continue to do so. The Trace still exists. Muggleborns, halfbloods, purebloods, anyone underage can be tracked, and just not doing magic is not enough--they have avoid being AROUND magic being one as well (remember Dobby?).

What if the government, our government, were corrupt and after you and your pals. You have about 20 adults able to help you. Would you rather they run around with guns trying to help a few people here and there and be completely unaware of what the enemy (who has funds, resources, and many many poeple) are doing, or would you want one or two in different positions within the government to alert you to what is happening? How much good does it do to go in with guns blazing when the other side has guns too? Wouldn't it be better to be forewarned and just move that family out? And if they just moved the targets, would you hear about it? It's not exactly very exciting is it? "The Spinnets have decided to take a small vacation to France as of earlier last week, and were thus unable to be reached for a minor investigation." Also, would VOLDEMORT's ministry (remember the man hates admitting defeat or any failures of his own, but loves to punish them in others) admit they couldn't get to a target before they left? No, it makes them look weak. So how are Harry & Co. supposed to hear about this stuff?
