As I remember Mad Eye died during “Seven Potters”. Order knew nothing about Snape's role and thought he's betrayer. If they didn't change plans after getting to know about a betrayer among them it makes the whole Order dumb and incompetent.

Ron without any problems lived with Bill and Fleur in the house that was under Fidelius. But I agree that this line is more about Trio stupidity.

The most obvious way of help is getting more people. Go from 20 to 200. As you're saying the Order helped some people to leave the country, but did nothing to overpower Riddle and DEs and win the war.

True Griffyndors indeed.
