Apparition and portkeys are not tracked. If they were, Trio would be caught and the ending of GoF would be different. I believe thar Floo to houses under Fidelius can't be tracked too.

Hermione had no problems with establishing fake identities for her parents and sending the to another country crossing several borders.

Books themselves provide a lot of ways for transportation, messaging, dealing with suspects in non fatal way, etc. And the Order used none of them for fighting Riddle.
