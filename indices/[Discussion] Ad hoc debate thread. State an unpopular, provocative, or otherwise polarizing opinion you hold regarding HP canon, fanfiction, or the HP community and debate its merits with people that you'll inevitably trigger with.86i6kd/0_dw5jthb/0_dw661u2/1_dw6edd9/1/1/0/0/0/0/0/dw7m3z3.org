I remember that the ministry was monitoring floo, apparition and portkeya from harrys house, hence the seven potters. It doesnt seem to be a hige reach to imagine they'd do the same for other homes. I should have been more clear about that.

And hermione got her parents out before the ministry came completely under voldy, and via muggle means. You're right about the fidelius, but hpw many people can cast that? Flitwick, dumbledore (dead) and maybe mcg anf snape. And as they afe either pretty high profile or cant be seen to not be on voldys side, it's kind of hard for them to be hopping around the isles putting up fudelius on houses
