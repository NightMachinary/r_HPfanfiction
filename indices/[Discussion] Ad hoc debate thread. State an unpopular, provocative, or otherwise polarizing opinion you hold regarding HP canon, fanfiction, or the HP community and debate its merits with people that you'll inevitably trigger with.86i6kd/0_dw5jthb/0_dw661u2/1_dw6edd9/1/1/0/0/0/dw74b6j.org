Seriously, think about it. McG is at Hogwarts, as are other order members, as professors. Death Eater professors are also there--with a means of immediate contact with Voldy. Clearly, they can't do anything there. The Carrows and other DE's are also on the train and able to immediately contact Voldy. Again, nothing they can do. Okay, so when they go home for the holidays..except, the entire family would have to be snuck out without alerting any DEs to the plans. Which is great in theory, except, Floo, Apparition and Portkeys are tracked by the ministry, which Voldy and the DEs control. Okay, so broom...and muggle transportation. Brooms are clearly very VISIBLE, and expensive--not every family has a broom for each member. Okay, so Muggle transportation. Except, most wizards have no idea how to blend in with Muggles and little to no idea of how to travel like one. Forget that the Muggle world doesn't even know they exist, so the needed documents for leaving the country, at minimum--VISA, Passport, some form of ID--they don't have. So that's out too. Really, the only way to get people out is in groups of 2 and 3, with broom, under cover of dark, with some way of quickly abandoning ship and disappearing if DEs are alerted--so basically, it's extremely difficult.

And remember, Mad-Eye hated the plan, and was suspicious of Dung. However, he's not the head of the Order, and clearly was overruled.
