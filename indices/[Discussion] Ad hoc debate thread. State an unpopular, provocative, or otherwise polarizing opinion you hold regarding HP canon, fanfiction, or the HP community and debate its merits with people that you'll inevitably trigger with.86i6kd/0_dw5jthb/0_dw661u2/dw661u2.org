The books are told from Harry's point of view. He doesn't know what the Order does when he's not actually there. When he's there the summer before 5th, he rarely sees any order members outside of Sirius and Molly other than on meeting nights/days, because they have jobs--regular jobs and things they are doing for the order. They're not all just hanging out in this one house in London. He goes to the Burrow before 6th year--he doesn't even get to see the order members/HQ. And before 7th is the same--he goes to the Burrow for the wedding, and the order members aren't mentioned as being around, and are likely busy doing actual work. Ofc Harry's interactions with them are them protecting him--from their POV, he's a little kid with a bunch of adults targeting him. Ofc they are going to be protecting him. They do plenty to proactively help, but given that we have an unreliable narrator, who can only speak from his own POV, we see little of that. Doesn't mean it isn't happening.
