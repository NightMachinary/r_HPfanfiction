The Order of Phoenix was basically a personal guard for Harry and the prophecy that did nothing else useful towards the war effort in the second war. I state this because in our interactions with them in the books and movies, they are usually moving Harry from point a to point b, and hiding out in a hallway/Grimmauld place. We never actually see action on the part of the order unless the dork Lord and his death munchers start the fray ie the trap in the department of mysteries/Bill's wedding. They never proactively do anything to help the main targets of the war, muggleborns/light families/neutral familes. I think it would have been far more realistic and thought provoking to see them do more to help in that part of the war. Hell Neville does a better job pulling targets out of the Carrow siblings view than the order does with anything else including guarding Harry.\\
Yes I get that trying to talk the other beings out of joining him would have helped had it succeeded, but it didn't. But if it didn't work in the first war it sure as hell wouldn't happen in the second war.
