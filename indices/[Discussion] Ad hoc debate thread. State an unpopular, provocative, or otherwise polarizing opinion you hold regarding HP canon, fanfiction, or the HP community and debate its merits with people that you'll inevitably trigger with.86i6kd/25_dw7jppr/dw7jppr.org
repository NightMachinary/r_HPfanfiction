AO3 is a pretty terrible fanfic archive, especially if you're not into slash. It's only good for oneshots and the occasional author that doesn't post to ffnet for some reason. The tags aren't as useful as everybody pretends they are, and because of the mass of smut on the site it can be very hard to find anything worth reading when you go through them. For example, the tag "slytherin hermione granger" brings nothing to the table that you won't have already read on ffnet, especially using scryer. Or it's probably a HP/DM lemon with hermione as a useless side character.
