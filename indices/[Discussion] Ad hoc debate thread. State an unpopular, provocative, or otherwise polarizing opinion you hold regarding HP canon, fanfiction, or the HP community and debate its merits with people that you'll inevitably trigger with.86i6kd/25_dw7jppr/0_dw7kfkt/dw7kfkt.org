AO3 is a very nice archive to post a story - it's easier to post and update chapters than on FFNet, and you have more options with regards to formating and illustrations, as well as Author Notes. The only flaw is the lack of PMs.

However, it's a terrible archive to find a story to read. The tags are useless since too many authors tag every character, pairing and (side)plot, no matter how small. And the search options are cumbersome and unintuitive, lacking even simple things such as right-clicking on tags in the results to add them to the search or exclude options, or drop-down menus.
