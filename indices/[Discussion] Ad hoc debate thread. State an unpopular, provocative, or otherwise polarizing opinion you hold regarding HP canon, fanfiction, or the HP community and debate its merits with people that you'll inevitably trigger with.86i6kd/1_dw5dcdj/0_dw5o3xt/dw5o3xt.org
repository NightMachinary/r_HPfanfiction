Fuck it, I prefer the AO3 search and tag system. Sometimes you just want something incredibly specific, and the AO3 system lets me look for whatever combination of things I want. With FFN's search, I always feel like it comes up with way too many things I don't feel like reading.

But, hey, they both have their pros and cons.
