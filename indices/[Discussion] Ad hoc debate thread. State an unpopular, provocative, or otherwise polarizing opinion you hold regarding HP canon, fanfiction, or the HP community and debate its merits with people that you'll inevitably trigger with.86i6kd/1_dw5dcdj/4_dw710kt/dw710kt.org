I have to say that when I first started writing HP fic, I put it on AO3 because it was where my other fandoms were. What I've found is that you get different kind of community responses between FFNet. Our FFNet ones, with a couple of exceptions, are general comment responses 'i liked x' 'more please' 'this is cool' which is of course lovely in it's own right. You can thank people for that easier. However, by and large, on AO3, we get comments that go into the meta of the characters and the decision, questions out how we interpret the canon and the world building and we get into discussions in the comments. As such, AO3 FEELS more communal to me because we interact more with the readers and get into comment discussions.
