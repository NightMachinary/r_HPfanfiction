Canon is taken far too seriously and far too literally, and it hurts many stories. Trying to make up excuses and explanations for ill-thought out plot devices or tropes ("Adults are useless", House-Elf slavery, Abused Orphan Hero, Unbreakable Vow) just so they don't wreck internal consistency, the plot, or the setting is far, far inferior to simply changing or ignoring what part of canon doesn't fit your story.

Don't want your wizard society to be slave-owning scum? Make the elves servants, not slaves. Don't want to spend pages on dealing with the issues of an abused child, nor want to make light of child abuse by pretending it doesn't deeply affect kids? Change the Dursleys' behaviour.

Your story will be better if you don't mindlessly follow canon.
