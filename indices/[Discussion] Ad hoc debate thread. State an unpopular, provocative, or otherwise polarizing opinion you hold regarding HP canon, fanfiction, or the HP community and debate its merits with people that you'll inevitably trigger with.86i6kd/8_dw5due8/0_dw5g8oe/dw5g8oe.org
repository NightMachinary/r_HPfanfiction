I don't necessarily disagree with this. I'm okay with people changing parts of canon they don't like or that don't mesh with their story.

I'm not okay with people ignoring canon. As in, they get details about the HP universe wrong because they didn't take the time to look up the actual details in canon. This really comes out in characterization. I want to see somebody OOC because the author is crafting a new, distinct persona, not because the person hasn't read canon in 5 years, and doesn't want to look up how Xenophilius Lovegood actually behaved.

It's also generally poor form for the author to push their political or moral opinion into the story by having the main character repeatedly riff on why Death Eaters totally aren't bad guys because reasons.
