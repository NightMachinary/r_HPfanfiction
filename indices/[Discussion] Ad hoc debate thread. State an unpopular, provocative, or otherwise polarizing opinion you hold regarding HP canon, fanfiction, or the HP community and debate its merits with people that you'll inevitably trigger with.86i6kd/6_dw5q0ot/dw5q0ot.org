Rowling really dropped the ball with Ron's character development. He's mostly unrealized potential.

Ron Weasley was the most undeveloped of the trio. He never really found himself in the series or the later released info. He never finds anything he's passionate about or his own 'niche'. Even after the series is over, he either ends up riding someone else's coattails (an auror with Harry) or is riding his dead brothers borrowed dream (working at the joke shop).

Even Quidditch, the closest thing he has to something he's passionate about is more fully realized by his sister Ginny instead who becomes a professional Quidditch player.
