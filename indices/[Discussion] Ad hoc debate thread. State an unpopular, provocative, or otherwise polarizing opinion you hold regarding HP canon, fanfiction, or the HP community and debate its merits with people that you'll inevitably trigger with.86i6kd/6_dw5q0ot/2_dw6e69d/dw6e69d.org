  Rowling really dropped the ball with Ron's character development.

This is the statement that I disagree with.

There are two definitions of character development:

1) The definition of character development refers to the process of creating a believable character in fiction by giving the character depth and personality.

2) The change in characterization of a Dynamic Character, who changes over the course of a narrative.

Rowling clearly succeeded in developing Ron as in interesting and vibrant character in the first case.

Rowling didn't grow his character much in terms of major character or personality change over time in the second case.

You are saying Rowling failed at Ron's character development in the second sense. I'd contend that she didn't fail because it seems to me that she intentionally didn't grow his character, which is fine.

There are plenty of characters and people in real life who don't change much or learn new things as they get older. That doesn't make them poorly written characters.
