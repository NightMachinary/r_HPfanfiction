Attending Hogwarts was mandatory after Voldemort took over. There would have been trouble if they sent Ginny somewhere else. And the Weasley's weren't going to abandon the cause themselves either. Plus, while we didn't see them, the Order still existed and must have been doing something in that time. Being in the Ministry would at least give them information about death eater movements and targets.
