Yeah, I never understood that. How are we meant to believe that Voldemort went "Find Potter, Granger and Weasley, they've been best friends for 6 years." And his death eaters said "Potter and Granger are defying us and are at large somewhere while Weasley is home with spattergroit." And Voldemort just accepts it?!
