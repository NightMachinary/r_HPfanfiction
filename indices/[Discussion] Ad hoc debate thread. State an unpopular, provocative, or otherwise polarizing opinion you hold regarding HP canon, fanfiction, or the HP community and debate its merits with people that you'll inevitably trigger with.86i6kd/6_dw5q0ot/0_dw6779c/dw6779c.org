He was somewhat lost in the fray after Book 6, but I think people read so much fanon they forget the absolute GOLD that is Ron's loyalty. Remember, Ron has family that can be hurt by his actions. His little sister--who all the Weasley brothers are protective of--is still at Hogwarts (in DH) and right under the Death Eaters' noses and within their purview. He canNOT afford to be seen with Harry and Hermione (whose parents are safely on the other side of the planet), because they will hurt his family (which the weasley's value more than anything). In addition to the stress of the Horcrux hunt, the Horcrux pulling at his mind and emotions, Ron has an additional stressor/worry--his family, and his very exposed little sister. He is of course worried about his older brothers too, Bill, who is a known Order member (Charlie is somewhat safer with the Dragons), Percy, in the midst of the ministry, amidst enemies, and likely feeding information to Order supporters/members and helping muggleborns, and Fred and George, who run potterwatch and are likely on the run with their friend Lee.

He's known to be great at Quidditch as a keeper--remember the game where he literally saves EVERYTHING? But it might be that he wants to settle into a stable job and support Hermione's ambitions, like an actual husband, you know? And I think the War would break anyone out of needing the spotlght or wanting it. He likely has more fame than he wants as one of the "Golden Trio" who saved the wizarding world. Maybe he really wanted to be an auror, or maybe he decided to help George with the shop so that he doesn't drown in his own grief and has someone, family, around to help and miss Fred with him? Ron, in the books, in canon, is a good friend, and I think Harry forgets to acknowledge or consider how much added pressure Ron is under BECAUSE he has a loving, close, family--Harry is too busy being jealous of it and wanting it to even try to understand what actually having a group of 8 other people that you love and would do just about anything for truly means. Again, the books are from Harry's POV.
