  Accusations of seeking fame aside, Snape's criticism of Harry is spot on.

How so? I admit it's been awhile so I can't remember how he criticizes Harry's character.

  Hagrid is a menace and should never been given any position at Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Probably, but when everyone else at Hogwarts is a menace, I guess he gets a pass.

  It's basically confirmed that Daphne is a blood supremacist.
#+end_quote

Eh no it's not. I read your other reply, but none of it talks about Daphne. Her sister and Pansy are not her. It shows she's tolerant of intolerance, and that's certainly a bad trait, but it's not the same as being a genuine bigot herself. Especially since Sirius is a prime example of family not being homogeneous.

  Fanfiction shouldn't be held to lower standards than published literature.
#+end_quote

Most fanfiction never goes through any more editing than what the author can do alone, so I'd disagree.
