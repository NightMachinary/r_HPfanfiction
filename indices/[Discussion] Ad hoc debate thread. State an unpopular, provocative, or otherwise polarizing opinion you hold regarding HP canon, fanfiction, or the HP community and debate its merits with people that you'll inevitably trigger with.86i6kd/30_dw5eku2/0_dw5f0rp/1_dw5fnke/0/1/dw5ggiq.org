Pottermore is more canon than books actually. I wondered if I should included that, but decided that Cursed Child is enough. Clearly I was wrong.

The "Writings by JK Rowling" are as the name suggests written by JK Rowling. JK Rowling is both a creator and an owner of the Harry Potter universe. Thus what she writes about Potterverse is canon. And obviously, later works trump earlier in matters of continuity.
