I've probably forgot some, but let's go with this.

- AO3 actually is a better site than FFN.

- Cursed Child is canon.

- While I wouldn't say that Luna is "certifiably insane", her father clearly is and she has actual problems and should have got help.

- Accusations of seeking fame aside, Snape's criticism of Harry is spot on.

- Hermione is an incredible hipocrite, and feels a need to always be right even when she clearly isn't.

- Hagrid is a menace and should never been given any position at Hogwarts.

- It's basically confirmed that Daphne is a blood supremacist.

- Charlus and Dorea weren't supposed to be Harry's grandparents.

- It's incredible how many fanfiction authors fail to comprehend children novels.

- It's also incredible how often changed elements in fics end up being more simplistic than the base children novels.

- Fanfiction shouldn't be held to lower standards than published literature.

- Rowling's plotting in the original series is terrible.

- Constantly recommending your own fics is in incredibly bad taste.
