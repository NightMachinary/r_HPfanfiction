I meant as a general rule, homosexuals and the rest were still shunned, ridiculed, and even beaten up/killed. It still can happen today but is much less prevalent.

I graduated high school in 97 and I knew of one guy who was "out" and he was a social pariah. He was treated so horribly (physically and mentally) he either dropped out or moved far away. /Pretty sure/ he didn't kill himself because we would have heard about it.
