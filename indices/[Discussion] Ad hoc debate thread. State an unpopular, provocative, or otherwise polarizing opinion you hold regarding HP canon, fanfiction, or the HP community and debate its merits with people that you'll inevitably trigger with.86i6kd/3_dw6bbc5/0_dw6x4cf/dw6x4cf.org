/Back in the mid 90s being gay wasn't nearly as accepted as it is now./

Depends what you mean by accepted, and where. I'm in the US, not the UK, so things unfolded differently, but mid-90s had a lot of out gay people. Cosmopolitan cities, especially harbor cities where a mix of cultures already existed, tended to be more accepting. Rural areas, not so much. Northern England wouldn't have been a great place to be gay, I imagine. Manchester and Glasgow, ditto.

So yeah, there was overt and dangerous homophobia, but there was also a flourishing and increasingly accepted gay presence, including on the global artistic/musical stage. What didn't exist then were the nonbinary, genderqueer, and finely parsed versions of sexuality and identity that have their own vocabulary now. But then, any fic that uses jargon as part of its characterization ("Hi, I'm Pansy Parkinson, and I'm demisexual!") is instant back-button territory for me.
