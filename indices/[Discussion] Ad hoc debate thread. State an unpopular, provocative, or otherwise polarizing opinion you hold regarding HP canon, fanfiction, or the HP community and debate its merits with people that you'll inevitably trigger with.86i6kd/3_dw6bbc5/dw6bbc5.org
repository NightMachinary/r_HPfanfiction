Stories where literally every character is gay.\\
Stories where it's clear the author is putting modern values onto people who lived 30 years ago. Back in the mid 90s being gay wasn't nearly as accepted as it is now.\\
Stories where out of no where Draco becomes a male veela and of course Harry is his mate. The convo usually looks something like this. "Harry you are my mate. You must love me!" "But I like girl parts!" "Not anymore!" "Ok I guess.".\\
Obvious anachronisms. Harry didn't listen to Taylor Swift or whoever tf back in 199x on his iPhone. I'm not even sure TayTay was born yet...
