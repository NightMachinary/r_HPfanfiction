God, that was the worst book ever. It read like some of the shitfest fanfics--JKR was playing around with time and clearly contradicted things she had had Hermione say in Book 3. Forget the butterfly effect, Cursed Child ignored that freaking hurricanes of world-ending intensity should have rippled out and acted like it was perfectly all right. I swear, the book/play was just an exercise in JKR going: "How much can I fuck with people? You think they'll buy it?" I pretend it's a fanfic and had nothing to do with HP cannonverse.
