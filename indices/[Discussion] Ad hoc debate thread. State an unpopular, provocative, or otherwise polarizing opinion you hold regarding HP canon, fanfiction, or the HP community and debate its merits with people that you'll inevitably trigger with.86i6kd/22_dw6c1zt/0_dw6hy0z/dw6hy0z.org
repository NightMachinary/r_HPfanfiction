The only reason I disagree is that somewhere, somehow yeaaars ago when the first couple of books were being written, I remember seeing a cartoonish drawing of Hermione as being a goofy ugly little white girl with insanely frizzy hair, and it has been my "head image" since. I don't usually imagine Emma Watson when picturing scenes. It doesn't bother me when races are changed around by people though.
