I don't think Hermione in the books was meant to be black or biracial however I don't mind at all when fics change her race because I can see it fitting. There are also fics that write Harry as being Desi and I'm also here for that. One of my favorite fic writers, Annerb writes James as being mixed race (white/Indian) and therefore Harry as being 1/4 Indian. This is my new head cannon.
