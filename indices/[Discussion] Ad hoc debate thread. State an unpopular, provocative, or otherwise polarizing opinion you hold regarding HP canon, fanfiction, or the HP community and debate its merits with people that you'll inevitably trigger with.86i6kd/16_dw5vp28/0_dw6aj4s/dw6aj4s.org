Canon Hermione is decent at applying her knowledge. She's okay at acquiring more knowledge, though she might be severely hampered by the Hogwarts Library's organization (the books may well be sorted according to the weather on the day the author completed the manuscript). She's apparently excellent at regurgitating her knowledge on demand.

She'd be an excellent historian, if paired with a vicious editor.

I think that's primarily because Rowling didn't know how to write an intelligent character and wanted to write her as an intelligent character.
