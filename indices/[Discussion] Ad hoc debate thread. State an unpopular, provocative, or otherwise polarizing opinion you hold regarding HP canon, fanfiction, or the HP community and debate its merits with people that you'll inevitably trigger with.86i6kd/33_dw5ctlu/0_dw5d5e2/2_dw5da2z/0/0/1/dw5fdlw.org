Just some thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  ...he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely conscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so: Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I work one day..
#+end_quote

Author is equivocating consciousness with self-consciousness. This is a common layman's misconception. Nothing necessarily wrong with this, but for somebody that knows the distinction, it's slightly annoying.

I do like the idea of contemplating how The Sorting Hat, an animated object, experiences consciousness. It's an interesting idea.

  Harry sat on the stool and /carefully/ placed onto his head
#+end_quote

Some of the italics seem arbitrarily placed.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."

  What?

  "I seem to have become self-aware."
#+end_quote

The fact that The Sorting Hat used the pronoun "I" in the opening paragraph seems to conflict with it becoming self-aware for the first time here.

#+begin_quote
  There was a wordless telepathic sigh.
#+end_quote

The qualifier "wordless" is redundant with "sigh" here.

#+begin_quote
  I am in essence a sort of mirror by which children Sort themselves. But most children simply take for granted that a Hat is talking to them
#+end_quote

I can get behind "Sort" being a proper down, but why is "Hat" a proper noun here?

#+begin_quote
  If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as thinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness -
#+end_quote

The author has doubled and tripled down hard on their (incorrect) usage of the term consciousness in this chapter, riffing it on repeatedly. I can excuse a minor passing mistake, but if you're going to really make a point of a complex concept such as consciousness, you should at least do a minimum of due diligence to ensure you're using the term correctly.

#+begin_quote
  But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who arrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach.
#+end_quote

If the author has read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach][GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach]] and even the barest contemporary work on the subject, then they should be well versed enough to know the distinction between consciousness and self-consciousness.

#+begin_quote
  In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense of total inner disarray must be what other people felt like when talking to /him/.
#+end_quote

Horribly self-aggrandizing, but great characterization.

#+begin_quote
  Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat didn't just go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw -

  "Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have called it out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we need to discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For the love of Merlin, must you pull this sort of thing on everyone and everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing -"
#+end_quote

I like the interplay between narration and dialogue. Also, the hat is supposed to have Harry's vocabulary, so its using words like "Merlin" is inconsistent.

Ok, I've finished about half the chapter, enough I think to form an initial opinion.

The writing is good. Certainly unique in form. For that alone, I can see why it would be attractive to people. There are frequent problems with consistency in terms of usage of italics, proper nouns, punctuation. Minor issues with word usage, but nothing major.

There are a lot of things I like, some of the ideas are thought provoking. Stylistically, I like the interplay between Harry and The Sorting Hat.

The author goes out of his way to show how incredibly smart Harry is, which is annoying. It makes my dislike Harry, but that's not necessarily a problem with the writing. It's a design choice.

My biggest issue with this chapter, one that may not carry into other chapters, is the author's misuse of the word consciousness, equating it to self-consciousness. It seems like a simple mistake, and it is. I'd easily forgive it if it weren't such an important part of the chapter, and it wasn't shoved into the readers face over and over again. Seems like lazy writing to me. I'd have done some more research into the subject to check my facts before making such a point of it, especially if I were writing a fic in which my main character is supposed to know a lot on the topic.

Altogether, it's good. Perhaps /great/ if you really like the style. Based on the first half of the 10th chapter of HPMOR, it's probably not among the best fics ever written, but I can now see why somebody might think it is. I'll continue to withhold absolute judgement until I read a larger portion of the story.
