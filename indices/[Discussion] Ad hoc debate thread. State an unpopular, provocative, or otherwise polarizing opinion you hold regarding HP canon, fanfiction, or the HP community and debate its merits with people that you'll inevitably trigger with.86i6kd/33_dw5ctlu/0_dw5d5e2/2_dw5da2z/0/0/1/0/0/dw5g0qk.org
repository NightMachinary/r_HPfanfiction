Self-awareness isn't required for consciousness. The author strongly implies that simple awareness doesn't warrant consciousness. Regardless, I'm /not/ an expert in this area, so as an expert, please explain 1) why self-awareness is required for consciousness, 2) there isn't any such implication 3) "consciousness" is a valid substitute or short-hand for self-consciousness in this case. I'm happy to be enlightened.
