If nothing else, /Seventh Horcrux/ gotta /Seventh Horcrux/. The subject matter is too referential for it to /actually/ be published, but as far as actual writing goes, why not? Also, my memory's foggy but I would consider /Fantastic Elves/ a clear contender. It has a sweet, sort of Roald-Dahlish quality to it and no glaring flaws that I can see.
