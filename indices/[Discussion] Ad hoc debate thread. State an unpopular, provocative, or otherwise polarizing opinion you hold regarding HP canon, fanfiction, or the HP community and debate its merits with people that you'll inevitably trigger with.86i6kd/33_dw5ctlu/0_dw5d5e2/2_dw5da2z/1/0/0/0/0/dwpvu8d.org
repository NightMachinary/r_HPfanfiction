  That's a pretty egregious flaw.
#+end_quote

No, that's pretty egregious pedantry. Using it every other line becomes ridiculous, but there's a middle ground between never doing it and ridiculous booksaidism. It's much like "no adverb between /to/ and the verb" --- a good rule of thumb, but not a hard law by any means.

As for the discussion of the amount of adverb, I've seen it pointed out that the /canon books/ have an extremely large number of adverbs in dialogue too (Stephen King is quoted with something to the effect of "Madam Rowling never met an adverb that she did not like"), and it works quite well.
