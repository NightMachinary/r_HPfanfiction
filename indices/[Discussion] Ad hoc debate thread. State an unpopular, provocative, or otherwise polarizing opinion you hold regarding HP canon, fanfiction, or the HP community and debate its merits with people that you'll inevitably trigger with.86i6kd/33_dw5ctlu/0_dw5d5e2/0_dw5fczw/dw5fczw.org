I don't give much of a damn about writing quality, but on the metric of what fanfic did I learn the most from and changed the way I think, HPMOR is ludicrously off the scale. It is in the category with real books. HPMOR isn't written to be a fanfiction. It uses the world of Harry Potter (which provides a set cast that everyone is familiar with) to explore the question of how to analyze a world that can't be guaranteed to follow any existing rules you know.

This may not be what many people who read other HP fanfics are looking for so many people will go away unhappy. However, there is a concentrated audience (who don't necessarily read other HP fanfics) who really enjoy it. Look no further than the fact that [[/r/HPfanfiction]] has 18k subscribers discussing the whole fandom while [[/r/HPMOR]] has 10k subscribers about one fic.
