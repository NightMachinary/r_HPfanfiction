There's well-written and there's well-written. HPMR has a strong narrative voice, few SPAG errors, and an interesting premise. That being said, I find many of the characters OOC and the riffing on canon annoying at some points. The annoyance I can take, but the OOC was a deal breaker for me after about 25 chapters.
