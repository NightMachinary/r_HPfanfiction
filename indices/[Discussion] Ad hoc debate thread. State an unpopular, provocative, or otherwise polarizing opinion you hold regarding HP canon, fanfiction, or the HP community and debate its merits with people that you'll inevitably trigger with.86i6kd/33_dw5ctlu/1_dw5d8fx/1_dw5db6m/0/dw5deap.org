I freely admit that I'm a huge crossover Junkie, so most of my favorite fics tend to be crossovers. Many people can't stand the crossover stories for some reason but whatever. I like what I like and I'm okay with that.

I honestly don't know what I would put as my all-time favorite story. At the moment I'm getting seriously into some Game of Thrones fanfiction so it might not even be in the Harry Potter fandom.
