Agree on the film obviously. There is chemistry in the books. Those stolen glances where they both crack up and the scene in the common room where Ginny is casually leaning on Harry and they have good banter are two examples. The problem is we don't have /enough/ of those examples. It isn't that when they are together, there is no chemistry. There is. Just not enough of those scenes.
