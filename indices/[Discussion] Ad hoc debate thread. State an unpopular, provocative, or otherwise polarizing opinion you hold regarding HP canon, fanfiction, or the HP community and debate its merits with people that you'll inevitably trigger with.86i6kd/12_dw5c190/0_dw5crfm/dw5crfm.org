Ginny certainly wasn't well fleshed out for being the main character's significant other. As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, she could have used a major dose of character development.

That said, I always thought her fire was a good counterbalance to Harry's general attitude. I think the more fundamental problem is that Rowling isn't good at romance. There's chemistry there, but it's clouded in a fog of bad writing. I can't think of any well written romance or chemistry in the entire series. Maybe Tonks and Remus?
