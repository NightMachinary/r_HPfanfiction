Ummm...we didn't see any of their relationship except the bit with Tonks' depression in Year 6, and the ending of HBP when they get together, and the beginning of DH when they are married and have a kid on the way. We just don't see their relationship develop or grow, and we only get to see Remus being scared about being a dad--which happens to almost all expectant fathers, because it's terrifying suddenly being (partly) responsible for a little life, forget that it's in the middle of a war where he and Tonks will be especially targeted.
