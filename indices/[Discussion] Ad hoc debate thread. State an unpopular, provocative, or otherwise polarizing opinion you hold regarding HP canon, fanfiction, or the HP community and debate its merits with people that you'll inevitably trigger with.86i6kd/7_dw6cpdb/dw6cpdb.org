A bit late, but I thought I'd add my two cents. I think Tonks and Remus was/is extremely creepy/terrible pairing. More than that, I think Remus is a pitiful being and I despise him as a character.

I understand the depression factor, I understand his mindset and how his personality and view on the world caused him to act the way he did. How he acted throughout the books was still shitty and they aren't excusable.
