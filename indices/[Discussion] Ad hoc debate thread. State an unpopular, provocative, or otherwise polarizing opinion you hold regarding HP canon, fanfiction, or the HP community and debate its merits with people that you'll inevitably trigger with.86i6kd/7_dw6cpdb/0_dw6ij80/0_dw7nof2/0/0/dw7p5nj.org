Does he though?

I mean from Harry's POV - of course he does. It's important for the series that he does it for the Order of Merlin/ to get back at Lupin.

As an adult reader I'm more doubtful. That's what I love about this series- the older I am as a read it I question the motives of the adults more. Are they are as obvious as they seem to Harry or are they more complex or flat out not explained?

It makes for a lot of theorising.
