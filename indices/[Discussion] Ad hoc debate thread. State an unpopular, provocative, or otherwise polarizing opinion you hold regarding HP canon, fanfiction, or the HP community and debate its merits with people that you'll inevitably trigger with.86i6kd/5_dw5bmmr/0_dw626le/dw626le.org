I find this opinion very interesting because it's just so different from the way I read in general. To me, it's almost always about the journey, the characters and the little moments that may make me laugh or feel happy or sad. While unfinished fics can be frustrating, I never regret reading them if the fic is good otherwise.

I will always take reading an abandoned fic that has fascinating worldbuilding, good prose, amazing dialogue and perfect character portrayals over an okay finished fic thats kind of bland. One I will reread while the other one I will never finish in the first place. For me it's about how I feel while reading it, not whether the plot manages to come to a conclusion.

The same applies to books and tv shows, I love firefly despite it stopping at season 1, or game or thrones even though the books are likely never going to be finished.

I am curious, does that thought also apply to other media or is it just unfinished fanfiction? Do you read books series that are in progress or watch unfinished tv shows? Or are those different since those do tend to get finished?
