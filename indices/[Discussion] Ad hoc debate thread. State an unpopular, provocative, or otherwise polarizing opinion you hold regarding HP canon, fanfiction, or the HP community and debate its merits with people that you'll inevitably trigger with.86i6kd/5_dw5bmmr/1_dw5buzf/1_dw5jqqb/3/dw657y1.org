Sometimes they actually discover how writing works and feel put out by what they've produced already and feel the need to scrap and start again. Sometimes they then get put out by how much effort went into their first effort and stop. I've seen dozens of stories where the author realised they could have done it so much better but they've written themselves into a corner and promised to rewrite but the rewrite never comes or is never finished.
