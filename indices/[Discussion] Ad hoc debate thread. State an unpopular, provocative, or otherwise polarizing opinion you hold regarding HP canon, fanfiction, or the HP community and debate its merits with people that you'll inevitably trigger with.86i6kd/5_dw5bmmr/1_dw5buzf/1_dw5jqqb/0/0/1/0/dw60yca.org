I mean shit. Robst spent like 700000+ words saying nothing.

And hey. I get it. I do. But logistically a 400 page book is well within established confines to complete a story.

To wit. JKRs first three HP books come in under 100000 words. The last four are over with Order bring the longest and wordiest.

Prisoner is my favorite and it's right under 100k. So I think I'm still justified in not getting how those stories aren't done.
