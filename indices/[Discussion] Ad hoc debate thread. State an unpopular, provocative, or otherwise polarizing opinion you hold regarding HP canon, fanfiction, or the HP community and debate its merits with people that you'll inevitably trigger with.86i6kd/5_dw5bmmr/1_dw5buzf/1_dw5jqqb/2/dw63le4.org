From what I have seen, a lot of 100k stories do not actually ever get finished. It's a hobby for most people that takes a lot of time. Interests change, real life happens, just because they wrote so many words doesn't mean they have the desire, time or even the skill to wrap up their story. They don't get paid for it and they don't owe their readers anything.

A lot of fics also tend to be not structured or written well. They end up 100k words into the fic while Harry is still in his first year and never get to a conclusion. Its easy to get stuck writing something that never actually progresses the plot line somewhere and just stop.

This even happens to professional authors. George R.R Martin got stuck writing game of thrones "a dance of dragons" book because his world building was so complicated that he couldn't find a way to converge story lines together. It took him years to figure it out. He also doesn't seem to have any desire to finish his books anytime soon so I doubt we will ever get the conclusion to those. And this is an author that wrote 1 million + words on this series already.
