If the story ends at a logical conclusion and isn't on a cliffhanger or something like that then I'll consider reading them. But if it just ends in the middle of a story arc or something then I find it highly irritating because it's all build up and no payoff. To put it a little more crudely, it's all foreplay no climax. I'm not going to lose any sleep because there are stories that other people say are great that I'm never going to read.

As for incomplete sequels, it depends on if the first story interested me enough to read it. Once again if the first story leaves me at a big Cliffhanger and there's no resolution in the sequel, I don't really like to read those.
