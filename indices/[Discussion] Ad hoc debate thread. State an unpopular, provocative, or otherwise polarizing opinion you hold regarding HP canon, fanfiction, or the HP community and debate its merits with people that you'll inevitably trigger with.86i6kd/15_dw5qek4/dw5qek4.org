People who stick to Canon religiously. "If it's not in the books then it's not really Harry Potter." Logical extensions of magic like wards can enhance and deepen the lore of Harry Potter. I'm not saying every idea is a good idea but you don't have to automatically discredit a story just because they're doing something that didn't happen in the books.

Also canon rehashes, especially those where major differences are in the story yet everything happens exactly like in the books. I'm not asking for a complete alternate universe, but give the readers a change-of-pace please. If we wanted to read how Harry & Co defeated the bad guy exactly like it happened in the books then we'd just read the damn books!
