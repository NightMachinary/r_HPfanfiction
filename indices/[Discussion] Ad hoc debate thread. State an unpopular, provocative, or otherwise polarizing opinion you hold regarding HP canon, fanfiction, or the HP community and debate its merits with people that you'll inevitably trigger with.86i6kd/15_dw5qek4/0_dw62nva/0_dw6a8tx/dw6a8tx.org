I remember someone on reddit saying that in most fanfics where wards play a role they are treated as rune-javascript controlled Star Trek shields. Those are the wards that get a lot of hate.

Nothing wrong with calling the protective curses, jinxes, charms as wards but very few authors actually manage to portray them in a way thats magical rather than sci fi.
