I don't see how such wards would be annoying either. In fact, protections that only keep out those you want to keep out exist in canon as well (namely the Fidelius, bond of blood and some general protections (like what was around the Tonks residence)). A lot of people want magic to be this wholly illogical thing (following from Hermione in book q), but it's clear that even in canon there is a certain logic to how magic works.
