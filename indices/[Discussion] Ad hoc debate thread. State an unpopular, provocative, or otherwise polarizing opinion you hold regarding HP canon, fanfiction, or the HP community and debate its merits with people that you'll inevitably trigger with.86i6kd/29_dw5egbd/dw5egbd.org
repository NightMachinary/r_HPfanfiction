I don't see why I'm getting downvoted. I'm being open and honest, and I would prefer if people respected that, even if they disagree.

Hermione should never have ended up with Ron Weasley.

They're a terrible match in every regards; have no hobbies in common; actively resent and hurt each other a lot; they seem to have only been paired because they fight / bicker constantly; and Rowling literally admitted that the only reason why they ended up a couple was because of her own "wish fulfillment". Rowling herself even expressed doubts over the relationship in the Wonderland interview, and it's strongly implied this is because she wrote it at a time in her life when she was still pining over her unhealthy relationship with her ex-husband.

In short, Hermione needed to end up with someone - anyone - who not only was a much better match for her, but at least shared some of her personality traits and interests. Ron briefly mentions Hermione "liking Cedric Diggory because he's handsome" in /Goblet of Fire/, but obviously, Cedric /died/, so...not exactly condusive to writing a canon-compliant fic.

I personally 'ship her with young Tom Riddle, which I've written several, long essays as to why. The tl;dnr of it is that I feel like, out of all of the /Harry Potter/ characters Hermione could've ended up with (including Harry himself), based on Hermione's book character, she'd be most attracted to Tom in-theory. (If he weren't a meglomaniacal Dark Lord, that is.) They actually share a /lot/ in common, in personality, background, and interests / hobbies, and...well, it's canon that Hermione actually copied at least one of Tom's tactics, as she admits openly to Harry in /Order of the Phoenix/. *
