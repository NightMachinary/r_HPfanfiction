  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. If she changed the wizarding world, maybe they'd be more prepared against them in the future. But who is that prefect, and why does her mind itch at seeing him?
