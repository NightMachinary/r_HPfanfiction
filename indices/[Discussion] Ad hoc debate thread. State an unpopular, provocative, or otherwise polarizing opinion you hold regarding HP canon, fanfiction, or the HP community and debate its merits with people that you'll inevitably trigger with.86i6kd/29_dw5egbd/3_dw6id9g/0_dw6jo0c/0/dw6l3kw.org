It's not just tomione romance, but very often a side of Hermione that gets written into fics when I don't think there's much evidence for her being so terrified of everything all the time in the books. She took Bellatrix' torture for goodness sake! Another hugely disappointing fic in this regard was Red Right Hand, which started off well enough but went in a very odd, depressing direction as Hermione loses any sense of objectivity or control over her adopted son Tom. While being stuck in the whole Black-pureblood-traditions rigmarole. An infuriating fic to read, but really well written too. Ugh. linkffn(12304702)
