Oh, I agree 100%. I really like Tomione, but only when it's written without Hermione being "weak" and a doormat, as you put it. I actually don't like a majority of the "mainstream" Tomione fanfictions because of how poorly they characterize and write Hermione's character...linkffn(Nightmare) is one of the worst offenders, IMHO.
