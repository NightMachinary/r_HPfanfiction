My main problem with Tomione isn't the idea, it's that it seems the people who like Tomione as a pairing don't like the fic style I like. Champion was just about good enough, but very often Tom is still a totally possessive, manipulative psychopath and she is almost always shown as being /so weak/. It's nauseating. I have been enjoying Strange Attractors ( linkffn(12734980) ) but even there she needs the combined experience of god knows how many years as an unspeakable to just about keep up with him, and the political aspect of the fic is a bit annoying.
