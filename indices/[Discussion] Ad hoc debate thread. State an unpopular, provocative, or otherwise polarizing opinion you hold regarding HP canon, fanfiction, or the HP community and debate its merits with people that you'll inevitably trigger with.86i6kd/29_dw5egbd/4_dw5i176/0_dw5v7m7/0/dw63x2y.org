Harry was at times, less of a character more of a plot device. He was so heroic, so lazy, so adaptable. He made choices nobody else would make because it was needed he would. The Dursleys are almost parody villains as are Voldemort, Bellatrix and a lot of the Death Eaters. The Harry Potter series is one of the best stories ever written and very compelling but characters we sacrificed to make it so.
