Ron is the only human character is the series. Hermione is thoroughly unlikable and irritating. She is arrogant and stubborn while Ron is stubborn but relaxed. Hermione is driven Ron wants to enjoy life, Hermione grates on people and never showed the ability to make friends outside of those that saved her life from a troll. Ron has shown that when he needs he can make other friends to spend time with. The point is they're both flawed people but together as a couple they make one functioning person. Hermione keeps Ron on track and Ron keeps Hermione from burning out and puts out the fires she starts. Over the series we see Ron grow and accept playing second fiddle to Harry, he wouldn't mind being the less talented person in the relationship.

In conclusion they are two parts of a whole and so long as they appreciate what the other brings they are stronger together and all that mushy suit. That and alone their negative traits would hold them back in a professional environment.
