Thank you! I suppose there's not much else to be said, then. It just seems to boil down to some fan having different views on the characters than the author and other fans.

I actually agree with you on the latter half of your view, that Tom was "too far gone" by the time Harry tried to get him to feel remorse. He'd been far beyond the point of no return for decades. That's actually why I like the idea of young Tom Riddle and Hermione fostering a relationship: because I feel, quite strongly, that Hermione would try her best to help Tom become a better person. She would try everything in her power to get him to make different choices, and to not become the monster that he ultimately did.

I also feel like Tom would be, well...kind of an asshole to Hermione, at first. Yet Hermione is nothing, if not completely stubborn and iron-willed in her determination. I think he'd warm up to her eventually, simply based on her sheer persistance of presence, just like Harry and Ron did in PS/SS.
