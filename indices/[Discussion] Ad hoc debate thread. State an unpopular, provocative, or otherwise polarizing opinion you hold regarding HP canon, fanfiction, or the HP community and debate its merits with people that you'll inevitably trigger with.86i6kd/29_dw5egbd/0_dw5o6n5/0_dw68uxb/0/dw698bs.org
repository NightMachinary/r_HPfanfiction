Tom isn't capable of love though. That quote has her saying /if/ he'd had a loving mother he would be, but he didn't have that and he thinks love is a weakness. He not only doesn't love, he doesn't even want it. I personally feel compassion for Tom. His life is sad and he never had a real chance. Dumbledore himself feels compassion for Tom as well, and encourages Harry to try to do the same. That doesn't change what he became and by the time he dies his soul is so broken and shredded, finding love couldn't save him.

I like your answer though. Well said, I just disagree.
