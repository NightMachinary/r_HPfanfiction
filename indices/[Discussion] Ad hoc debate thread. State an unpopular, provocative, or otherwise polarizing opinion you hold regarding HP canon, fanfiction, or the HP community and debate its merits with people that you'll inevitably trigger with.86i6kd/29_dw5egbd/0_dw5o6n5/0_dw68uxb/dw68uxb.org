  Tom Riddle is incapable of love. He's an inherently shitty, evil character. There's nothing wrong with that, but he doesn't need/deserve/want love.

J.K. Rowling herself debunked this. Tom is certainly capable of love. However, because he never experienced it himself, he never understood it.

  Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that [Tom] came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him. [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/07/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript/][(Source)]]

Rowling has also written entire essays all but indirectly showing how she has compassion for Tom and his character, by delving into her horrific realization of what orphanages are /really/ like (and the negative effects they have on children) when doing "research trips". Specifically, when she visited orphanages to research for Tom's backstory in /Half-Blood Prince/.

You can read the full context and scope of Rowling's views [[https://www.quora.com/Was-Voldemort-a-psychopath-He-was-self-preserving-7-horcruxes-self-centred-He-killed-without-batting-an-eyelid-He-couldnt-love/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]] and [[https://www.quora.com/Is-Tom-Riddles-childhood-behaviour-personality-From-Harry-Potter-a-realistic-representation-of-how-a-future-psychopathic-acts-like/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]].

Also, from her essays and articles, it's quite clear that Rowling is very passionate about defending (and helping) the "child victims" of orphanages, Tom included. As Rowling has stated that Hermione is based off of herself many times, her reaction is basically the equivalent of how Hermione would react as well.
