I agree about the Ron and Hermione pairing but couldn't disagree more about young Tom and Hermione. Based on what you describe, why wouldn't it make much more sense for her to end up with Percy?

Tom Riddle is incapable of love. He's an inherently shitty, evil character. There's nothing wrong with that, but he doesn't need/deserve/want love.
