They have nothing in common other than one of Hermione's teachers says shes the brightest kid in the year to her and Riddle was also.

Their backgrounds are nothing alike, she's thoroughly middle-class with a cushty childhood whereas he's brought up in an working class orphanage during the war.

What interests do they have in common? Her only interests seem to be wanting to study, fighting for equality and boys. The only thing I could possibly think is that Riddle was a genius and Hermione likes to study?

The personalities could not be more different. He was charming smooth and popular. She's shrill, grating and unpopular even to her best friends.
