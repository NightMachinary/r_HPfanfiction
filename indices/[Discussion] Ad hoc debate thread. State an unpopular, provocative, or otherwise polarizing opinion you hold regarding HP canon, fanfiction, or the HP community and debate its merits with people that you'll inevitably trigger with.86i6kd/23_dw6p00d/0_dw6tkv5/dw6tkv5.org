That's actually a pretty common theory, but considering that InquisitorCOC conducts himself better in discussions I'm quite doubtful of it. You wouldn't make multi which is "better" than your main account if you wanted to promote your main account. In conclusion, I think that they are separate people, it's just that InquisitorCOC pushes Starfox's works everywhere because he likes bad fics.
