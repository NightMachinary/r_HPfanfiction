I didn't say Ron deserved death. But a lot of people didn't deserve it, but still died, because it's the war.

Ron't death in the war could be remarkable and meaningful. It would have redeemed his known sins and become a great Symbol of the Light (may be even greater than HP himself).

[Edit]: My bad, I did say that he should have died for his sins. Just several more reasons for it.
