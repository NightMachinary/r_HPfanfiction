We're talking about the second to main character here.

As I remember he wasn't even hurt in the war. Not even once he was experienced Cruciatus. As is he lost less than most (yes, he lost a brother, but he has another 5 and a sister).

Rowling was pampering him until the end.

Heroical death would have been a remarkable finish of his life. Pureblood hero fallen for the life of muggleborns.
