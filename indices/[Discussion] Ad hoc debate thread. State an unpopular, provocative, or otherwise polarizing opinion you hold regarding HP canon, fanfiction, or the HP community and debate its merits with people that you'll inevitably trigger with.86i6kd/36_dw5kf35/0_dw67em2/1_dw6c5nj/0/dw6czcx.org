  Weasley and Malfoy dismiss non-magical people as something unimportant.

He doesn't despise muggles or anything. You said he should die for it, and that's ridiculous. There are half-bloods with the same attitude.

  Leaving his best friends in the forest without any hope alone versus Riddle's forces... Yes, not horrible at all.
#+end_quote

Horcrux. He regretted it immediately after. It's still a shitty thing to do, but something he should die for? C'mon.

  So she killed Remus, Tonks, Fred, Colin, Lavender and bunch of others while she was in light place... Nice woman.

She killed them because that's how war works. She killed them for that purpose alone. She wanted to kill Ron just because she was in a dark place.
