Ah well, yes. I mean, I am the author of the two hermione timetravel compendium threads here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/66imst/my_hermione_ongoing_timetravel_compendium_of_the/?st=jdu6ez58&sh=5c6da5d6][1]] - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ymqb6/my_hermione_timetravel_compendium_of_the_last/?st=jf4gew3d&sh=4ff920f6][2]] ... So believe me when i say I am intimately acquainted with this aspect of Hermione fics. It's also supercommon in crossovers. it's a fine line though, because some of the timetravel angst scenes are sometimes even worse.
