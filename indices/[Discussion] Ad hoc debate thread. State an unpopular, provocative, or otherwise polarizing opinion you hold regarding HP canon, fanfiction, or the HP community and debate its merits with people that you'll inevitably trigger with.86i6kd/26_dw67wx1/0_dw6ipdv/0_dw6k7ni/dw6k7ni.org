I'll have to look when I'm at a desktop for specifics. The stories that tend to bug me is when Hermione goes back in time to fix everything and everyone immediately trusts her, wants to date her, and she apparently knows every spell because she reads a lot. I love a good time travel fix it but I prefer it when the characters run into possibly unexpected problems (i.e. it's the middle of a war why would you trust some rando).
