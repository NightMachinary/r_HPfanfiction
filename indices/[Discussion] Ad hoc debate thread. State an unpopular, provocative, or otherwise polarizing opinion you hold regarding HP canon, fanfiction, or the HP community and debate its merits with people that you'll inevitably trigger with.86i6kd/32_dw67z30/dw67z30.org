Any story featuring Daphne Greengrass as a romance option or direct friendship is just wish fullfillment and not worth reading.

Draco Malfoy is always an asshole, even if he has leather pants, and stories where he is not an asshole are just wish fullfillment and not worth reading.

In all Harry Potter fanfiction, Harry is Harry in Name Only. No one writes Harry as he was in canon.

If your story has more than a thousand reviews, that probably means that its just well writen crap.
