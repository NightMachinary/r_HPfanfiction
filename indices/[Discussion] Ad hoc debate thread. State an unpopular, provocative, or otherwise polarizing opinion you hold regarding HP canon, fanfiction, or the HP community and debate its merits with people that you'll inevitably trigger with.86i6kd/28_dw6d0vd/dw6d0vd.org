Ron is an idiot and I would have loved to read his death scene

I hate Ginny, such a waste of what could have been a good character for Harry to be with instead of one devoid of any personality other than she has red hair and her and harry look like a semi-backwards james and lily.

I don't find Lucius Malfoy attractive at all.

Red eyes for Voldemort, why? What is this LOTR?

Harry is the most lazy self centered teenager I've read in a book."Honestly I have a dark lord who knows more magic than almost every other magical person on the earth combined. So I'll just learn expalliarmus and protego, I should be good. God knows Accio was too much for my little itty bitty brain and maturity to handle."

Dumbledore was funny, and was in a horrible situation, I don't enjoy perfect-Dumbledore fanfics or bashing ones

Snape is still an asshat just because he loved someone doesn't make him a good person. Hitler loved someone too.
