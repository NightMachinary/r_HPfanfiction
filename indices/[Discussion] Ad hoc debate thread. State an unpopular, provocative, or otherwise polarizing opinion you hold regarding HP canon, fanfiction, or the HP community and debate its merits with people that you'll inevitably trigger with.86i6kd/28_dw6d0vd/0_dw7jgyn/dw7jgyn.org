I think you overestimate how much the average teenager is willing to do to get out of a bad situation. And I think the point is that Harry /is/ average. When push came to shove, he did form the DA, learn the patronus, etc. He's just trying to live his life in the early books, and acting like many a young lad would have. People forget they were kids, and he was clueless about the world around him. It's only Hermione's bookish nature that meant she knew more about certain things or could find solutions. He was by all accounts a pretty traumatized, supershy boy who wasn't used to the attention he received, had forced himself to underperform so as not to draw attention to himself. I don't think protego and experliarimus are the only jinxes her learnt (there is a famous sectusempra once!) but I think he tended to stick to what he was good at. He has more of my sympathy than most characters.

And of course he's self-centred to some extent. He's a teenager.
