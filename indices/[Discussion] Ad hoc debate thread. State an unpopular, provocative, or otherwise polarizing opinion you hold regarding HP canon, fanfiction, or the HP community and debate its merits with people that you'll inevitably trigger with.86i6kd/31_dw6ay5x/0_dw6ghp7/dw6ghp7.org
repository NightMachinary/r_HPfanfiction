Right, I'll rise to that bait, Mr Fatno. You are right from a literary analysis standpoint that the canon magical system isn't /meant/ to make sense. But you seem to be missing a very important point: this is fanfiction. The original books were a commentary on British society, so what? Fanfiction doesn't have to be. Fanfiction is the land of what-ifs, whims and thought experiments; if an author thinks he has a story to tell with a codified magic system, and likes the challenge of beating the mess of canon magic into proper shape, why stop them? Purposefully ignoring something is very different from being unaware of it.
