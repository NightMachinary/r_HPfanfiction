  Hermione was, in fact, black

This, along with "Dumbledore was gay" and "there's at least one Jewish student at Hogwarts", is an attempt to inject more diversity into the series than actually exists there. It's not an invalid reading of the text, but the text does nothing to support it. It's a hollow, hypocritical gesture toward representation, trying to gather both the people who would be afraid of representation and the people who are asking for it.

I believe it's the Percy Jackson series where the author started out in the same boat as Rowling, but made representation explicit later on. That's a compromise position that actually contains representation.
