If you're trying to determine what is canon, then you should use Rowling's later statements.

If you want stories that depict gay people or Jewish people, a story where the author didn't explicitly say that every character was a straight gentile but also didn't depict anything related to homosexuality or Judaism won't satisfy.

Two different goals, two different metrics.
