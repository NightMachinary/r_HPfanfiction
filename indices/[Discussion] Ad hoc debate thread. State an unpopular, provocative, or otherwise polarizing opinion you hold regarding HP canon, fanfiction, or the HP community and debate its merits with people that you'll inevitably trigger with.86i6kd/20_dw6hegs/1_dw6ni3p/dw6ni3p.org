I'd be surprised if there wasn't at least one Jew at Hogwarts. How is that injecting diversity? Hermione could very well be black. Dumbledore could be gay. Statistically there are problem several homosexuals at Hogwarts. It's not injecting diversity to speculate.

I have a problem with people saying "hermione has to be black otherwise HP is racist," but speculation doesn't bother me.
