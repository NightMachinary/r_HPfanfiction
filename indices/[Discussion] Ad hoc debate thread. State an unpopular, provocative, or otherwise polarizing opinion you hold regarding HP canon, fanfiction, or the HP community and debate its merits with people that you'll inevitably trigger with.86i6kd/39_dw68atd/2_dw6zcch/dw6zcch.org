Reading fanfiction has never stopped me from reading literature, poetry, fantasy and scifi, fairy tales and folk lore, some British mysteries, monographs on art and certain eras of architecture, the history of silent film, the debate around Richard III - with the occasional children's book (like HP) thrown in.

So don't worry. If someone likes to read, believe me, they'll find a way to cram their interests in, no matter how little time they may have.
