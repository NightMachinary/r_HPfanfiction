No way! If I'm reading real literature I can't read all of my super edgy "Harry Potter" stories where he's a genius who needs to escape the manipulative machinations of an "Old Man" in order protect his group of female friends (and Neville) */cough/* harem */cough/* while he enacts a super secret but unstoppable plan to kill Lord Dudders all while amazing his peers and teachers come to appreciate how much bigger his di---magical core is compared to Malfoy, Dumbledore, and Lord Dudders!

This is the kind of stuff I live for, and you can't find this stuff in "real" literature.
