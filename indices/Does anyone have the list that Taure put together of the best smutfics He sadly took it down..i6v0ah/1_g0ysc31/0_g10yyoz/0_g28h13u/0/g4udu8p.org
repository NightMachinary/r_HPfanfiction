Taure never got back to me, and there's not much I can do without access to the source material. I /could/ write a general tool to assist in maintaining such lists, but I'd prefer to get in touch with one or more maintainers so I can figure out the requirements. That would also give me confidence that there's a demand. I don't mind doing the work, but only if people have a use for it.
