That's fair. Tell you what: I've got a bit of time on my hands, what with the lockdown and all. If you're willing to send me the latest version of the source doc, I'd be willing to write a script to automatically prune dead or relocated entries from it. I'd be happy to send you and back the cleaned up result - and script - so you don't have to bother with that busywork again.

If you're interested, send me a PM and I'll hand you an email address.
