  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know.\\
  Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group... WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
