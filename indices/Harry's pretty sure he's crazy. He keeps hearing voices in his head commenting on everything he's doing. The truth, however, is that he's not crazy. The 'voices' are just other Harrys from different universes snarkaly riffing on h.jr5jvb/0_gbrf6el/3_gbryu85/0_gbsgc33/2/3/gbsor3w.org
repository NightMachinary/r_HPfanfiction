fic is mostly what you've asked for- like multiple versions of harry's accross the harryverse, although not necessarily in a metatextual manner

oop :)

also @ glencoe or something, both are are somewhat distinct identities.

you could have a physically femme pretty drac or femme drac while being male or have a femme fem! drake or more masc/butch drake.

-or like you can have a pretty while male drake or a pretty with fem!drake

-what you choose to manifest as a result of these distinctions is up to you

[[/u/issuesandasexuals][u/issuesandasexuals]], while good you're intentions may be, i don't think [[/u/glencoe2000][u/glencoe2000]]'s actions necessarily reflect the intention what you're suggesting tho it may come off as exclusionary.

--and also while you do you @ issusesand, ya don't have to enforce you're view of transformative works on other. People are allowed to genderbend and while you may dislike the the het conversion of a slash paring people can like what they want w/out it being inherently homophobic or with homophobic intentions,

but yeah the starting thread is anti-gay with their /somewhat/ reasonable interpretation of harry's character :/

- tho like personally i am a bit partial to femslash versions of slash pairings.
