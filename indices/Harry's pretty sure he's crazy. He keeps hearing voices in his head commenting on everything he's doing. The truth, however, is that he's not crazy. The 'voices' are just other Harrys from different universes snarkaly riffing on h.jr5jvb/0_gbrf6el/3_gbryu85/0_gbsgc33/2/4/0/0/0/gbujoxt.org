Sure, that's â€˜wholesome af'.\\
I didn't mean to imply that this trope and anyone who write it are homophobic. I understand that there's many different reasons why someone might write this.\\
The original comment was meant to show my view on the trope, and why I don't read it. And don't appreciate someone saying I do, however implicitly. I wasn't trying to attack the person or their views or anyone at all.\\
I see how it could be taken that way, of course. It's just that my brain doesn't see it like that. Many only showing one side of the argument wasn't the best way to go about it, but I really don't like my box being bombarded by these comments.
