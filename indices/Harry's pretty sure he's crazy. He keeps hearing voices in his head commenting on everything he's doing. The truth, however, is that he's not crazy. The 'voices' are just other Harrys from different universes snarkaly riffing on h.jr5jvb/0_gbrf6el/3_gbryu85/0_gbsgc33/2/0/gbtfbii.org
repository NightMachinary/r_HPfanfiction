You are wrong. So, so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong. Why don't you stop thinking in such black, and white views story wise. Changing the gender of a character doesn't mean someone is homophobic. They could be exploring the different dynamics of a relationship(M/M, F/F, or M/F) based on the gender. I've read stories with straight pairings becoming gay pairings just to see how the story, characters, environmental atmosphere, etc... would change based on it.

Frankly I consider you to be homophobic based on how strongly you made this post based on a joke. Maybe you should look at yourself more, and judge others less.
