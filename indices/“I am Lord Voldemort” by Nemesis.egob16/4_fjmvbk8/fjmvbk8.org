Indeed! This definitely will always be one of the best HP fanfics out there. I read this way back around 15 years ago. Hahaha. My high school self back then thought this was legit canon that simply didn't make the cut. Lol. It was that awesome and believable. 👍🏻

I printed the whole thing and had it book bound cause I loved it so much and lent it out to fellow fans to share the love for the story.
