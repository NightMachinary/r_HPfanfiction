But Harry would have just been dead, not fine. The only reason he survived Voldemort's killing curse in the deathly hallows was because he was still tethered to life through Voldemort himself (who was still tethered by his connection to horocrux in Nagini). He had to sacrifice himself... it wasn't just Harry's death that fulfilled the prophecy... it was the martyrdom. He died so others could live. His sacrifice to save his friends had the same effect on them that his mother's death had on him; it formed a magical protection around them protecting them from Voldemort.
