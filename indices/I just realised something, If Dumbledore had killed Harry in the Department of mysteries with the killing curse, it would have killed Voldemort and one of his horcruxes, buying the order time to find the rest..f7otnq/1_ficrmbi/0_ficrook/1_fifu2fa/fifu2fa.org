If Voldemort lost his body a second time it wouldn't take long for him to be back. The reason it took so long the first time was because his followers all believed him to be dead. Now they know he can come back so they'll be more likely to find and help his spirit.

Not to mention Pettigrew knows exactly what to do to get his master back.
