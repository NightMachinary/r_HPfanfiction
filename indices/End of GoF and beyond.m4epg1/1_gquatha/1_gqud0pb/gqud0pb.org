  Does destroying a Horcrux reduce the power of its maker or is it an all/nothing situation?
#+end_quote

I think destroying the Horcruxes did diminish reborn Riddle, it's been a long time since I read the full book, but didn't Harry mention Riddle's thoughts feeling more erratic when he used the scarcrux in DH?

  What would have happened to the wraith if the diary Horcrux had succeeded? Does the wraith merge with Diary Riddle? Are they separate and then we have two Voldemorts after the ritual in the cemetery?

I want to read a fic from a DEs POV of two Riddles.
