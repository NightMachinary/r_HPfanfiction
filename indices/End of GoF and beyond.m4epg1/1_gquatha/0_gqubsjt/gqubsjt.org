  is the wraith his soul? I don't see how it can be given that he became a wraith via an AK and Voldemort's AK to Harry in the forest destroys the scar Horcrux

Idk, but he made Nagini a Horcrux before the ritual so there's /something/ there, right?

Edited because I accidentally posted.

I've had a thought before about the ritual using a Horcrux. I later decided /that/ one didn't because each of the other Horcruxes had a reaction to being destroyed in some way, but perhaps if he'd used a different ritual that did use a Horcrux, he might have returned looking more... whole.
