I think there is a lot left unanswered or that doesn't make sense about Horcruxes:

- would being 'reborn' through the ritual in GoF use up a Horcrux?
- What would have happened to the wraith if the diary Horcrux had succeeded?

  - Does the wraith merge with Diary Riddle?
  - Are they separate and then we have two Voldemorts after the ritual in the cemetery?

- is the wraith his soul? I don't see how it can be given that he became a wraith via an AK and Voldemort's AK to Harry in the forest destroys the scar Horcrux
- what is the relative strength of each Horcrux? Are they all equal or did they diminish in strength with each subsequent Horcrux?
- Does destroying a Horcrux reduce the power of its maker or is it an all/nothing situation?
