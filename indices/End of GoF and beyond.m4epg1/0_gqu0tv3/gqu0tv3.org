Voldemort himself calls Horcruxes his “anchors”, Slughorn said that “one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged”. If they are anchors tethering a soul to the Earth then it seems to follow, when all those anchors are destroyed (including Harry's scar, although it can be disputed, that it wasn't created correctly, because the ritual was interrupted by Voldemort's death), nothing tethers the soul to Earth and it is gone. Which makes me angry about all those time-travelling stories, where they repeat all Stations of the Canon for no reason whatsoever (in my opinion).
