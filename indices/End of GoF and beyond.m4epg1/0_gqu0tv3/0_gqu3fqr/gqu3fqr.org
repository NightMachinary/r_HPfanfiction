The 'he goes poof!' option. I lean towards that one too and had some serious think time to come up with an excuse where that didn't happen before realising it didn't matter. The DEs wouldn't know about the Scarcrux until after the GoF, which will lead to a frustrated conversation about what to do now because they aren't killing a kid and what about AKing the Dark Lord? It would give them time to figure out how to safely remove the Horcrux from the kid. And so on.
