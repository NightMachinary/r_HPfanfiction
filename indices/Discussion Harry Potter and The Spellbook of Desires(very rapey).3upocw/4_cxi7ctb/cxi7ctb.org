I honestly never thought of it that way. I felt like it was more of a way to have a plethora of characters fuck without character development or whatever. If the spelled characters were spelled to look like they didn't want to do it then I understand the rape fantasy position but for the most part they acted as if they wanted it. I mean officially it's rape but I don't think it was written by someone who enjoys rape. Or maybe it was.
