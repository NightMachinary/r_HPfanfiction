Sorry, I was just spinning off from your comment because I think fandom's use of concepts like dubcon and noncon to play with rape fantasy is an interesting way of marking how a reader might approach a fic. It's all technically rape, and it can be uncomfortable for a lot of people. But at least there's some attempt on fandom's part to find ways to talk about sexual fantasy, including the disturbing kind.
