If they have no autonomy over their own choices, it's rape, even if they're fictional characters.

Of course, in fandom we give ourselves room to indulge sexual fantasies and explore kinks, so the terms non-con and dub-con help distinguish between different kinds of fictional coercion and fantasy material. Most of the time, even non-con means "unrealistic treatment of a rape scenario."

Some people object to the terms, but I think they're useful as a way of reminding readers "depiction doesn't equal endorsement." Fiction is not reality. Fantasy (not genre fantasy, obviously, but id-wallowing) is not reality. Some writers are a little unclear on the concept, but those are individual cases.

Not that you could pay me to read this fic. But then, it's not my kink. And even if I did accept a bribe to read it, I would reserve the right to rant about it and do the equivalent of throwing it at the wall with extreme prejudice.
