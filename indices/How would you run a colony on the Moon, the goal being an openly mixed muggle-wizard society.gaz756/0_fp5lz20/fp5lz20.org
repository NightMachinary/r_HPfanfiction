If you can go to the moon with magic, going to Mars is just as easy as it only requires more energy but with magic that doesn't matter. Mars has better gravity and a 25 hour day. Changing the length of a day is much harder than just flying a little further.

So my moon colony would be on Mars instead. Or on an exoplanet far, far away if it's supposed to stay hidden from muggles for the next few centuries.
