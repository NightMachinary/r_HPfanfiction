Not quite what you asked for, but I'd recommend linkao3(209494).

It might not be your cup of tea, as it's Voldemort/MOD!Harry but it's not about romance iirc but more about MOD!Harry coming from a future where muggles killed the magical community, so they decide to move the magicals to the moon and hide them from non-magicals. It was a really intriguing plot and included a lot of technical details you mentioned in your post and it's really well-written, too.
