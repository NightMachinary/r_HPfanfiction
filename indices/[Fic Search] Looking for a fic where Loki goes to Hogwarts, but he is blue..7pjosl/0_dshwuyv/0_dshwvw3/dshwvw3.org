  Loki, de-aged and lost, wakes up in England. Well, he didn't know it was England, or maybe it was Scotland, he couldn't be sure since all he had to go on was a forest, a lake, a castle, a slightly cloudy sky and basically no knowledge of Midgard country names to go on but there was definitely something odd about the place. He could be imagining it in his slightly concussed and confused mind but somehow he didn't think owls carrying mail and children wearing robes were very common place not to mention the magic sticks.
