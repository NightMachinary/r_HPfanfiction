I don't think I have ever heard of this ship before. They are one of the most unlikely couples to happen in the entire fanfic community. They are totally different people. I'm not kidding. If she is a sweet fruit, he is not even a vegetable. He is a furniture. I have heard of Dobby/Dubledore/Dudley threesome but never Ron/Fleur.
