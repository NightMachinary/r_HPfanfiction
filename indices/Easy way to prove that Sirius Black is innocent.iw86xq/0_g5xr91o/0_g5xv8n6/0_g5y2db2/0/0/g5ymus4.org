Let's reword it then. That's a scene they added to the movies to emphasize the point that Lily was the driving force behind Snape's change of heart about serving Lord V. We all know he spared no thought for her husband or child. Showing Snape grieving Lily, holding her dead body, looks like an attempt to make him look more... human, for the lack of a better word.
