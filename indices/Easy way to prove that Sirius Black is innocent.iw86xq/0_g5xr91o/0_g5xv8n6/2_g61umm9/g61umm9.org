  Plus, I don't think the secret around Grimmauld place disappeared after Dumbledore died.

Two different scenarios. With Grimmauld, Dumbledore was the Secret Keeper, and when he died everyone who knew the Secret became a Keeper. The Secret was still intact. When Voldemort attack the Potters, the Secret was broken. Whatever it was, whether that they lived there or were hiding there, they weren't anymore because they were killed. So it doesn't matter whether the Secret Keeper is still alive or not, because the Secret no longer exists to keep.
