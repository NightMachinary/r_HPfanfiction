i thought it said that when the people under the charm die(as in all who know the secret) it unravels, but if the secret keeper dies like dumbledore did then everyone who knows the secret becomes the secret keepers. and i think moody and mcgonagall put up wards to deter snape since they still thought he had betrayed them.
