The easiest way would be for Sirius to go to the ICW headquarters and request a trial for "breaking" the statute of secrecy by blowing up a street full of muggles.

The ICW upholds the statute, so I posit that the ICW can hold trials for someone who breaks the statute if a member nation does not do one themselves.
