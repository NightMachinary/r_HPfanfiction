Only a few time travel stories. I kinda stumbled upon them by accident and found I liked them, though they're a little hard to search for.

I have 3 HP ones and one non-HP one. I mostly ship Harry/Ginny but am open to other things.

linkffn(6413108) - really interesting one where Snape's /mind/ is sent back to just before Harry starts at Hogwarts.

linkffn(4149763) - Not HP but a very interesting Naruto one.
