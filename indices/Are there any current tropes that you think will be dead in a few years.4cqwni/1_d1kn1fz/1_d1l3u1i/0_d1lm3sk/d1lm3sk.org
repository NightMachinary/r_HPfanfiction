I could pretty much write the story.

Harry suddenly realizes that Dumbeldore and/or the Weasleys are evil personified. He starts taking his life back. The goblins/Dursleys/Malfoys help him. He insults Dumbeldore who is stupid evil. There's ALWAYS a trunk scene.

Oh and it's always, always Harmony.
