I disagree. While older users will likely grow tired of them, hundreds enter HPfanfiction every year. To them, indy!Harry stories would likely be appealing, since it 1) Has Harry become much more active than his more passive canon counterpart and 2) has a completely different perspective of Dumbledore (albeit, a horrible one). Because of the constant supply of new users, I don't think indy!Harry is going anywhere for a while, sadly.
