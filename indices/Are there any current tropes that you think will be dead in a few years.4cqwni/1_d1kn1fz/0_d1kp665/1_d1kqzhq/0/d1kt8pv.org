I'm not against the idea of Indy!Harry in itself. I think most, if not all of us here want Harry to be much more ambitious and active than he was in canon, although I disagree with you that he was lame.

It's just that Indy!Harry is almost always associated with a lot of bad things, such as character bashing, author avatar/Gary!Stu, wish fulfillment, etc. When I meant Indy!Harry, I meant stories like Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny. (It's sort of like how the vocal, belligerent shippers became known as Harmonians, although it, at first, referred to H/Hr shippers in general).

Anyways, you've been around for a long time. Are there any personal favorites that you have? You've mentioned that it's done well a handful of times, and I'd love to hear which ones there are. Are there any that aren't as well known? I'd love to hear from you.
