I can't think of any that are dying. I mean, as long as people keep recommending stories like Lordwar's HP & the Summer of Change, a lot of the more common ones are going to stay around. People are still writing things like phoenix!Hedwig and using magical cores, and as much as I wish people will stop writing fics that are almost 100% identical to a thousand other fics, I don't think it's going to happen.
