I feel like downtrodden!goblins (did I do that right?) is either gone completely or at least on its way out.

Extreme Dursley abuse is in the same boat.

I don't really see much bashing pop up anymore tbh. I haven't seen Weasley(s) or Dumbledore bashed (or portrayed in a comically poor light) in a relatively recently posted fic in a while, outside of parodies ofc.

That said, maybe I've just avoided (luckily) seeing any new stories with those tropes.
