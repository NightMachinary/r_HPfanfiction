I literally just finished reading Delenda Est and it was one of my favorite all time fanfics now. I had never read or had the inclination to read Harry/Bellatrix before but I just stumbled across this story. The idea seemed intriguing, it had time travel and dimension travelling which I had recently come to enjoy stories about so I thought i would give it a try, not expecting much and not sure how Harry and Bellatrix would mash. I strongly recommend this story to all. It has a powerful Harry buy not as ridiculous as some I've seen, it has a slowly building romance, awesome new spells and lots of political intrigue that isn't overdone. It was a long story but not once did I get tired of it. I would have read it in one sitting if I had the time. If anyone decides to give it a shot let me know what you think.
