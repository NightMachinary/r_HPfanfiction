Try some Slytherin!Harry!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]: this one has has the Slytherin dynamics that I think you're looking for, and Harry trying to blend in. It's extremely well-written and I think one of the best fics out there. Also a pretty realistic approach to Harry in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/6/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]]: this one is a little more OOC (in my opinion) but features a mainly Slytherin cast. There's one very long fic per year at Hogwarts and Year 6 is currently in the works.
