Opened the thread expecting to see [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][Sacrifices Arc]] already recommended. A major problem with this story is that its manipulative characters (Dumbledore, Lily) are supposed to be clever and cunning too, but are riding from one Idiot Ball to another so often that being idiots can't even be called OoC for them.

Try also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology,]] which showcases slytherin!Hermione but has only 120k words so far to offer.
