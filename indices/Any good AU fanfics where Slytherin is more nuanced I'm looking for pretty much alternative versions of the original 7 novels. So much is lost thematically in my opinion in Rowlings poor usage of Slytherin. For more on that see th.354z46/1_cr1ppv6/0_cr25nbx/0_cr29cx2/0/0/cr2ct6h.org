I'd say this story is a 6/10 -- 7/10-ish read --- if you have neither overrated expectations about it nor qualms about skipping large chunks of text.

On your first point --- you have to consider that the story is being told from Harry's perspective, so when, for instance, the narrator says something like the highlighted “Of course he was essentially good.”, all it does is give you /Harry's/ opinion on things --- it doesn't convey a universal truth about this world where all people going to Gryffindor have to be “good” 100% of the time.

Your second point of criticism is much more valid, unfortunately. The author added /multiple/ additional prophecies into the story and s/he also was more interested in the angst/relations aspect of it than overall robustness of plot development. Because of this, and maybe author's partial laziness, there are many cases when you just want to take something nasty and smack the protagonist(s) on the face with it because of how ridiculously retarded decisions they are managing to make, so that the story will progress in the direction its author wants it to.

Overall, I'd say stay away from it if you have something else to read, but I'd also suggest giving it a try if it has something that you're looking for or if you're out of interesting things to read.
