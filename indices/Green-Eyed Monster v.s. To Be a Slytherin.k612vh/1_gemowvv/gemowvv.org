They are the same flavors of a similar idea. But accusing the authors of plagiarism is frankly insulting. Both of them copy tons of ideas from canon. There is a large amount of divergence in the DH plot. TBS is fundamentally more optimistic than GEM and has a better/longer epilouge-arc with better endings for everyone involved while GEM reads like a tragedy. Lorena and Audrey are very different characters and so is everyone in Slytherin. GEM diverges more from canon and has more original ideas while TBS has better pacing with symmetrical OC's who build on canon themes.

Lorena is closer to her brother and has a less tragic story arc than Audrey. TBS covers pre-hogwarts time and time spend at Dursleys in between school better than GEM which skips it too fast.

The biggest difference for me though is the extra muggle OC Amity Raincrow in TBS. Her characterization is done nicely with an original backstory and a side fic. The Snape arc in TBS is a lot better than the one in GEM because of her.
