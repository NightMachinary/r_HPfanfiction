Never did I say in my post that there was plagiarism. You can go and check for yourself. I only ever said that the storyline and main character were too similar for my comfort. I was irritated that people were commenting that GEM was too like TBS when it was published first. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. I personally found the beginning of TBS too unrealistic to get through and the similarities of Lorena to Audrey a deterrent to me continuing to read it. Who know maybe one day I will decide to skip the first 20 chapters and find that I enjoy the story just as much as GEM. But for now I am definitely turned off. The least the author of TBS could do is say that they were inspired by GEM like many other authors of other fan fictions have done before (I am referencing the success of Dreaming of Sunshine, a Naruto SI fanfic that revitalized the genre and inspired a whole new era of SI fanfics for that fandom, most authors credited Dreaming of Sunshine as their inspiration). I also slightly doubt the author never read GEM as it was a leading Draco/OC fanfic on FF.net for ~3/4 years. But also maybe they didn't I really don't know.
