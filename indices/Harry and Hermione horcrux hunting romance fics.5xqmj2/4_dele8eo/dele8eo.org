I think this is a trope waiting for a good story.

The two examples given are both awful. In one, it's the standard "we both loved each other all along" thing, and the other is "we were both potioned". Utter trash.

Tbh, the best thing I've read on this topic is a throwaway scene in Vitam Paramus where Harry tells Gabrielle about him sleeping with Hermione. It's almost irrelevant to the story but still gives a better reason for it happening than these two stories dedicated to the topic!
