Actually, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), qualifies. Although they were not officially a couple in this story, it wouldn't take much for them to become one by the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/5/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290), also has them hunt horcruxes together after Year 5.
