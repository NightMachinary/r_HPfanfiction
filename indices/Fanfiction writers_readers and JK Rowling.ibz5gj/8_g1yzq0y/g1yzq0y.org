As a writer, I have a generally positive view of J.K. Rowling. The overall plot structures of the /HP/ books are more than questionable, but she undoubtedly knows how to write a page-turner, and imbue her characters with a certain depth and likability; I also take a kinder view of her worldbuilding than many; it was never meant to be realistic and it is not, but not all great worldbuilding has to be in the "plausible alternative history that meticulously accounts for how the economy of centaur commodities works" category. The /HP/ universe is a deftly-brushed fantasy land that provides a backdrop for, as fanfiction demonstrates, a nearly-infinite array of possible stories, and that's got to mean something.

When it comes to what she's done with /HP/ since the release of the final books, she's as much derided here as anywhere else, especially because as fanfiction-writers, we know how it's done and are all the more able to make fun of some of her decision for the Potterverse's future --- because we /are/ able to put our money where our mouth is, and not only criticize what she did, but show the world how to do better. That being said, personally, I find the whole thing generally harmless. There are stupid decisions in her latest additions to the canonical Potterverse, sure. But there were stupid decisions in the books too, and there are some good ideas in the new material, as well. (I /like/ the eldritch Trolley Witch, dammit!)

As a person, though? Blergh. Blergh, blergh, *blergh*. Now, I don't hate her or anything, and her attitude towards fanfiction is certainly praiseworthy, so especially on this subreddit, I feel like I do have to give her props for /that/.

But... even /before/ she decided to make being awful to trans people on Twitter her new favorite hobby, there were undercurrents to her public persona which annoyed me immensely. Her tendency, once she got onto writing Book 5 or so, to believe she was writing some sort of philosophically complex masterpiece with Things To Say about Deep Topics, was certainly one of them, insofar as she had very little to back it up save making some trite parallels between her villains and the Nazis. Which isn't exactly the height of complexity. Besides that, her idea of moral complexity consists of washed-up Christian aphorisms, including some really quite poisonous ideas about courage vs. cowardice and about the topic of death. I would hesitate to give children of mine the later /HP/ books unless I had a long talk with them about taking a lot of the narrator and heroes' moral opinions with a Mount Everest-sized grain of salt.
