I find her eagerness to court political controversy quite sad, particularly when it comes in the form of attacking and mocking a minority community that is literally smaller than the number of followers she has on twitter. And her insistence on playing the victim is really quite pathetic.

That said, I'll always hold a small spot in my heart for the fact that she created the HP series, which helped me get through some extremely dark times as a teenager. She gave me a safe place to escape to every day. And I will always be thankful for that.

I believe firmly that you can appreciate the output of an artist without liking or supporting the artist or their views. Particularly when it comes to fan works, I have no issue continuing to appreciate and enjoy the HP world despite Rowlings views. I'll hesitate to spend money on things that send the money back to her in the future. I imagine I'll only watch future films when I can get them second hand for example.
