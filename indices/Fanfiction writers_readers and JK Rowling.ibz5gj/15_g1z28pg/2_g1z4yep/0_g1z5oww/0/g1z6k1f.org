Sorry, this is just a link that says that primates have sex differences. It's very distant from JKR's actual claims and her actual viewpoint! Unfortunately, this is particular study is like using quantum mechanics to explain water condensation--technically relevant, but not useful to the conversation! Do you have any sources that speak specifically to humans and gender?
