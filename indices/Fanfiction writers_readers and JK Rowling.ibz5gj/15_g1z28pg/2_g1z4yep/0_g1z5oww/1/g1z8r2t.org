this is complete pseudoscience.

you're linking one review paper by one author in a journal called /"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences"/ which deals with *primate* sex roles in a way that is as conjecture as it is evidence-based, and that has no relevance at all to the question being asked. it's an incomplete theoretical model! as the author themselves explains.

did you read the paper? would you be willing to tell me what relevance it has to proving that JKR is right about trans people?

scientific consensus is vastly against TERF claims.
