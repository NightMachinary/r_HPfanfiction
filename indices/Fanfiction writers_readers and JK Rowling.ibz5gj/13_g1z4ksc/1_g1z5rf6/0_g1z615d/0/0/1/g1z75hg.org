This is hilarious.

Edit to elaborate: In the past, racist people and racist scientists used scientific research to explain and justify why white people were superior. That practice was racist and wrong. Your citing of this barely relevant scientific research about how animal sex behaviors change when animal populations of a certain sex rise or fall to try to support your “disagreement” with the existence of trans humans is transphobic in exactly the same way.
