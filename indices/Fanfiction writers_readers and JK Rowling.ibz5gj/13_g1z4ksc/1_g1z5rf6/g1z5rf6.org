Hey bud! Since you deleted your other comment, I'm going to post my reply here. In your post, you brought up the point that accepting trans people would cause “sliding degeneracy” and that INCELs and pedophiles also say that they want “human rights” (which I guess by that you mean their “human right” to rape people? Which is not a human right.) Here is my reply:

INCELs and pedophiles are rapists. They actively hurt people by acting out their sexual fantasies. Their perceived “right” to act as they would like to infringes on other people's right to not be raped. This is obviously not okay.

Who do trans people harm by being trans? Other than your feelings?
