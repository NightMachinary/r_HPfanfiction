Personally, I don't give a toss. I hold the author and the work separate and, while I might not agree with her opinions, I don't allow that to affect my enjoyment of her work. I do think she's been overly villainised for some poorly-expressed thoughts, I guess in part because she's such a prominent figure. For example, with the TERFism, I'm 50/50 because I kind of understand the point I think she was trying to make, but she did it very poorly and I equally understand how people who are stigmatised in that way would be offended. Without being inside her head, it's impossible to know. All the hate for e.g. Cho Chang's name is utterly ridiculous imo. It minimalises the impact of the genuinely potentially problematic issues (again, the TERFism) by creating a fuss out of a complete non-issue.

tl;dr: JKR has some thoughts I don't agree with, but I think she has been turned into a villain for lite reason. I keep my opinion of her opinions separate from my enjoyment of her work and I still love Harry Potter regardless of what she says.
