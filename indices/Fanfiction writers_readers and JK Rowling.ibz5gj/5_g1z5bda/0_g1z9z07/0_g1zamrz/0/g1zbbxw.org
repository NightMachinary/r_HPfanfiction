Because it's tough to separate the author's opinion from the work, sometimes. It's one thing when the author isn't really present (eg - classic books where the author is deceased), but when they're still here and making very public remarks it can color everything.

As another example, I found it a lot harder to enjoy Orson Scott Card's books when I found out his real life views. It made me reconsider certain aspects of his books, put things into a new light even within the things I'd previously enjoyed - on top of making it harder to want to support him (which buying/consuming/discussing his works does).

Sometimes it's easy to divorce the author and the books. Other times... It's not.
