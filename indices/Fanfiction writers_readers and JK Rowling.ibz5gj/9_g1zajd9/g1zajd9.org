Honestly it boggles my mind that she wastes her time arguing with people on Twitter when she is a millonaire. I don't understand why she doesn't just amuse herself with her money and keeps her opinions to herself. It's ridiculous that she's trying to imply she's a victim of 'cancel culture' when she was the one that started posting hateful things in the first place. Maybe she thinks she is some kind of political rolemodel because of all the attention and status she's gotten from Harry Potter, but she is not. She needs to put her phone down asap.

I'll always love Harry Potter, however, this debacle with JK Rowling has definitely woken me up to problematic aspects of the universe.
