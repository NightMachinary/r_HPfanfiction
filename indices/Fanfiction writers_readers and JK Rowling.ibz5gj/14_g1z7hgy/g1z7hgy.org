Couldn't care less. I don't do the twitter thing and honestly writers should stick to what they're good at. I don't like writers spouting off on their political opinions regardless of whether I agree or not, it just seems like a cheap use of one's platform. Being a good writer does not make one an expert in other fields nor an automatic authority about anything except writing.
