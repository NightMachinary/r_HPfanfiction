My feelings towards JKR are a combination of (1) ongoing respect and (2) frustration.

*Ongoing Respect*

Ongoing respect because I still think that what JKR did with the HP series is amazing, and it remains fresh and original and so captivating in comparison to pretty much everything else in the fantasy genre to this day.

There have been some post-DH creative missteps for sure, but I think many of these have been overblown by the fandom, often deliberately from a position of malice - people who want to tear down rather than build. I am not a particular fan of the Cursed Child (having both read it and seen the play live), but I think the way people have reacted to it has largely departed from cool headed rationality. I often feel quite embarrassed by the lack of moderation and respect in the behaviour of my fellow fans on this front.

Similarly, reactions to some of her HP-related Tweets seem to come from a place of malice. The Tweet that pre-plumbing, wizards would relieve themselves where they stand and vanish it has been deliberately misrepresented by a certain section of the fandom intent on destroying anything JKR produces. I think it's clear that (i) JKR was specifically referring to urination ("relieve themselves"), (ii) she didn't mean to imply that they did it in front of other people ("where you stand" does not imply in company, it merely implies that there is not a specific location you go to do it), and (iii) they would still "unzip" first.

Yet the malicious fandom has deliberately turned it into "wizards shit their pants".

It's still a regrettable addition to the universe (if JKR had thought about it a bit longer, she would know that plumbing has a long history and that it's perfectly plausible that wizards would have had it in the year 1000). But it's nowhere near as bad as people portray it to be and I do find myself irritated every time fans deliberately misrepresent it.

On the whole, I would say that 90% of the worldbuilding elements JKR has added to the HP universe post-DH have been good. That's not too bad a record.

*Frustration*

The frustration comes from the fact that I feel like JKR is wasting her talents in terms of the projects she chooses to engage in.

JKR's talent is writing novels. Specifically, writing genre fiction: mystery/adventure novels. And her greatest brainchild is the HP universe. That's a once-in-a-lifetime idea.

Yet she seems intent on spending her creative energies on projects that are outside her principal talents. Ill-advised attempts at literary fiction. Within the HP universe, average movies, poorly considered plays, and web content that was originally supposed to be an HP encyclopedia and just became a short article on a random topic once a year. None of these play to JKR's strengths and all of them disappoint because of that.

The Fantastic Beasts movies are... fine. I like the visuals, I like the worldbuilding and magic. The characters are... okay. The plot is meh. But what is absolutely clear to me is that these stories would have been infinitely better if they had been written as novels.

I remain of the view that JKR, if she sat down and wrote some novels in the HP universe, could still knock it out of the park. Certain worldbuilding elements in the FB movies show that she still has that magic worldbuilding touch. But for whatever reason, she refuses to do so. And that's frustrating.

As for her political views, she is certainly entitled to her viewpoint and entitled to promote that viewpoint if she so wishes. I do find it regrettable, however, that she uses her time in this way rather than remaining focused on creative endeavours. I don't want to speculate too much of her personal life, but I can't help but feel that constantly getting into political arguments with strangers on the internet (and on the cesspit that is Twitter, no less) cannot be JKR living her best life.
