I think ever since DH came out, JKR has been struggling with the idea that nothing she ever does is going to eclipse Harry Potter. She's been doing everything she can to get away from the franchise that is by far is her best work.

That's entirely understandable. I can only imagine how it must feel to be the most successful author of all time and still be the recipient of endless sneers about how you've only ever written children's/genre fiction. The desire to produce something that would establish her as an author who can do more than just Harry Potter is entirely understandable.

But the thing is... it's failed. It's been over a decade now, and pretty much all her post-HP projects have not gone well. I think it may be time for JKR to make peace with the fact that she is "the Harry Potter woman" and, instead of trying to escape it, double down on it and give the people what they want: full length, properly crafted (and professionally edited) novels set within the Harry Potter universe.
