Harry Potter was such a huge part of my childhood, I will always love it for what it is. I can't deny though that I am massively disappointed by J.K. Rowling. It was quite a let down that the woman who gave us Hermione Granger turned out to become Pansy Parkinson in the end. I still hope she digs herself out of this hole of bigotry she has descended into.

Doesn't change that I love Harry Potter. Tolkien was a conservative catholic even for his time, yet I love every single page of his legendarium. I don't have to agree with an artist on everything to enjoy their art, especially since Harry Potter is completely free of the views she has recently begun to espouse.
