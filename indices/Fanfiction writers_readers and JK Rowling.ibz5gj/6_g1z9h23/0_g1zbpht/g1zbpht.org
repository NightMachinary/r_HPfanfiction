I feel just about the same way as you do.

For a lot of my childhood, I felt like I existed more in the books than I did in my real life. It was a massive part of my life and this has been a huge let down. I still love Harry Potter, but now, I do not love or support J. K. Rowling. I actively consume fan fiction and I would buy fan made merchandise, but I don't give her my money anymore. I know this doesn't hurt her in any way, and this isn't my goal- I just do not want to support a person who, at best, dog whistles support for people who hate people like me.
