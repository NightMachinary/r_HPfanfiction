Pottermore. But the Lexicon [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/animagus-3/][summarizes it well.]] "Fiery pain" and the first transformation is "painful and frightening," but gets easier with time.

I think also it's worth noting that Skeeter, Sirius and Pettigrew all would have huge incentives to change form if it were easily done, and in terms of emotional upheaval, I'd also think what Sirius went through would count. So the form seems fairly static to me.

But it's a fan fiction, so room for creativity!

Perhaps it's not simple upheaval so much as an altered self-image, as the form is a reflection of your nature. Say if, for example, Peter had taken the form of a lion but still betrayed his friends and felt any guilt, a rat might then be more appropriate and he'd shift.
