I'm not saying he lives as a Muggle. I'm implying that, to the reporter who tracks him down, he bears no resemblance to Harry Potter, the legendary boy wizard who vanquished the evil dark lord Voldemort. Harry's simply not using magic all that much. Harry would never go full-muggle. Not with the life he had. The Weasleys' reaction is not overt. They don't shut him out overnight. But they end up drifting apart.
