Well, I kind of had this idea that everyone else would be keen to have their own lives rather than keep going after that one friend who wants to be left alone. I went to college too, and at the end of our courses my friends and I also swore that we'd be in touch, that we'd be friends, and that we'd be there for each other no matter what. But, I don't know where half of them are and what they're up to!! It's not exactly shutting someone out, per se, but your own life gets in the way.

But, introspecting here, it's kind of a big thing they were in together - engineering the downfall of Voldemort. I guess they wouldn't completely forget Harry, but the few who are aware of his whereabouts would respect his wishes to be left alone.

and why is a reporter wanting to cook up a story not plausible? Chernobyl happened in the eighties, and aren't reporters still interested in it? If there is a chance of a story, big or small, you can be sure of a reporter wanting to sniff it out.
