This is really [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511): Only it's not some OC press woman, but Hermione finding him. Honestly, I hate the idea of introducing OC here. Harry has enough established hardcore female followers/friends so they should be the first candidates to look out for him.

Why not Ginny who gave up her promising Quidditch career to find her love?

Why not Hermione who gave up her promising Ministry position to find her best friend?

Why not Luna who now searches for both Crumpled-Horned Snorkack and Harry?

Heh, even Katie Bell searching for her leader and savior is more plausible than some press woman OC!
