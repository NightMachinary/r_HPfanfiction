I really like this, I would love for this to be a thing I would read that right now. I love the angst and hardships that everyone goes through because happy is boring for me. I want to see some dark stuff happen because that never really happens in books; where the bad guy wins or the hero's in the story don't get their happy ending: this right here is so much more interesting for me because you could do so much more to the characters if they didn't win in the end. What would they do if they were faced with this much failure? How could they go on with their life? Because the books don't go into this kind of detail that you made right here because they are the heroes they have to have their happy ending after so much death and destruction. But what if they don't...?
