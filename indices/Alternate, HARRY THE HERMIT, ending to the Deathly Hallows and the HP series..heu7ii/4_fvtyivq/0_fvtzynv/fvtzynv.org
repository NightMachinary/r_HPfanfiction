Thanks! I might just try to write and expand it. I've got some ideas. This thing's stemming from my desire to see an alternate, realistic ending that echoes real life. I don't know if you've heard of the epic Mahabharata? The good guys and the bad guys (who are actually cousins) fight a war for the kingdom. Just when the good guys think they've routed the bad guys and won a great victory, a survivor from the bad guys' side sets their camp on fire, killing all their children, their kinsmen and everyone who had fought for them. So the good guys are left with a vast kingdom and riches, but no friends and family to enjoy it with. As a Hindu, I've always known that life usually finds a way to screw with you. That's the norm.
