It was not my intention to portray Ron in a negative light, but canon-wise, it's always been Ron who has been fond of luxury and comfort. So it made sense in my head that he would be most embittered if he were prevented from leading a happy, comfortable life with the girl he loved. Also, it's not technically bashing Ron. He simply gets sidelined as usual. It's the case of people talking about the splendid jacuzzi and the amazing modular kitchen in a newly built house and not paying any mind to the solid foundation without which the house and all its rooms would have come down like sticks. Ron has always been the foundation for Harry. It's not a glamorous feature, but an essential one. Unfortunately, the press doesn't want that.
