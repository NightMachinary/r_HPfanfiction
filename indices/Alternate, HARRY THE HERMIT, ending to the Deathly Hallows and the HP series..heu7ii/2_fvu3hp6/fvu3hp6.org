Sorry, but I'm a sucker for happy endings. (Not that the characters shouldn't work extra hard to get them.) Real-life has plenty of bad endings- just turn on the news. Or visit [[/r/MorbidReality][r/MorbidReality]] if you're mentally stable and brave enough. So I like happy endings in books, movies, tv shows, etc. The characters should struggle and maybe get a bit tortured or maimed or even killed along the way. But in the end, the good guys have to win.

I can understand Harry leaving Brittain but maybe for New Zealand or the USA? He can always get help from a psychiatrist. Or find a new friend or love interest. Or get attacked by a new villain. I don't know if you watched them, but a few years ago Nolan made a trilogy of Batman movies that were pretty popular. So between the second and third movies, several years pass in which Batman is gone and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But he eventually comes out again and by the end even regains some sort of... normalcy.

My point is that life goes on. Harry living indefinitely on the North Pole seems incredibly depressing and sad. I suppose he could do it for a few years and /then/ start the fic with someone finding Harry and forcing him to come back to the world. Actually, come to think of it this fic has a similar plot. But since it's not a request thread I'll just copy the link instead of using the bot. Harry drifts away from his friends after the battle and becomes an alcoholic and Draco of all people has to save him.
