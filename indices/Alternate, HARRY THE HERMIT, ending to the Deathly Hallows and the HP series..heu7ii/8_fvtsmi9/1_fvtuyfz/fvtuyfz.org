I'm not bashing any of the Weasleys. I'm just saying that they become overwhelmed by grief and just sink into their own cocoon. With the exception of Ron, no one else is concerned about fame or credit. I know this person who was in an accident. The bike he had been riding with his friend crashed. He survived and his friend didn't. His friend's parents didn't exactly blame him for the accident, but they didn't want his sympathies either. They didn't want his visits. They didn't want anything to do with him. This incident factored into my thinking.
