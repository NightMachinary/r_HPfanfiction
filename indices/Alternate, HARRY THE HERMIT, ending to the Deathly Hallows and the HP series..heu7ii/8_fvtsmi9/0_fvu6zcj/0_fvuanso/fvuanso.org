Yes. It sounds realistic. It makes sense that neither Harry nor Hermione would abandon Ron. But her injury and his perceived sorry state make him a difficult person to deal with/be around. Plus, there is also the fact that Harry and Hermione themselves are not immaculate, emotionally/psychologically speaking. Hermione was tortured, FFS, and Harry willingly walked to towards his death. He stared at an Avada Kedavra curse right in the face. There's going to be PTSD, and a lot of it. The concept that I have here is all of them experiencing some form of trauma and none of them being able to care for the other and heal the other. Which is why they go their separate ways.
