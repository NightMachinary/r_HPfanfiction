I am picturing a ron missing a leg who hobbles arround in constant pain falling to alcoholism for the pain

you could something like ron jumped in front of a curse for harry's sake and then the media and minstry completely ignores his heroics

Harry basically pays for his friends living which makes ron bitter that he is so helpless that he basically needs harry to survive

Ron tries to put on a brave face for harry.

you could make a really good story where harry and hermione try to save ron from himself

Hermione does love him but due to the pain and Injuries and the fact he see's himself as a useless cripple he belives the media lies
