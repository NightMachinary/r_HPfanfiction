Yeah, well, okay. It does make sense that Molly Weasley wouldn't cut Harry off completely. But, she grieves for Fred first. As a mother who has lost her son, she takes her time to grieve and come to terms with it. Harry himself, on the other hand, is burdened by survivor's guilt. He blames himself. He feels tainted that by his association, the Weasleys have suffered a lot. He perceives Molly and Arthur's less than warm feelings (brought on as a result of the war and not necessarily because of him) towards him as something innately hostile and distances himself from them. Its a case of people not communicating properly.
