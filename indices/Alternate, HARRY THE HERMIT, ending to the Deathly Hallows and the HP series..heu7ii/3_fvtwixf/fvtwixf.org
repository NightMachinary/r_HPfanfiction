As depressing as it is, I can see most of this happening (though I wouldn't want to read something so hopeless- I need my happy endings), but one thing that doesn't seem justified is the Weasley family distancing themselves from Harry. I understand why Ron does in this scenario, and I imagine that George would be pushing everyone away, but why would Molly and Arthur do it too? Do they blame Harry for Fred's death? It's not like he took a bullet for Harry, and I can't see them pushing away a young man that Molly has referred to as "as good as her son".
