Yeah, I'm not going to force myself through several million words of writing just to feel a bit of satisfaction. As I recall I've always given up part way through because the whole thing slows right down.

As with all big fanfic series, its in great want of some hefty editing. The author could accomplish the same plot more effectively, in 2/3 the number of words if it was well edited.

As it is, I think a lot of authors try to get the highest word count they can rather than trying to write effectively.
