He gradually grows up after making a series of realizations. By the end of the story he still an asshole, but he knows he's an asshole and realizes it's just the person he is. He's not AS whiny and actually helps Harry get through a lot of struggles with being a normal, well-adjusted human. Harry's development is way more frustrating because he was raised to believe he was a guardian and sacrifice for his brother (the boy who lived). Lily and Dumbledore molded him into this weaponized child because of an irrational fear that he'd become a dark lord and the whole story is focused around his coming to grips with what it means to live for yourself and your own choices.
