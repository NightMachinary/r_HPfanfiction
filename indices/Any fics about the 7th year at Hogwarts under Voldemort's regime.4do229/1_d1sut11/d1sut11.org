I've never even heard of Not From Others, though I have it open in another tab as I write this and will be checking it out immediately. The fic that stands out to me as the best DH Hogwarts fic is linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness by Thanfiction). This is one of my favorite fics of all time, and a true classic of HP fanfiction.
