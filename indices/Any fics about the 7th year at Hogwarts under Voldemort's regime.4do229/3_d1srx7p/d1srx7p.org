[[/u/SchroedingersKneazle]] is absolutely correct in saying that Not From Others is stellar - that's my go-to as well.

Another couple of fics that I really enjoyed were A Call To Arms by MyDearProfessorMcGonagall and While You Were Gone by jcooks2010. Both are darker, but also great stories, very well written, and both pull at you.
