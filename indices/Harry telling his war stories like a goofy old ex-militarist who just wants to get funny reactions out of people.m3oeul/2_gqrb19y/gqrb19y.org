"Closest I ever came to dying without actually dying? Well, no one seems to believe my Jesus impersonation story."

Ron had to cut in here at that comment.

"You know it would help your story if you didn't refer to it like that?"

Harry shrugged his shoulders, probably but then it would take the fun out of it. He looked at the pub filled with DA members and Hogwarts Battle Alumni. They were the ones wanting stories, he was making sure he had fun as well.

"Okay, this ghost thingy of Voldemort from before he died, the first time, or the second, or the last time. It was standing there laughing at me as I was dying rapidly of Basilisk poison. Huge fang, bigger than my hand, stuck right in my shoulder. So, laying there, dying, about to reach the pearly gates, I yank that bitch out and stab his ass with it. Boom! Second time I killed his ass right there!"

Ron groaned as he saw Hermione take a pull from her drink, an action Ginny was following along with. Of all the ways to describe an epic battle of a millennia-old basilisk against the soul of Voldemort possessing his sister, that would not be one he would ever suggest.

Draco was better but he was still a Gryffindor in snakes clothing so he of course had to comment.

"No one survives basilisk venom Potter. Come up with a better lie next time."

Harry had been waiting and replied right away.

"No one survives the Killing Curse either, but here I am. Malfoy, it's magic."

With that, he finally got to start his prank he had set up. He had spent nearly a day layering compulsion charms and enchantments just for this one bit.

The assembled crowd of people began dancing in step together and singing along.

The look on nearly everyone's face as they realized he had pranked them all was priceless.
