Harry watch the Express leaving for school and nod to his livelong rival. He chuckled when his brain made the connection, remembering how in his First Year he helped calming a friend of Hagrid before accepting a job in Ilvermony, now a respected Headmaster there. Aside from being chased by Karkaroff in a really weird First Task (Spell-tag against other school's headmaster? Who even came up with that?), he also got transfigured into a galleon, unknowingly carried out from Gringott by the visiting Headmaster of Uagadou. Thankfully Hermione's spell automatically cancel the spell once the headmaster took a drink, it would be awkward to stay like that forever.

Maybe Luna is right, his life does seems to run on a theme, his friendly rivalry with Dean Thomas has started since he first meet him at Madam Malkin's fitting room. But, what if the first magical of his year he met was Lavender, would he become a botanist or potion master? Suddenly he shudders, what if he had met Malfoy?
