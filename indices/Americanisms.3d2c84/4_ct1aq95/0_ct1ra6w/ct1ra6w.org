I was reading Made In American by Bill Bryson, all about how the English language changed both in the UK and in the US from when the US was colonized and how they languages are so different not, and 'block' was explained as an Americanism to mean "blocks of housing that were connected" (a side effect of lots of people moving into the same area in a short amount of time), and then it eventually came to mean the area within four intersecting streets.

The more you know.
