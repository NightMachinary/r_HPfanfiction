Towns and cities in Britain aren't really built on anything resembling a grid system. Taking four rights or lefts /might/ take you back to where you started, but it's more likely it won't. Especially nowadays when it's quite possible that you'll run afoul of a one-way system (our inner city roads are much narrower and so many side roads have been made one-way).
