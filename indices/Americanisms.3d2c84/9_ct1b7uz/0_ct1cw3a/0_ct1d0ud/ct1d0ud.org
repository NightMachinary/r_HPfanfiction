It was slang for cigarettes long before it became a homosexual slur. It's the same thing with using gay to describe happiness i.e. "My what a gay evening" it doesn't mean the evening is homosexual, it means it's nice/happy.

Faggot also means a bunch of sticks tied together, and faggots and mash is an English dish consisting of pork mince moulded into balls and served with mashed potatoes and gravy.
