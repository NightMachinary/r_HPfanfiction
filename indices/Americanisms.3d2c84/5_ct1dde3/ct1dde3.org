Metric measurement is one. Every single book in the series uses feet, inches, miles, etc. That isn't done just for the U.S. editions, this is Bloomsbury as well. Harry's wand is eleven inches, Great Hangleton and Little Hangleton are 6 miles apart and Quidditch goals are fifty feet high. While centimeters, meters and kilometers aren't technically incorrect, they're just not what the books use and when so when I come across one, I'm reminded that I'm not reading the real thing.

Starkers means naked. It does not mean insane as in "stark raving mad." I've read more than one fic where the author has made this mistake.
