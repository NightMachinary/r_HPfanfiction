It's worth pointing out that /real/ Britain is pretty schizo when it comes to units.

When you're travelling long distances you use miles. If you're travelling short distances you'll either use yards or meters (depending on age).

Heights of people and mountains are measured in feet (and inches) while similarly sized objects will be measured in meters, cm and mm (for example, a table or tall building). However some things are still measured in inches for historical reasons.

When cooking ounces and pounds are still relatively widespread though in recent years there has been more of a transition to metric.

Basically, I don't think a British Muggle would bat an eyelid at the use of imperial measures in wizarding society. It's already so muddled that I didn't notice anything strange when I was reading the books.
