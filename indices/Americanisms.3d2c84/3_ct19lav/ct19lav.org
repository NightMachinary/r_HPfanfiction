- Tattle, tattling or tattle tale.- Grass, Grassing up, telling on someone.
- Bangs- Fringe
- Huh- This can sound really American.
- Those American mailboxes on sticks outside- We don't have them.
- Highschool age characters driving- You don't see this a lot in HP, but I have seen a few fics where muggleborn/muggle teenagers drive around everywhere despite the fact that you can't get a full driving license until you are 18 in the UK.
- The Dursleys being too mean to pay for Harrys glasses/injections etc- We have NHS, so no medical bills like that.
- Shots- Injections/jabs
- Not really an Americanism, but I saw a fic once that claimed a quiche was called a kings pie in England. I've never heard that term before and unless it's some weird regional slang, it's not true.
- Hose- Tights
- Suspenders- Braces. Suspenders in UK are what you use to hold stockings up.
- Damn being treated like a swear word. Outside of primary school, no one cares.
- Curse/cursing (profanity)- Swear/swearing.
