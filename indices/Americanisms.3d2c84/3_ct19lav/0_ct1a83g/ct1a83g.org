  Highschool age characters driving- You don't see this a lot in HP, but I have seen a few fics where muggleborn/muggle teenagers drive around everywhere despite the fact that you can't get a full driving license until you are 18 in the UK.

That's not quite true. In the Uk the legal age to get a full license is 17.
