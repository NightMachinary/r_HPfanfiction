Just to clarify too - if you said something I didn't fully understand, in America I'd say "Huh?" to mean "I have no idea what you just said, can you repeat that?". Would "responding with "Er?" in Britain imply that same meaning? For some reason I feel like it means more, "I heard what you said, but I'm not sure how to respond" instead.
