  One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that Hogwarts, like most, if not all, British schools, has three terms, not two semesters. There is a break at Halloween, in February, and at Easter.

That would be four terms.

Schools have three terms, broken up by a Christmas holiday and an Easter holiday.

There's a half-term short holiday in the middle of the Winter and Spring terms, though it appears Hogwarts doesn't have this.
