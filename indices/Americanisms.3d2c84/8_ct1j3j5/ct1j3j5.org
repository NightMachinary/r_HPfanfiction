One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that Hogwarts, like most, if not all, British schools, has three terms, not two semesters. There is a break at +Halloween+ Christmas, a mid-term break in February, and at Easter.

*Ninja Edit:* Another thing I forgot to mention is that end of year exams, apart from OWLs and NEWTs, hold very little importance. The third year exams might be more important as it's possible that they determine what OWLs you would be able to do, and the same goes for the fifth year exams. In recent years, coursework has an increasing amount of significance, but not when the Harry Potter books were written. Hermione worrying about the first year and second year exams so much is meant to be an indicator of how scholarly she is. This also explains why the school can get away with cancelling the exams at the end of the protagonists' second year, assuming that the older students were not included in this, as they wouldn't do their exams at the same time anyway.

A related thing is that I've never heard GCSE or A-Level subject choices be referred to as electives. Personally, I and all the people around me referred to them as just GCSEs or A-Levels, for example: "What GCSEs did you choose?" rather than "What electives did you choose?" This might just be a regional thing though, as Northern Ireland is a bit weird with regards to the UK education system, given that we still have grammar schools.
