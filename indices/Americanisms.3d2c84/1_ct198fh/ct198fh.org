Dressing gown= robe.

Jumper= hoodie.

Rubbish= trash but is also an expression I.e. ' That's rubbish'.

Motorway= highway

Pub= bar.

Tea (in some places, mostly further north)= dinner.

Shop= store.

Edit- Also, graduation is a very American thing. I doubt Hogwarts had one.

Edit again- In England you go on 'holiday' not vacation.

And you only go to the bathroom to bathe otherwise you 'use the toilet'.

Just a few randoms that came to mind :)
