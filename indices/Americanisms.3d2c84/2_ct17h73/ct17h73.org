I often see subtle reference to a Grade Point Average style system of assessing school work. In the UK, at a school level, almost all of your performance in a year is represented by the score you get on the end of year exam. We also don't reveal the results to let people know where they were in the year, which is something I often see when people are Hermione bashing, unless you find out from your friends you can't know exactly how you performed compared to those around you (beyond an A-E grade).
