Sure! My bad lol.

Well, the fic is about Harry and an OC Female Slytherin who are rivals even worst than him and Malfoy are. One time, when they fight aboard the Hogwarts Express, they suddenly begin to feel an odd attraction to one another and pay attention to endearing things like eyes, face and etc.

They sent vehemently their growing attraction to one another especially as they are pushed together via school projects (Potions and such) until they can't handle it anymore.

They begin their relationship in secret while portraying the same hostile behavior to one another in public.

Harry basically forsake Ron and Hermione (who hate the OC very much and she them) for her, and after a certain event invites her to the Order HQ.

The OC (Female Slytherin) is from a Dark Pureblood House that didn't side with Voldemort despite their dark nature and tendencies. She is also the u disputable "Queen of Slytherin" as well.

The fanfic has a lot of depth and much more things that made it enjoyable but this is a rough summary of the important points. I don't know how helpful it'll be but I hope it is.

I also understand that many Harry x Daphne fanfics are like that but there's a certain appeal to it when it's an entirely new OC than a character whose only been mentioned once or twice in canon.
