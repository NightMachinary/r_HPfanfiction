It would make very little difference if it was Harry/Daphne or Harry/OC. The OC in the fic is pretty much Daphne in Fanfiction community. If I take Elizabeth and replace with Daphne and take Edwards and replace it with Greengrass, it would literally make no difference in the story. I could not read this fic without thing of Daphne everytime Elizabeth is mentioned. The characterizations are the same.

Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to find Harry/OC where OC behaves like this fic, simply because most of those will fall under Harry/Daphne category.

Let me know if you find any such completed fics though. I would be interested even if I will probably be thinking of Daphne throughout. :D
