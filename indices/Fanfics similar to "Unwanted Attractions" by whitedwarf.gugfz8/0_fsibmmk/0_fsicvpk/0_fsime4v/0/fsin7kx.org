You are right and I'll be a liar if I say I didn't think the same, but having Daphne jn that fic as a sort of Antagonist to Elizabeth and a threat to her place in Slytherin.

Let's be honest, in fics where it's Daphne in that place, Pansy and anyone else isn't a real threat to her standing in Slytherin.

I wouldn't mind if you recommend fics with Daphne instead of OC but that she'll keep the same charactistics that I described above.
