While it was good, the flashback scenes, where it was a literal copy and paste of past chapters, were a pain to read through and was generally confusing. I had several headscratching moments that had me wondering if I was reading a reposted chapter. Most of the length of this fic was because of copypasta.

Would love for the author to redo those chapters and just delete those or briefly mention the flashbacks and non dedicate a whole new chapter for a copy pasta with a few lines added in.
