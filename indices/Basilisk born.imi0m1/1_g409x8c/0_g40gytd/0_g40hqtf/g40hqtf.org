I didn't so much mind Grindelwald's war. It was Voldemort's war that was vague, uninformative, and repetitive. It seemed like it tried to drag things out for suspense, but mostly it just fell flat and even though /everything/ repeated I have no idea what happened except that I don't think time was linear for unknown reasons
