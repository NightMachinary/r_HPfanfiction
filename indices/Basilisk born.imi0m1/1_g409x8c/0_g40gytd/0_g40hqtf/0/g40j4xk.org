I didn't mind Grindelwald's war either, maybe I said it wrong but I'm meant after that war it got progressively more dull. It was rather interesting and insightful. But past that, I feel like the author realized how close to the present the flashbacks were getting, yet wanted to continue to format of alternating between flashbacks and the present which caused them to start dragging the plot and jumping around more. It's a really bizarre read where one chapter I'm disinterested and end up skimming through it, whereas the next I'm delighting in the plot and savouring every word.
