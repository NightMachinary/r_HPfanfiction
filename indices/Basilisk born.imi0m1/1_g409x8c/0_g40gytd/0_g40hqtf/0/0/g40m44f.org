The repetitive flashback dreams? Omg I wanted to scream. Everything just keeps dragging on and on and while I was really into this story last year now I'm about ready to cut it loose.

There's been a few stories (in various fandoms) I've encountered where it keeps building and building and never goes anywhere. Eventually I stop waiting and just stop following the story instead. If it takes too long to get to the point, I'm not going to still care when the author finally gets there.
