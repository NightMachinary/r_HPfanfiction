In canon, Divination is bunk. Dumbledore even says he wanted to drop it from the availble courses, but needed something to keep Trelawney at Hogwarts.

As for the other stuff, it's really just the prophecy. Despite the attempt at saying Harry had a choice, Dumbledore knows who Harry is won't change, so Harry is fated to kill or be killed by Voldemort.
