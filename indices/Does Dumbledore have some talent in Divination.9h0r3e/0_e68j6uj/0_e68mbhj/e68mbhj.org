But arithmancy is apparently legit. And we know computers can make some very accurate predictions, even without magic. Dumbledore was almost certainly close to genius level, and is certainly very smart...plus, we know he took Arithmancy. I could definitely see him using it. It might even be how he knew Ron would benefit from the deluminator.

And also, I disagree with Divination being bunk. It's just that it can't be learned by someone who doesn't have the talent - much like magic is bunk to muggles, and iPhones are bunk to luddites. Dumbledore wanted to drop it because students were using it for an easy O, and there were no decent teachers.
