I disagree, for example, defeating Voldemort was made easier by the existence of a prophecy. Without it, Dumbledore would probably never have guessed at the existence of Horcruxes, he'd never have been defeated the first time, he'd never fixate on Harry to the point he was able to be killed, because he'd never take Harry's blood, and there would be no blood protection from Lily. You can't blame his belief in it as being the only thing that gave it credence; if it weren't a real thing, how would it be recorded in the DoM? I highly doubt they record every fake one, indicating there is actually something to real prophecies.

Don't forget the centeurs also use it. Just because it's imprecise, and hard to interpret, doesn't mean it's bunk.

Also, it's not just for the future - it can be used for the past and present, too. Hermione is very narrow minded, and doesn't believe anything that can't be learned from books. She got sniffy about it because she was extremely overworked, an emotional teenager, and couldn't cope with the fact she couldn't do it, and hated to admit it...and who doesn't? I actually could see McGonagall being the same way, plus she was influenced by her exasperation with Trelawney, who was actually a fraud. Plus, we've seen in canon that she's prone to mistakes and brushing genuine issues off.

And Dumbledore also put stock in prophecies, not just Voldemort.

Plus, the Pettigrew prophecy was actually helpful - it told them what he was doing, and warned them that the reborn Voldemort would be worse than ever before.
