There's no instance in canon where Divination let's anyone do anything. That Dumbledore, McGonagall and Hermione place high doubt on it is very good reason to think it's not really anything. Arithmancy isn't Divination though (in HP), it's its own field with similar aims but apparently does work. But it has nothing to do with the Ron and Deluminator. That was figured out just based on him observing Ron's personality and figuring him to be the one to leave the hunt and thus need a way back.
