  I would suggest that you start with Chapter 5

That's because the first four chapters were written as one-off parodies; it wasn't until chapter five that the author was seriously trying to write a coherent story. [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix/][Daystar's Remix of Rationality]] is a re-write of the first four chapters that corrects a lot of the problems you're probably thinking of.

  As the story starts a bit rough around the edges, I decided to experiment with a rewrite of the first four chapters to examine how they might be "smoothed out" to try and better match the depth and brilliance of the rest of the story in tone and characterization, and add more context so as not to assume the readers are familiar with the canon series.
