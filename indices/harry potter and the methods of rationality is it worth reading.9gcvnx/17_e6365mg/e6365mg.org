It's... readable? When I got up to the point where the story hadn't been added to anymore yet (I think chapter 97? at the time) I found that I no longer cared enough about the story to wait for the next chapter to come out.

So it was readable enough to keep my interest, but not interesting enough for me to keep caring about once I had to wait for more.
