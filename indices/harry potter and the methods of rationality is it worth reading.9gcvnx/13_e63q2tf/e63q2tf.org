This subreddit hates the fic, so you'll probably get very biased advise.

Here's a few questions that might determine whether you might like HPMOR:

1. Does the idea of an AU where /everyone/ is much, much, *much* more intelligent than canon appeal to you?

2. Do discussions about science, rationality, materialism, metaphysical philosophy interest you and are you okay with long monologues on these topics?

3. Can you be okay with a somewhat smug, unreliable and socially inept protagonist, who's a brilliant thinker for an 11 year old and likes to consider himself an adult?

Another way to go about it might be to read EY's short story [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/n5TqCuizyJDfAPjkr/the-baby-eating-aliens-1-8]["Three World's Collide"]], which has nothing to do with HP, but might give you an idea whether you like his style.
