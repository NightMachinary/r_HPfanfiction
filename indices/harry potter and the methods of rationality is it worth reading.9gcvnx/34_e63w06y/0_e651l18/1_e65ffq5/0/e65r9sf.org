Or it could be that the author's idea of genius, 12 years old or 39 years old, is flawed in a way that reflects rather amusingly on them in the same vein that sex scenes written by young teenagers that have never had sex do.

For me, the problem with the fic is that HP's magic system and setting is whimiscal and well, magical. Finding "rational" explanations for every little thing just robs the magic from everything. And once some flaws are introduced into the priors, the conclusions become more and more wrong (IMHO) until I can't enjoy it as a "rational" take, I can't enjoy it as a more traditional whimsical tale, and so I can't enjoy it.

Clearly many others have enjoyed it, more power to them. But for those of us who did not, we have just as much right to tell people what we disliked about it, if only to save someone else who might have similar tastes a few hours of slogging through Terry Goodkind level didactic text.
