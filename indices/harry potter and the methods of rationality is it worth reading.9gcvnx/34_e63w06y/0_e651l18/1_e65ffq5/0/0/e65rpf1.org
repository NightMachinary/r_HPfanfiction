Reading this, I'm uncertain if you've even read the story to completion. The story never finds a deeper 'rational' explanation to magic. If anything it keeps getting weirder and more mystical, and actually improves on Rowling's system in the end, because it shows how important one's emotional state is to unlocking deeper levels of magic. Emotion, not logic or rationality.

You don't have a right to criticize the story like this, in a public form. Not when you either didn't finish reading it, or didn't have any interest in/understanding of the material. All you've got here are especially flimsy straw mans, with little bearing on the actual material.
