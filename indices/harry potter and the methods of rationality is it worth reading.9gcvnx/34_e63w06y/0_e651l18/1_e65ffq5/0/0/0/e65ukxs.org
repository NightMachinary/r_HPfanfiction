  You don't have a right to criticize the story like this, in a public form.

I did not finish the story because I found it unbearable somewhere around chapter 10. My point is that for people with tastes similar to mine, they will probably hate the story too, and shouldn't have to read 700k words they don't enjoy.

  All you've got here are especially flimsy straw mans, with little bearing on the actual material.

I don't intend to get into some deeper discussion on the meaning of this fanfic, because certain choices the author made cause me to strongly dislike it. That's really been my point all along. Have a good day/night/solar revolution.
