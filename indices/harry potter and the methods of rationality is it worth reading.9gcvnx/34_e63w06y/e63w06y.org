Yes. Ignoring the story and plot outright, if you look at the basic level of writing, grasp of dialogue, humour, and foreshadowing, it stands in the top .01% of Harry Potter fanfiction. The story was written by an actual genius, and it shows. If only so that you can experience such damn fine writing, reading it is worth it; it's better written than the vast majority of actual published fantasy novels I've encountered in the last few years.

Also... the actual story is pretty damn nicely good. Just saying.

edit: sigh @ downvotes. I get that this subreddit hates HPMOR, but it is undeniably well written, and is undeniably, by any factual measure, one of the top stories in the fandom. Despite how much some people, especially here, dislike it.
