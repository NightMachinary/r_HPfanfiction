Oh man... You just had to ask about /that/ one?

Just to be clear. I personally adored it. It has tons of problems, but I can't help but be in love with it despite that, i'm just the kind of person that really appreciate this story.

But as for if YOU want to read it... that's more complicated. This subreddit has a love/hate relationship with HPMOR, it is incredibly popular, but simultaneously incredibly niche. It helped spawn off an entire sub-genre of fanfiction and original stuff called "rational fiction", or "rationa/ist/ fiction" (there are few distinctions, but that's not all that important now.) For more of that see [[/r/rational][r/rational]] which absolutely *adores* MoR. It was formed as a reaction to that very fanfic, after all.

The writing isn't the best in the first 4 chapters, but thanks to its incredible popularity someone has already edited it and posted it themselves. Just the first four chapters though, as those are a bit more infamous. It's the same story, just better edited. Here's that link, btw.
