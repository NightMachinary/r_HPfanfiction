I think MoR is pretty bad and Harry smarmy and pretentious, but if you want to see the absolute smarmiest, unlikable Harry then linkffn(Knowledge is Power by DZ2) is where it's at. Not to be too mean, but I couldn't get into because of how shitty and pseudo-intellectual Harry was made out in the first few chapters. It was like the author tried to make him Tony Stark but took out any redeeming character traits.
