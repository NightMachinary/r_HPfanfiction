Oh FFS!

No, 'Harrison' is not his name.

I'll read that fic. I have absolutely terrible taste and I like the basic premise. Working out why terrible fics are terrible is sort of a side effect and loathsome protagonists make amazing villains.

'Harrison' though... no. Bad.

Oh god, it starts with a key so you know which punction is thoughts and which is parseltongue, /just see how she handled it in the damn books!/ (Half Blood Prince is the one you want, one of the visits to Dumbledore's office).

Oh gosh, this is going to be awful isn't it.

Oh yes, just randomly italicise words for emphasis, that's not jarring at all. (Note to self: make sure not randomly italicising for emphasis in own fics).

I love the way the author has taken things Rowling actually did well and made me realise that by doing it badly. The whole way the Dursleys are shown to be abnormal being the main one so far.That and handling 'Thoughts' and //parseltongue//.

OK, I was wrong. I cannot read this fic. Not after the Millers section. I didn't make it to chapter two.
