Lemme just say this bit isn't even the most ridiculous, conceited stuff Harry says. I only got in like 6 chapters but it still manages to get to new levels of cocksure "intelligence":

  Dear "Deputy Headmistress McGonagall" (kindly note the air-quotes there)

  Let me first congratulate you on making me smile with regards to your insane letter regarding the impossible existence of magic, let alone the even-more impossible existence of a school where one can become a wizard -- or witch in the case of the /females of the species/.

  However, the only thing that amuses me about your pathetic excuse for fun and games is the creativity that must have gone into naming those books and creating such interesting topics. Now, don't get me wrong, I admire and appreciate LARPing as much as the next boy, but I have never had any ambitions to join any of them: whether they're Tolkien fans, Pratchett fans or even King fans, let alone the embarrassing LARPers who go around in Lucas' gear and call it normal.*

  So, if you want me to actually consider your joke even an iota of truth, it's going to take something truly spectacular; therefore, I cordially invite you to arrange the necessary proof and deliver it to my address on the anniversary of my birth: July 31st.

  If you convince me, I'll attend your "school" but if not, I have the names and addresses of several well-known therapists and psychiatrists who can help you keep your jokes in better taste.*

  As a wise man once said: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and, sorry, but even my hunger for knowledge and your amusing book titles barely qualify as that.

  Ball's in your court.*

  Yours sincerely,

  Harrison James Potter
