Umm fanfiction can be whatever specially if its an AU. Harry was raised by other people (Petunia was different to him, treating him like a real mother would), so character would be fundamentally changed. He was not abused but he does have issues. And like i said before he is often proven wrong and thrown down a few pegs.

He does suffer from the egotistical character that sometimes comes with intelligence, and he does show some of the social awkwardness that comes with it.

He reminds me sometimes of Sheldon, so yeah he is egotistical.
