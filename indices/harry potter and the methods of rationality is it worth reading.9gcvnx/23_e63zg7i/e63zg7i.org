I liked it a lot. I've always felt that people take it really seriously and are really defensive of canon over something which is just an AU interpretation like any other.

The fact that people go nuts over it as The Worst Thing on the one hand but on the other are perfectly happy to excuse and support harems, super!Harry, underage sex, abusive!James and Lily, evil Weasleys etc. etc. has always left me scratching my head.
