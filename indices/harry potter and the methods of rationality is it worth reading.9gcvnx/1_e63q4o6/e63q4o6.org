Here's a mini-review I had posted on a different site a while ago:

In a nutshell, if you mostly share Yudkowsky's metaphysical assumptions and his hopes for the future of humanity in broad strokes, you can enjoy the /first half/ of the fic: it was amusing, downright hilarious in places, and didn't take itself too seriously at the start; it had about the right mix of references (pop-cultural and scientific) that I knew about and that I didn't know about and could learn something from.

The author did take on board a lot of fanon. There was all sorts of wizardly nobility stuff, character personalities taken straight out of mediocre power fantasy fic, and magic that functioned like a battery (though Harry didn't get the biggest one, so I guess that was OK). I didn't mind much the deviations from canon, as long as the author kept the digs at canon to a minimum. It also had its share of inanity, such as characters bursting into song at the Sorting, but it could be chalked up to the author's unfamiliarity with the fandom culture, and it was fairly isolated.

Over time, though, the fun stuff was largely supplanted in favour of Serious Business Slytherin Scheming with basically two people having any agency. I recall largely skimming through the second half of the story, because I did want to see how it ends. (My verdict: Meh.)

There is, also, a price for enjoying the first half of this fic: in order to enjoy the amusing interactions, you should try to stop thinking of the characters as representations of hypothetical human beings---canon or not---with distinct personalities, motivations, feelings, and thought processes. Rather, you need start thinking of them as acrobats or dancers in a tightly choreographed dance, or perhaps archetypes personified, like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell'arte][Commedia dell'arte]] characters, acting out a morality play.

The saddest cut of all, though, is that if one wanted to write a Rational!Protagonist fic in HPverse, the most logical Rational!Protagonist is Hermione, not Harry. To make Harry one, Yudkowsky had to literally have someone completely overwrite his personality (which, admittedly, is more honest than most Smart!Studious!Harry writers, who don't provide even that much justification). To make Hermione one would have taken a few tweaks to her circumstances and interests. (Now, I understand why Yudkowsky chose Harry: his goal was didactic first and foremost, and not nearly as many people would have read a Hermione-centric non-romance fic as would read a Harry-centric one.)

So, I'll end with a plug for a fic that I don't think has been mentioned in this thread: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ by Robin Drew]], which is, in a way, what HPMOR should have been.
