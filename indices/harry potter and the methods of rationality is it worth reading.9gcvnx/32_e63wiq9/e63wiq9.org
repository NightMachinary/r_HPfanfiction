it depends. i like the worldbuilding, but the characters are insufferable. same with his Pokemon fic, actually. the idea of the fic and what it's trying to do is better than the fic itself. but if you're into Tolkien-esque asides where you get a crash course in that universe's metaphysics or other wild-ass concepts right in the middle of another scene, try it.
