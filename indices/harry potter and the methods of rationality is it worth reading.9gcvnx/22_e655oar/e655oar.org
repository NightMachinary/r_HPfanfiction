I started the book on Friday afternoon, and I just finished it this morning. Or last night? It was around 5am and the distinction is a little blurry. I didn't do too much else with my weekend.

The last time I read this much in one weekend was when I was in school and trying to finish my undergrad thesis. The last time I read this much for /pleasure/ was when I was in middle school.
