Harry starts out thinking that everyone is an idiot, because he is arrogant. Yes the story is written stating Harry thinks he is smarter than everyone. Yet none of his theories are proven showing how stupid the wizarding world is, and in fact all of them he tries fail.

HPMOR is much less a look at how amazing smart this Harry is perfect, and more a look at silly confident this Harry is in his intelligence and how he almost ruins everything by thinking he can do everything alone.

I understand the writing style is not to many peoples liking but stating it misses the point of fanfiction is unfair. HPMOR is a story that is unique made from using elements of the original work. The main inconsistencies it addresses is non permanent transfiguration and that the universe shouldn't want people speaking latin in order to perform magic.
