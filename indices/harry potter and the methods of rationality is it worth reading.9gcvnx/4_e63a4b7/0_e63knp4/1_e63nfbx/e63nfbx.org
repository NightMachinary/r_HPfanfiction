The point of fanfiction is to use elements of an original work to create your own story.

In my opinion, a fanfic author ought to find a reasonable justification for inconsistencies it addresses, or eliminate them outright from the setting.

What's more fun to you, that every single wizard and goblin in Britain is a blithering fucking idiot, or that there's an actual practical reason unknown to both ickle Harrykins and the reader why the wizarding banking system is set up a shown and it's not actually exploited even if it seems easy to do so by RL standards?

MOR is basically written around the first part. To me, that's pointless and basically unreadable. Sure, crack is a genre too, but then you have to play it for humour, which isn't MOR's aim.

This is all subjective of course, but then I /did/ state from the beginning that this is just my point of view rather than an objective definition of fanfiction and its aims.
