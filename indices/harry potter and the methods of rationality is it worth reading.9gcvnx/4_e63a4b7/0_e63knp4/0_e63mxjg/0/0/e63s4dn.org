I mean, if only the most popular pairings were around (canon pairings, Harry and Hermione with Snape or Malfoy or both), I'd have noped out faster than you can hit "close tab". And canon compliant usually equals boring since you know the outcome.

And I'm all for diversity of ideas. I'm writing one story where Andromeda Tonks adopts Harry, one where he and Tonks travel across Europe while basically using the plot of the 2003 video game Freelancer (which is a space RPG) and I've finished a couple oneshots, one where Hermione gets a crush after being treated to a kebab.

But the overall goal in all of those is to play around in Rowling's sandbox. Harry isn't going to shout "Heil +Hitler+ Voldemort", Hermione isn't going to end pureblood heiress. Sure, I might have to invent nations like a magical HRE equivalent or take a look at Lithuanian grammar for some OC names, but the overall world is still the same. There's Harry, Hogwarts, magic, Quidditch, flying brooms, Voldemort, Death Eaters and so on. Not all of those will always play a quintessential role, but they are there.
