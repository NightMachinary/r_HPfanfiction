That makes sense, I suppose. Sometimes I read a book or watch a movie and wish it would /keep going/. Sometimes I read fanfiction to scratch that itch.

On the other hand, I would never have gotten into HP fanfiction if there wasn't so much amazing variety. Sometimes I think that HP fanfiction is as numerous and varied as all the genres of books in existence, and I'm happy that the fanon community has grown and evolved through the years. I never get bored with it because I always stumble upon a story so unique that my interest is piqued again. If I restricted myself to canon compliant (or canon-similar) stories then I would have gotten bored very quickly.
