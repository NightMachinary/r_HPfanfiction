Not OP, I'd say that the goal of fanfics is to create more content to add to a familiar universe. I'd say most of use are here because they fell in love with the HP universe through the books and movies. But there are only seven/eight of them and at some point, you know them by heart.

Now enter fanfics, where you get a lot of new content for the world/characters we have come to love. It's not all sunshine and roses, but there's a lot of material to choose from to scratch that itch.
