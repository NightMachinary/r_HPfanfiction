In the fic, Harry supposes that there is a "Source of Magic" acting like an impartial AI that only takes commands from people with wizard DNA. If that's the case, then each "spell" is like a command in a programming language engineered by whoever created the Source of Magic, probably the people of Atlantis before it disappeared.

EY's contradictory comment is from Q&A at the UC Berkeley wrap party ([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Twro49BDcJ9jpWcKH/hpmor-q-and-a-by-eliezer-at-wrap-party-in-berkeley][transcript]], relevant section is at the very end). Rather than magic being something created by humans, he proposes that the universe could be inherently magical and humans (or something else) imposed limits in order to prevent reality from falling apart in a series of growing catastrophes.
