I had similar thoughts when I read it. Harry sometimes gets a comeuppance politically or psychologically, but never scientifically. From a didactic point of view, that seems like a poor authorial decision: nobody in-story points out the weaknesses of his scientific methods, so a reader can be misled into thinking that they are as adequate.
