That's true, though Harry does make other assumptions that cause problems in the story, and a few of his assumptions would cause major problems after the story if he never scientifically tested them.

For example, Harry's "experiment" about magic heritability was really weak (it was designed to make someone question their point of view rather than actually prove anything.) There are other possible explanations besides the one Harry gives, so the wizarding population might run into problems later if they tried to use that as a basis for policy.
