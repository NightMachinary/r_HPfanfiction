That's a fair interpretation, I guess. At the same time, its more of an issue since he specifically tried to bill his story as an explanation of certain concepts. Its important to both understand those concepts (unlike a lot of the pseudoscience and hypotheses that are thrown in the story) and have characters who you can trust when they tell you about those new ideas. Instead, we get a lot of author tracts from Harry and Quirrell, neither of whom is a very reliable narrator, especially if you'r saying that the explanations of magic in the story are wrong.
