  "Harry Potter makes a guess about the nature of magic and it works out every time."

Oddly enough, the author later made comments on reddit contradicting the explanation of magic that Harry came up with. EY might have meant it as an object lesson for why making a hypothesis that fits the observed evidence isn't enough. The hypothesis has to be tested, otherwise a different explanation might end up being the truth. Harry in the story tries to be a good scientist, but he's only a kid, so he makes a lot of mistakes in his reasoning that the narative shines a light on later.
