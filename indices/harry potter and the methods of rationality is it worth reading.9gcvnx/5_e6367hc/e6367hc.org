I'd say its worth reading. It brings up some interesting ideas and takes on canon, it squeezes in all major plot points from across the series into the first year, the characters have clear motivations and there's a clear theme its going for, even if you disagree with it. It's also well-edited, which is better than 95+% of other fanfics. Yes, it has characters acting OOC and depends on some author fiat, but overall I thought it was pretty good and worth the read.

It's also the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10][third-most favorited fic on fanfiction.net]], it has [[http://www.hpmor.com/][its own website]], etc. If nothing else, if you enjoy HP fanfiction as a whole, its good to take a look at it and understand where people are coming from when they praise or decry it, regardless of their opinions.

It can be slow going at times, though- early on has a decent pace, but later on you'll get chapters of actual story progression bookended by character thoughts and reactions, or stuff like fun action scenes (inspired by Ender's Game) that start off as a fun exploration of magic and character relationships, but end up dragging on after fulfilling their intended purpose. The epilogue alone is like 6 chapters long. Also, rather than "Harry Potter + Science," its more like "Harry Potter makes a guess about the nature of magic and it works out every time." A lot of plot points are resolved with a similar set of tools.
