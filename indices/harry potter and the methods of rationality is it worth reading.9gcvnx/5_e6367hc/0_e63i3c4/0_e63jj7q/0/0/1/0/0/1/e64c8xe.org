Which is fine: in your position, having not witnessed the stuff and with people just talking about it, I'd be suspicious too. I'm hoping the cultlike stuff has actually died away, and not just gone offline. I don't see any angry screaming at all in this thread, but I do see a lot of other stuff that I'm assuming other regulars to the sub also see and are choosing to ignore.
