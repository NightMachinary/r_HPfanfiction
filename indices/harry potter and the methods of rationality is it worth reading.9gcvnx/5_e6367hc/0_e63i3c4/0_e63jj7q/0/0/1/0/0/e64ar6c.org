To be fair, I've seen some conspiracy theory comments about the alleged cult of Less Wrong on this sub which would fall into the "angry screaming" category. This thread contains a few choice examples.

My general policy is to take everything with a grain of salt and politely encourage people to provide evidence for their claims. Thus far, I've never seen anything concrete to support the idea that EY is dismissive of fanfiction.
