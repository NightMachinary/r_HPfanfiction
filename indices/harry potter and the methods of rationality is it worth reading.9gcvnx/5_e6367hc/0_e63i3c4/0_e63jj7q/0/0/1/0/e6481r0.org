It was many many years ago, and EY (who, as you may notice, looks for these discussions and occasionally engages in reputation management) deletes stuff. But more than that: I don't think there is an archive of the ‘discussion's on Less Wrong. As has always been his right: things he said and later deleted which aren't about fanfic (or Roko's Basilisk: I make an exception for that, too) I take care never to bring up again, because I think people should have a right to that. Fanfic seems sufficiently unimportant that no harm is done, though even this is interpreted by him as ‘angry screaming' and telling people that enjoying it is terrible and not allowed, which is odd but there we go.
