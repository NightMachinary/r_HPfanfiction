  This was /so/ not the case early on, although he did something of a course correction as he got some blowback. Which is how it should be. And I am basing some of this on things said outside the text of the fic itself, including discussions on Less Wrong.

Well, I suppose this serves as an illustration of the degree to which you can't trust what you read on the Internet, if nothing else. A lot of times it's hard to refute the stuff that people make up, but at least this case is nicely, crisply refutable. Ch. 14 was posted pretty early on and contains a Getting the Hang of Thursdays reference, or let's see, Ch. 9 even before that and The Mysterious Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks... I'm trying to think of what HP fanfiction reference would be visible before Ch. 9... I suppose the reference to Atlantis in Ch. 7 would count as a Wastelands and/or a general fanon reference, but that's harder to prove. I could probably find something even earlier if I looked. References to other fanfics are ubiquitous throughout HPMOR, and indeed it's a story set in the world of Harry Potter *fanfiction* more than a story set in the original Harry Potter per se. I'd previously read tons of HP fanfiction, so that was the universe where HPMOR popped into my head.

None of those references were suggested to me; they're all fics I encountered on my own. Many of them appear in my Favorites on my FFN account here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong]]

The Internet is full of accusations that are hard to refute. It's worth paying attention when some of them are shown to be definitely, factually false. It should make you reconsider all the others, especially the ones that consist of vague, hateful assertions about an author's state of mind. Even if that was true, how would people come to know it? Are they telepaths?

My advice to OP is to try reading HPMOR, see if you like it, and absolutely ignore anything said on the Internet about what I had in mind or how I felt about J. K. Rowling or what my purpose was etcetera. Just blank all the angry screaming about the author out of your mind, look at the story as a story, try to follow what's going on in-universe, and forget all the allegations of invisible, unfalsifiable evil intentions going on behind the scene. I'm sad that so many people are coming into this fic with blatant lies about the author's grand malevolent intentions twisting their interpretation of what's meant to be fun and chaos. I meant the story as a story.

I also meant it to be enjoyed. If you don't enjoy a book, stop reading it and leave it to others to enjoy. Why can so many people not handle the thought of somebody else enjoying a book they didn't? Is the world so small?

Here's what should be said in response to OP's question (and I'm glad the top-voted comment here said more or less the same thing). Some people enjoy HPMOR a whole lot. Some people don't like it. Try reading some chapters. If it turns out you're in the former group, continue. If you're in the latter group, stop reading and spend the irreplaceable hours of your future existence experiencing something you enjoy instead of something you hate. If you're in the former group, don't post unmarked spoilers on the Internet, so as to preserve other people's future enjoyment. If you're in the latter group, don't tell other people that they're not allowed to enjoy it, so as to preserve their possible enjoyment.

There isn't so much happiness in the world that you should be trying to destroy every bit of it that doesn't gain 100% of your own personal approval. Some people really did like HPMOR a lot, they had some happier hours. I'm not sure I understand deep down the view where these moments of happiness are terrible and cannot be allowed to stand.
