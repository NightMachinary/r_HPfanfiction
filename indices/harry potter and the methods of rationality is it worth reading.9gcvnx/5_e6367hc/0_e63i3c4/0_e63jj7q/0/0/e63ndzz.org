This was /so/ not the case early on, although he did something of a course correction as he got some blowback. Which is how it should be. And I am basing some of this on things said outside the text of the fic itself, including discussions on Less Wrong.

But the stuff about slash and shipping, particularly early on, was the same tired old stuff you used to hear from people who would never deign to read fanfic and generally had a very low view of it. Hohoho fanfic is all fangirls writing yaoi. Like the fics where the author sticks in endless notes explaining that there is no slash or romance in this fic, no siree bob, and just to make sure let's have the characters have a vaguely homophobic discussion in which they make it clear that they aren't gay. A cliche in fic from writers newer to fanfic who think they're above it.

And a lot of the references he included were things that readers had suggested to him, or had discussed in places like Less Wrong.
