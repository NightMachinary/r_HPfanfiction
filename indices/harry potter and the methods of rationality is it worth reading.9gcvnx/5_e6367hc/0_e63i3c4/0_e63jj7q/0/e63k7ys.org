  I think EY views fanfiction, HP fandom, and the fanfic community in very much the same way he views the academic and scientific community: with utter contempt and as something he doesn't need to be involved in.

What makes you say that? HPMOR contains many hat-tips to other Harry Potter fanfics (Wastelands of Time, A Black Comedy, Getting the Hang of Thursdays, etc.) Also, the story contains a lot of tongue-in-cheek comedy about trends in the fanfiction community (OT3, the popularity of slash, etc.) Overall, I get the impression that EY enjoyed reading Harry Potter fanfiction and respects high quality fics.
