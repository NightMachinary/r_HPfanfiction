  Like, if you came across a Chick tract in which Harry Potter learns that he needs to pray the sinner's prayer and regularly attend a Baptist church, even if it had a few genuinely amusing moments it probably wouldn't fit well with other HP fanfic and you wouldn't expect it to have a big following here, rather than in a community of Chick tract enthusiasts.

Look, I've read enough Chick tracts to know that in a Chick tract Harry would probably end up burning in hell and (probably) Hermoine would be the one repenting for her witchcraft and praying the sinner's prayer. Those things had a bit of a pattern to them and they would definitely single out Harry as the one who went to hell.

As a Christian I find them pretty abhorrent, but they were definitely weirdly engrossing to read back in the day (partly due to them being comics).
