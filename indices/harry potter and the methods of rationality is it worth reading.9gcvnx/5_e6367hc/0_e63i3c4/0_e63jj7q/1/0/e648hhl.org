Hey, they had one where the literal anti-Christ humourously learnt about Jesus and repented: I think Harry has a chance in a more recent tract. I agree that they are weirdly engrossing, and many people enjoy reading them, but you wouldn't exactly expect them to fit in well in a Harry Potter fanfic forum rather than a discussion forum for people who bought into that brand of Christianity, and the plot and characterisation would always be sacrificed so that the point could be made. Any discussion of them in a HP fanfic community would be likely to upset Chick, if he were still alive and read such discussions.
