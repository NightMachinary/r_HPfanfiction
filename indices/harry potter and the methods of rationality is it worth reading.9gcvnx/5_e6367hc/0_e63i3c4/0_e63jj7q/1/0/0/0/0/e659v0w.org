Man, I wish I could remember more specifics so that I could come up with something as good as what you just did. All I can remember is one where there are a bunch of people walking a wide path and then there is the narrow path to salvation. And then there is one called Somebody Goofed. Beyond that info all I remember is general themes and specific panels (usually minus the dialogue). And I sure as Hell (pun intended) am not going to google Chick tracts, not even in incognito mode. I don't need to get the related ads popping up on Facebook etc.
