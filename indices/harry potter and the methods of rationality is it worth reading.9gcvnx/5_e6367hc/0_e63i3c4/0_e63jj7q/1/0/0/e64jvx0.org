I wasn't really trying to engage your point, I was just having a bit of fun by combining the two based on my knowledge of both.

​

I mean I can imagine a Chick tract version with Harry as the one repenting. It'd probably have Ron die and be the one burning in Hell (which would appeal to a much to large portion of this fandom) and Dudley as the one witnessing to him. It'd probably be Dudley or another Dursley in that role for any version.

​

But I still hold that it would be Harry. There's be a lot of material to use for when he is in Hell and asking why he is there after stopping Voldemort, etc.

​

Actually, in a Chick tract version of Harry Potter, can you really blame Voldemort for making horcruxes?
