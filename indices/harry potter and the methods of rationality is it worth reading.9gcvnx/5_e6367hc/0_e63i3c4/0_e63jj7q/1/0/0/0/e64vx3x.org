Oooo, or Voldemort could be the one witnessed to by Dudley when he comes to kill the Dursleys, and Harry dismisses it all but Voldemort prays the sinner's prayer and is washed clean. Because it's nothing to do with what they actually do, so Voldemort gets to live forever like he always wanted (but in Heaven) while Harry is sent wailing into the firey pit.

You could even call it â€˜Horcrux' and have Dudley describe Jesus as his horcrux.
