Hmm, I think EY views fanfiction, HP fandom, and the fanfic community in very much the same way he views the academic and scientific community: with utter contempt and as something he doesn't need to be involved in. This was more apparent in the early days of HPMoR. In that way, I don't think he exactly intended HPMoR to /be/ a Harry Potter fanfic, and it doesn't really fit in this community, even though it obviously /is/ a fanfic that goes through a lot of the HP fanfic cliches. He wasn't big on HP lore when he started (I think he even said at one point that he hadn't actually read the books, early on), which was obvious in some of his â€˜take that's about the books as I recall from when I first read it, long ago, and the plot and characterisation was very much not the point of why he was writing.

Like, if you came across a Chick tract in which Harry Potter learns that he needs to pray the sinner's prayer and regularly attend a Baptist church, even if it had a few genuinely amusing moments it probably wouldn't fit well with other HP fanfic and you wouldn't expect it to have a big following here, rather than in a community of Chick tract enthusiasts.
