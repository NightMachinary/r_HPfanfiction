Yeah I agree with this. It seems to be a super polarizing fic and it's definitely not for everyone. However, despite the problems it has, I found it to be an enjoyable read.

It's decently written and has some interesting and unique plot ideas, and some pretty exciting segments. But it also often seems like some scenes are thin window dressing for the author to use to push forward his philosophies or some lesson about logical fallacies, rather than being there to tell a story. And the main character can be an annoying prick at times. And it has some pacing issues, where it sort of meanders a bit in the middle. This has nothing to with the fic itself, but it's also sort of annoying that a lot of it's fans, whom haven't and probably won't ever read any other Harry Potter fanfiction, think it's the best possible version of Harry Potter and some flawless masterpiece. It's definitely an enjoyable fic to read, and I get this it appeals to some demographics that wouldn't be into most other fanfics so I'm not saying those people should read more, but the epitome of writing it is not.
