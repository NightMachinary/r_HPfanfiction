I think it's worth at least trying once. If you feel like you want to drop out, then no, it's not for you. If it /is/ for you, it's rather a fun ride that scratches a few itches canon leaves. It has its problems, but there's a lot of fun stuff in there.

I found the ending pretty satisfying, and the way a few running gags were wrapped up. I don't at all regret having read it and one day will probably read it again.
