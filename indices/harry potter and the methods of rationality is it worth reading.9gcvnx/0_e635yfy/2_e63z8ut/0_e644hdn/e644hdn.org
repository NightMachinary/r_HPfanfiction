I suppose even the action-heavy parts of HPMOR, such as the Azkaban scenes, focus a lot on introspection. Personally I love that type of thing. It's a bit like Death Note or other stories that delve into strategy and headgames. What's going on in the minds of the characters adds to the tension in a great way, but that may not be the right cup of tea for some people.
