I've reread my comment and your reply over and over again to try to understand where you get the idea that I don't like introspection and getting in the heads of characters. I clearly said I read it twice (even though the "re" in reread got left off accidentally its still pretty clear) and I clearly enjoy it, based on the fact that I said it was worth rereading.

All I said was that I felt like one arc was a slog both times and from that you inferred a lot of incorrect things about who I am as a person and what I like in stories I read.

Kind of comes across like the "you have to have a high IQ" style fans of Rick and Morty (which is, by the way, a show I enjoy very much).
