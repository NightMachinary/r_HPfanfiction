I didn't mean to imply anything negative. Not liking to read introspection doesn't imply anything about a person's IQ; people simply have different tastes and there's nothing wrong with that.

I would like to know what aspects of the Azkaban scenes were a "slog" on repeated readings. Personally, that's one of my favorite parts to reread, so I enjoy seeing what other people think of it. Your response in particular piqued my curiosity because I've never seen someone describe it that way.
