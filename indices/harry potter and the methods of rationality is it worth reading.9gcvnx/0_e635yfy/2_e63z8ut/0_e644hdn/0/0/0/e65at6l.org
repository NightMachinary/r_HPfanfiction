Next time you should probably just ask why I thought they were a slog instead of speculating on why a person (implying me) would not like it. And to be clear, I like introspection. You brought up Death Note, and that's an anime that I have watched at least a half dozen times and own on DVD.

As for why I didn't enjoy the Azkaban arc, I can't really tell you that (though I can tell you how it made me feel), as its been a while since my reread (and it's be a while before I might possibly read it a third time). If I had to speculate, it probably had to do with a combination of the tone and the pacing. I remember it feeling like it took forever (hence the word slog). Fittingly, it felt like the soul of HPMOR was sucked out during those chapters.
