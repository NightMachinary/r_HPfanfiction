I think this is a fun review, but while this is an entertaining read and brings up a lot of good points, the author of this review/reflection is fairly obnoxious in his own right.

Some of the complaints show a lack of critical reading of the story. Referencing Sanderson is well and good, but canon Harry Potter also operates on fairly fuzzy rules of magic that are used to solve problems.
