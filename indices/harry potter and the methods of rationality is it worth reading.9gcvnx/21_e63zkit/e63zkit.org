I found HPMoR fascinating, but also unsatisfying in many ways. I suggest you try the first ten or so chapters and see what you think. The best critical review I know of is no longer at its original host but can be found [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/][here]]. It looks long but that's just the chapter by chapter reviews, just read the beginning summary and ignore the rest.
