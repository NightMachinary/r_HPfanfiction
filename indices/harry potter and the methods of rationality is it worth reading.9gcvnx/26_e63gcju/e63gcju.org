The biggest potential draw back to /methods/ is how "educational" it can be or tries to be, if happen to be very well-educated yourself. Harry values science and logic. It reflects in his decision making and our insight into his thought processes. Much of your time will be spent reading about scientific studies, psychologic experiments and (often completely internal) discussions about missing links in magical theory.

This can seem rather pretentious or preachy, and tends to screw with the text-to-time relation somewhat. The length of some stories do seem to just come down to how hard Harry needs to think to solve all the problems /just right/. The pacing handles more like a science fiction novel than a magical children's story, so previous experience reading that genre would /probably/ help.

If you can get past or enjoy the talks about science papers, you are in for a hell of a ride, my friend. Personally, I will heartily recommend /methods/ to anyone giving fanfiction a shot. I've been a serious bibliophile since age 5, and /methods/ convinced me that fanfiction was probably worth trying out at age 19. Hell, I got my 50-year old and equally bibliophiliac dad to read it, and he had a blast with it (though that guy eats books like I eat cheeseburgers). It manages to go through a wide span of different tones and themes, and manages to do most of them pretty well. There's humor, horror, drama, mentorship, intrigue, intrigue with your mentor and /plenty/ of mystery. It knows when it's time to screw around and suspend disbelief, and when to get serious, emotional and angsty as /shit/.

TLDR: Mostly pacing differences in comparison to other texts in general. Can be kind of boring or pretentious if you already know a lot of the scientific topics. Protagonist is comparable to Miles Vorkosigan, according to my dad.
