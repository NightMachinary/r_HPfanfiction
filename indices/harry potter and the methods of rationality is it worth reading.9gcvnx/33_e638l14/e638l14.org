It is awesome, its just Harry is actually meant by the author to be super smart.

Also the author meant the story to be a sort of lecture in Rationality, fallacies, and logical biases. He even puts some "tests" for readers to solve.

Most people cant seem to see through Harry being supersmart but unlike other fics, the author does it on purpose and with a purpose.I fully recommend to read it.

Edit: I don't understand all the hate. There are certainly worse stories that people "dig" and have thousands of reviews without the writing quality this story has.
