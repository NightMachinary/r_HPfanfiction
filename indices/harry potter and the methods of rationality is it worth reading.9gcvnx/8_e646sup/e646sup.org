In my own experience I read it, couldn't stand the preachy tone in the first 10 chapters and left. Then maybe a year or so later I went back to it and despite my previous dislike of the story, read it all.

As was previously said, it was readable. I enjoyed some of the sillier bits that didn't take itself so seriously, but once it got into all the pseudoscience it got slowly more irritating to read, although by that point I had invested enough time into the fic that I wanted to finish it. Finishing, however, felt more trying to swallow a gross pill with only a tablespoon of water. It's doable, but it's uncomfortable and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

I personally really don't recommend it, but it does have a cult following so it is likeable by some.

From what I've gotten from this thread is if you go into it with an open mind, expecting to hate the main character, accepting the pseudoscience, and understanding that you really can't take it too seriously, you'll like it at least a bit.

For sure though, read a bit yourself and try it out. The first few chapters set the tone for the rest of the book well enough that if you don't like them you probably won't like the fic as a whole.

I wish you luck in deciding, as this sub sure enjoying hating HPMoR.
