the fic is intended by the author to function as this pedagogical induction into the sphere of “rationalism”.

exploring all that goes behind that intention is sort of a journey in and of itself, more than i care to explain fully within the confines of this reddit post

there is, or was, this whole sort of “rationalist” community thats built around the authors ideas, and it all ultimately leads to the leader who thinks that we have to prepare for the eventuality that a general aritificial intelligence will be created that will function as an ultimately powerful god and control all of our lives

just google shit like lesswrong and eliezer yudkowsky and read to get a full picture of what is up with this shit. its seriously weird
