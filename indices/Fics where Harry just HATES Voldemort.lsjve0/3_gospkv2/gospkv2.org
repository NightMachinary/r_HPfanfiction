'A Black Comedy'

'Time to put your galleons where your mouth is'

'Delenda Est'

'Of a linear circle'

â€‹

Those are the ones I can name off of the top of my head because I love reading about the black family. But really to find fics where Harry hates voldemort is basically every single fic excluding some Harry/Bella or some Harry/Snape and the whole of tommary. I would suggest searching old threads for fics where harry is powerful as usually he hates Voldy in those fics. WBWL is something to avoid then because the majority of the good ones have Voldy as a dad to Harry.

If you do see it could you please tell any good and long black family fics you know excluding the ones i listed.
