  74 lives since his original, Harry Potter, or the being that once went by that name, is tired. He has had enough, yet his lives continue. Now, he's reborn into a very different life than many of the others he's had. Once again he's got to save the world... With a bit more. Now, he's got to save the Galaxy... Because he's the Chosen One... again. Will he never get a break?
