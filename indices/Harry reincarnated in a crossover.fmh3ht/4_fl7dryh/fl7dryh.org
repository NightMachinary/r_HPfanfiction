The only ones I have that probably fit that description - I don't remember how much memory Harry has of his life as Harry - are linkffn(Uekibachi Koyoko by yorushihe), in which fem!Harry is reincarnated in the Narutoverse, and linkffn(Dusk to Dawn by reighost), in which Harry is reborn as Sawada Tsunayoshi in the Katekyo Hitman Reborn! universe. I didn't care much for the first one, and I don't know enough about KHR to have enjoyed the second one that much.
