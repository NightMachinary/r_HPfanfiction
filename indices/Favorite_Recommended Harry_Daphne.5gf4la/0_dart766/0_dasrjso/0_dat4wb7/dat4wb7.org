We still get a lot of discussion on some threads but ones likes ths come up every week. When posted this was actually the second Harry/Daphne request thread in 12 hours. No-one wants to rehash all their Haphne favourites and reasons again and again but I guarantee that if you replied to someone asking about a fic they'd recommended then you would get the discussion you want.
