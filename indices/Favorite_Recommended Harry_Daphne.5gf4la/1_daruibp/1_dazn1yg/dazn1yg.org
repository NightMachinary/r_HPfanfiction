Thanks for recommending Whispers in the night, it's fast becoming one of my favorite fanfics of the year! I love stories that have a Bill Weasley that acts as a friend / older brother character to Harry, and I'm a big fan of mature rated stories changing the age of the characters so that the whole narrative makes more sense and doesn't feel dirty to read.
