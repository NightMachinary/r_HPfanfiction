The meat of it is set during GOF. It features a lot of Weasley/Ferret/Hermione/Neville bashing. I have read it a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the few typos and dashes replacing quotation marks in the first few chapters.

It also features several flashbacks in it to Harry's previous life, when he was married to Daphne, and the events that follow on.
