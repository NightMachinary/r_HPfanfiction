linkffn(Passageways by jerrway69; Passageways Redux) comes to mind. Haven't read it in a while, but it should be at least decent. The original got abandoned in favour of a rewrite, which hasn't got very far yet.

linkffn(Ouroboros by Voice of the Nephilim) is good quality, though that one stops before much happens and doesn't seem like updating soon. There's part of the next chapter on WbA though...

Finally, I'd suggest checking some of the communities on ff.net, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Bellatrix/19637/99/0/2/0/0/0/0/][this one]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/First-Rate-Harry-and-Bellatrix-Fanfics/108333/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][this one]] come to mind. I'm not even going to /try/ to vouch for the contents, but IIRC there's at least a few good ones for varying definitions of good.
