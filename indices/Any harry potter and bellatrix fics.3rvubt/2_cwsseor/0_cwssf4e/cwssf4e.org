  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.
