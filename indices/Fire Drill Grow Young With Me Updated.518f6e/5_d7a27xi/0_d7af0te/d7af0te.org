Hey, I'm the author! I heard about this subreddit from some people and finally got an account. I just wanted to say that I get why you'd view it like that, and it that's my own fault, really. I didn't want Hermione to just info dump for 5 straight paragraphs and knew that it had to be broken up a bit by dialogue or Abby's thoughts. And unfortunately the only semi-interesting way I could think to do that was just have her be like 'wtf is going on' the whole time. Apparently not the best route.

I'm assuming you're talking about the part with Hermione, but I could be wrong! In general though, I think she was just very overstimulated in this chapter which caused her brain to freeze and tongue to loosen so that she was essentially questioning everything.

That's just my two cents though, but I thought you'd appreciate knowing that I was aware of it as well.
