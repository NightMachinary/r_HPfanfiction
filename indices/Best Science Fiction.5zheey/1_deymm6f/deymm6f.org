[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is by far my favorite HP/Sci-fi crossover. According to its author, the story is already finished, only waiting to be edited and uploaded.

--------------

Other noteworthy HP/Sci-fis:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/Blue-Magic][Blue Magic]], linkffn(8643565): Really good Mass Effect crossover, unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): The prequel to "The Stars Alone", so obviously.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): They have tech stuffs that were plainly impossible to make today.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354): A HP/Battle Star Galactica Crossover. Adama sucks in this story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10211577/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Alteran-Gift][Harry Potter and The Alteran Gift]], linkffn(10211577): This one is not a good fiction, and feels more like a manual to SG universe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/30/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality][Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality]]: Both magical and muggle worlds were illusions created by the Matrix.
