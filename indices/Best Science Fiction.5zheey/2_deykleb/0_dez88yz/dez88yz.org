Yeah, there are only a few science fiction universes I have seen with a decent volume of (readable) HP crossovers. Star Wars, Stargate, Star Trek (to a lesser degree), Mass Effect, and Firefly because Browncoat, Green Eyes.

Probably my favorite outside of those is linkffn(3983128), just a shame there isn't more of it.
