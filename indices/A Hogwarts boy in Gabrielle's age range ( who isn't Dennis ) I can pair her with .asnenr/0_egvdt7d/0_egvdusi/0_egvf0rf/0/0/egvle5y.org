Same question then, why does she need a pairing??

You obviously don't care who it is, you just need a name to fill out. So it can't matter at all for the plot.

Have you tried not pairing her? She can just be single. Or better yet, let her have "a boyfriend" who Harry (I'm assuming Harry is the MC?) never bothers to learn the name off. Hell, turn it into a running joke where it's a different kid every chapter.
