Well, I have a lot of fics for such occasions.

I can't recommend Slytherin Harry enough -

Linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry do? by Big D on a Diet)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do]]

This one is a really humorous series. It has gems like - " Snape, it can safely be assumed, despised children. Most teachers do, but Snape had elevated it to a state well beyond normal boundaries. With his rather /unique/ training in certain areas of magic and absolutely nil instruction in the area of teaching, Snape was to education what Voldemort was to life insurance. It had been eight years since the last official complaint against him, which said much for his campaign of intimidation."

Linkffn(Mistaken Identity by Silver Pard; A Mistaken Sorting by Silver Pard)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2870906/1/A-Mistaken-Sorting]]
