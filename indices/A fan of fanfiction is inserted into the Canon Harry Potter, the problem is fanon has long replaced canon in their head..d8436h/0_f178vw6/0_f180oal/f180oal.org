I can't remember the name of the fic, but I recently read one where Harry goes to Gringots to do an inheritance test and finds out he's related to Godric Gryffindor. He asks about the money, and the Goblins tell him Godric had so many descendants that the inheritance was split a long time ago, so basically all he gets is a boring certificate.

EDIT : Oh, I remember, it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003/1/Weeb][Weeb by Andrius]]. I didn't finish reading it because I got bored, but some parts were quite funny.
