It's like the fanfic wish fulfilment was "If only Goblins were like House Elves". Wealthy, independent, powerful warlike creatures with history of resentment and defeat grateful and humble? Because a kid is nice? Not likely.

Now, a shrewd, vengeful AND respectful young wizard with a brilliant plan is another story. But then you need a politics, magic and finance savvy HP, and that only works (for me) with time travelling. And even then, after deafening Voldyshorts, Harry was still a young lad, not a season political operator.

So yeah, no.
