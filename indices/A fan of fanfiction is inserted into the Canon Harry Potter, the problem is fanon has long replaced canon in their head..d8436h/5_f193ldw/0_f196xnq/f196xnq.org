Much worse.

The goblins are basically used a plot devices to pretty much remove any conflict. It usually starts with Harry meeting them and after showing just a little bit politeness they immediately do everything the can to help him

Its usually enough for Harry to call them by their name, but it can also be something like him greeting them with some cringy goblin greeting like "may your blade be bloodied and your vault fill with gold", sometimes he even goes further and makes the first Goblin he talks to his Account manager.

After that they usually start doing stuff like tell him about his real vaults that Dumbeldore has hidden from him, those are full of wealth and tomes and magical objects, none of which is ever going to be used, they also give him a long list of properties he own, none of which he is going to spend any significant amount of time in, then they offer to do a inheritance test on him, during which they discovered a lot of things, like the amount of lordships he's entitled to, all the marriage contracts he has, any hidden magical power he may have and all the life debts people owe him. Then they also remove any health problems he may have, like giving him nutrition potions, healing his Eyesight, removing the magical blocks Dumbledore placed on him And removing the soulpiece inside him.

This was just the very common stuff, whats also common is that they pretty much help him with any kind of problem he may have in the future, to the point where I have seen quite a few fics where they ended up destroying all of Voldemorts Horcruxes after meeting Harry.
