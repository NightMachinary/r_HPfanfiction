It's basically 'Harry gets the Muggle government involved' for people who don't actually want to involve a realistic government with realistic governing agendas. So they can 'Baffle them with Bureaucracy' but don't want any extra economic/military powers that magic is capable of, because goblins prefer medieval weaponry and already control access to all the money in the world.
