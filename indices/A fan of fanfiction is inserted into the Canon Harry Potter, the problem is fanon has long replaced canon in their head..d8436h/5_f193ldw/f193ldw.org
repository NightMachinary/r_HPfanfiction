I never realized the "Harry is friends with Goblins" trope was that prolific of a trope? Ironically, the only time I've come across it was when I was reading this Avengers/HP crossover. Harry wanted to bail out of England and live in comfortable obscurity in America, and Harry (apparently) had paid the Goblins back for all the mess he/Ron/Hermione caused with the bank heist in DH. It wasn't so much a "OhMANWhatACONSIderATEHUUUUmanYou'reAGOblinFriendNow" but a "Because you were respectful and owned up to your mistakes, we will grant you ONLY ONCE some help." And they sorted out all his paperwork and finances. And that was it.
