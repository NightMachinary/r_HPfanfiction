It is much better if you don't know. It's an absolutely terrible trope that is used by lazy authors as a crutch to make their already inevitably bland stories even blander.

If you must see how bad it can be (while still retaining passable grammar and sentence structures) you should go read anything written by Robst such as linkffn(Harry Crow). Then, preferably, go read your favorite good fanfic to get your mind off of it.
