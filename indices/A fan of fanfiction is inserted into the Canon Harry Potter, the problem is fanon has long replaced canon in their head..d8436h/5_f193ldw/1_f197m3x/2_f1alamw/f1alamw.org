Harry Crow is bad for multiple other reasons (non-stop curb-stomping any slight challenge, bashing, and bland, admiring girlfriend Hermione for like a bajillion pages). It pretty much starts the goblin friend Harry trope but also gets a pass from me on that particular sin, both because it wasn't a trope then and because the goblins actually have a reason to like and help Harry because they adopted him when he was a baby and consider him almost one of them as he's been raised in their culture. He doesn't just walk in a bank and be polite.
