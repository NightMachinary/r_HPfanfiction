The word you're looking for is fangirl.

Fangirls in general would be really shocked considering the males most popular with fangirls are people like Draco, Snape, or Tom Riddle. I can really see them being shocked that neither Draco or Snape are attractive in canon, and can really see a fangirl falling prey do the diarys manipulation.
