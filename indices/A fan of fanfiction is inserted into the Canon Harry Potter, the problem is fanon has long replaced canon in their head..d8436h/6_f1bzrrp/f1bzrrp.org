This gave me an idea: a person (say your typical stereotypically female Draco fangirl) is self-inserted into the HP universe the same generation as the main cast. Intent to pursue Draco Malfoy from the fanon view of him (attractive "bad boy" who merely needs a woman -- her -- in his life to thaw his poor heart). Only to be confronted with the one we see in canon -- a spoilt, arrogant, bully with no hidden benevolent depth.
