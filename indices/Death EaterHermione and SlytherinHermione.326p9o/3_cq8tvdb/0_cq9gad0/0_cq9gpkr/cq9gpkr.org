The only reason I know it is because it's on portkey, making the D/Hr scene even stranger. I skip almost every story that author has written b/c that one was so strange. They're almost all very AU and go against my own personal head-canon... the primary component of which is that Hermione would never betray Harry.

But, that's just my opinion. Several other readers love those kinds of stories and I'm happy for them.
