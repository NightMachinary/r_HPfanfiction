I don't think there's anything wrong with heavy AUs --- /Reign of The Serpent/ being a good example of one. The problem is incoherence. If Hermione is supposed to be this ruthless superwitch who leads Death Eater raids and assists Snape with Potions research by 15, then by golly, /write her like one/, even if she gets redeemed later through the Power of Love.

Alas. Like I said upthread, /Hermione in Slytherin/ is easy to find; but /Slytherin Hermione/ is not.
