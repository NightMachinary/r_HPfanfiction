That makes sense. In that context, the jinx on the DA parchment is a particularly nasty expression of her values.

  It is those values - I think - that make it so difficult to make a Slytherin Hermione fic that isn't utter rubbish.

It's not so much hard as that there aren't many people interested in writing Hermione-centric fic that isn't a (usually submissive on her part) romance. The latter tend to not think about things like consequences of their premise, characterization, what different characters know and what they don't know, and what they are and aren't able to do, etc., with /The Green Girl/ and /In Too Deep/ being two handy examples.

Other than that, it's perfectly possible to be cunning, ambitious, and ruthless, without being overly treacherous. /Applied Cultural Anthropology/'s Hermione will most certainly take perfectly good care of her +minions+ friends.
