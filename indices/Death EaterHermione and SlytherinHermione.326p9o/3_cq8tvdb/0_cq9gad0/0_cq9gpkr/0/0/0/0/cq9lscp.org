No, not to just Harry or to other second party. I see her passionate about her values (although at a young age this almost immediately qualifies her for Mary-Sue status). She stuck with Harry and the haphazardly paced horcrux hunt because it lined up with what she thought was important despite Harry being extremely moody and Ron leaving prematurely.

So loyalty isn't just for the sake of being loyal, but it's showing kinship with people who share her values. It is those values - I think - that make it so difficult to make a Slytherin Hermione fic that isn't utter rubbish.
