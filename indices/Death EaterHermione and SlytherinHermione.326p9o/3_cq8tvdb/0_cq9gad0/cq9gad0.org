Interesting premise, but a very incoherent implementation. This hypothetical Hermione is stated to have /led Death-Eater raids/ by the time she was 15. That means that she's tortured and murdered people. Despite that, 1) Draco at that age, can keep up with her dueling, 2) she still needs to cast the Disarming Charm verbally, and 3) The Hat takes one look at her mind and decides that she's so full of love, she can't be anything but a GRYFFINDOR.

I really don't think the author has thought things through.
