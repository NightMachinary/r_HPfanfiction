Canon Hermione displays plenty of cunning and pragmatism in Gryffindor --- more than any Slytherin of her cohort, anyway --- and a lot of authors forget that, casting her as an inflexible, authority-worshiping rule-monger, or a pacific paragon of goodness, unable to hurt even her mortal enemies, so, I guess that any fic where she displays those "Slytherin" traits up to her canon level is refreshing.

At the same time, the fic goes beyond making Slytherins only blood-prejudiced against non-Slytherins; it has pretty much everyone /except/ Slytherins be blood-prejudiced against Hermione, which is downright jarring. I'll give it another shot, on your recommendation, but I remain skeptical. If you don't mind spoiling, what does the fic do with Death Eaters' agenda which, you might recall in DH, involved confiscating all of Muggleborns' wands?
