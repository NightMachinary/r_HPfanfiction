As someone who's been scouring the web for Slytherin!Hermione fics for years, and even took a crack at one of his own, my experience is that it's fairly easy to find fics with Hermione /in/ Slytherin, but *very* hard to find fics with a Slytherin!Hermione. /The Green Girl/ is a classic example of the former: yes, Hermione gets to wear a green necktie, and yes, she is still a Muggleborn, but none of the challenges of being a Muggleborn in Slytherin [1] ever materialize, because it turns out that Slytherins are A-OK with Muggleborns, as long as they are sorted into Slytherin. (I am not making this up or exaggerating. Even Lucius Malfoy likes her. *Their whole House* is OOC.) But, if Slytherin welcomes a stubborn Muggleborn witch with open arms more so than Gryffindor had in canon, what's the point of putting her there, unless you really like green?

Also, considering that meeting Draco on Hogwarts Express was one of the things that /kept/ Harry out of Slytherin, wouldn't Hermione meeting Draco have a similar effect?

Actually, now that I think about it, I can certainly see them getting in a shouting match, so that when Hermione puts on the Sorting Hat, it'd go, "Well, it looks like your heart's greatest desire is to make all the Purebloods acknowledge just how much better than them you are in every way, and to crush Draco Malfoy in particular. Have fun in SLYTHERIN!"

So, I sit corrected. Meeting Draco early /could/ end in her being sorted Slytherin.

Currently, /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][/Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/ by jacobk]]: ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

A promising fic: Hermione comes to Hogwarts with a bit of a grievance against the world: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402/1/][/The Snake Pit/ by cupcake0118]]: After she is expelled from her London prep school for setting a science lab on fire, Hermione Granger is visited by Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. Finally feeling as though she has found her place in life, Hermione travels to Hogwarts. But when she gets there, she is sorted into a house which despises the very blood which courses through her veins.

A very Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione comes to Hogwarts, with Harry in tow: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][/Labyrinth/ by Kroontjespen]]: The mind of a prodigy is a scary thing. Hermione Granger's however is downright terrifying. AU. Slytherin!Hermione, Slytherin!Harry

Not sure what to think about this one, yet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/1/][/The Stark Effect/ by NexusNebulous]]: In which the girl who might have been Hermione Granger is raised as Tony Stark's daughter, and the world is that much closer to imploding spontaneously. One know-it-all Stark was enough, thank you. *Includes other Marvel characters, i.e. XMen, Spiderman, etc.

Probably abandoned, but what's written so far is amusing: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5769888/1/][/Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter?/ by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel]]: Muggleborn Hermione Granger is sorted into Slytherin, but after a nasty prank goes wrong and gives her red eyes, her classmates become convinced that she's the Dark Lord's heir.

Interesting premise, but awkward writing, because the writer is not a native speaker: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8137134/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents/ by CreatorZorah]]: At the age of five Harry turns into a snake. Five years later he saves a girl named Hermione.

Abandoned, but can be viewed as an interesting character study: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8094421/1/][/Wake of War/ by JeanHermioneSnape]]: 'Wake of War' is a story about a Slytherin Hermione Granger falling in love with her Potions Professor, while dodging the bad blokes and gals, some revenge plans and an evil mastermind, which will remain nameless for a while - let me know if you figure it out, just beware it isn't the obvious name. Enjoy your reading of 'Wake of War!

A heavy AU, where Hogwarts doesn't have Houses, but Hermione might as well be a Slytherin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][/Reign of the Serpent/ by AlphaEph19]]: AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

DeathEaterIsh!Hermione, though probably abandoned: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614738/1/][/Darkest Witch of Her Age/ by darkrose0510]]: Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.

[1] You know, the House that produced almost all the Death Eaters, and whose members openly cheer for Slytherin's Monster to purge Hogwarts of Muggleborns,
