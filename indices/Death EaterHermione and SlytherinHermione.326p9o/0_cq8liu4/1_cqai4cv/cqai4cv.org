This may sound a bit weird, but are any of the above specifically /not/ Dramione- or pairing-related? I'm interested in reading about Slytherin!Hermione or Dark!Hermione myself, but I'm decidedly uninterested in Dramione [or Snamione, for that matter]. Yet most of the Dark!Hermione fanfictions seem to revolve around, or include, Dramione.
