Not weird at all. I have a very similar filter. Pretty much the only way I'm OK with Dramione if Draco is Hermione's "minion with benefits". (Well, OK, I am exaggerating a bit, but only a bit.) So, these fics have already been filtered for the rich badboy / bookish ing√©nue Dramione pairing.

In terms of specific fics, Dramione is likely in /The Snake Pit/, if it ever gets written, but the dynamic would probably have Hermione on top, so to speak; /Reign of the Serpent/ is possibly, but unlikely, Dramione, albeit with twists; and /Wake of War/ has a Dramione moment, though it's more of a casual encounter, and it never gets to Snamione. In /The Stark Effect/, IIRC Draco is friendly (because Starks are well-connected) but no romance. In the others, Hermione is more likely to hex Draco than to kiss him.
