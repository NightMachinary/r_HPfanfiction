I doubt Dumbledore would interfere with their research as long as the Hogwarts ghosts weren't affected. He has no love for Dementors and couldn't give a care what the Ministry wants. He'll disavow any sense of responsibility for their plans as it has nothing to do with breaking Hogwarts rules, and would probably stand right next to them, chuckling as the Minister whinged about losing the cheap labour of having Dementors as prison guards.

If Dumbledore was the restrictive sort for the sake of political leverage, he would have shut down the twins' prank research well before they started product testing. He is not, and gets great delight in seeing his students invent, develop or create something he hadn't considered before.

So yeah- completely out of character.
