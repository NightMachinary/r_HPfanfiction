I think Dumbledore is oOC the moment he discourages research. He is a researcher himself and a teacher to boot. He comments on interesting magic throughout the books and delights in seeing his students invent and further their knowledge.

A scene with him dancing a jig in celebration of the dementors demise is also completely within character. On several occasions he comments on the sheer wrongness of their existence.

I can see some ministry dudes being miffed about something that could cause Azkaban to fail them. If these wizards are close to Harry, I could even see them be persecuted by Umbridge and painted as scapegoats after the breakout from Azkaban.

As to what Ray could get away with in his Defense class... don't worry too much. It can't be worse than Lockhart.
