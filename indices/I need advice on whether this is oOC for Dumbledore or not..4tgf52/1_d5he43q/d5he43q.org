Death's relationship to magic is one of the things I think Dumbledore understands extremely well, he'd probably be very supportive of their research so long as the ghosts souls/spirits were not destroyed.

And I definitely think he'd be supportive of anything that would stop Dementors 'cause he hates those things. Not sure if your fic is set during the war, but I don't think he cares about alienating the Ministry in peacetime, but possibly in wartime he'd prefer not to risk losing the Ministry's cooperation.

If you need Dumbledore as a foe, I think an in-character way to get him to disapprove of the research is if they inadvertenly find a way to destroy souls, something akin to Horcruxes, and I think Dumbledore would be justifiably wary of that sort of thing.
