Thanks for the feedback! I wrote the first chapter very quickly one day when I had a burst of inspiration, so I know I didn't do a very good job of showing not telling. About the stuff that uncommon in the UK, like I said in an earlier reply, it's hard to know that stuff as someone from the US. And, for the excessive punctuation, since it's not going to be something big and actually published, I'm going to keep it as it's just for fun.
