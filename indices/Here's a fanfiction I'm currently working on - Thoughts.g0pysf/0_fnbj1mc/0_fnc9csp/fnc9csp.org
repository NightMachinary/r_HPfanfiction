I didn't read the op post but your criticism made me certain that I won't. I am writting a fic right now, would you mind doing this for me?

(Shamelessly asking for a beta because I need it). I currently sit at 43k words published (another 9ish ready for next week). With chapters around 5k works. Here is a link if you want to give it a read!

P.s. major au, no major divergence yet on plot.
