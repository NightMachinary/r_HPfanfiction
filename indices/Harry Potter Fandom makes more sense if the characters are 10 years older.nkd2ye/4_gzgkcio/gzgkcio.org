I disagree. First, it makes no sense waiting until their twenty to start their magical education, but I think the pacing is right as is. Harry doesn't get taught how to fight until second year, and even then (had Lockhart been competent), all he would've learned is Disarm and Block. In the wizarding world, that's vital. Of course, other students learn more complex spells around 1st to 2nd year. Hermione paralyses Neville, and Draco summons a snake, but considering their characteristics, that makes sense. Hermione wants to learn more; Draco has friends who wouldn't mind teaching him how to summon a venomous snake.

As for the later stuff. Sure, it doesn't make sense for a kid to go through the tri-wizard tournament, but he wasn't supposed to anyway. JK Rowling could've been more specific as to why he couldn't join, and fanfictions which make the GoF more powerful and dangerous fix that imo. And Harry starting Dumbledore's Army... that's more like a tutoring gig than an actual militant organisation. As much as it sounds like they're training for war, they're not really. They're not learning how to be soldiers, they're learning how to protect themselves from someone who had to protect themselves. Harry just turns out to be pretty good at it. And yea, no adult would trust a kid to lead a militia, but adults aren't, other fifteen year olds are, and zi don't know about you but teenagers tend to be idiots, so them trusting Harry makes a lot of sense.
