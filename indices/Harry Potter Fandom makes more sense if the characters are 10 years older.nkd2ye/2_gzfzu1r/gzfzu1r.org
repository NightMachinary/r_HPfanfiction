I mean we're used to teen novels where they go on this huge adventures and shit. But yeah, agreed. Things like the challenges in Philosopher's Stone is kinda easy to see.

But the basilisk? No shit. And the Tri-wizard Tournament? Why the fuck would you even let teenagers compete in something like this?

And how can a 15 yo teen be more knowledgeable than his older peers? Like Cho, for example and Fred and George and Lee. No matter how much stuff he went through, he doesn't have the sheer knowledge. He can't even do non-verbal spells.

Anyways there's a lot of shit that would have been way better if they were older.
