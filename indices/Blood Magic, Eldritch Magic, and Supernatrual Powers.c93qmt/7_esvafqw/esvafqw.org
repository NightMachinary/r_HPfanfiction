Well, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse) is pretty decent, but it has more than a few unfortunate tropes and is abandoned to boot. That said, what is there deals a lot with Necromancy and the magic of death, so that's a plus. Also has some of the cooler magical artifacts I've seen in fics.
