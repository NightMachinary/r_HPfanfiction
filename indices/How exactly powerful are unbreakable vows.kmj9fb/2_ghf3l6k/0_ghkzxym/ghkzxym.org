I like your way of thinking. I read a story once where they needed to get a potion ingredients from a freshly slain basilisk and something that was brought up was that after the eyes of it were removed, carefully as they couldn't do so while looking at them they placed them in a bag. Someone asked if the eyes would kill while the basilisk was dead and they weren't connected to it anymore and the response was no one knows, do you want to find out?
