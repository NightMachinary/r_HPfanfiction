If I were writing about unbreakable vows I think I'd make it so that the characters themselves are also quite sketchy on the details. Realistically even if you personally know someone who has made an unbreakable vow, and they later died, you can't know for certain what actually caused them to die and whether it was even related to the vow or not. That's what makes them risky, because it's not super understood how or why they work, only that they supposedly do.
