FILFY teacher - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool Dxd crossover: Despite the title, it's actually a really interesting story that has good action, romance, and family elements.

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - linkffn(11157943) - My favorite Star Wars crossover (not that I read that many). I just really enjoy the character dynamic used.

What's a Gungan? - linkffn(13569941) - Star Wars crossover - Also a fun fic that is really well done. Strong character dynamics.

Pack - linkffn(13391615) - Jurassic Park crossover - I am pushing it a little with this one as it occurs at the very end of the third task. But it is an interesting story for sure. Lot's of wizarding bashing though.

Kicking Gotham - linkffn(13521865) - DCU crossover - A really good story and does a good job balancing both worlds.

When Harry met Wednesday - linkffn(11674317) - Addams Family Crossover - I gritter take on the hp universe with the Addams around.

Crestfallen - linkffn(8310486) - Marvel Crossover - There is no pairing in this, just to be clear. But it is a well-done story.

Finding Home - linkffn(8148717) - Marvel Crossover - Another good Marvel Crossover.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781) - Marvel Crossover - Does an amazing job uniting both HP and Marvel universe and makes use of the characters well. It's a very enjoyable story.

Shining Light - linkffn(7125352) - League of Legends Crossover - It's incomplete but I enjoyed seeing Harry and Lux interact with each other.

And yeah that is my list, I hope you enjoy at least one of these.
