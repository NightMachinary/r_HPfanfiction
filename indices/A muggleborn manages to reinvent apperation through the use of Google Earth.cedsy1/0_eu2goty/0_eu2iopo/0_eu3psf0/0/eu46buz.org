I kinda like the idea that all those unpleasant feelings in case of using apparation are due to magic accelerating/decelerating you to match the Earth's movement - and if you overdo it its gonna turn from unpleasant to downright deadly (and the whole process has to take max 2-3 seconds)

Still you could use something like Google Earth to help yourself travel, it's just the apparating across long distances would require making several stops inbetween starting point and final destination (and cross-ocean would be either risky or impossible due to distances)

The portkeys on the other hand don't have a time limit of how long can the journey take, so, while unpleasant, they can take you basically anywhere - and that also gives a good reason for such method of travel to exist (since why would you have portkeys if you can just teleport yourself without use of an additional object?)
