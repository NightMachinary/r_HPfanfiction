It depends on which details you have to visualize. Let's say you want to apparate from London to somewhere on the equator. You use Google Maps to get a good visualization of the city center of Quito, Ecuador (about one mile from the equator) A long distance which may have large power requirements, but that's all you need right?

 

Arguably it's not even close. Does this visualization of surrounding buildings also magically fix height differences between your starting and ending locations? While London is 36 feet above sea level, Quito is 9,350 feet. Being wrong on this point would see you far too deep underground for anyone to possibly rescue you. Or, if you do successfully apparate, that sort of sudden air pressure change will render your lungs useless if you aren't prepared for it.

 

Even assuming you make it in one piece to your destination, there are still other problems. Going from London to the equator means you'd have to near turn yourself perpendicular whilst apparating in order to arrive right side up (and indeed a trip from London to Australia would necessitate going upside down). Also, everything in Quito is moving much faster than everything in London due to the nature of the Earth's rotation (in the same way that the outside of a record is spinning faster than the inside of the record; while they complete one full "rotation" at the same time, the outside covers much more distance than the inside). So you also have to magically compensate, speeding yourself up to match local conditions.

 

You could of course just say it's all magic and hand-wave it away as automatically taken care of. Personally, the way I like to think of it is this. Apparation and portkeys are basically the exact same bit of magic, the latter just applied to an object. The reason portkeys exist at all is that, even ignoring power requirements, apparating farther than anything local is /really very dangerous/ and /ludicrously complicated/. And there is no real reason to do that hard work and take those enormous risks when you can instead take a portkey, made by people whose whole livelihood is based on making those sorts of calculations.
