Okay look. Here's a list. Some might be "good", some are meh. I can't even say anymore. Most will be very famous. For me, that part of my fanfic reading past is now all just a blur of discarded school uniforms, things being "grasped", and lots of panting.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi

Huge and stupid. Infamous. Sets the gold standard for mushing as many females into a pile as possible. Probably wanted by INTERPOL for international sex trafficking.

Fundamental entry in the "soul bond" genre. The classic big dumb soul bond story. Known to cause cancer in the state of California.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

I don't even remember this one. Says multi. Lots of favs. As far as I remember, does what it says on the tin.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

Until I checked my list, I didn't even realize this one was finished. That is how much I care about harem fics. Some of the new ideas here are interesting, but it isn't exactly the most tightly plotted thing ever.

Still being updated, has a dark sort of approach. Dumbledore isn't a good guy, if that wasn't clear. A bit of DLP bait, but not a bad new idea for plots. The most extreme AbusedLuna I've ever read, possibly too over the top. zArkham is an idea leader in what he does.

Whew! Hope that helps some.
