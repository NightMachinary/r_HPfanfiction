If you want a "believable" Harem where girls all have their own personality and backstory. Where you can't just swap one name for another and have the exact same sex scene... One that pokes fun at other harems, and cliches in general...

Then you want something like my 'Searching for the Power' on ffn or hpff or ficwad *shameless self plug*

There are a whole lot of the other kind though, most Harems are just an excuse to write porn. Mine is more like a good Anime harem (but with sex instead of unresolved tension)
