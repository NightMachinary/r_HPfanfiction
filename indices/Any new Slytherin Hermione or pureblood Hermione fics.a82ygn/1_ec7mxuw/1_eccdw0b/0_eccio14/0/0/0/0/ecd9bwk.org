Harry kind of starts off with Ron's attitude at the beginning but he slowly starts to get better, Draco and Hermione are different but are a family is the most important thing type of character. And there is some conflict between the characters but I wouldn't call them antagonists of each other. The story mainly follows the books for the first two although I suppose you could consider Remus an antagonist in the third book, and the third book is where the story takes a somewhat major diversion from canon
