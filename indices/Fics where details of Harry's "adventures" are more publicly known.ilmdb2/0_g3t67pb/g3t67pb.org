Honestly, Harry should have got an Order of Merlin First Class for every book.

Edit: Lily should also have gotten a posthumous one for taking out Voldie the first time, and James at least a Second Class for trying to attack Voldemort bare handed to protect his family. Didn't work, but the man had guts.
