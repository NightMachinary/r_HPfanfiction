linkffn(Like a Red Headed Stepchild) was written by a prompt here, basically, what if Harry has red hair like his mum.

I think, /I'm not sure/, that linkffn(Breaking Down the Shyness) was inspired by a prompt here, as what if Daphne was really just a shy girl behind her Ice Queen mask.

I'm pretty sure there a few more, but I can't remember right now.
