  Because it's not really a betrayal and because Ron is a better friend to Harry than Harry to Ron (or Harry to anyone really)

Now that's just some straight up nonsense, don't get me wrong /no-one/ is a particularly good friend to anyone in the original books (honestly do we even know what anyone does together for fun that makes sense for them to be hanging out? Quidditch and chess is the only thing that comes to mind). But if we're just counting risking lives for each other Harry has a hell of a lead over Ron, even just the willingly committing suicide out of love for his friends certainly wins out over anything else in the series.
