Harry could have not gone after Ginny, or not given his triwizard winnings to Fred and George, or not forgiven Ron no questions asked when he was being a prick about the cup/the horcrux hunt, or not have saved Arthur's life, or not have /willingly committed suicide for him/.

Don't get me wrong, Ron willingly going with Harry on those adventures is all good, barring some childish jealousy Ron is a loyal stalwart friend through most of the books. He is most certainly not giving more for Harry than Harry has given for him though.

Also I love the idea that Ron is a better friend to Harry than vice versa because Ron goes with Harry into dangerous situations. Never mind they were going after his little sister in book 2, it was Ron's rat and Ron being dragged off by Sirius in book 3, Ron was never in danger in 4 and in book 5 several other people beside him volunteered to save Sirius as well. And after that it's made incredibly clear that even though Harry is the chosen one in book 6 and 7 Ron himself says its nothing to do with Harry and he's on the chopping block for being a blood traitor. So we have what, the stone in book one (seeing as hermione wouldn't have been in the toilet without Ron being a dick the troll bit gets a pass). Then the Sirius rescue in book 5 and that's it. Jeez man it's a shame Ron didn't give up on Harry after the first book. If he had he'd have avoided.... Well Ginny would be dead, he'd probably be dead between Sirius, pettigrew and lupin with no wolfbane and his father would be dead.
