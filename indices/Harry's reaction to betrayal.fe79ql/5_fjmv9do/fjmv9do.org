I guess it would depend of the "level" of betrayal.

If it's just something along the lines of his dispute with Ron in GoF, nothing. Because it's not really a betrayal and because Ron is a better friend to Harry than Harry to Ron (or Harry to anyone really), risking his life several time for him and always there when really needed.

If it's a "true" betrayal, I would think he would react pretty much like when Sirius died. A lot of crying, but also destroying absolutely everything in his reach at the same time.
