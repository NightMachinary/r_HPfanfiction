See, the thing is that Voldemort in canon had a point when he said its not about good or evil, but about power. But it wasn't ironically the one he intended. Good and evil are like many things "in the eye of the beholder." Dumbledore got many of his positions in canon not only because of his magical power, skill and experience, but also because of the contributions he made to the Wizarding World. In other words, people /perceived/ him as good.

For Dumbledore to be "evil" in any real capacity, it would mean he would need to have either: 1) fooled the majority of the population (including other more "evil" people) into thinking he was good when he was not; 2) created a grand conspiracy involving magics and ridiculously complicated plots that make canon look like planning a day trip; or 3) the Wizarding World is generally cool with "evil" behavior, and thus doesn't describe it as such (meaning the protagonist holds what would be considered "evil" viewpoints in context).

All of these things are quite frankly hard to buy in a real sense for a number of reasons: the wizarding world generally has similar moral sensibilities as the muggle world with only slight variations due to magic, British history would likely have to be very different from what we see in canon, magical deception on such a scale is far too OP, etc.

Writers don't usually want Dumbledore to be evil, at least as we think of it. What they want is to either create a temporary antagonist for the main character (see: every Indy!Harry fic), show off how powerful the main character is (i.e. going up against the "Greatest Sorcerer in the World"), provide reader/author catharsis for outsmarting Dumbledore, or all of the above. This usually doesn't need him to be "evil," but rather depicts him as overtly manipulative and trying to decide everything for everyone, something very dissimilar to canon.

I guess what I am saying here is that Evil Dumbledore is usually not what authors/readers want for their fics, and usually just use him as a ridiculous stand-in for conflict where none exists. Bashing stems from people taking the worst (or perceived worst) characteristics in characters and magnifying them as if they are the only aspects of these people. And bashing, without indelibly redefining the characters history and nature, does not create enjoyable or believable characters to read (in my opinion).
