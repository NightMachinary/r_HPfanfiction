I'm usually pretty disappointed by evil Dumbledore fics - they tend to go with him being manipulative, and not really giving him any actual competence /or/ motivations.

There's two routes I think would be fun - a morally grey one or a dark one. For the morally grey one, I'd like to see it as Dumbledore having (self-explanatory) convinced himself that he's the only one that can stop the dark wizards out there - famously Grindelwald, then the incompetent ministers and their failings to answer to Voldemort, etc. That builds up to him /actually/ taking power/most of the power - a few steps further than canon- where it seems he has all these titles and positions just because of prestige, but doesn't /do/ anything with them. Instead, this Dumbledore would really be the puppet master behind the ministry - using it like a game of chess against Voldemort and other presumptive dark lords. A twist on this one that could be fun is having Voldemort and the purebloods be a reaction to Dumbledore - namely, the way he's curtailing ancient rights and privileges as a way to both weaken his prospective enemies and strengthen his own position. But in the process, in the classic aristocratic reactionary mind, it actually /causes/ the very thing he was doing it to stop.

The second, the dark one, I'd like to see take another turn. Whereas the first one has Dumbledore doing what he genuinely thinks is the right thing - just with no moral qualms about squashing the Dark - this one would have him be dark from the start. His disagreement with Grindelwald would be both from the methods and the one in charge - this Dark!Dumbledore would want to have himself in charge of everything for personal power, and the way to do it would be through putting himself in the system and slowly taking full charge of it, instead of a revolution. If this Dark!Dumbledore is to be the real antagonist, an interesting aspect to explore here would be a Voldemort that was fully crafted by Dumbledore (either literally or figuratively). Having a dark lord out in the open, after all, works so well to unite people behind Dumbledore /and/ brings other opponents out in the limelight. In this, Voldemort could be a full charade, or just a nice little bogeyman to have around to help justify Dumbledore taking more and more control...

I think those characterizations would make a lot of sense, and be interesting to read about.
