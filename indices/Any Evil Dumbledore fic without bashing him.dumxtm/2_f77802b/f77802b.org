If you don't mind Remus/Sirius then linkao3(Do Not Disturb by fluorescentgrey) and its sequel are both excellent portrayals of manipulative evil Dumbledore. It's an AU where Remus goes to Azkaban instead of Sirius and I really can't rec it enough; the things Dumbledore does in it are frankly kind of horrifying in their level of disturbing and underhandedness. It's very subtle but very powerful, really.
