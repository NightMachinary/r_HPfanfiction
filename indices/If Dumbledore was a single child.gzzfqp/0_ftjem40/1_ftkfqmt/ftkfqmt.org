  maybe with Ephilias Doge, maybe not.

From what I remember, Albus friendship with Ephilias is at least partly due to the fact that they were both social pariah when they started Hogwarts (Albus because of his father, and Ephilias because he was just healing from the dragonpox et was still a bit green).

Without his father going to Azkaban, people would not wait for Albus to show his genius before approaching him and maybe he would have made another friends at school.
