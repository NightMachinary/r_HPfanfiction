If Albus were an only child, then a lot of things would have been different.

His father would not have been sent to Azkaban, because there would have been no Arianna to be injured by Muggle boys, and therefore no Muggle boys to take revenge on.

Percival not dying in Azkaban and Kendra not dying by one of Arianna's outbursts means that the Dumbledore family, while not affluent, may not in such a precarious situation. Albus could go on his world tour, maybe with Ephilias Doge, maybe not.

There would be no need to have to relocate to Godric's Hollow either. And that means no direct connection to Bathilda Bagshot.

Maybe Albus encounters Gellert, maybe he doesn't, but Albus won't be "trapped" by the responsibility of caring for Abeforth and Arianna in this timeline.
