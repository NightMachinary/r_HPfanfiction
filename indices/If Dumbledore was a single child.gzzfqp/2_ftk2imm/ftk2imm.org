Best case scenario is that he stands up to Grindlewald much sooner than he did canonically. Like, if Dumbles bodies him in 1935 instead of 1945 then that's 10 years of peace that otherwise wouldn't exist.

Worst case scenario is that, since he didn't learn from his dalliance with Grindy that he absolutely cannot handle even a small bit of political power, he wouldn't have resisted taking the post of Minister when offered it and he becomes the tyrant that he feared that he canonically (? Is this fanon? I don't fucking know anymore.) feared he would be.
