linkffn(Morning in the Land of Nod)

It's incomplete, woefully short, and not so much a Mad Max crossover as it is heavily inspired by Max (and a significant amount of David Bowie, but that's neither here nor there), but I've written the first two chapters of something that might be what you're asking for. As far as I've planned there are no pairings, since most of the fic centres around the parent-child relationship between Harry and Rose.
