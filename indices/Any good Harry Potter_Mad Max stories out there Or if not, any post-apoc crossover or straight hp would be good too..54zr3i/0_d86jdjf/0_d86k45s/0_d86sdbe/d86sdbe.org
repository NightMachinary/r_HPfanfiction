Currently, the biggest reference is to Diamond Dogs and Bowie's Halloween Jack persona, but there's been reference to the Thin White Duke, Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, and a significant amount of the fic takes place in Berlin, where Bowie had one of his most creative periods and put out the "Berlin Trilogy" (Heroes, Lodger, and Low). So, yeah, there's a pretty heavy influence, if I'm to be honest.
