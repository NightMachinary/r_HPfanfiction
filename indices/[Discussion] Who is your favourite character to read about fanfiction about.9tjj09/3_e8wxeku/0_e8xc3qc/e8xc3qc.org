I agree, the problem I run into often is that most fanfics revolving around him having Dumbledore assign some girl to save him from himself. Although I appreciate a redemption story line cause i am sappy like that, after the first couple of fanfics I kinda just want to read one where we are in his perspective as he grows to be the character we met in the books/movies.
