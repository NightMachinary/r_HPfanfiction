I enjoy reading stories that focus on Tom Riddle and/or Voldemort. He can be a fascinating character in the same vein as Hannibal Lector or Lex Luthor; a look at what an intelligent and charismatic person can be when they discard the rules of conventional morality as set down by society.

Riddle and his horcruxes also make a great framing device to explore philosophical concepts like ethics, identity, fate vs. free will, nature vs. nurture, etc.
