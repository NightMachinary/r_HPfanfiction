Ditto. Snape is the entire reason I'm still in fandom, because he's a fascinating character and even now not all of his stories have been told. I'd like to see more complex fics about his upbringing and how his anti-Muggle feelings evolved (was he the classic small weird street kid whose life was made absolute hell by the neighborhood bullies?); why he styled himself the Half-Blood Prince in school when by rights he should have been ashamed of his Muggle blood (did he have a brief period of pushing back in frustration because he was tired of being treated like shit by his pureblood housemates?); how much his mother influenced his knowledge of the Dark Arts, and so on. He invented spells as a teenager; where did that experimental talent go? He was really bloody poor; I'd like to see writers who understand English industrial poverty tackle his family's home life. Did both his parents die young(ish)? There's so much to explore.

I'd like to see more fic detailing his evolving relationship with Dumbledore and the eleventh-hour shift in his moral compass to the tantalizing admission 'Lately, only those whom I could not save.' I would especially love to see more fic about that dreadful year as headmaster. He must have known he wouldn't make it out alive, and the only question about his death was when, not if. Plus, however much of a misanthrope Snape was, being hated by absolutely everybody, and knowing the people who used to be his colleagues might actually kill him one day, would have to be harrowing.

Anyway, yeah. He's a great source of drama, and the challenge of making him less of a caricature and more of a person is part of the appeal to me.
