Severus Snape. Terrible, terrible person, but definitely a story-mine. He's a double agent! He's competent! He loves the Dark Arts! He has a terrible past! He was on the right side all along! I like it when he gets explored, whether it's by apologists or detractors, but most especially by those who explore all aspects.
