Ron. I feel like there's a lot left on the table to explore with his character. His humor is a big plus for me, and i remember thinking how much charm his character had compared to others when I first read the series. I enjoy his place among the trio, sort of a emotional core of the group..the morale. It's rare you see a guy in positions like this in fiction. He's a bit of a mother hen, while being unbelievably brave to the point of recklessness for those he cares for. It's great to see fanfics that explore that, but alas few do.
