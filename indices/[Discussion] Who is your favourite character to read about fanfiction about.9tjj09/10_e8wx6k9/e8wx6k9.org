Harry and Hermione because I find them relatable. Also Hermione is a ruthless bitch and I love her for that.

The Tonks family is a goldmine for original plots due to combining Black family stuff, Ministry/Auror stuff, the support of and fight against Pureblood supremacy and neutrality. They do not seem to be poor. Money to make things happen is available to a certain degree , so you aren't constrained from that angle.

Also Lavender Brown. Went down fighting for what is right but has a horrible rep in the fandom due to hormones.
