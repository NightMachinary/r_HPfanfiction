Hermione. Because I really like her. She's not perfect but she can be passionate about what she believes in. I think the conflict she brings about the non-magical and magical world balances out everything. That everything is not perfect and just because you've gotten used to it doesn't mean you can't make a change. Plus, I just really like her with Harry.

Daphne. She is one of the most flexible characters in the HPfanfiction world. The different ways authors give her life and background story is so... interesting and refreshing. Each author has their different take on Daphne's personality and family.
