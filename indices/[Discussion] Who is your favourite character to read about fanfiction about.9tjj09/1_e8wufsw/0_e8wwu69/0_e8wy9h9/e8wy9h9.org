Yeah, I've read a few stories where she is much more open. Partners by muggledad; A Chance Encounter by spectre4hire; the Lion's trilogy by James Spookie are some of them. Dorothea Greengrass and Shygui also have different takes on her character in their stories, and all their fics are Haphne ships.

Haphne is my favorite HP pairing after Harmony.
