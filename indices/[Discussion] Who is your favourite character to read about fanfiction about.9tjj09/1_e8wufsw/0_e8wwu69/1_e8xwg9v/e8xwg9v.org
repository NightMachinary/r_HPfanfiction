Why the fuck do so many people write about Daphne? There's nothing I can think of her doing in canon. Hell, I only know her name cause of fanfiction. When I saw her the first time, I remembered something about her, but I couldn't think of anything about her but her name

She just seems like what people use instead of using OCs cause of the bias towards OC.
