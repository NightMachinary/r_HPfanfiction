I don't use her much (had her spy for Voldemort in one scene), so I might not be exactly representative for her fanbase.

BUT

Basically, she is a Slytherin girl to fill the "rich upper class" fantasies without having to rewrite a character like you would have to for Pansy or Bellatrix. She was not a known Death Eater, so you don't have to worry on that front either. She is the go-to default for "hot Slytherin chick" if you want to write a "political" story because she is a pureblood and not dirt poor like the Weasleys.

  She just seems like what people use instead of using OCs cause of the bias towards OC

Well, why invent horrible OC names when Rowling provided a neat list? Under ideal circumstances, you still ought to come up with some characterisation on your own. Then again, I write stories about Tonks, Lisa Turpin and Katie Bell, so I am abusing the hell out of that loophole.
