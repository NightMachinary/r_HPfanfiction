Sadly fanfiction either turns Hermione into a walking library or into a perfect human being that can do no wrong :( (or even worse: Into a domineering teacher's pet who abuses her fellow students by harshly punishing them for even putting one toe out of line!) and gets away with all kinds of things (where people normally put their feet down! "Till here and no further!")
