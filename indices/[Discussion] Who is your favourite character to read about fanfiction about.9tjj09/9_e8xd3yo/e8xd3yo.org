Aside from the obvious answers (Harry, Hermione) I really enjoy a well written Neville. Sadly often he's pretty flanderized, either as a super timid 1st year version of himself or an already developed super brave warrior.

For me the tension between these points is what's interesting. Like having him be reluctant to speak up in social settings but still harboring strong opinions and intervening. There's lots that can be done with that.
