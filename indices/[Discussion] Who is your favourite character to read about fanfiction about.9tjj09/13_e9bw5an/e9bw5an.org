Plain old Harry :) - sure Sirius is interesting, but more as supporting cast! Same for Tonks, Hermione etc.

Seriously, I seldom read fics that don't have Harry as the MC (unless they are self-inserts! I love those if well done (meaning the MC tries to fix a lot of things, but is not always successful and might even make things worse sometimes or uncover bigger problems - while still making headway and ultimately turning the tide (if that's the MC's goal - MCs that just want to survive and get rich and/or powerful are fun, too!))
