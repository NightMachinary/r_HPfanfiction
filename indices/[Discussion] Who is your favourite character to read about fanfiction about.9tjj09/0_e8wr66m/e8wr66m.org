Okay, like roughly 80 % of young women, i once heavily identified as Hermione, the shy bookworm. In addition she adds conflict because she grew up in a very different way compared to non-muggleborns. She should have realistic flaws though, like lacking certain background facts about wizarding life and not having great social skills.

I also like to read about Snape, because he is such an asshole. While he was kinda unrepentant about bullying children and only left the DE because the woman he loved was targeted, he tried to protect her son afterwards instead of becoming the worst person ever out of despair. Fanfics writing from the perspective of a non OOC Snape are not easy to find. Naming your son after him was still too much, Harry.

In general its not the characters that make me read a fic, but the plot, the more original the better.
