Cedric gasped as he hit the ground, one hand clenched tightly around the handle of the Portkey, the other gripping Harry's arm.

Harry...

Harry was dead...

It had been a trap. The entire Tournament had been a trap. The Cup had been a Portkey. Sent them right into the clutches of Voldemort and that weedy little servant of his...the one called Wormtail.

They had blasted Cedric and he had hit his head on a rock. By the time he'd come to, Harry was tied to a tombstone and that slimy servant was slashing at him with a knife and then that ritual...the potion from hell...

And Voldemort...and his Death Eaters. That snake Malfoy and that bastard Macnair and Crabbe and Goyle and Nott...devils...

Cedric had feigned death...tried to hear as much as he could without giving himself away.

And Voldemort had made Harry duel him. And their wands had connected. It was the strangest thing Cedric had ever seen...bodies had come out of Voldemort's wand...a Muggle man and a witch named Bertha Jorkins and...Harry's parents.

And then Lucius Malfoy had fired another curse--the Cruciatus Curse--and it had hit Cedric. And he had yelled and given away his position and he'd broken Harry's concentration. The connection had broken.

They had run for the Porktey. But Harry had fallen over Cedric when Cedric stumbled and hurt his leg even worse and Cedric accidentally grabbed Harry's wand in the confusion.

And Voldemort made to "kill the spare, properly," but Harry had stepped in front of the curse...

And then it had happened...

Cedric had grabbed Harry's body and his wand and ran for the Portkey. And the Death Eaters had been right on their tails...

A thunderous noise hit his ears. Yelling. War cries. Death Eaters? Those bloody bastards had managed to follow him. How was that possible? Did it matter? No, it didn't matter...Cedric had to protect Harry's body. He wouldn't let them use his friend for anymore of those rituals from hell. He couldn't fail again...

Cedric groaned weakly as he let go of the damned Portkey and reached for his wand. Or was it Harry's? He was bruised, bloodied, and trembling from the Cruciatus Curse. But he wasn't beaten. Cedric had shown restraint before...in the maze...and the graveyard...but not anymore. They had /killed/ Harry. This was war.

"You did it, my boy! You won!"

/Dad?/

"You did wonderful, Ced! Triwizard Champion!"

Damn the bloody Triwizard to the fires of hell. Cedric raised his head and saw his father smiling wider than he had ever seen him smile before.

"Dad..."

"A true winner! A champion! Best of the lot! Alright now, Harry up you get. Molly's in a right state about you...Harry?"

"Cedric!"

/Professor Dumbledore?/

"Cedric, what's happened?" Professor Dumbledore knelt beside him, his blue eyes blazing with purpose.

"Professor Dumbledore, I'm sorry...Harry...It was him..."

"Good heavens!" Minister Fudge appeared suddenly, at Dumbledore's side.

"They...they killed Harry..."

"Dead? Son, that can't be!"

There was more talking now. Lots more talking. Cedric could barely stand to hear any of it. Fudge wanted to talk to him. Cedric didn't want to talk to anyone.

"Cornelius, I will not allow Cedric to leave this courtyard."

"At least, the body has to be moved," Fudge answered. "People will panic if they see it. They're already starting to move. If too many see it--."

/It?!/

"HARRY'S NOT AN 'IT!'" Cedric bellowed. "I can't leave him! I won't!"

"He needs the hospital wing," a new voice interjected. Cedric looked up and saw Mad-Eye Moody. "Potter's dead, but Diggory's injured. I'll take him to the infirmary. We can go now."

"I'm not leaving my son," Cedric's father set his jaw. "I will not, Mad-Eye."

"I'm not leaving," Cedric grabbed Dumbledore's arm. "Sir...Voldemort...he said that one of his servants, his most faithful one, was here at Hogwarts."

"Boy, you're not talking sense," Moody interrupted. "The Dark Lord..."

/The Dark Lord?!/

There was a flash of red and Moody fell over, Stunned. Standing on one leg was a one-eyed, heavily scarred man with a look of pure hatred on his face.

"Headmaster," Alastor Moody whispered, hobbling. "If you'll help me retrieve my eye."
