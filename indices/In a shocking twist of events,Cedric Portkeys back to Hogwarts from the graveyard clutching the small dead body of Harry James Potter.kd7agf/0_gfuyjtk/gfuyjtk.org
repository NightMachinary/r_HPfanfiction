Cedric's breath was laboured. He was in shock as he tears fell for his once opponent, his classmate, his brief friend. Dead before him.

He barely registered the triumphant sounds of horns, the celebrating victory song, the cheers and applause. The abrupt stop.

​

The /screaming/.

​

"HARRY?! /HARRY!"/

​

It was the Granger girl, he thought. He didn't care. Nothing mattered. Everything was barely registered by him in favour of Harry's limp lifeless form and a harsh pounding in his chest. In his head.

​

'He's back he's back he's back HE'S BACK HE'S BACK HE'S BACK /HE'S BACK HE'S BACK HE'S-/'

​

"Diggory!"

​

Cedric startled, barely looking up. He met Headmaster Dumbledore's eyes and... never had he seen the old man. Look so broken. Never had he ever thought he would hear Professor McGonagall cry but a heart-wrenching wail of horror escaped her at the sight of her students body.

Snape stumbled backwards, looking sick. Moody... was grinning?

​

"What happened?"

​

"He's back..." Cedric muttered, so softly. Yet it pierced into the horrified silence. Everyone heard. "You-Know-Who's back..."

​

He looked around, dead eyed. Then he saw it. Saw Moody, saw how he started /grinning./ It clicked in place. How Harry's name had gotten into the Goblet of Fire. Who has changed the Portkey. Who had ensured things would go this way, that Harry would get so far just to die.

He was the one who he kept seeing talk to Harry out of class. Cedric's grief turned to rage and his wand was out before he knew what he was doing.

" AUFER ARMA!" A purple bolt of magic struck the wizard in the chest before he could react, his arms falling off. "DISCEDITAME!"

And with powerful blast that cut into the very dirt the bastard was thrown back.

​

"CEDRIC! STOP!"

​

"HE DID IT!" Cedric screamed. "HE SET HARRY UP! HE'S BACK BECAUSE OF /HIM/!"

​

Snape at least seemed to have some sense amongst the people present, immediately pointing his wand at the man, followed by a few others. Especially when they noticed the signs of bubbling on the teachers face.

​

"Professor Sprout." Dumbledore spoke, his voice grave. Cedric felt his heart ache, having never heard the man sound so broken. Cedric couldn't look at him, nor Hermione who was wailing uncontrollably, holding onto Ron who stood still, mouth open in horror. Several other Wealsey family members seemed to be doing one of the same themselves.

​

Draco Malfoy looked like he'd been hit with a sickness inducing hex, his face was green. He didn't look triumphant, he looked scared.

​

He didn't realize how long Dumbledore's pause was as all eyes darted between Moody who was being pinned down by the staff and Harry's body. Oh god, Harry' s...

​

The shock was beginning to wear off. Cedric felt the heaving in his chest as the tears began to start anew.

​

"Take mister Diggory somewhere to recover. I'll... talk with him soon."

​

Cedric was aware of hands on his shoulders, trying to steer him away. "W-Wait..." He took a breath. "Please, l-let me j-just... say sorry."

​

He wasn't sure why, but his request was granted, so he knelt down, his eyes meting those now lifeless green ones that had once been so kind and, even when riled, held a compassion in them. Gone now. No one would see that look again.

His heart clenched further as he closed the Boy-Who-Lived's eyes for one last time. "I'm sorry.... i'm sorry... It should have been me... i'm sorry..."

​

His eyes darted to the wand in Harry's hand. Somehow, Harry had the presence of mind when they'd arrived to unsheath his wand but hadn't gotten much further before it all went long. With a brief, sudden moment of clarity, Cedric pocketed the wand before standing up. He looked back and at that moment, he made a promise.

​

The Boy-Who-Lived may lay dead before him now, but Cedric would make sure in spirit, in ideas, in what he would of stood for... he would make sure that Harry lived on with him. No matter what, even if he had to face down You-Know-....

​

Even if he had to face down /Voldemort/ by himself to do so. He wouldn't let Harry's death be pointless.
