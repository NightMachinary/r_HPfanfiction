(Oh, that is good.)

​

"A horcrux...." Dumbledore muttered and his confused elation quickly turned back to dread. "Harry, are you sure?"

​

"Positive, sir." Harry nodded. He gulped. "He made... he made eight, including himself and I."

​

"This is...." Dumbledore sucked in a deep breath. "Come on, both of you need to get to the hospital wing. The other contestants as well it would seem."

​

"Harry..." Cedric muttered quietly. "I thought... I was so sure-"

​

"It's not your fault." Harry said. He said it quiet, yet so firm. Then the next thing he said loud, loud enough for everyone to hear. "It was Voldemort. Voldemort tried to kill me again."

​

The horrified reaction of the crowd was to be expected. Fudge was by fair the stupidest.

​

"Poppycock!" He cried, panicked. "He's j-just hit his head, probably wasn't even-"

​

"Don't say that!!" Cedric practically snarled, surprising even himself as he shock. Even with Harry back alive he was shuddering. "I could feel how cold he was!"

​

"But still-"

​

"Minister, with all due respect, stop being an insufferable dunderhead." Snape's voice shocked the crowd, especially with his tone. All turned to him and suddenly, they understood why. "After all, if they are lying then I must question, what was the point of this deception?"

​

And Snape nodded his head down to the man beneath his wand. It was no longer Mad-Eye Moody.

​

No, it was Barty Crouch Jr.

​

"Oh dear Merlin...." Fudge muttered, horrified. "But this doesn't-"

​

"If you truly think everyone will believe you now, with how many have just seen the proof here, I think you are sorely mistaken." McGonagall's voce rang out, finally having come back to her senses. "So for once in your life, Cornelius, don't make a fool of yourself."

​

Cedric looked down to see Harry had sneaked away during the confrontation. He was currently wrapped in a family group hug with the Weasleys and Granger. Even some of the other Gryffindors eventually broke in to hug him.

​

A profound relief washed over him, but only for a moment. There was so much that needed to be dealt with, clearly, and though Harry may have surived, Voldemort was still out there.

​

Though they may have grabbed the cup together in that maze...

​

Right now, there were no champions.
