(That is so good!! I'm gonna add on a tiny bit just for fun :))

Cedric looked away, tightening his fist around Harry's wand, and then on some strange instinct he looked back one more time.

Gasps erupted from onlookers, and Cedric felt his own jaw go slack as Harry- the same Harry who had been dead moments earlier-slowly blinked his eyes open and raised an arm to his forehead with a grimace. Then, he shot up straight and brandished his hand through the air, as if he were still holding his wand.

“Harry!” Dumbledore exclaimed, his voice full of bewildered astonishment.

The noise that erupted from the crowd was unlike anything Cedric had ever heard before. Students and teachers alike began screaming Harry's name, mixed with a lone garbled howl of fury and curses.

Cedric dropped weakly to his knees, then crawled over to the boy who'd apparently returned from the dead. He grabbed Harry's hand tightly in his own and watched the boy who refused to die gesture frantically towards Dumbledore. The old wizard crouched down opposite Cedric, took Harry's other hand, and leaned in. Against all the polite manners Cedric had been taught, he leaned in as well, his heart hammering wildly, and though what Harry Potter said next meant absolutely nothing to Cedric Diggory, his blood ran cold just the same.

“Sir... I am-was... a Horcrux. My Mom told me so. And I wasn't the only one he made.”
