That Dumbledore scene near the end of the first chapter has gotta be the funniest shit I've ever read.

  "He doesn't hate you Harry. Far from it in fact. I dare say that he sees some of your mother in you."

  'I dare say you are mentally handicapped.' Harry knelt forward and stared at the ground. He didn't want to open himself up to legilimency... if that is indeed what had clouded his mind just a minute before.

  "You see, Harry, I have taken it upon myself as your Magical Guardian to prepare a betrothal contract. It will be through marriage that you learn to love and finally bring Voldemort to heel."

  "Married! You picked my wife for me?" Through his shock, Harry briefly wondered which witch had been chosen by the Headmaster for this sacrifice. If it were Ginny or even Hermione then maybe this could work. Or Susan... even Luna... but wasn't dating and courtship and free will supposed to be part of marriage? This contract better not be for Pansy Parkinson.

  "Not quite, Harry. I believe Tom has been intimate with Mrs. Lestrange, perhaps with the wives of a few of his more loyal followers as well." The old man paused and scratched at his beard for a moment. "As the prophesy states, Harry, we are to employ the power he knows not meaning that love between a man and a woman may not qualify. You, Harry, are to bond with Severus. You shall take his name as the subordinate member of the union. We have been brewing a rare and rather remarkable potion which will allow you to bear an heir to the Snape line. Yes, I'm quite sure that Tom has done nothing remotely like this."

Edit: Holy shit it gets even better! Dumbledore polyjuices into students to get laid!
