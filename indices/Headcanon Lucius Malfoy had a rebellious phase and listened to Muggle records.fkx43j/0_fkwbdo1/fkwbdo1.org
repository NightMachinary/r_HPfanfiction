I've always thought a story about Draco going full punk after fifth year would really work.

He shows back up at Hogwarts suddenly embodying the spirit of Sirius Black and nobody knows what to do about it. Really I just want people to spot Malfoy lurking around muggle London listening to really edgy music about fighting the system.
