Harry turned to Daphne in exasperation.

"Well damn," he said. "If I knew they'd get off their asses and actually /do/ something the second I disappeared, I'd have done this first year!"

Daphne shook her head in wonder, and replied.

"I wonder why Dumbledore decided to kill everyone? Isn't he known for second chances?"

"Eh," Harry said, his tone conveying obvious disinterest. "Doesn't matter. We trained in the Magicks of the Ancient Arcane, and yet somehow these fifteen other teenagers apparently outclass us, /and/ managed to destroy all of Voldemort's forces."

Daphne nodded, "We must've ended up in some kind of alternate reality. We only have a fighting force of Goblin warriors and Arcane Magicks behind our backs, we're definitely outmatched by this child army Dumbledore has created from your study group."

"Always knew he was bonkers."

With that, they turned on their heels, and walked back into the bank. Things were obviously under control. It was time for a vacation.
