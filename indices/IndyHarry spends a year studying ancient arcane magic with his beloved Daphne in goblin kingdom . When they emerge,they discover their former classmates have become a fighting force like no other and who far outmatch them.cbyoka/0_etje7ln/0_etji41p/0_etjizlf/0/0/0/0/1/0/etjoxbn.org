What a moronic response. Good try, man. This is why I stopped where I did.

You can try as hard as you want, but you didn't specify any of the stuff you just said. You said the DA was an 'elite fighting force', (Teenagers, remember). The Goblin nation, from all that we know, is the only Wizarding bank in the world. And just because Harry studied Arcane magic doesn't mean he forgot his schooling, or that Goblins don't also have a fucking cutting curse. Goblins obviously have magic, they're just not allowed a wand.

Bill and his Curse Breaker buddies, that all work for Gringotts, broke into Gringotts and stole literally everything? While the Goblins were around? With their dragons? Hope none of the people that have money in those vaults find out the 'good guys' just stole all their shit.

New combat spells developed daily? Uh, no. Where are all these new geniuses coming from? They've been studying the same spells for decades, and all of a sudden they make new ones every day?

Harry has loyal House Elves. Hermione was so intense about freeing them they avoided wherever she happened to be in canon. Not sure they plan on helping her causes.
