Hermione: Uh, Harry... Voldemort brought down the defences of Hogwarts in a single spell. But that aside, why do you think that the founders of Hogwarts would have kept their knowledge from their students? They made a school to teach all they knew, so the knowledge would spread. And it did. And we improved on it. You'd have known that if you had ever read Hogwarts: A History.

Ron: Becuase someone found it'd stop them trying to start a war every few decades. But if they ever won a war, why do you think they aren't allowed wands? We're nice, but we're not stupid.
