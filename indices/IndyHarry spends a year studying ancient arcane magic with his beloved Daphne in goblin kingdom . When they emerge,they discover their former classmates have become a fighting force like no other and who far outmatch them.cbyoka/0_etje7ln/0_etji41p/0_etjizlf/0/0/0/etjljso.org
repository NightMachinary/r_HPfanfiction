Hermione: Harry, actually, yes - Dumbledore's think-tank, which I was a member of, found ways to undo all of Voldemort's rituals. How do you think we beat him? Also, did you honestly think he couldn't die? If ancient secrets were so powerful, why aren't we surrounded by hundreds of ancient wizards and witches? And ancient runes isn't really useful unless you like reading old texts and scrolls - which, I'll have you know, I enjoy. Especially now that I don't have to focus on helping to defeat Voldemort.

Ron: Mate, you studied with the goblins? Did you forget that they lost every damn war with the wizards? If they held the secrets to such power as you claim, wouldn't you think they had won a war or two?
