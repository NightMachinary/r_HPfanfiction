Harry shook his head at his two friends. They just didn't seem to understand.

He gave Hermione a look of disappointment, and said, "Hermione, a lot of people do know about them. Slughorn taught Voldemort about them. People just aren't stupid enough to go around killing people are ripping their souls to shreds. Muggle board games even mentions the fucking things."

He ran his hands through his hair, /had she always been this difficult?/

"And why do you like reading them? They're full of ancient knowledge, and you've already said that it's useless knowledge. You're not going to convince me that knowledge used to build Hogwarts, enchant it with nearly impenetrable defences, and have it make a room that can be anything you need, is useless. Stop trying."

He turned to Ron after that, this time in actual anger.

"Ron, /mate/, if they've lost every single war they've faught against us," he took a moment to draw breathe, and then continued with a shout. "/Why do they have a monopoly on all of our money?/"

Edit: Also, this is where I stop responding. Ancient magic doesn't have to be outdated. You also kinda ignored most of the stuff I brought up.
