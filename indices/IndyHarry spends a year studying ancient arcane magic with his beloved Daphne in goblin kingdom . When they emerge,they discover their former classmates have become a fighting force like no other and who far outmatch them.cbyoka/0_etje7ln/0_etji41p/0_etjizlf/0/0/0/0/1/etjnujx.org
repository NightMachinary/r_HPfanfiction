Ron rolled his eyes

"OK,mate. But the fact of the matter is; all your fancy arcane magic and tiny little minions means literally nothing now. While you were all underground in the hovel you call a kingdom,Bill and his Curse Breaker buddies manages to break through every vault in Gringotts and loot them to help us with the war. The goblins have nothing and if they have another rebellion in mind.."

Hermione cut in

"Lets just say,Ginny is eager to test out her Slicing Curse on some non-human targets. We also have hundreds of trained wizards,fiercely loyal house-elves,dozens of trained dragons,the support of every other magical nation and new combat spells being developed daily. The goblins have axes and rusty armour."
