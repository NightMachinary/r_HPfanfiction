"Well Hermione, guess you got me. I'll just go back to studies of the Arcane, and ancient rituals, and all my buddies that hold a monopoly on all the money available to Wizarding kind. Those same rituals Voldemort has been using to make sure he can't die? Those are pretty ancient," Harry responded with a sigh. "Guess that knowledge isn't useful though, because you said it isn't. It's obviously evil, but I didn't know that you had new magic available to you that allowed you to not die."

He tapped his chin for a second, as if thinking, before he responded again.

"You'd best stop taking Ancient Runes, I mean, Ancient is in the name. Sorry that you've been wasting your time there. Hogwarts' enchantments are ancient too, guess they need to be taken down and done up with new stuff. The Sorting Hat, I hear you say? Nope, ancient. Made by people that were around before Hogwarts. He's useless."
