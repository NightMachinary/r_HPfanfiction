I absolutely hate nonsense like that.

What looks or was supposed to be a throwaway joke now completely rewrites everything we know about how magic works. So there is such a things as "anti-magical DNA"?? Why??? That doesn't make any sense!!

The only way to sleep at night is to completely disregard it and treat it as just a silly joke with no foothold in canon.
