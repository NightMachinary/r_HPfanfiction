I was thinking of stories where Bella acts more like linkffn(A life twice lived by Nemesis13)

There is also another one where Bella is married to Remus, proclaimed that a hamster named Julian was the King of Hamsters due to having survived a night with Moony, and I think she was pleased that Sally Anne or someone else's first instinct when trouble came up, was to light shit on fire..
