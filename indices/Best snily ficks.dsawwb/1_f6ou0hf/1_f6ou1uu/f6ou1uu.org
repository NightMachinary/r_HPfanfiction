  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE
