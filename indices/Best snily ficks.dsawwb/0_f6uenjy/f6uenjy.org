SS Peggy Sue: linkffn(Severus Snape and the Art of War; The Peace Not Promised)

Lily travels to the future: linkffn(Ananke)

Teenage SS turns his life around: linkffn(If Someone Cared Enough)

These are IMO the best ones not already linked. I've read several decent-ish fics that don't stand out as fics I really liked, but which aren't /bad/. They're overall not as good IMO, so I describe them a bit further in case anything in particular catches your interest.

linkffn(The Moment It Began) My "golden standard" (base expectations of a fic of its kind) on SS Peggy Sue, since it was among the first of its kind I read. Has some problems (IMO romance happens /way/ too quickly, and the ending is too abrupt) and doesn't really stand out, but is a decent fic of its kind and doesn't really do anything wrong.

linkffn(Obscura Nox Animae) Lily survives as an animal and spends a lot of time watching over Harry, switching from various animals. Eventually meets SS and he manages to restore her. My major issue with this fic is Lily essentially becoming a prisoner for her own protection later on, which forces the ship a bit, something I find offputting.

linkffn(The Road Not Taken by kellydofc) SS manages to turn things around after the Mudblood incident. There is several fics of this kind where he gets forgiveness pretty much instantly, which is the main reason it isn't that special to me. I'd rather see him have to work for it, the process taking a while, showing a believable turning point.

linkffn(Dreams of Future Past) Pseudo-Peggy Sue -- instead of him going back after death, he sends memories back to his past self as dreams, which helps defeat the Dark Lord early, and allows his alternate younger self to improve his life as well.

linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) Another Peggy Sue. However, this one puts a lot less focus on the ship itself, so it stands out a bit that way. Unfinished!

linkffn(To Love and Protect) Lily survives in a "light" version of what is basically a "complete" Horcrux -- an artifact that provides protection, cast as part of the love protection Harry got.

linkffn(A Dream Carved in Stone) AU. Lily never married James. The universe has some other subtle differences.

linkffn(Letters from the Dark) Lily (and the rest of the school) gets an anonymous penpal. Ultimately helps her review some things from the past, which ultimately allows her to reconnect to Severus.

linkffn(Change by J.Buchanan99) Has the major distinction of being the only enemies-to-lovers fic of this ship I've read (they never met before Hogwarts). However, it's unfinished and isn't something I liked as much as the above linked ones.
