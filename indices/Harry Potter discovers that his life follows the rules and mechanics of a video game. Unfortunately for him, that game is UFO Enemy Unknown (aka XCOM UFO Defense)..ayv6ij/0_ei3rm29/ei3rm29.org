  As he stood before the door in the forbidden third floor, Harry realized he might be stepping into a dangerous situation.

  Closing his eyes, he selected the question mark in the interface only he could see, and only in his head. At the bottom of the menu that appeared, he selected "Save Game", then "2", and entered "Forbidden Third Floor".

  Now, even if he were killed, he could return to this moment before he opened the door only after briefly inconvenienced by death. He had learned this the hard way, when he had fallen off the roof and broken his neck after being transported there mysteriously while being chased by Dudley, and had to relive the first eight years of his life again.

  Confidently, Harry tried the door, knowing if anything happened to him, he would return to this point in time with all of the knowledge he would have accrued from his own coming demise.
