That sounds amazingly cathartic.

EDIT: Okay, a couple of chapters in and it looks like it starts post-freedom? I'm guessing this ties into the spoilers you mentioned but either way I feel like I'm missing a large amount of context for a lot of the things characters are offhandedly referring to.

EDIT 2: Yeah the stories are kind of all over the place but the chronological order is in the author's profile, thank god.
