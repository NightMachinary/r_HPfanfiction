It's a series with minor Dumbledore-Molly-Hermione bashing but a lot of characters get second chances, I there isn't much romance usually, there's not really slash but Sirius and Remus act like a married couple 99% of the time and it's hilarious bc Sirius doesn't even realize, and it does have the 'pup' nickname, but it's usually from Sirius and it makes sense in context.(There's also minor Lord shit but it's not in your face)

Basically, the series starts during the summer of fifth year, and basically Harry gets fed up with how Molly treats Sirius and gets Sirius to stand up for himself. It's got a lot of fluffy family moments but it's also got plot and drama. Also, Sirius is protective and powerful and knows how to intimidate people and it's amazing.

The author also does a lot of Marauders Era fics in the same universe, and has given me a lot of my headcanons. I almost prefer their universe to canon. I'm on the edge.
