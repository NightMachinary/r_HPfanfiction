The linkffn(Innocent) series is one of my favourites. Sirius accidentally escapes 5 years earlier (literally, he dreams of walking out of his cell, and wakes up in the water outside), and since he has no leads on Peter, he instead goes to check on Harry. And when he finds how unhappy Harry is with the Dursleys, he offers him another home. Which results in an even bigger uproar than his initial escape, with everyone thinking he kidnapped the Boy Who Lived in an effort to finish the job he started. Eight-year-old Harry, meanwhile, thinks Padfoot is much better than the Dursleys, and is awed to learn more about his parents and about magic.

Sirius does eventually clear his name, but it doesn't happen quickly; the fic is half a million words. And it's only the first book in a series, although the others are shorter.

It doesn't have any superpowered characters, nor secret Black family magic, nor lordships, just Sirius doing his flawed but sincere best to be a good parent to Harry.
