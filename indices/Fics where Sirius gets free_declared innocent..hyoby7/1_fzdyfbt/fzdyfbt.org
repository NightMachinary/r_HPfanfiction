I'm currently reading ffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]) which starts just like that. Only it is becoming a bit OP!harry and â€˜Lord Potter-Black' ish but the beginning is solid. Also the characterisation of Dumbledore is much better than usual. The weasleys as well for that matter.
