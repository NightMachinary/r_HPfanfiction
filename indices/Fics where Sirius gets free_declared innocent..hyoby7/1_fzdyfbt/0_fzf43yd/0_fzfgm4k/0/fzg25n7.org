That's right! Been a while since I've read it (not really a fic you can just reread whenever you feel like it) but yeah, the politics is mainly Sirius's thing. Harry has a small part with the other heirs, and there's the whole family magic thing (which I actually liked and thought was well done), but Harry isn't a teenager politician like he's normally portrayed in these types of stories.
