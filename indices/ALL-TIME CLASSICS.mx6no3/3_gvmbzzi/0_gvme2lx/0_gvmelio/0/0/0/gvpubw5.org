Not really, it uses very few of the traditional tropes. Compared to the kind of fics you're talking about the characterization and writing are actually pretty well done. It's just obnoxious in a [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] way, what with the author using Harry as a mouthpiece for his pseudo-scientific opinions, complaining that the canon magic system isn't logical enough, munchkin to the max, etc. among other things. So it isn't bad like the Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin fics, but it is pretty off-putting in the "genius 11-year old who's smarter than most adults" department. Like, not a fan myself, but I can see why some people would like it.
