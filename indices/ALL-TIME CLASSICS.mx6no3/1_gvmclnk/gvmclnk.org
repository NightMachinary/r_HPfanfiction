[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] is honestly the best thing in fandom I read in years. Mature characterizations, brilliant series end to end. If you want to go back to stuff before 2010, [[http://www.archiveofourown.org/works/67766][Snape: the Home Fries Nazi]] is pretty awesome and rightfully considered a classic.

What ships and tropes do you like? There's a ton of new Wolfstar fics going around.
