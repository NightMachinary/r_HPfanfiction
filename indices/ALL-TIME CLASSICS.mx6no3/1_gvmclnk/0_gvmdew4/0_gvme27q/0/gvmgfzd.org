73 Aberdeen is amazing! I still need to read Break.

[[/u/Yunwha][u/Yunwha]], I checked my Wolfstar bookmarks on AO3 - here are two really good ones with under 600 kudos, since you said you'd read most of the well-known fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27679754][*Rourke*]] *by sreka:* When wildlife filmmaker Sirius Black arrives on a remote Antarctic island for a year-long assignment, he isn't phased by the freezing wind, the perpetual darkness, or the hostility he meets from some of the biologists at the research base. He is used to living an itinerant existence. He is comfortable with unforgiving conditions. He expects the world to treat him harshly. But he does not expect to fall in love. (complete)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20059978/chapters/47507422][*chase the stars*]] *by Duskglass:* It's probably the most foolish, reckless, dangerous thing Sirius Black has ever done in a lifetime of foolish and reckless and dangerous things... but he takes one look at Harry and knows it's the only choice he can make. (or: 'sirius escapes azkaban early & accidentally kidnaps harry' au) (WIP)
