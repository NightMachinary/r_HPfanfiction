I second the rec to visit [[/r/HPSlashFics][r/HPSlashFics]]

Here are some - perhaps not all time classics - but personal favs

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334][chalk this one up as a win]] is a Flintwood soulmate fic. Overall, you might want to check out the whole series as it features two other Soulmate fics in the same AU universe. One is a Drarry the other is Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan fic *Summary:* Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045][Bound]] is a great Wolfstar series. An AU in which Sirius emerges from the veil, when Remus is already married to Tonks. Brilliant characterizations, a lot of hurt and raw emotions with a hopeful ending. *Summary of the first work:* “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120][Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil]] Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521][Step back in Time]] This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][The Second String]] Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends up working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Great plot and characterizations. Canon and OC characters alike Highly rec

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] My favorite Death Eater!Harry fic (eventual Harrymort). In this one, Harry is the product of an affair between Lily and Regulus, Lily having seduced him to get intel on Death Eaters Harry grows up in an orphanage. His name in this fic is Izar, which takes a bit to get used to but don't let that stop you. Features cool world-building, especially in terms of spell creation, Death Eater raids and clashes with Aurors, manipulative and intelligent Voldemort, intelligent Harry --> good character arch/developement, Unspeakable!Harry, alive!Lily and James Potter, interesting plot and plot-twists. An edited version is currently being posted (chapter by chapter) on ao3, above I linked the complete fic from ffn
