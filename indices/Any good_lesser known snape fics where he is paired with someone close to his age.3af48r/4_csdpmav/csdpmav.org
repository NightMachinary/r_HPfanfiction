There is linkao3(My Name is Cameron Sage by thesewarmstars). It's a fic where Harry goes back in time and is Harry/Snape, but it's not a teacher-student relationship because the two are at the same age and are equals in their friendship/relationship in terms of power. In fact, Harry grows and learns and gains quite a bit more power than Snape. Anyway, I liked it a lot and I'm typically not into slash fics. Give it a try!
