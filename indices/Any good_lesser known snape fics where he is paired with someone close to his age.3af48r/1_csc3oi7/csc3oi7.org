My idea of well-written and yours, probably don't match up, but I enjoyed both of these stories. The first is unfinished but still interesting, linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) The second one is HG/SS, though they are the same age. It is a WIP but worth a look, linkffn(Happily Ever After the Fact by Tychesong)
