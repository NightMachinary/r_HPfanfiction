Hmm: I'm reading Prince of the Dark Kingdom and it has Snape dating an entymologyist. This is definitely a side plot, so its not what you're looking for. On the other hand, it has a believable emotionally whole Snape.

I also like of Muggles and Magic: It's ultimately Snape/Hermione, but its set in the Regency era. Hermione only goes to Hogwarts for a couple of years and then works as a governess for Snape as an adult, so marginally less squicky.

There's also one in which adult Hermione decides to have marriage of convenience with Snape once he's in Azkaban, which kind of subverts the Marriage Law Trope, if you might be interested.

Oh, I finally remembered one: The Birthday Present by excessivelyperky Snape is single for 700k words, but has a crush on Molly Weasley because Molly is kind to him. I think its really good. :) It has one of my favorite devices: Brewer's Bog, the idea that long-term potions-fume poisoning has been affecting Snape's health (mentally and physically).
