I've read NoahPhantom's works a few times- I have now reached the age where I can't seem to read them anymore. There is a lot more world building than in Vekin87 but this ultimately means a lot more exposition which gets a bit boring to read over time. I can't comment on Colin Creevey, but I would recommend giving NoahPhantom's a read. I would say the plot doesn't really ramp up until the later books but it also becomes much more AU then as well (compliant with the series but has very different themes). I enjoy the originality and world building though and the ideas have definitely informed some of my own ideas on magic.

Edit: removed what I think might have been a bit of a spoiler?
