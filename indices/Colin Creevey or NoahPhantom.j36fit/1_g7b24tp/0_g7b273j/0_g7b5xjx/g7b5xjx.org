Thanks for that detailed reply, I really appreciate it. Lippert's James Potter series was actually the first fanfic I ever read and while I enjoyed it, I found it to be a tad corny, overly political and I couldn't stand Petra as a character. I also didn't like how he made Harry out to be dull and boring.

I then moved on to Albus Severus fanfics as I find him to have the most potential. Sharing the names of two of the most interesting characters opens up so many possibilities namely interactions with certain portraits in the Headmaster's office!

Anyway, I'm blabbing. I started NoahPhantom's series a few hours ago and already I'm impressed with his prose so hopefully it'll keep me busy for a while.

Oh and I've heard of the Stygian trilogy and I've heard it's very good so I will definitely give that a shot too
