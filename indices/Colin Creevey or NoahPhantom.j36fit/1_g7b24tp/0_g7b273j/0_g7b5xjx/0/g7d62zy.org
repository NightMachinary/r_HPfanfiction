It's funny, you had the same gripes as me with Lippert. He had a couple of incredible ideas, like a conservative Harry and James's obsession with Petra, but never really fleshed out either the political system or Petra's character well enough for them to work. Also agree about the corniness, the whole Christmas scene in book five was completely unnecessary as well.

But yeah, you don't get any of that in NoahPhantom. There are flaws, but they're very different flaws.
