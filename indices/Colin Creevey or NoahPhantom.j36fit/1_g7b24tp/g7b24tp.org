You're right that NoahPhantom's series doesn't build up in quality the same way Vekin's does. It's very different than Vekin's series; it's way crazier and over-the-top, more colorful, and probably better with worldbuilding, the plotting is really detailed and exceptional, but the characters somewhat take a hit. There's a plot point in book 7 that I thought was absolutely terrible. I didn't think the ending was very good, but the epilogue is. I have a lot of mixed feelings about this series, but it's definitely very high quality, at least by fanfic standards.

Colin Creevey's series was, at least to me, a little lower quality in terms of writing. It's not very fast-paced, doesn't reach that much beyond canon, and is largely character driven. Someone brought it up the other day on here and I'll probably give it another go to try to finish it. But I did find NoahPhantom's series a metaphorical page-turner, which doesn't really apply to this one.

Some other things to try might be Slide's Stygian Trilogy, which has Albus as one of the main characters and to me is better than both Vekin and Noah, or Lippert's James Potter series, which I avoided for a while but enjoyed when I read it.
