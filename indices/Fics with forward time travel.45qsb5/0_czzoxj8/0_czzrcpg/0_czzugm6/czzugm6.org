Ah, that might have just been me then. The way I remember it, though, I started reading it more for the Firefly part because to be honest, Harry in it is massively overpowered and after (I'm trying to phrase it so it's not a spoiler) they meet those old people, it was really boring and I stopped reading.

I wouldn't recommend it to someone if they didn't also want to read about Firefly because Harry's part is only really interesting in terms of relationships with the setting, for me at least.
