I honestly enjoyed the story in general, but it definitely has flaws. Harry being godlike is probably one of the lesser ones. Several of the main Firefly cast people are underutilized and flat, and relationship between the stated main characters has no payoff at all. I'm not expecting smut, but it kind of fizzles out.

Still a good adventure story, and the setting is interesting, but it has some issues.
