Hmm, if time-travel used as a plot device for explaining the crossover merger is fine, then I'll add [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][/Ascension/]] (141,467WL; Complete) to the list.

This one is a HP x Mass Effect story that follows stations of Mass Effect (IIRC) but the author is at least quite knowledgeable about Mass Effect-verse.
