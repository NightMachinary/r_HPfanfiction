That's definitely something I took into account! Since you can take as many OWL exams as you like, with the limit of 8 subjects being for classes, you could if you wanted do exactly what you described. I see no reason why you wouldn't be allowed into the OWL exams in your 6th or 7th year too, provided the Professor agrees.

And yeah that sounds like my system too, forget the story I want to fiddle with the background details!
