What might be interesting is to explore the possibility of taking OWL level subjects after one's fifth year - for example, if you decide in your seventh year that you want to have some background in Cryptozoology, but your subjects are more geared towards a Healer specialization, then you can either obtain the material through the school, self-study and write the exam with the rest of the OWL level students, or you can join the Care for Magical Creatures class during the year and write the exam at the end of the year with the rest of your class.

​

If that got confusing, basically post-OWL students should be able to add to their number of OWLs after their fifth year of schooling. This would be helpful for kids who find themselves suddenly changing their minds about their chosen career path - as someone who just finished going through this phase in my life, 14 to 17 years old rarely produces concrete plans for the future. (Even now, I find myself contemplating switching my Psychology degree for one in Digital Art... someone stop me!)

I've always loved world-building and character development - 2k words on the characters background but only 1500 words of actual story. Goodbye, fics that I was actually working on after months of abandonment. I've been sucked back into worldbuilding!
