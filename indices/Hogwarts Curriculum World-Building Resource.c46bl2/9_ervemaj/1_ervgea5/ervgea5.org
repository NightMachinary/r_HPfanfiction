It's based on canon, but since it's designed to be the curriculum a decade or so after canon ends, I put a lot of thought into designing a more logical curriculum. So Astronomy and HoM aren't core because Astronomy is supplemental to Divination, Potions, Herbology etc rather than a directly important magic itself, and because a lot of the basics of HoM are covered in Magical Society, with History being more specialist. As to DADA, the idea is that because after 3rd year, you can theoretically drop any 2 core classes and pick up a good number of options, if it wasn't required in 1st and 2nd year, many students would never study it. As the beginner DADA course is designed to give a wizard/witch just enough info to survive being attacked by a muggle or another student, as well as some of the more common creatures they may face the threat of, it's sufficient for the average person even if they drop it at 3rd year. History of Magic, by contrast, doesn't teach anything that it would be a significant loss for some students not to study, given that Magical Society will teach them the bits that are most relevant to today, as will living in the Wizarding World.

I figured that for Astronomy, also, Planets and Moons would be a more detailed and in depth topic, with a lot more heavy theory involved which is why I had it set for 5th year.
