Thanks!

Yeah it's supposed to be an extrapolation of canon. I tried to ask the question "if I was updating Hogwarts for a post-canon time period, with a larger population, peace, less bigotry and fewer obstacles like Dumbledore's plotting, what classes would I teach?" and it kind of got out of hand. I really tried to make sure that a student would get a well rounded education, regardless of their choices at OWL and NEWT, that would set them in a good state for getting a career and living in the world. That's why, for example, DADA in 1st and 2nd Year is mostly just a basic introduction to casting spells to defend yourself, and understanding the most common dangerous creatures. That way, even if you drop it in 3rd Year, you're not going to get burned at the stake by an overzealous Muggle or poke a Doxy nest.

As to Crypto/Magizoology, honestly I swapped them back and forth the entire time I wrote this document, and in the end just liked the sound of Cryptozoology a bit more.
