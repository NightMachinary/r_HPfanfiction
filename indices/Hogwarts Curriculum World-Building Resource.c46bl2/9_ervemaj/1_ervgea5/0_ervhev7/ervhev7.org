It seems like a really well thought out project and I applaud your work! Thanks for the explanation! I know a lot of this isn't canon, with the classes like warding and magical arts, but the foundation is great. Reading it over again, I appreciate the inclusion of enchanting and healing, and that the first years of magical society and muggle studies are focused on mythbusting. Why did you choose the term cryptozoology instead of magizoology for the class? The term cryptids seems so out of place for the wizarding world, where magical creatures really exist and are known.
