This is a fantastic resource, thanks for putting it together! A small correction, if this is based on canon; Astronomy and History of Magic are core classes in the books. You also left off Astronomy from the basic subject description list. I like the idea of Astronomy as an OWL class, but I can't believe studying planets/moons happens in 5th year AFTER comets/meteors. Seems like planets/moons would be better directly after stars/constellations. Based on all of what you wrote, I think DADA should be required, but not beginning until 3rd year, while History of Magic should begin in 1st year.
