Yeah, I basically took canon as my starting point, but tried to make it a bit more logical (or what I see as logical). Charms was by far the hardest, since we really don't get much idea in canon of what Charms Theory actually entails, or why you'd need to spend multiple weeks worth of lessons on a spell instead of just being taught the wand movement and incantation and told to practice (unless it's a dangerous spell). Put simply, I don't think there's any actual reason given in-universe for why Aguamenti is taught at NEWT level and is so difficult, whilst Accio is 4th Year and kinda difficult, with Alohomora being ??? difficult but taught in 1st Year. That's why I decided to kind of ignore the difficulty of the Charms and focus more on the type of Charms. The idea is that you learn roughly half (increasing as you get through the years) of the spells you learn about, with the expectation that you'll practice the others when you're ready in your own time. So you don't learn Aguamenti in practice, and you aren't expected to be able to cast it, but you do learn its incantation and wand movement, and the theory behind it, and then you're expected to practice it at your own pace. That means that it could still be a NEWT level charm in practice, but taught theoretically much earlier.
