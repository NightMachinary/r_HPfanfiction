Nice work! I've also done some worldbuilding on the side, but that is simply magnificent amount of work. A few technical suggestions from me:

- Care of magical creatures should include some 5X creatures, or at least one of the less dangerous and more obtainable ones, like a dragon (those can be handled pretty easily by a group of wizards) in NEWT level
- Water conjuration isn't a survival charm, as conjured objects disappear after a while - so while it might work to spray someone or cool yourself, you're much better with a cooling charm, because drinking something that will disappear after some time isn't wise
- Topics should bleed between years, i think. This is partly based on canon and partly on making things more diverse - you can intermingle conjuration and human transfiguration in 6th and 7th year, or start basic animate to inanimate in 1st year (canon 1st year exam was to transfigure mouse into a snuffbox).
- Muggle/magic studies should be interchangable in timetables, muggle ones for those with wizarding background and magic studies for those with muggle background, mandatory up to OWL level without the obligation to take the OWL.
- History of Magic should be a core subject, but Binns must be exorcised beforehand
- Minor mistakes in 1-5X classification scale. All dragons are to be classified as 5X due to untameability. Wampus cat and werewolf also fall into that category. On the other hand, Phoenix should only be 4X, because it can be tamed. Also, Vampires aren't beasts and thus don't fall into the X scale.
