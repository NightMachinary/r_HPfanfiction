- The 7th Year NEWT Curriculum for CoMC DOES have its Practical portion dedicated to 5X creatures. There's 5 Years of OWL/NEWT, and 5 Creature Classes for a reason.
- I hadn't thought about the implications of Auguamenti being temporary, but for my own headcanon I'm happy to leave it given that we know in canon characters at least contemplated using it for drinking water.
- I can imagine that they would, in practice. Depending on the specifics of the class, the teacher and things. The Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff class might start on next year's work a bit early, or perhaps spend longer on a topic than originally scheduled for example. But I like the idea of distinct topics just to make it easier to keep straight in my head and as a guideline.
- I thought about doing this, but decided against it. I decided that the aim of Muggle Studies is to ensure that magically raised kids don't learn prejudices, or endanger the Statute of Secrecy, while the aim of Magical Society is to teach kids that will one day live in the Magical World as full citizens how the world works. Essentially, Magical Society is the equivalent of a Citizenship course in the Real World, while Muggle Studies is more like a foreign culture course. But of course, as the two subjects so heavily contrast and overlap, it's entirely likely that a good amount of lessons would be blended together, and that school trips etc might be shared between the classes. Since you only HAVE to study them for 2 years, that means that you get enough information about the Muggle world not to break the Statute or believe utter nonsense, but not so much that it's unnecessary, and you get enough info about the Magical world to not put your foot in your mouth or look like a total idiot. I also like the idea of having Muggleborns in Muggle Studies and Magical-Born students in Magical Society, so they can interact and help teach the class.
- I see HoM as a more specialist version of the sort of thing you get in Magical Society. In MS you get a basic overview of how the Government works, what the general scope of the law is, how magical dress and attitudes differ from Muggle ones, and then in HoM you dig down into specific periods and events, looking at how these things contributed to the present day. I can see an argument for making it core, and if you are going to merge Muggle Studies and Magical Society, I'd support it, but personally I prefer it my way. Also, Binns being exorcised is top priority.
- Dragons are not untameable. They are difficult to tame, and perhaps "trainable" is a better term, but they aren't as untameable as, say, a Blast-Ended Skrewt. With the proper techniques, like the clankers in Gringotts, you can get a Dragon to work as your security guard and not hurt you. A Blast-Ended Skrewt will indiscriminately burn everything nearby no matter what you try. However, some Dragons are more ornery and harder to train or tame than others - Hungarian Horntails are near impossible to train, and can really only be conditioned into fear by something like the clankers, while Welsh Greens can actually, if raised from an egg, be taught to distinguish between authorised and unauthorised people and work as a more effective guard. Wampus may be untameable, but I don't see it as scoring too high on Worst Case Harm or Aggression, and I think there's a good amount of Existent Defensive Options. Unlike the Phoenix which, while tameable and non-aggressive, tops the scale for Magical Potency and can cause unhealable burns, is unstoppable, and can teleport through wards, making it score very high on Worst Case Harm and have basically no Existent Defensive Options. Werewolves are 4X instead of 5X for a similar reason - their weakness to silver, the Wolfsbane potion and anti-Werewolf wards all mean that while they're Aggressive and score high on Worst Case Harm, their other attributes keep them from being at the very top. I debated on Vampires, I think you can go either way depending on how discriminatory you want your Ministry to be.\\

Overall, I'm grateful for the feedback. I think that most of what you raised is very much a personal choice, and I'm glad there aren't too many glaring flaws in my logic or planning!
