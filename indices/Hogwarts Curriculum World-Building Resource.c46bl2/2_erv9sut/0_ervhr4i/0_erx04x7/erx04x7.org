- The summary on top of the doc says they deal with 4X creatures.
- About muggle/magic studies, i thought it should be more about not making life-long wizards sit through magical society lessons, or muggleborns through explainations of the basics of the muggle world. They can get homework that forces them to interact with each other, they don't need to be toghether in class.
- I admit i might be a little biased towards history being a required subject, but it is important to properly understand and attach yourself to the society. Maybe a two-year required course for everyone, just to go over the things that noone would normally care about but that are quite important, like goblin rebellions and whatnot?
- Wampus cat worst case scenario is death. It runs faster than an arrow and can hypnotise people, so i'd say it should score 5x. I don't know where do you get the info about taming some dragon species so i won't say anything about it, but i think they should all be classified as 5X due to magic resistance - few if any singular wizards could hope to stop a dragon.\\
  Phoenixes, due to being non-agressive, shouldn't score 5X even if they have the theoritical potential to cause immense harm - if the reasons you've written are such a factor then you'd have to classify house elves as 5X creatures.\\
  Werewolves being susceptible to silver is a myth - it's only used in treating werewolf bites. The only way to deal with one is to be in an enclosed space where he can't get in, an animagus transformation (a rare and difficult skill) or to off it, which would be tantamount to murder and thus not a feasible option.
