There are a lot of fics that fall under soul/bond and creature tropes for Drarry. Weirdly, not many fics that I have read have BOTH a bond and a creature, although a couple do. Anyway here are some recs:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2693312/chapters/6026747][The Light More Beautiful]] - This is a creature (werwolf) and bond (mate) fic that also has an interesting plot device I haven't seen anywhere else - Draco and Harry lose their virginities together 6th year due to an accident with lust potion. Then Harry helps Draco leave the country to get away from the war and Draco doesn't come back for years. That's where this story picks up. The writing here was good and all the magic and auror stuff was well conceived. The knotting was weird but not too crazy. Overall I thought this was a sweet fic and I would definitely recommend it. linkao3(2693312)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/376913/chapters/615059][Angels and Devils]] - Cute 7th year fic where Harry is a Seraphim (winged angel thing) and bonds with Draco. This was pretty well done - I remember liking it a lot because it was different than the usual creature fic. linkao3(376913)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3895723/chapters/8712883][He Was He and I Was Bunny]] - not exactly a creature fic really at all, but this is a very sweet and very happy 8th year fic where Harry is an animagus bunny and Draco befriends him as a pet. Obviously a lot of UST is the result :) highly recommend. linkao3(3895723)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5203025/chapters/11991827][The Destiny You Sold]] is a bond fic but not a creature fic. In this fic Draco owns a yarn shop in Hogsmeade and Harry is working at the Hogsmede branch of Ollivanders and the shops are next door to one another. They accidentally are magically bound together when Harry fixes Draco's wand and then have to live together and "satisfy the bond" until they can undo it. Of course they start to catch real feelings and angst ensues. It's just okay. linkao3(5203025)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2354237/chapters/5194637][Before the World was Made]] is a bonding fic. In this fic Harry is an auror and Draco is a jeweler/antiques dealer. An old bonding ring Harry is investigating accidentally bonds them together and they have to figure out how to undo it. I liked this fic a lot and the writing was great. The plot moved a little quickly at the end though and their character motivations for loving each other went largely unexplained. Still a good fic though that I'd recommend. linkao3(2354237)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/754708/chapters/1410134][Bond]] - This is an oldie but a goody AU where Draco and Harry are bonded using old marriage magic. It has everything you want in a Dr/Hr fic - true characterizations, sexual tension, a slow build to love and a good plot. linkao3(754708)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4707098][If the Sun Goes Black]] and the prequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406/chapters/14353156][There Is Always the Moon]] are really good creature fics where Draco is a creature. To say anymore will give a lot away because there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to spoil. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good. linkao3(6264406) and linkao3(4707098)
