  She is a slayer. Born to fight the demons, vampires and the forces of darkness. Now, because of bad luck and bad mistakes, she's running. He is The Boy Who Lived. Destined to destroy the Dark Lord. Now, because of a loveless home and a manipulative old wizard, he's more alone and frustrated than ever. Together, these two lost souls discover that they are far more powerful than they ever were apart. Brute strength meets magical finesse in a story of young love and...okay, I'm sorry, I just can't. It's Faith Lehane and Harry Potter, people. They don't do mushy. A slayer being dropped head first into Wizarding Britain? Shit's about to get real up in here and nothing and no one is going to be the same. Gloves are off and with Faith's help, Harry ain't buyin' what the dark lord is selling.
