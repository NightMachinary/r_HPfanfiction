I quite like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Key of Dagon), which is apparently the first of a series of which I've only read the first. Harry/Dawn.

I also like linkffn(Judge, Jury by oldscout1011), linkffn(Taking Out The Trash by skabs), linkffn(White Knights and Dark Lords by Sherza) and linkffn(The Gringotts Account by lancer47).

linkffn(A Fate Worse Than Death by Clell65619) is a nice one-shot that could have been a lead-in to a larger story. No pairing.

linkffn(And Seven Times Never Kill Man) is also a nice one-shot with no pairing.

There's also linkffn(Dead Trouble by Marcus Rowlands). Not a one-shot.

I wasn't that fond of linkffn(It's All In The Blood by Sam-453).

The following crossovers are on my to-be-read list, so I can't say anything about them, but they're listed as complete.

linkffn(Back At Ya by Fairywm) Harry Potter and the Echo of the White Witch ([[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=885]]) linkffn(New Horizons by Lucifael) linkffn(The Eighth Weasley by Fyre) linkffn(When Harry Met Buffy by Fyre)
