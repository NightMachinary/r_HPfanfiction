Wow, that's incredibly obnoxious. Like, the reasoning isn't even functional, because all he has to do is get all the bastards on his side, and then murder them in an isolated location, no becoming a genocidal maniac needed.

Becoming Voldemort is pretty much the worst way he could have solved the problem, honestly.
