I think reading a story from a different perspective can be quite fascinating. And I also think it probably wouldn't be exactly like canon because, even though Harry tries to do what Voldemort did, I think he wouldn't be able to redo absolutely every single moment exactly the same which could lead to some interesting changes/developments. Idk, it just sounds intriguing.
