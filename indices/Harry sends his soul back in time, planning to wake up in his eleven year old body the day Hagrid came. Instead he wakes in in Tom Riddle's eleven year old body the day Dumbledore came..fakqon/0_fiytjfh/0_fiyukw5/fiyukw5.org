I know it exists, I just can't for the life of me remember the title.

It involves Harry deciding that he doesn't want this life, he doesn't want to win as Voldemort, unfortunately he knows he has to be Voldemort otherwise the prosperity that came after the Battle of Hogwarts will never happen as it was due to the Death Eaters being brought together and wiped out that resulted in real change. So he decides that since he knows what Voldemort did, he'll do that, and then get his well deserved rest after allowing young Harry to kill him at the battle.
