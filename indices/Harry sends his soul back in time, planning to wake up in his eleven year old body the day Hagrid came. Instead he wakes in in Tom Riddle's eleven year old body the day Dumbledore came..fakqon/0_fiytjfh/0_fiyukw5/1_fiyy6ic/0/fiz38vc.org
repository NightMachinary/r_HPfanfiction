The same events told from a different point of view can make for excellent story-telling. If you're familiar with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film][The Thing]]), for example, then Peter Watts's [[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/][The Things]] tells the same story from the antagonist's point of view and is a great read.
