Pretty much any story concept can be done well. The problem here is not that the same events told f/ a different perspective make for a bad story (although it /is/ a hard enough concept to pull of successfully) but is that Harry Potter is reincarnated as Tom Marvolo Riddle in particular. If Harry's thought process is as psi567 describes, then that means the moments in canon where Harry triumphs over Tom due to his emotional strength are no longer so---Harry-reincarnated-as-Tom is in essence "throwing" those conflicts in his younger self's favor. One of the worst, if not /the/ worst, things a redux of or sequel to a story can do is retrospectively worsen that story.
