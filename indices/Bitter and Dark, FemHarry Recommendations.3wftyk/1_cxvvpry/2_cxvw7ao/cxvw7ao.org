I kind of don't like the whole 'time traveling' trope.

But this is pretty close in terms of mentality what I am looking for.

Although, there is no 'build up' to the bitterness. (Which I was kind of looking for)

But I did say I would take anything. Make up your mind Nekyia!

Oh well, thanks for the recommendation.
