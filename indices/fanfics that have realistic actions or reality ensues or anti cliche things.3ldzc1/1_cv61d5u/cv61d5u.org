  harry learns that he can't be emancipated if he is 11 or whatever underage age he is and that he would have to have a guardian look after him and no person would like harry live alone

I usually use what I call a Mentor, or a guardian in the Muggle World to take care of things who wouldn't understand why they are Emancipated. Also, if I do Emancipate Harry at that age, he usually has house-elves or older friends (like Sirius) who are usually there with him. Emancipation doesn't simply mean one has to live alone. It gives him freedoms.
