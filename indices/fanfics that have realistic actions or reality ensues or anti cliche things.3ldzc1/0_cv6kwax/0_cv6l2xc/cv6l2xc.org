Ironically, one of the truest quotes from HP is from Quirrel in Philosopher's Stone;

#+begin_quote
  There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.
#+end_quote

You can't beat evil. There is no evil, nor any good. The Allies didn't defeat evil, they defeated their enemies.
