I have major beef with this:

Bad guys break out all kinds of nasty spells, fire off endless salvos of unforgivables, while good guys could only muster stupifies and protegos in return.

That's just pathetic. Please take a look at how our real life cops respond to violent criminals, and how the Allies beat up the Axis in WW2.

You can't beat evil by being a wimp.
