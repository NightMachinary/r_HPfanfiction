I like your suggestions. I'm wondering if Draco would accept an offer from Dumbledore, or the very real threat of his family dying and I wonder where he ranked Voldemort vs. Dumbledore according to his view of the world. I don't think Voldemort takes control of the Ministry period.

Snape could also "try" to kill Dumbledore the year after. I don't know what Voldemort's deadline for Draco was here (quite literally a deadline too). I forgot about Slughorn too. Dumbledore still moves him into Hogwarts? Or is the pushed back schedule of Dumbledore not dying in the immediate future make him go about getting Slughorn's memory in another way. And if Snape is still teaching potions, Harry's not in there for the book.
