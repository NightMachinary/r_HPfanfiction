Snape wouldn't make the Vow. He and Dumbledore would offer Draco shelter, maybe pretending he died in his mission. Snape would be the next to be tasked with killing Dumbledore. He would "fail" and be banished from Hogwarts in the attempt, so he would appear to work full time for LV.

Dumbledore would find a better way to transport Harry out of Privet Drive, Harry's wand won't pwn Lucius' so LV won't be looking for the Elder Wand. Voldemort /probably/ won't manage to take control of the Ministry, but if he does, Hogwarts would remain Dumbledore's domain. Harry would probably return for a seventh year. Depending on the circumstances, taking the locket from Umbridge would probably be a lot easier. No sword shenanigans, they would destroy the Horcruxes with it.

If Harry would be at Hogwarts, he'd probably look for another Horcrux there and find the Diadem - though he might not find it straight away because he didn't Sectumsempra'd Draco and hid the book there (then again, Harry wanted to use the curse on McLaggen, so it might happen anyway). Not sure how they would know about the Cup or infiltrate Gringotts. Take it from there.
