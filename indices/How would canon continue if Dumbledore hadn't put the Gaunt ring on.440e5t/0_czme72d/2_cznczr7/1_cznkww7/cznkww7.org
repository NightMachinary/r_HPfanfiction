First, no one other than the Malfoys, Bellatrix, Snape, Dumbledore, and (doubtfully) Voldemort knew about the Vow. It was done in secret, the mission was a secret, Narcissa wasn't even supposed to talk about it to Snape.

He didn't have to make the Vow. Voldemort doesn't ask for Unbreakable Vows for every task he gives, the task wasn't given to Snape (Narcissa only asked for help) and Snape doesn't have to prove anything to Bellatrix. He only did it because Dumbledore already told him to.
