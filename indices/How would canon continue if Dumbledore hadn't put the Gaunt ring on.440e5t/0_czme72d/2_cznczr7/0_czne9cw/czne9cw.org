I don't think so. The death eaters seem very much so a every man for himself situation. The opening scene to book 7 comes to mind; the other death eaters have no problem laughing at the Malfoys after they had fallen down the social ladder.

As long as Snape agreed to kill Dumbledore after Draco failed, Voldemort wouldn't care about an unbreakable vow. Considering how finicky the whole thing seemed, and that Voldemort didn't require them for every little thing, he probably considered the vow a really dumb thing to do. Too many chances to 'break' it and die on accident.
