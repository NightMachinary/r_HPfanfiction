I think Voldemort would still be looking for the Elder Wand. He was first suspicious of the twin cores in GoF, and we have to assume there would be some kind of attack or assault on Harry again, because while Dumbledore's protection would make for better odds, it's inevitable that Voldemort would try to find a weak moment to attack Harry again and possibly the Weasleys or Hogwarts just to get to him. He might not have been so diligent in his search for the wand, but he would still have that solution on his mind.
