Hm...I don't think Harry's role can be "diminished" even more (because in the last book he relies on luck, chance and the sacrifice of others even more than in the previous volumes! It's no wounder that Hermione feels more like the hero in that book!), he's bumbling along without much of a plan (why move around in a tent for example? A house under the fidelius would be better and they'd have food and maybe company etc. too).

Ok, back to topic:

I think Dumbledore would cancel his crazy plan, he might even appologize to Harry for all the crap he went through because of Dumbledore, with Harry as a human sacrifice (come on, that plan was just crappy and it's a wounder that it worked in the first place!).

Dumbledore might surrender the Elder Wand to Harry (to help him fight Voldemort, I mean the wand is supposedly unbeatable and it would be a great equalizer in a fight!) for the final fight!

Of course he and Harry would hunt down the horcruxes (don't like that plot-device, but it sadly is canon!) without going on an extended camping trip!

Snape wouldn't make any vows, hell the greasy bastard might even survive (sadly...that was the one thing good about that book IMHO: Snape getting what he deserved...I will never understand why people like him (or Draco for that matter - I hate bullies because I've been a victim of people like those two once!))

Hm...Hogwarts would become "Resistance Central" (because there's no way Dumbledore would surrender the school and even if the ministry falls Hogwarts can be defended - it's a castle after all with tons of wards etc.) and a siege would happen IMHO! That would bind a lot of LV's forces, so that the resistance would have some more space to move around (there might even be a guerilla-style war - I mean now the resistance kind of is in the situation that LV and the deatheaters are during the first war, so the order and left over loyal aurors would strike from the shadows, there might even be a phoenix-mark or something to show that there's still resistance!)

Also: Dumbledore might get international allies on board to help with the fighting!

Draco might die on his mission (would only serve that bully right, he got off in canon which isn't fair - he should IMHO rot in prison for a decade or two and his fortune should be confiscated to pay for rebuilding (same for the fortune of other deatheaters like the Lestranges, the Carrows etc.)) if Dumbledore doesn't give him an out (sadly he probably would...second chances, for killers no less, my ass...sanctimonious prick - sacrificing a child is ok, killing killers isn't? Ok Dumbledore, I don't think I'll follow you!)
