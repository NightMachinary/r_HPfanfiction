  2015-10-27 - Forging the Sword: Chapter 16 update: My father was diagnosed and died of Leukemia this year, so fanfic writing took an 8-month hiatus. I am now writing again. About five months ago I made an executive decision, and chapter 16 now covers the entirety of the rest of fourth year. It'll be pretty big (best estimate at the moment is over 30,000 words) so instead of getting three 10,000 word chapters separated by a few months each, you should be getting the Durmstrang tournament as one 'book'. I think the pacing will work out better that way. Current wordcount: 21,000/32,000.

From the author's bio. So s/he had to take a break due to life stuff, but is working on it again.
