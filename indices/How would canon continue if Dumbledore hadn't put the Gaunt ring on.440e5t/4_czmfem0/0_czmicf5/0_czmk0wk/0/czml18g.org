The books were never building towards a huge awesome battle with spell-light shooting around and acrobatic flips and shit. Like, you'd have to not be paying attention to think it was going that way.

Voldemort is way more powerful, skilled and experienced than [seventeen-year-old] Harry (and pretty much everyone except Dumbledore). That fact has always been plain. The whole plot of the series is Harry trying to find a way to defeat him that doesn't rely on brute strength, because if he tried that he'd get his arse handed to him.

Like, were people expecting some sort of training montage where Harry emerged as Voldemort's duelling equal because reasons? It's so weird, half the time people complain because Harry rushes into stuff without thinking and then when he uses his smarts and only walks into a fight he's assured of winning and winning quickly they complain as well...

...oh I get it. You wanted something more...Gryffindor-y.
