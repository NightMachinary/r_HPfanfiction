That's how it happened in the first place, isn't it? Baby Harry didn't defeat Voldemort in an impressive drawn-out thing. It was pretty much bam, he's dead. Personally I adore bookends like that in stories, where they open with the close.

Though to be fair I did expect an amount of flashy flashiness from the final battle - from the Elder Wand, not from Harry. And it did deliver somewhat. I think because we never saw it on screen people don't realize just how dramatic that last scene was - the bang like a cannon blast, the golden flames dead center between them. With a little creative cinematic liberty it would have been waaaay more impressive than the movie version.
