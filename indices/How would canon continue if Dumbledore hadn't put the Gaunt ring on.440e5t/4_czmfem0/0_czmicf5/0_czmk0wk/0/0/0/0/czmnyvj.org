Eh I guess we just disagree. I wanted to story to show Harry grow, not necessarily be the same as it was when he was a kid. Don't get me wrong, I don't want him to be equal to Voldemort, just a small chance where a character rose to the occasion to defeat evil despite the overwhelming odds. I guess I just prefer that type of story as opposed to some theory won the battle. I feel like Harry potter is almost more of a hero's journey for Dumbledore than for Harry, and I wanted it to be a hero's journey for Harry. I really felt like it was building up to that until years 5-7.
