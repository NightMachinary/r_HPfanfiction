The power he knows not definitely wasn't any sort of dueling skill. In my opinion the best ending would have been a death eater(s) cursing Voldemort in the back for attacking Hogwarts of all places. Voldemort is a half-blood and used Pureblood prejudice for his personal gain. I think watching Harry stand up and fight someone he obviously can't beat in defense of the school would have been a fitting catalyst for this, and easily construed as the power-of-love and hand-of-the-other from the prophesy.

In the end Harry would have just been an ordinary wizard with extra-ordinary conviction, and it wouldn't have relied of ridiculous deus ex machina.
