That's an interesting point. However, desiring power is not the same as having power. IIRC, Dumbledore, at least, believed that if he were to die undefeated (killed by Snape on his orders), the power of the wand would die with him rather than transfer to Snape. (That said, that may be an extrapolation; I can try to search for canon references, if you want.)
