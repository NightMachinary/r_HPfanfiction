Weasleys were hostile and suspicious of Harry right from the start, but it was mainly caused by the meddling of another time traveller, whose identity is not revealed until the last sentence of this fic.

I actually enjoyed this angsty episode, although I hate angst in general. Weasleys at odds with Harry actually had quite a few interesting effects later in the story, many of them positive.
