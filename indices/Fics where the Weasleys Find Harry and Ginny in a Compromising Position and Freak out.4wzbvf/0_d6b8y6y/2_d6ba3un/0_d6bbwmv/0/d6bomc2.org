Yes, but in that particular case if felt ... contrived. Horny people can and often are stupid, but those two were together for long enough and furthermore lived long enough to be capable of controlling themselves for a few minutes when it's clear that they are somewhere where the adults have something against one of them and likely will take note of them disappearing. So it really feels like a cheap attempt at creating more drama by handing Ginevra a ball full of stupid.
