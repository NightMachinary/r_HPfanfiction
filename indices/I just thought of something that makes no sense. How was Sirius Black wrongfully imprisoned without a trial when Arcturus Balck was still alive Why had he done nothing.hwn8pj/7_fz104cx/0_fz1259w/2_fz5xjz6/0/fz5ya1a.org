Not sure, maybe Walburga left everything to Regulus in her will and didn't get round to writing a new one before she died. Perhaps she never quite gave up hope he'd turn up (after all they never actually found his body IIRC) or didn't think about the fact that everything would default to Sirius with him dead.
