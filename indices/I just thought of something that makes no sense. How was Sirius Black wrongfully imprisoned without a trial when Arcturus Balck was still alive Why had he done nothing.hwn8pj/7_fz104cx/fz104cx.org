Well Sirius' mother blasted him off of the family tree. But Arcturus must not have approved. If he had then Sirius would not have inherited the Black fortune/House and it would have then gone to Draco. So Arcturus never took action to remove Sirius from the family.

Now we don't know what Arcturus tried. But considering when Sirius first went in Azkaban you had Dumbledore (who believed he was guilty and knew he didn't have a trial), Crouch (same, plus wanted to look tough after his son), and Bagnold (same, and probably accepted bribes to keep deatheaters out of Azkaban and most likely Sirius in).

So even if Arcturus tried to get him out the 3 who could "open" a "closed" case didn't see the need or have the desire to. Then with Fudge elected and in Malfoy's pocket (who would benefit greatly from Sirius being in Azkaban) the odds of Arcturus succeeding were slim to none.

Canon never addressed this but several fics have (most on variations of the above).
