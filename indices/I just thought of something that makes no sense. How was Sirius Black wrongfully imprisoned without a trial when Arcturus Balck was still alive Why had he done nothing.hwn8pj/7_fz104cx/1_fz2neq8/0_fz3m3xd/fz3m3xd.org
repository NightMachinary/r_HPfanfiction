Sorry i was thinking next of kin (closest relative) for male inheritance which would be Draco. If inheritance is based on next of kin (closest relative) male or female it would be Bellatrix.

Of course, if lnheritance was based on blood/position of family then since the Sirius (1877) line is dead it would go to his brothers line (Arcturus 1884) and his daughter Callidora who married a Longbottom.

That's one part of the world that I don't think JKR fleshed out very well but it definitely gives fanfic authors lots of flexibility for stories.
