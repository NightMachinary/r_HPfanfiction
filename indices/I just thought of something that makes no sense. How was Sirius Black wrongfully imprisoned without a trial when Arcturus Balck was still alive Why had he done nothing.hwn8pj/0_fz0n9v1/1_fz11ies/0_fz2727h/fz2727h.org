That and I think a few other factors play in. Like @wyanmai and @Kininger625 stated, Sirius and his family hated each other (minus Andromeda) and Andromeda has to look out for her family first and foremost. You're right that she probably was of the belief that Sirius was guilty. The evidence against Sirius is too much and no one else knew of the switch. Another factor is that Andromeda was disowned by the Blacks. Even if she wanted to, it was her word against the Black family. A very powerful family along with other families that most likely supported them (Malfoy, Nott, Lestrange,). Even if Sirius got a trial and Andromeda was able to sway some favor against sending him to prison, the blacks and their supporters would probably bribe others to get Sirius in jail.
