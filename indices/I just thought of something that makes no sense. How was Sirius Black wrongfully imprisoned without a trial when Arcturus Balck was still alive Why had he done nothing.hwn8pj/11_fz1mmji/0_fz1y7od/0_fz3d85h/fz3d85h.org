That was Sirius's paranoia, yes. Him and Remus shspected each other and James didn't suspect anyone. Dumbledore suspected somebody /close/ to the Potters so he likely suspected Sirius, Peter and Remus. I wouldn't be surprised if he did suspect Peter instead, but was shocked when the traitor turned out to be Sirius. It's also why I feel Dumbledore easily accepted his innocence in POA.
