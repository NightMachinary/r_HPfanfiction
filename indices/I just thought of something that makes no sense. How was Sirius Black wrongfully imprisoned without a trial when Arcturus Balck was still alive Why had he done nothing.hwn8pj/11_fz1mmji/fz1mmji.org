It didn't serve the plot? Honestly, canon has a lot of loose strings/plot holes that most people either skip over or fix using their headcanon.

I feel like Arcturus would have tried since Sirius was his only remaining descendant, and the only young male to carry the Black name. However, the evidence plus the Black family openly backing Voldie meant no one would accept testimony from any of Sirius's relatives, not even Andromeda.

As for Andromeda, you have to understand the true tragedy of a civil war. Distrust is everywhere - your neighbor who looked after your kids the year before is now selling information about them in return for the safety of their own family. Brothers backstabbing each other, a son spying on his own family. You would believe anything of anyone - it's why James and Sirius found it so easy to believe that Remus would betray them. It's likely also why Sirius seemed to forgive the members of the Orders - he accepted that he would have done the same in their shoes.
