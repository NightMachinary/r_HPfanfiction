Thing is it's not just Sirius's point of view, though....the Black family is so notorious Dumbledore, McGongall, Moody, etc. aren't "surprised" that Sirius turned out "bad" (unfair, and they have their own slant, but the fact the family is so incredibly racist that multiple people are ready to write someone off for being a Black imo implies they must have been very, very bad),

Also, even if Reg was willing...if the timeline fits he would have only be 15/16. Any family that permitted that is just grossly negligent. Narcissa hates the idea of Draco joining in comparison. And the fact that the Potters were willing to take in Sirius is also a glaring red light that the Blacks were pretty awful instead of trying to reunite him with his family.

TLDR: It is from Sirius's POV, but there are hints and comments from other characters and certain elements which indicate they really were heinous.
