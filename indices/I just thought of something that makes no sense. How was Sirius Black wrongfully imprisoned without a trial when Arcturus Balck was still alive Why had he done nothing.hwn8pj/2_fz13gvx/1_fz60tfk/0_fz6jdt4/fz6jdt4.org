I'm not sure the family was /that/ bad, sure they were a bunch of blood purists and bigots, but we have to remember that we only have Sirius side of the story, not to mention he spent 13 years in Azkaban and must have lost any good memory he had with his family.\\
Anyways concerning the points you made :

- Andromeda ran off to marry a Mudblood. From the Black point of view, what's pretty much the worst thing she could have done. Not a good family but . . . blood purist.
- Sirius was cut off the family only after he left them, he is the one who burnt the bridges by running aways. And since he "only" been burnt and not dishinerited (like Andromeda), maybe he still had a chance to come back.
- Alphard was burnt the family tree by Walburga when she learnt he gave Galleons to Sirius to help him stay away from the family. It was more the tantrum of a mother rather than the concerted decision of the family.
- We don't know if Walburga portrait is an accurate representation of her. Some people speculated that the portrait was either "corrupted" by the house, or that Walburga kinda lost it in her old age.
- Nobody forced Regulus to join. He was fascinated by Voldemort (he clipped the articles talking about him in his room) and joined the Death Eaters himself. His parents must have been very proud, and Bellatrix probably helped him, but it was his mistake and his mistake alone. People seem to forget that Regulus was remorseless blood purist, he only "changed" side because Voldemort almost killed his House Elf.
- According to the Black Family tree, Cygnus Black got Bellatrix when he was . . . 13. It was probably Rowling who fucked up with numbers (never been that good with them), but yeah it's the canon age.
- I think Bellatrix was the most bigoted member of the Blacks, so I'm not sure she should be used as any kind of standard regarding them. After all, she considered Draco dying to complete his mission an honor while Narcissa was looking for a way to save him.
