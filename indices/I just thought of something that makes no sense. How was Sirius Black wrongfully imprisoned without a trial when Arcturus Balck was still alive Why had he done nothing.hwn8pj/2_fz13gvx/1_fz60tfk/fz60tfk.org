I always thought there was an implication the Black family was seriously abusive. Cutting Andromeda out like that and Bellatrix willingly killing her kin, Wahlburga screaming abuse and doing crazy shit to Sirius and trying to force her kids--not even Hogwarts grads---to join Voldmort, etc. Also, it might have been a fuck up by JK but I think the Black family tree has Andromeda, Bellatrix, and Narcissa's parents getting married when they are like 14 of all things. Doesn't one of them get completely cut out of the family simply for helping Sirius?

So yeah...it makes sense that this crazy, magically racist and incest ridden and possibly sexually abusive crazy family, wouldn't lift a finger to someone they saw as a 'traitor" to his family regardless of his innocent or guilt.
