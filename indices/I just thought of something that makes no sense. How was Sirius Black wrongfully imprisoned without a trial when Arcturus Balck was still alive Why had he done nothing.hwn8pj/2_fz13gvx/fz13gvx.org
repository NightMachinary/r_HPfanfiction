I could ask you why Arcturus should care about what happen to this grandson who forsook his family by running away in the night and going to live with another family. I could also ask you what make you think that Arcturus could have done anything (they were just a wealthy pureblood family, no the royalty of Magical Britain.

â€‹

But I'll rather just ask you this : Why bother?

To the general knowledge, Sirius just disappeared the night Voldemort was vanquised, and only resurfaced 5 days later, when he killed one of his supposed best friend, who had just accused him of having betrayed the Potter, as well as tens of muggles. Add at that the fact that Albus Dumbledore himself can swear that Sirius was the Potters Secret Keeper (since it's what they told him), and that only him could have told Voldemort their location, and his trial would be a formality.\\
I know that some people like to use the "Veritaserum" card, but as Rowling said, the potions as flaws. Sirius was probably talented enough to use some of the ways she mentioned, like transfiguring the potions into water when it reachs his lips, or he could have used the 5 days he disappeared to change his memory and say "his" truth to the jury. But even without any of that, it would have just taken one jury yelling "/He was You-Know-Who right hand man, he must have taught him some of his tricks/" to make him appear guilty no matter what.

So why would Arcturus use a lot of his potential ressources and favor to give Sirius a trial, when it would just have found him guilty in 5 minutes, and even have the risk to change his sentence from a life sentence to the kiss?
