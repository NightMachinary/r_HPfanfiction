That may be true, but I prefer a flimsy excuse to letting such a game breaking thing in the story. But anyways, "it can beaten on the spot" is only a secondary argument. The main arguments are still people refusing to be subjected to the potion, and memory manipulation.

People don't want to have all of their deepest secrets made public in front of a jury, and the few who ask for the potion would seem suspectfull because they are the exception, they may want the potion because they prepared against it.

Veritaserum make people say what he thinks is the truth. Under the potion, Morfinn Gaunt would admit killing the Riddles, Mrs Smith Elf would say she poisoned her, and Stan Shumpkin would explain how he tried to kill Harry Potter the night of his 17th birthday. All of them were innocent of their crimes but had their memory modified or were under the Imperius. Sirius had 5 days to change his before his arrest. Nothing he would say could have been trusted.
