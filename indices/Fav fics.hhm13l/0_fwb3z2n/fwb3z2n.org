[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1358209/chapters/2836213][Master of Death]] has Harry choose to travel to a parallel dimension in King's Cross. It's incomplete but doesn't end in a hanging way.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6122017][Outsiders and Other Eldritch Entities]] has the OotP of a different universe summon Harry the MOD to defeat Voldemort.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] is a HP/Sherlock crossover where Harry uses his MOD powers to make money as a medium. I didn't even watch Sherlock but I really enjoyed it.
