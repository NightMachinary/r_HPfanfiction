Out of the Night by Raining Ink was another one that was quite amazing for its characterizations and relative restraint in improving Harry without succumbing to illogical overpowering. It was removed from fanfiction.net but I believe there's a copy floating around out there. Obviously (and sadly) abandoned, but it was good enough to be worth recommending.
