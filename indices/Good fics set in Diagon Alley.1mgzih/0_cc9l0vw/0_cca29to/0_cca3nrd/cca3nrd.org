Harry suffers a mental breakdown while being convicted to Azkaban. He serves his time and rebuilds his life away from the magical world.

Rated: Fiction T - English - Harry P. - Chapters: 21 - Words: 73,611 - Reviews: 517 - Favs: 1,250 - Follows: 1,851 - Updated: 04-15-13 - Published: 07-30-09 - id: 5262122

It's a bit angsty with the Azkaban!Harry stuff and Harry doesn't really stay away from the magical world- he gets a job with Ollivander. Incomplete, but maybe the author can be prodded into updating it by getting a few more reviews/visitors.
