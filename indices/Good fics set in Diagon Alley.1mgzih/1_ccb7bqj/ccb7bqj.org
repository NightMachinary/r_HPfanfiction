Not /technically/ Diagon Alley, but the Ministry built a new alley after the war. It's just shy of shameless crack, but it's the good kind. Gives you a look at the day in and day outs of owning a magical sex shop during December holiday rush. Main character's include Harry, Hermione, Draco, Ron, the twins (yah, DH didn't really happen, can't remember the exact details of the end of the war), Luna, Severus, and a senile old lady named Emma Thompson. I linked both FF.net and AO3 to make life easier. There's also a sequel that's just as long.
