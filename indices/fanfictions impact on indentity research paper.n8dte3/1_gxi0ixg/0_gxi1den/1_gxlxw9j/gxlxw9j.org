Considering the paper is about minorities in gender identity specifically, it might be a good idea to improve the first question. You can sort non-binary and gender-fluid people from men and women, but transgenders are minorities as well, and they'll choose the same answers as the cisgenders. This can affect the outcome of your research, because you can't tell who is part of the group of people your paper is about and who isn't.
