Ah, okay. So, kind of similar our GCSE and A-Levels (qualifications in the UK), by the looks of a quick google on the subject. Thanks. :)

I am a little confused by one thing though - is it one qualification on lots of topics, or one qualification for each topic? I know you can do courses in different topics, but I'm not sure how that translates to the actual awarded qualification(s?) at the end.

If you don't mind answering, of course. :)
