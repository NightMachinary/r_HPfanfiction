Just to clarify, the Harry in this story is essentially the cannon Dumbledore of that verse, I would say Dumbledore is bashed in the story but truth be told he just doesn't play enough of a role for it to be considered bashing, it would be like trying to bash Maflada Hopkins (the one who sends the underage magic letters) only with cannon as basis.
