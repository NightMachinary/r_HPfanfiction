Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap): Harry is generally abrasive and not all that good, but he keeps charging through tanking everything in his way.

The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): Harry has totally been changed by the future in this fic, such that he is more brutal than in any other fic I can think of. He blows off Voldemort's hand at one point, and when he comes back with a silver hand like Pettigrew, Harry says "I liked your hand the other way: it was more satisfying to look at."

The Darkness Within linkffn(The Darkness Within): Harry is pretty much rude and assholish to everyone except maybe Voldemort. Even by the the third book, he never really gets along with anyone except maybe his brother, and nobody is shocked when he might do something really evil (or they believe it so easily).
