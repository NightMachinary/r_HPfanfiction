I really like the Lore of Misplaced. How the author explains the History of Naruto's Earth and the Sheningans following, *BUT* My problem with this fiction, and it is a general problem with all the Mass Effect crossover fictions, is that the plot is a carbon copy of the Plot of the 3 games, at least to the point I read which is like 600k words in. There is like zero deviation from the main Plotline and the secondary missions.
