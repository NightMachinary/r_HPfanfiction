  But to expand on the complaint, Stations of Canon are a pretty big thing in any fanfic for any intellectual property. Very few fanfics make an entirely original story, unless they take it outside the timeframe of the canon

Sure, that's quite fine when you are new to the world of fanfictions, but when you read hundreds of fictions following Canon, it becomes boring and really really repetitive. Unfortunately All Slytherin Harry, all WBWL, All Indy!Harry, OP!Hermione (and etc.) fictions tend to respect the same Tropes and in the end be the same thing.

That's why generally why I only now read fictions which are very AU, or about Time-travel, or during a non Canon Period or with an Original main character, not because the rest is Bad but just because I'm bored to read the same thing all over again.
