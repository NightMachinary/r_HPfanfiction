But to expand on the complaint, Stations of Canon are a pretty big thing in any fanfic for any intellectual property. Very few fanfics make an entirely original story, unless they take it outside the timeframe of the canon. I mean, how many fanfics that take place during the Hogwarts years have you read that /didn't/ have Dumbledore setting up a trap for Voldemort with the Philosopher's Stone(or a fake Philosopher's Stone)?
