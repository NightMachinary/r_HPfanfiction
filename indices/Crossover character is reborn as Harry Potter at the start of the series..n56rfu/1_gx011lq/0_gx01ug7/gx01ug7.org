Now THIS is broom racing! I would looooove to see Anakin as Harry. But I think I would like it even more if it was post-Mustafar Anakin. I think he'd be convinced he was being forced (intentional word choice) to serve some sort of penance for what he had done: having to spend the next seven years with a bunch of younglings, being the chosen one again, trying and failing to get the rank of master from the order.
