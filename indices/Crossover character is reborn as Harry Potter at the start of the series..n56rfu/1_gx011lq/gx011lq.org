I think Pug of Midkemia would be cool, he was a very powerful two hundred+ year old magician who fought other magic users, aliens, demons and gods. I'd love to see him interact with the potterverse.

Also, I'd like to see Phantom Menace era Anakin take Harry's place, just to see if he'd mess up or not.
