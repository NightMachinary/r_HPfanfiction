I'd never given much thought to how I would die /-/ though I'd had reason enough in the last few months. But even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. I would not have imagined waking up afterward in this tiny (infinitesimal really), spider-filled cupboard. I would not have imagined the rainy, suburban neighborhood, neatly lined with brown brick houses and tile shingles. And I certainly would not have imagined the family that shared the space with me and seemed to, for some reason, very strongly dislike me.

I found myself cooking breakfast for them nonetheless, thinking about how Charlie never complained if I burned his bacon. And despite my inner confusion and turmoil, about three things I was absolutely certain.

1. I was inhabiting the body of an eleven year old British boy.
2. This was, amazingly, more strange than anything that had happened to me in Forks.
3. That Hufflepuff third year I met on the train to school was going to be unsurpassedly good looking in a few years.
