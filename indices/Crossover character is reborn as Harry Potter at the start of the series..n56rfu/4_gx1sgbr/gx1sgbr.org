Albus knew something was wrong with the boy. Harry's demeanor was twisted from the very moment Hargid met up with him. Harry's hair had grown long, his skin pale, and his mouth silent. More importantly, Harry developed... odd capabilities. He seemed to apparate silently, often seen in the corner of one's eye yet never there when they turned to look. He somehow hid /inside the paintings/. Such a thing shouldn't be possible as even the people inside weren't living souls.

The worst part was that people started disappearing. Significant numbers of Slytherin House had vanished, its head of house included. The boy was immediately under Albus's unspoken scrutiny.

He went to interrogate Petunia for answers. The townspeople he met with said no one lived in that area for years, they'd all disappeared. Hagrid could be forgiven for forgetting such a detail if what he'd told Albus of his first meeting with the boy had any measure of truth. Albus knew then that he would not find the answers he was looking for, but he went to Petunia's house anyway. He wished he hadn't.

Albus immediately began searching for ways to either fix the boy or /deal with him/ before he became more of a problem. Two dark lords in a single lifetime was already far too many. The only fact about the boy he thought might be useful against him was the video tape he always had with him, but it seemed to be a red herring.

Albus finally decided the best he could do was confront the boy head-on. He grabbed the map that was confiscated from the Weasley twins and looked for the boy's name. Distressingly, Harry Potter was nowhere to be found; however, /most/ interesting was the fact that there were two names in his office. His own was obvious, but who on earth was Samara Morgan...
