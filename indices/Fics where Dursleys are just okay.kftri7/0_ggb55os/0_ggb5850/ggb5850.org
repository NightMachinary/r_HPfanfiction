#+begin_quote
  A sleeping child with her sister's eyes left in her care forces Petunia to make a choice, hold on to her bitterness and resentment for her sister, or work to make things right with someone who no longer was around to be able to forgive her. As challenging and heartbreaking of a circumstance she was put in, Petunia manages to become a mother to two boys, with some help along the way from another lost and grieving soul.

  (Sequel to Petunia's Invitation) Evanses, Dursleys, Weasleys, Potters... All these families, past and present, and all of them a source of some strife or another. Petunia doesn't seem to be able to disentangle herself from any of them.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.

  Lily and James left Harry a muggle trust fund with a muggleborn trustee. This will impact Harry's childhood, leading to a more grounded Harry going to Hogwarts.This starts in Novemeber 1981, quickly covers Harry's pre-Hogwarts days, and Chp. 3 is when Harry's letter arrives.Anything recognizable belongs to JKR.

  The life of one Petunia Marie Evans had never been easy, and it hadn't been particularly pleasant for a long time either. In another world, one much different than this, Petunia was alone. Jealousy turned into bitterness turned into hatred - and hatred marks the soul like nothing else.This time was different. Petunia found a family, one that cared for her and loved her, when she was on the brink of loosing herself to her anger and it saved not only her life, but Harry's too.
