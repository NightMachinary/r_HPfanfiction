Perhaps, but the story is not pregnant-child oriented (or even lemon), it is more part of the environment where the number of children and mothers is a bit overwhelming. And child nudity (or any nudity) is really culturally given thing ... I have never had a problem with it when I was a child, and I questioned it only when my ten year or so old friend (a girl) went swimming in nude. When I have protested it with my parents, they told me it was OK. We are not Germans, but Germany with FKK beaches is just next door from us.
