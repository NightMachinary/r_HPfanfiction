Sounds interesting. The only fic I can think of that involves Hermione going to Beauxbatons and coming to Hogwarts for TWT is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159]]) --- but it's a heavy AU, and she never attends Hogwarts in the first place.

As a bit of an aside, no matter how much bashfic authors wish it were so, Ron was not bullying Hermione. Read the first few chapters of PS: Ron would have loved nothing better to be left alone by Hermione and was open and direct about it. All their negative interactions were initiated by Hermione, because hectoring and unsolicited advice was how early-canon Hermione expressed friendship. So can we please bury this fanon already? Please?
