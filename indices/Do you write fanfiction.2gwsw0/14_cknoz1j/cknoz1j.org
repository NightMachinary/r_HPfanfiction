I've written [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7ECookieDust][a fair few]]. Mostly one shots for a handful of fandoms, but did do a HP AU trilogy that totals in at about 600K words. I was pretty proud and impressed with myself when I wrote it, but since then I've realised all the bad things about it. I don't regret writing it though; it helped me finds my strengths and weaknesses and was a huge step in improving my writing.
