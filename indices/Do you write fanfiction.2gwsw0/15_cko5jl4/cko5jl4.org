Yes, I do. I've written two unfinished Code Geass fanfics, and I have one longer (still unfinished...) Harry Potter fic. It's Harry/Hermione/Fleur. My profile is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864841/][here]], and the HP fanfic is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8871485/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sc%C4%ABenra-Cw%C4%93na][Harry Potter and the Scīenra Cwēna]].
