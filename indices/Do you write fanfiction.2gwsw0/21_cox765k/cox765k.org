So it looks like this discussion is pretty old, but anyway... :D So I began to write a few fanfics but never got around to finish but one. Kinda feel bad about it... Oh and I read a LOT of fanfics really, especially where the main character is badass/powerful. But I also enjoy the "ordinary" heroes if the plot is interesting enough.

Anyway here is my profile if you want to check it out.: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5243349/gogo199432][profile]]
