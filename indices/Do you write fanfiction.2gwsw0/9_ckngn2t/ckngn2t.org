Yes. I have a few stories in progress, one finished one-shot, and one terrible short novel that I'm firing into the sun and writing a sequel for. That is, I like the direction it was pointed toward at the end and want to continue that, but the content of the story is deeply problematic, and I'm not sure it's fixable.
