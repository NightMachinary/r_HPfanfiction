That didn't sound quite right but I wasn't sure so I had to [[http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/USCSS_Nostromo][look it up]]. It was a freighter/tug. Much less romantic than a ship mining in the farthest reaches of deep space. There's not really one ship that sticks out to me as fitting the description of deep space miner though, as in most universes they simply exist in the background or are canon fodder representative of how fucked the local area and/or hero is. As for research spacecraft, there are far too many to name individually, but I think Destiny from SGU fits the best: 700 million light years from normal but somehow everything works out for the best, and you learn a whole lot along the way.
