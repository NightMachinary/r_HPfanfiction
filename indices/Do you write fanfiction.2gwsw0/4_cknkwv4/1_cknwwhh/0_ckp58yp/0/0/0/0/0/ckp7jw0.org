And a fishing ship doesn't actually do the fishing within its own hull, it hauls around nets to collect the fish, and afterward holds the fish in its hold.

The people on board were space miners, hauling around automated mining equipment. The ship Nostromo was a tug for hauling that equipment. Your website of choice is simply one that doesn't use the term "mining" for the Nostromo itself. From the first page of Google results.

#+begin_quote
  The USCSS Nostromo (reg. 180924609) was a $42 billion (and adjusted) dollar *mining vessel* owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, a Lockmart CM 88B Bison M-Class starfreighter used as a commercial hauler between Thedus and Earth. The Nostromo was 243.8 meters in length, 164.6 meters wide and 72.5 meters in height. It also carried (or rather pulled) a massive refinery behind it for processing ore on the long trip to Earth.

That isn't even a very interesting argument. I'm shipping space mining and the Nostromo, and the facts and basic ontology of the sci-fi setting back me up.

Just like Harry/Tonks, there might have to be a lot of extra stuff to haul around along with the ship to make it work. But everything still fits together and you should call both what they are.

Fully functional drilling operations.
