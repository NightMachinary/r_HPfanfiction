That did mining. Which is why it hauled a hugeass refinery behind it, along with the ore.

Ugh. Don't remind me of that abortion of a show. All the worst parts of the SG universe, combined with trying to be Battlestar Galactica (another horrible soap opera) as well. I had managed to forget for several months. SG: Atlantis was better, which is awful to have to acknowledge.

But then again, Harry/Tonks is almost never part of a well-thought-out, /finished/ fanfic, so it sort of fits in that way.
