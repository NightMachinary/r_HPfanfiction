Yeah, I [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eerbkaiser][dabble]] a bit. Got about 350k words across several short and longer stories.

Currently I have one somewhat smutty [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10256543/1/Nymphadora-s-Beau][ongoing Harry/Tonks fic]] and once that's done I'll be going back to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9406757/1/One-Misfired-Spell-Later][a Harry/Hermione/Fleur multichapter]] which I'm not particularly proud of (it was too unplanned) but people seem to like it so I'll try to do better in the continuation.

I also write a lot of shorter stories, some no more than a drabble, some completed one-shots.

I'm still amazed by how many people read my fics each time I get a review.
