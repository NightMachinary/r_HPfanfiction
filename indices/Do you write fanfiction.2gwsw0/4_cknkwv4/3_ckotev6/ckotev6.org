YOU! Seriously loving Beau, so glad you updated today =)

In news completely unrelated to how much I like your stories, it's a bit nutty finding people with wildly different users across websites. I've had all of three users personally: my ~6th grade one, my college one, and this one, and I've transitioned all but one or two of the sites I use to this username. I'm a huge fan of consistency in that way. Pretty much any time you see NedryOS, odds are its me. But that's just my opinion.
