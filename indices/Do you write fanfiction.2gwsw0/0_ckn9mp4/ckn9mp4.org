I wrote fic back in the early 00s when I was in middle/high school. It was Pokemon, Digimon, and a single chapter of some Harry/Draco fic I was trying out. My Pokemon and Digimon fics were a hit on ffn back in the day, so I thought I was such a good writer. And when I got into Harry Potter I knew I wanted to write something.

Aaaand it sucked. I realized pretty quickly the quality of fics in the HP fandom were so much higher than the anime fandoms I previously was in and my skills just weren't there. That was the end of my short-lived fan fiction writer career. Haha.
