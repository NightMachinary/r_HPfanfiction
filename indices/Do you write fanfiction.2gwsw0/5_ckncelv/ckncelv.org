Yep, I write. Done over a quarter of a million words worth so far, much of it published. Did one huge chuck of a story for NaNoWriMo one year, then started writing original fiction as well. Three novels currently in progress.

Here I am on [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/TimeLoopedPowerGamer/profile][AO3]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etimeloopedpowergamer][Fanfiction.net]]. Be warned: one of my AO3 stories is just straight-up porn. Also, it is pretty good if I do say so. Not an HP fic, however, though I am working on one of those.

The other two, also on FFN, are a Naruto and a Harry Potter story. Neither are finished but they aren't abandoned either. I did just update /Witch Queen/, so there is that. Haven't updated the Naruto story on AO3 with all completed chapters yet, for some reason. Hmm...

As for how good they are, I couldn't really say, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] has over 100,000 views in its lifetime and is in 31 communities. The Naruto story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8782164/1/Secret-Treasures-of-the-Uchiha][Secret Treasures of the Uchiha]], isn't quite as popular, but was also well received. Both would be more popular if I'd just finish them already.

I also read fanfic like a hungry badger. Can't say I really care for short one-shots, as my favorite stories are always at least novel sized (80k+ words).
