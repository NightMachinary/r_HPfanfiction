Thanks! I had to write and rewrite three or so times to avoid the classic "yelling at Dumbledore" for the scene in chapter 13. Initial drafts of that one got...intense, but I think that sort of thing is really, really boring. And if there is one thing I'm trying to do with this story, it is be not-boring.
