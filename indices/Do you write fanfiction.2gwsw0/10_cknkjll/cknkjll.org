If anyone here likes Jhonen Vasquez stuff, I still recommend my fanfiction from when I was in high school. I dug that so hard.

As for HP, I did write two completed fics. The first when I was about 13 or 14... I almost don't regret losing the file over the years. The second was about six years later and significantly better, but still not great. Haven't given up the dream, though...
