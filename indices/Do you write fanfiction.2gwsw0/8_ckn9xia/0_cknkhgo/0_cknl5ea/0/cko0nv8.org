Mine was before the Whomping Willow thing, so everybody was pretty tight still. It's basically like a soap opera, where James and Sirius overhear Remus having sexy dreams about Sirius, and the events that follow from that. Sirius is hypocritically homophobic at first, while James is totally supportive and stuff, and Remus angsts for a bit before he and Sirius end up kissing in the last chapter. It's a sweet story, but the characters are pretty shallow, looking back on it. If I were to rewrite it, I'd make the homophobia into a bigger conflict, and I'd make James a more complex character as well.
