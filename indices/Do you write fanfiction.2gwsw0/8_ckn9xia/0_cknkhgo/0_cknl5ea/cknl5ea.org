What was yours about?

Mine was focused on the time when Remus/James/Peter weren't talking to Sirius because of the Snape/Wumping Willow incident.

It was the angstiest piece of writing I've ever seen in my entire life.

It had everything, characters telling others they hate each other, the threat of Remus being executed for being a werewolf, self harm/suicide attempt.

Good lord it was so angst ridden.

I thought mine was great too when I wrote it. Now though...

However, every now and then I get an alert telling me someone favourited or followed me because of that story.
