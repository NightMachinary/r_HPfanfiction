I used to write for YGO and once I grew tired of that fandom, I turned to Harry Potter since I have been into the books since it first came out. I am really thinking of going back to my other older fandoms as well [X-men, Sailor Moon, etc].

I am in the process of changing things around atm but right now I write mostly gen, and occasional slash. My favorite character focus is Harry but I like playing with certain lesser developed characters like Merope Gaunt or Eileen Prince. Tom/Lucius/Severus friendship is a thing of win. :)

Holy fuck I realize I have been posting fanfiction for a decade. AUUUUGH
