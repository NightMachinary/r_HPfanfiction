It's a Doctor Who crossover where an encounter with a Weeping Angel as a kid causes them to become Harry's greatest fear. So if you know your Weeping Angels, you'd that when Harry's boggart turns into one during their first DADA class in third year, no one is safe.

The whole fic is well written but there is one chapter towards the end that is perfectly tense and horrifyingly good. It does have a sequel that is almost as good although that's taking a lot longer for the author to finish.
