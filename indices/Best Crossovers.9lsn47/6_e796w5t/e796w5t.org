harry potter x sword art online

the harry potter timeline is shifted up accordingly, and the general world around it is transformed into some kind of weird mega crossover clusterfuck including, most weirdly, ALF. the sitcom about that puppet alien that eats cats

but i still like it. the mega crossover elements dont enter into it much until you get to the sequels
