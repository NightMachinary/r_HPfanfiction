I will forever recommend Mischief's heir. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

Summer after first year Harry is locked in his room and makes a prayer to Loki who decides to answer it. It's a series, it's completed, and it's a wonderful ride that involves families of choice, kids reaching their full potential and being little innovative geniuses, independent Harry, restored Tom Riddle, magic, science, space programs, and so much more. It's amazing and I adore it so much I have trouble putting it into words.
