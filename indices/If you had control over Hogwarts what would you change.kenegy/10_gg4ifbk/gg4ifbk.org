For one week (probably the same one as OWLs and NEWTs) regular second year classes are canceled and instead second years take all the electives. One week isn't a lot for studying an elective subject, but it can cover:

- What the subject even is (I don't think Harry found this out about arithmancy until later)
- Why it's useful
- Why it's interesting
- Some very basics that every Hogwarts graduate ought to know so they don't embarrass themselves
- For each student, whether they're likely to be good at it

After this, each student meets with their head of house to discuss which electives they want to take. They discuss careers, mostly from a keeping-options-open perspective. They also discuss total workload (some students will try to over-exert themselves, others to under-exert -- both need to be reined in).

At the end of the discussion the student picks subjects.

No more getting cut off from careers because of your 12-year-old self's "closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list".
