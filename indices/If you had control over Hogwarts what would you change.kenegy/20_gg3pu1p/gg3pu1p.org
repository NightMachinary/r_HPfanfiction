Minor houses, as suggested by The Rupert in Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy: you get sorted into your main house, and then your secondary house based on your other personality traits. Like Hermione would be a Gryffindor major with a ravenclaw minor. sleep in whatever dorm you want eat at whatever table you want. reduces house rivalry/bullying and overall us/them mentality in the wizarding world.
