More teachers and more students. More clubs and extra-curriculars - newspaper, theatre, duelling club, charms club, even just study groups. Excursions on weekends (or even during weekdays if it's for a specific year level or class and is educational), school trips over the holidays. Maybe an orientation week for the first years in the first week of school, where they get shown around by a teacher and told how to use the Owlery, the library, etc. More school traditions - i.e the Hufflepuffs put on an egg hunt every year on the last day of term before the Easter holidays, all the fifth years run into the lake in their robes and swim when they finish their O.W.Ls, things like that. A school counselor. Greater opportunity to go home and visit family; even if it's only once or twice a month. Career day!!
