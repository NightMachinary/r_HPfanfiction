“Muggle Studies”, would become compulsory for the first two-three years, and I'd change it to “History and Traditions of the Non-Magical World”---although I suppose Muggle Studies is a sufficient enough name, I rather dislike the word Muggle. It would teach students basic history and traditions of the Non-Wizarding world, how to use Muggle writing instruments, basics maths etc. and if you continue it past year three it teaches you things like how to get a higher education in the Muggle world, job applications etc, etc.

And on the other side of the spectrum I'd make a compulsory course for years two-three for “Introduction and Traditions of the Wizarding World”, or something similar to that name I suppose. It would teach students things like how to use and care for quills, ink, etc, etc. along with any traditions that are commonly seen in the Wizarding World---whatever those may be. It would introduce students to all the basics so everyone's on the same page and no one is left feeling clueless.

Edit: I'd also remove Divination, and for those who show talent/promise towards it would get something of a tutor of sorts. I suppose like a one-on-one apprenticeship, or however many show promise.
