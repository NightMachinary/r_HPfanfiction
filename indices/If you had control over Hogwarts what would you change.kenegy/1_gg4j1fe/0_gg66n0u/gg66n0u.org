And an orientation! Are the teachers not tired of first years arriving late (or never arriving at all) to class? It's ridiculous how they're just expected to figure out everything for themselves. Like, are there even signs?

I'd also add more inter-house common areas. The common rooms are fine if your friends are in your house, but it doesn't seem like students from other houses are allowed in?? Like, there's the library but you can't talk or else you'll get kicked out by Madam Pince (if she's still alive). There's also the Great Hall, but that's not nearly as cozy.

And it'd be cool to have a place where students can get food at all times. Like a snack cart or something?
