Increase the number of teachers; if not, reduce the number of positions one person can hold (none of this Transfiguration professor/Head of House/Deputy Headmistress baloney). One way or another, they desperately need more adults there.

OK, that wasn't a class, but it is an issue.

Release Binns. Modify Divination to be more of an introduction to the possibilities with a test (if possible) to find those with a genuine talent who should get instruction. Move Potions out of the dungeons and light and ventilate the place properly (the lighting and ventilation conditions may mostly be fanon, but if not, it should be fixed). Vet the teachers better. Update Muggle Studies with an emphasis on cameras. If there are educational standards, enforce them; if there aren't any, put them in place.

All that out of the way, I like the idea of adding courses like Intro to Wizarding Society, Estate Management (or some sort of financial or economic course), Household Charms (like Home Ec), Intro to Magical Law (aka political science or Civics). Arts/Humanities classes like Literature or Magical Painting. Alchemy for the advanced students. Some physical ed classes. I feel as though something medical would not be amiss, although I'm not sure what exactly.

Some basic seminars might be helpful. How to use the library properly, for example; I know there were one-shot classes in both my high school and college that did that. How to write with a quill--that could be part of the Into to the Wizarding World. Tutors to bring under or disadvantaged students up to snuff (reading, etc) as well as providing help in other things like classes or how to write an essay. [how many essays do you think homeschooled kids like the Weasleys wrote? And why would Muggle standards be the same as Hogwarts'? Sounds like more than half could use this.] Sex ed? Covering relevant potions, spells, how to say No, and how to identify magical threats like succubi (if they exist).

Didn't mean for this to be so long; started typing and it all just /flowed/!
