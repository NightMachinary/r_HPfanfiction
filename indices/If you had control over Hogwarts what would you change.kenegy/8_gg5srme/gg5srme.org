The first thing that I would do is to hire more staff. How the school operates in the canon is really unrealistic. There are just fifteen teachers for a school that has over seven hundred students. Really, I'd have more assistant professors on the Hogwarts staff that would be able to manage the education for the lower years( Perhaps 1-3).

Secondly, the classes for the lower years(Years 1-5) are organised as two houses of the same year together at a time. If we calculate it for the first year, the children would have the following classes:

1. Transfiguration
2. Potions
3. Charms
4. DADA
5. Herbology
6. Astronomy(Wednesday Nights Maybe)
7. Flying lessons

The time table should be made in a way so that the courses can be completed satisfactorily within the time of an academic year. In these classes, I'd add introductory classes to both the wizarding world and the muggle world, which would then form the basis of the muggle studies course as [[/u/Mishcl][u/Mishcl]] said. I'd also expand the muggle studies course to be a kind of an accumulation of joint courses offered by various schools such as Eton along with Hogwarts.

Then there are other electives, which I'd want for all the third years to have a trial class so that they can understand what they would be getting into. These electives will also be used to give the students a better specialization.

Removing Divination wouldn't do much. There are forms of divining such as tarot card reading and tea leaves which while being extremely vague would be useful.

More clubs, definitely.

Also, along with the trial classes, the students would be given a list of professions that require an education in the subject, so that they can choose wisely. The students would also have the option of having extra classes during their sixth and seventh year to learn another elective if they suddenly want to change their path. Career counselling will happen every year from the third year onwards.

The higher years( i.e., 6 and 7) would have more specialized classes and projects. It would also be emphasized upon them to form connections, and many times they'd have guest lecturers and scouts invited to the school so that they can both provide for information and to find capable candidates for things such as apprenticeship or auror training.

Edit: Forgot about it the first time, History of Magic should be an actual course, not a place for students to sleep. We learn many things from history. It is a testament to our lives today.
