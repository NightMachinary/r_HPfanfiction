All teachers have a teaching degree. All teachers must know basic first aid, or whatever the magical equivalent is. All teachers will be monitored to some degree, and complaints about a teachers behaviour will be taken seriously so that another Snape, or Umbridge don't come about.

Casting of magic above a certain level outside pre-approved areas will carry serious consequences. Potions use on another will have serious consequences. The use of a mild truth potion will be allowed, it should be a potion that makes it impossible to lie, but you don't have to answer. Mind magics will be prohibited, and punished harshly unless appropiate permissions are given. That's all I got right now.
