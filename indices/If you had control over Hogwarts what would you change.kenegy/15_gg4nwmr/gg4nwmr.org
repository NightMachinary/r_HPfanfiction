After what's happened at the school:

-A damn therapist

-More than one nurse

-A counselor

-Something to cruelly keep the students out of the forbidden forest so they can't just waltz in whenever nobody's looking

-Maybe locked doors so the students can't leave the castle at night

-A use for all these extra classrooms mentioned

-Something to get rid of myrtle she's creepy

-Theater class (I wanna see wizarding theater kids damnit)
