It seems like everyone covered the courses and classes but one thing no one mentioned is the fucking moving stairs. It seems so inconvenient to be heading to class but the staircase starts moving so you have to go the long way around and now you're 25mins late to charms. So yeah get rid of those maybe have magical escalators instead?

Get rid of peeves or give him an actual job like being a ghostly guard that looks out for students past curfew instead of being a general hazard to students. On the subject of ghosts Binns needs to go and update the course since it seems like Binns hasn't changed anything.

I read this fic where the houses have combined common rooms so there's the Slytherdor, Griffinclaw, etc. anyone can go into those common rooms doesn't just have to be the two houses and each room has it's own thing. You're allowed to stay up past curfew while in those rooms too.

Include more sports like quidditch is fine but seriously wizards need some variety. Like what about broom racing and people are able to modify their brooms to go faster (limited to professional racers only though). Also you can't tell me muggleborns and halfbloods dont play muggle sports like c'mon you're telling no one in Hogwarts has ever said "Hey does anyone want to play some football?"

There needs to be more modes of magical transportation especially for underage wizards. All brooms should come with a "cloak mode" that makes them invisible when activated that way people can fly without worrying about being seen.

Feild trips should definitely be a thing where they are able to go to prominent magical places. Career day should be a thing how can anyone chose a career when they dont know their options?

More wizard holidays there's Yule but I dont remeber if there was anything else. Merlin seems to be pretty important so why not have a holiday around him? There has to be /some/ major events in wizard history that would have holidays around them.

A better fucking government. There should be a magical CPS cause it seems like wizarding families dont know what "child endangerment" means and of course so that magical children don't become obscurals (spelling?) duh. Some sort of goverment financial aid as well, muggleborns and poor wizarding families could benefit from that. How are muggleborns paying for things when they dont have wizard money or they might not have enough so yeah finacial aid.

Magical kids should be able to practice over the summer maybe some sort of summer camp? It would gives those that failed a class the chance to make it up and those that want to get in more practice or stay a bit ahead would be able to. (I imagine Harry would go to get away from the Dursleys and Hermione would go to get ahead)

This one is very simple and its give first years a map of the school you dumbfucks one the first things Harry and Ron did was get lost getting to class. The Muardurs (spelling?) managed to do it so why cant you oh great headmaster? The map could be like the minecraft map where it tells you where you are and points in the direction you're facing. Boom no more children accidentally wondering into potentially dangerous areas.

There should be a student body government I know there's Perfects and Headboys/girls but they mostly deal with their own houses. Plus more house unity yay.

Dont house dangerous objects that Dark Lords want to get their hands on in a school full of children (looking at you Dumbledore safest place my ass)

Substitute teachers. If an applicant doesnt get the job but their resume and credentials are good they can be called in to substitute for that class.

The school should have more events once the allure of magic wears off it seems kinda boring. Like no prom for 7th years? what a drag.

There should be a study group with teachers and perfects present to help those struggling.

There should be some sort of snack bar. There has to be situations where a student doesnt wake up on time so they miss breakfast or if someone is just thirsty then what? Wait until dinner? No

I mostly focused on more social issues and general incovinces since most people already talked about classes and courses.
