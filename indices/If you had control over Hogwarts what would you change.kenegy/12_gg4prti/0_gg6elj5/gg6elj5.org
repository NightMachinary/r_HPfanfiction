There's an unfinished fic where Harry got some extra tuition over the summer (post 4th year IIRC) and made these maps for Gryffindor first years. Based on the Marauders Map, it showed all the public spaces and the best route to get there, plus would add places as the student went there. As soon as a student got one, it would be keyed to them. Gryffindor because Harry knew that House. Flitwick saw one and got very excited, because of the charms work as well as the concept itself; Harry gave him an unkeyed one and told him how to adjust for Ravenclaw. Don't know if he gave one to Sprout and Snape wouldn't ask Potter to spit on him if he was on fire.

You would think if a group of students could figure out how to tie something like that into the magic/wards of the school, a headmaster could as well. I suppose it can be chalked up to the Wizarding World's notion of "if it works, no need to improve." If a thousand years of students managed to get around without extra guidance, then it's fine. Right?
