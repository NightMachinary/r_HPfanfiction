Abolish Slytherin and resort its students into other Houses.

It really should be obvious why the following is a recipe for disaster:

1. Take children who are already predisposed to value or at least tolerate dishonesty and self-aggrandisement over other things.
2. Teach them that these are virtues and that everyone else is against them.
3. Also teach them to admire a founder who was considered to be xenophobic /in his own time/.
4. Appoint heads of house who are alternate between corrupt wheelers-and-dealers and former Death Eaters who never outgrew their childhood rivalries.
5. Let them stew in this environment for 7 years.

But, apparently, people insist on following it because tradition, or something.
