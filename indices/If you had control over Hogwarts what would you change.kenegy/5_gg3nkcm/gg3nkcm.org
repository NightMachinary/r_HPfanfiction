A dueling elective. Magical theory classes (if hogwarts really is one of the best schools then I'm assuming they have university level courses for the upper years). Healing classes. Wizarding world art and culture (ie how to charm paintings, painting history, etc). A home ec class, where you learn basic household charms like sewing, cooking, cleaning, hair cutting, etc that wouldn't fit in the charm curriculum.

And definitely more clubs/extracurricular, especially since it's a boarding school. Fashion design club? Maybe intramural football for muggleborns or something like a transfiguration competition. Definitely theater! England is famous for its theater. Can you imagine what magical special effects would be like?
