There's a part in OOTP where it says Umbridge sits in on all of Trelawney's (or maybe Hagrid's) classes, and my first thought was "there is absolutely no way she sits in on even half of them." DADA is never shown to be a double class, so that's 4x5=20 classes for just first through fifth years, plus however they do 6th/7th, and then she goes to /all/ of someone else's classes? Way too many classes are one house only, there's /no/ way things don't get absolutely out of control if they try to cover for a sick teacher for a couple days.
