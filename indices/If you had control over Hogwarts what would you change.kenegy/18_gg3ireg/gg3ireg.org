The two easiest changes would be to bring muggle studies up to the current technology and have a wizarding culture class for all muggle born and muggle raised to be better informed about the wizarding world that they have joined.

Then maybe add a chemistry course since it also involves precise measurements and handling of ingredients just like potions. Update astronomy with the latest telescopes etc (assuming that the brass magical ones aren't as "good" (since canon implies but never states that)).

Then add other muggle courses so that muggleborns and muggle raised (and any other magical) could continue a muggle education.
