If you've not already read The Never Ending Road you should do so - it's one of the best fanfics I've ever read. Brilliant characterisations, beautiful writing. Its sequel is unfinished but infrequently updating. Will eventually be Snarriet.

Also worth a recommendation is The Pureblood Pretense - it's very different to the stories I usually read as it's very AU, and I get why there's quite mixed views on it, but I enjoyed it.
