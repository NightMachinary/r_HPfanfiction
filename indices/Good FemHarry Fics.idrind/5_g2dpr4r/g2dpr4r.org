I'll second The Pureblood Pretense and also recommend Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus.

Also not really what you asked for, but the Alexandra Quick series has a female main character and is great. It's it's own original story set in wizarding America, that features a girl named Alexandra Quick attending Magical school there and going on a somewhat similar journey to Harry's.
