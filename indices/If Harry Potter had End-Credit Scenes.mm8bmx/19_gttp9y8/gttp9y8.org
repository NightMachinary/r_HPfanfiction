Two actually major quibbles.

#+begin_quote
  One of his underlings asks how he plans to deal with someone as powerful as Dumbledore. With a sneer, Fudge replies, “Get me Undersecretary Umbridge.”

What makes Umbridge such a great villain is that she's not an Evil villain. In D&D terms, it would be lawful evil. She's a bigoted but otherwise everyday incompetent bureaucrat who let power go to her head. Likewise in the end credits for the HBP, she's not going to take the locket from him, it'll be Fletcher who tries to bribe Umbridge, or perhaps she finds it in an inventory locker and thinks it looks pretty, and then the locket calls out to her.
