I like these. My choices:

PoA: Bertha Jorkins is in an Albanian bar when she tilts her head as if she's heard something, and rises from the booth where she's reading over a Ministry form for notifying the Muggle government about importing four dangerous creatures - three dragons and a sphinx - into Scotland in late November. She gets up and heads to the back, near the restrooms; she shakes her head as she thinks aloud that she was hearing things - and as she turns around, Wormtail is there, an evil, lecherous look on his face as he says 'Bertha. So long since I've seen you outside of class...'

HBP: the cute waitress at the Cafe Harry was at is the last person there. It is obvious that she is waiting for someone (Harry); after several seconds, she sighs as she gets up from her seat - and the lights in the Cafe go out several seconds after she goes into the back.

DH, Pt.2: as the boats with Albus, Rose, and Scorpius travel across the lake, we see Moaning Myrtle watching the annual tradition from the clock tower. As she stands there, we see two other ghosts - Fred Weasley and Cedric Diggory - glide up to stand beside her and watch. All three smile at the sight.
