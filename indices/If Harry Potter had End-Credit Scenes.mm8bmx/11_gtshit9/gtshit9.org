I love these!!

I feel like the end-credits scene for HBP should be more along the lines of Mundungus taking things from Grimmauld Place though. Especially for people who haven't read the books, the moment where it is revealed that Umbridge is the one with the locket is a big moment and provoked a strong emotional response from the audience, so I feel like this should remain a surprise until the exact moment. Just my opinion though! I really like your ideas for all of these :)
