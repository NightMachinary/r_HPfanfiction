I mean, PoA's credits would give away the end of GoF, because we would be expecting Voldemort to return from the start then.

Both credits in GoF would be amazing!

HBP's last scene would be nice if we saw Mundungus stealing objects from Grimmauld Place and Kreacher trying to get them back, but without emphasising the locket. Just him grabbing everything in sight.

Though, we shouldn't see him selling anything, because when Kreacher says in DH that Mundungus stole the locket, we still don't know what happened with it and expect it to be with him. So seeing him selling the locket would spoil the twist.

DH's credits is my headcanon lol /James Sirius Potter/ is starting Hogwarts and he is related to Fred and George. This is like the ultimate fusion of troublemakers. McGonagall could foresee the headache he'd give her, but the decision to retire came when he set something on fire before the end of the Start of Term Feast.
