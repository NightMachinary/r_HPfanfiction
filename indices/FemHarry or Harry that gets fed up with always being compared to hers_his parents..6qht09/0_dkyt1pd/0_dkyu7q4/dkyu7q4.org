#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter wanted two things in life; to escape from the Dursley's, and to make her mark on the world. When she is brought back into the world of Magic, it is that second desire that would change everything. Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry. Rated for occasional language, mature themes, and general future-proofing. Begins 31 July, 1991, planned to run through all seven books.
