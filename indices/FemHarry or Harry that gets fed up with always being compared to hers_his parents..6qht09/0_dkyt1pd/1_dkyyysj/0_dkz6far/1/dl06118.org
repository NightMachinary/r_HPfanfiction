I'll be honest, Totally loving Harriet personallity when she's with her group. Especially since she's using Political power rather then ''Showing of her magic like she is some super saiyan''

but... I hardly could get past the chapter and stopped reading (for now), where you had Harriet forced back to the dursley's because of a old cunt saying because of wards.
