I dont remember the name of the fic but i once read somewhere horcruxes were created through the corruption of an ancient marriage ritual. Basically you bond your soul to someone you love and then kill them and enjoy killing them, causing your soul to split in two. Rest of the ritual is just binding that soul to an inanimate object.
