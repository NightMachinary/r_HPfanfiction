I skimmed the start of the story again and it's almost textbook Mary Sue: Even his "flaws" are just ways to show how amazing he is. Like, he almost single-handedly wins a war of attrition against Voldemort, but he blames himself, because he just wasn't good enough to save everyone and just can't get over it. He's such a noble soul, who's way too hard on himself, even Fate herself adores him!

And then on the train ride he immediately does the Hadrian thing and calmly explains to Neville, Hermione and Ron how they shouldn't judge a book by its cover and that not all Slytherins are evil... and they are all amazed by his beautiful philosophical insights... while I just can't stop rolling my eyes.
