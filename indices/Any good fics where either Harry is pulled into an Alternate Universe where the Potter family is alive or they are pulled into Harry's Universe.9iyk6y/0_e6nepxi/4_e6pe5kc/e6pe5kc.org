I just read Shadow Walks based off your comment here too and I also really ended up liking it. I'm not big on Harmony usually but it was pretty well done. I'm surprised I haven't read it before. I feel like I've read almost every big Dimension Travel fic out there. Anyway, thanks for the recommendation.
