Nope not at all, and while dated it is one of the best AU fics out there. Brilliant fight scenes, and one of the best Voldemorts in fanction. It's always been a top 5 fic at worst for me.

TBH there's no real shipping involved at all, tiny hints towards M/F attraction in the (unfinished) sequel, but that's it.
