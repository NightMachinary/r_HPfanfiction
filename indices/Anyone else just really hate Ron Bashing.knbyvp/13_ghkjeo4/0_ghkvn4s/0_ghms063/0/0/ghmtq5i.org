  If I liked them equally it'd be a double standard, but I don't so it's fine.

Double standard: A double standard is the application of different sets of principles for situations that are, in principle, the same. It is often used to describe treatment whereby one group is given more latitude than another.

Hermione is given more latitude in her actions than Ron because you like her more, even when said actions are the same. That's literally a double standard.
