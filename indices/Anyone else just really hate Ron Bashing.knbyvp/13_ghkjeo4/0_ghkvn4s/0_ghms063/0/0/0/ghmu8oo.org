Yeah, and I only have sex with my girlfriend because I like her more. Refusing to have sex with every other woman on the planet isn't a double standard.

I mean if I had two girlfriends, and wouldn't have sex with one of them, that'd be a double standard. I think you're just confused and think Hermione and Ron are held to the same standard when they're clearly not.
