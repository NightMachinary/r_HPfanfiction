I hate any bashing, period, even if it's of characters I hate like Snape. The story becomes a lot less interesting if you turn any 'main cast' character into a moron. You can make characters evil without turning them into parody, and I frankly have no idea why bashing is so big in this fandom. You can make Harry stop being on Dumbledore's side or stop being friends with Ron without turning them into morons. Bashing just feels extremely childish, and usually follows some extremely overused tropes around.
