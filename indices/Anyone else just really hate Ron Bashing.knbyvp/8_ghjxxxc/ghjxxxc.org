It is annoying, but it's the same with any sort of bashing. In canon, nobody is perfect, just like almost nobody is irredeemably evil.

I think the movies can be blamed for some of the Ron bashing though, they de-emphasised some of his good qualities in favour of making him a comic relief, and gave some of his better moments to Hermione.

Movie Hermione is basically flawless, which is irritating. I blame Steve Kloves.
