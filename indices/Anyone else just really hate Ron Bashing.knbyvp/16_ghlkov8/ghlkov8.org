I never really liked Ron much, and I started reading the series as a teenager before book 6 was released. All the times I remember him calling Hermione 'mental' for being a massive nerd and spending so much time in the library... well, I probably took it a little too personally, being a pretty voracious reader myself.

Also, he's a bit shouty and aggressive, and angry guys scare the shit out of me due to anxiety and childhood trauma. He'd have given me panic attacks if we'd gone to school together.

I think his vision in the Mirror of Erised turned me off him as well. Even when I was in my early teens, it seemed a bit shallow and selfish.
