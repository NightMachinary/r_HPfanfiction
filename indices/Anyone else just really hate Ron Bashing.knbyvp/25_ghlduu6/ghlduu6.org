I very much hate Ron-bashing. Though, if some other characters got hit with the bash stick more often (Hermione, the twins, Arthur, Bill, Charlie) I wouldn't hate it so much.

And before anyone says "Well Hermione/the twins gets bashed too!" I mean stories where ONLY Hermione or the twins are bashed. 99% of the time if Hermione is bashed, so is Ron and Dumbledore. If the twins are bashed, Ron and Ginny are too. Where are the fics where Hermione's the sole bashed character and everyone else is left alone? The twins? Bill? Charlie? Arthur?

I rest my case.
