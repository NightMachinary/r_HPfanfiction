I hate Weasley bashing overall, but especially Ron bashing. He is a great character and so lovable. I like more creative ways for why Hermione is with whatever character in the story or why Harry can't tell Ron something. I tend to stop reading if the bashing gets too intense. Don't drag ickle Ronnikins y'all!
