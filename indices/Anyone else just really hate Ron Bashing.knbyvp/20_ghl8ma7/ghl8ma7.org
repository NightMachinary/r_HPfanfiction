Bashing characters in fics is lazy and unimaginative, and extremely boring to read, even for characters I don't like.

If I don't like a character, that's because there's plenty of reasons in canon for me to find them unlikable. No reason to make stuff up.

As for Ron bashing in particular, I absolutely judge people who hate him. Everyone has their favorites and their least favorites, I'm not saying everyone has to love him. But when someone is frothing at the mouth to *hate* on /Ron/? In a story with characters that are actually cruel, evil, manipulative, shallow, bigoted, and malicious? I'm definitely judging you.
