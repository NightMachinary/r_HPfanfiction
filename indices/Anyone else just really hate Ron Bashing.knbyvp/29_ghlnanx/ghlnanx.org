I I actually don't like Ron that much, mostly because I think he's a jealous git, he abandoned harry in forth year, even when he knew how harry actually is, and after harry got the finished the first task, BAM! It's like those fight never happened, I honestly don't think abandoning your 'best friend' when he's forced to participative in a game which was closed because previous contestants died, not a good quality. He's also very biased towards Slytherin or anyone that is not griffindor. I feel like he's using harry, before you say anything about how he saved harry from his uncle's house, the idea was twin's.

Anyway it's just my personal opinion, not arguing with anyone.
