I like characters to remain reasonably within their canon personality. So fics where Ron acts like a jerk and overreacts, puts his foot in it, but has some sort of redemption arc are fine by me. Fics where Ron gets thrown downstairs on a regular basis, finds toads in his toast and just overall has more bad luck than Odysseus are too much for me.
