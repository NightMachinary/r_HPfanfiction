Eh. Personally I don't care, so long as it works for whatever story a person is trying to tell, but even that depends on how well it's used. There's a comedy fic where Ron gets put in the Triwizard and ends up bumbling around through it that I find semi-amusing, for example. It is hard to use well, I admit, but it can be done.

Generally, bashing is relative anyway. You consider Ron a great friend to Harry, but others interpret his character in more negative ways (usually either feckless idiot or borderline death eater). Whether those interpretations are accurate or not, people hold them, and that makes these conversations a little confused as 'Ron Bashing' subsequently means different things to different people (though I'm currently too tired to work out an example to demonstrate exactly what 'Ron Bashing' would be for someone who perceives Ron as the worst thing since sliced bread). For example, there might be a fic that you stop reading due to Ron Bashing where Ron is a disloyal and aggressive character who expresses such severe Slytherin hate that Harry is chased away. Other people might have a mental image of Ron where that fic is perfectly 'in-character' for him.
