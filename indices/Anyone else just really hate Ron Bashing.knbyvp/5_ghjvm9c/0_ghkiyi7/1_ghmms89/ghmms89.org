Exactly. And equally, many people will disagree and be able to cite a million reasons why Ron is in fact the bestest friend ever. It's the nature of narrative and perception.

It's why I always have a slightly confused moment in all of these sorts of conversations because my brain reads "I don't like Ron" or "I hate Ron Bashing" and immediately wonders which 'Ron' they're talking about. It's pretty much the same with most characters - there's a dozen or more variant interpretations of Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, Malfoy, Voldemort, etc. floating about the fandom.
