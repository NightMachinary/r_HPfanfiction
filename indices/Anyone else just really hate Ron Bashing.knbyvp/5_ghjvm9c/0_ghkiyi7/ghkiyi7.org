Yes - your reply is excellent. I've got a fic going where Ron is a great friend to Harry - understanding, patient, and empathetic - and I consider that to be massively OOC for him.

Frankly, any fic that lionizes or treats Ron well is AU *in my opinion*, not because he is evil and deserves to be bashed, but because - again, in my opinion - he was a legit awful friend to H & Hr in canon.

I totally understand why people like him - he's average, mediocre, the only 'every-man' of the main characters. Hell, he's also the only one with a sense of humor.

We all read fics that appeal to us personally. Having been burned by people I considered friends, I can't look positively on Ron as a character without some *MASSIVE* changes to who he is. That's not a concern for a lot of other people.

Good thing there's nearly a million fanfics for us to all pick from!
