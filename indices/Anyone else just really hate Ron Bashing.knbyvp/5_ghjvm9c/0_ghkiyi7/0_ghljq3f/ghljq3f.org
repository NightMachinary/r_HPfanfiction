There's a reason Ron bashing is so common, he might not be a horrible friend, but I don't think Rowling have Ron enough positive moments to offset the negative moments. It's easy to point out flaws in Ron because he never changes. People didn't have a problem with Ron the first three books, he was the fun friend that had Harry's back. The fourth book ruined Ron in that we never saw him actually overcoming his jealousy in later books. It's just sorta glossed over. Flaws like Harry taking out his anger on his friends and Hermione's being bossy are way easier to gloss over than abandoning your friends in life or death situations.

That being said, I don't particularly like Ron bashing, I would much rather prefer if authors actually had him grow as a person.
