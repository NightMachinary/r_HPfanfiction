So true, great point. It's a real shame, because Ron really /should/ be able to relate to Harry in a lot of ways that almost no one else can - they both grew up poor, not having possessions of their own (Harry bc of abuse, Ron bc of hand-me-downs), they both have real fears about not living up to expectations (Harry of his dead parents, Ron of his exceptional siblings).

All the pieces are there for Harry and Ron to have a really beautiful, loving friendship. Instead, JKR made Ron into a resentful, immature, disloyal jerk. And that /does/ suck!
