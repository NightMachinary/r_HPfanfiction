I think what annoys about Ron-Bashing is the same people who hate Ron tend to love Hermione and ship her with Harry.

Which disregards the canon personalities beyond the point of recognition. I know the point of fanfiction is to do your own thing, but to me it's always just screamed a lack of understanding to me of the characters.

I don't bother with these fics beyond the first chapter or two, because I just can't get any enjoyment out of them.

I don't think I'd enjoy Hermione-Bashing fics either, not that I've ever seen a fic like that, but if Harry with his canon personality was going to fall out with one of them and not be bothered about it, it'd be her, not Ron.
