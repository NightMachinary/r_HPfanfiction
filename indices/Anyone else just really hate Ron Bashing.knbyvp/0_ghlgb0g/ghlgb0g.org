Ron is one of my favourite characters, however I can cope with a little bashing (of any characters) if its:

A: Done well And B: Not either overt or just plain ridiculous.

An example, and forgive me for forgetting the title of the fiction, I attempted to read that started with Harry just straight murdering the Dursleys, had Dumbledore set up as a vampire hating mass murderer who started the order of the phoenix as an anti vampire terror group, and had ron as a moronic slitheryn hating twat who, and says (paraphrased) " Ron didn't need harry, he had Albus Dumbledore as his best friend now"

Other highlights included harry owning a house with a magical time closet that allowed him to learn Dumbledore level power in a day and a sexy adult vampire who falls in love with harry immediately after meeting him.

Needless to say I did not read the whole Fic

ETA: My favourite quote about Ron in any fic comes from The Problem with Potions; "This is why Ron was Harry's best friend, if Harry Jumped off a cliff, Ron would immediately follow him, and they would try work out a way to not die on the way down"
