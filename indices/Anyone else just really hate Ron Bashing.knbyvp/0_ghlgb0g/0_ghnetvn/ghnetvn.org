  ETA: My favourite quote about Ron in any fic comes from The Problem with Potions; "This is why Ron was Harry's best friend, if Harry Jumped off a cliff, Ron would immediately follow him, and they would try work out a way to not die on the way down"

I can totally see him going from: "WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE HARRY? A BLOODY BIRD? COULD HAVE FOOLED ME." to a "I am SOARry about it." in the matter of minutes just to defuse the tension.
