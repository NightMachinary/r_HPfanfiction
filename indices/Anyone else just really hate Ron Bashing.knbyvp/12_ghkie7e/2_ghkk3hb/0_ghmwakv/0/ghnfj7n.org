I'm honestly starting to believe in that crackpot theory, that there was a time when Luna had a crush on Ron in OoTP, and that the only reason Rowling didn't want to put them together is cause she knew that if she did that, she couldn't have found the way to break them up(Luna was a instant fan favorite when she was brought in, plus she is the epitome of anti-Hermione), or made them disgusting(like she did with Harry's POV describing Ron and Lav), or even if she did found a way, she would have been put through more shit than Ron was in his bashing fics.
