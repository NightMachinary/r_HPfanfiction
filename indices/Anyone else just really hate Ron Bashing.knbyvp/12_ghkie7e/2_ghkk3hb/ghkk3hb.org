Also Harry is kind of an asshole at times, particularly after the fifth book but he gets a pass because he is the main character. Also Hermione is quite as an asshole as Ron at times (except book 2 there are examples in all the other novels), but she also gets a pass because movies portrayed her as a Mary Sue or because many fanfic female authors can use her as an avenue for self-insertion.
