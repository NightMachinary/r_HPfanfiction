Well Hermione could have read some books about socializing(and practice it in front of a mirror), cause she doesn't know how to notice social queues, clearly most of the time she is just blinded by her rational my-way-or-the-high-way mindset. :/

Also not hating Hermione, but you gotta call her out for her bullshit sometimes.

Also bonus: If I was at Hogwarts and in Gryffindor when they went, I can't imagine being friends with her(cause I just don't like the vibe those smug, full of themselves types offer), but I would have been nice to her.
