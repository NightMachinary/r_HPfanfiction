But the problem with Ron bashing is more Rowling's convenient writing than anything else. Every time Hermione makes a mistake, something shitty/"plot"-wise happens to put it under the rug, or fizzle it(so it can be justified), where as for Ron its much more clearer(as well as Harry too, but much much less than Ron), easier to spot and call him out. But that's just Rowling's favoritism to Hermione. So Ron-bashers aren't anything more than hardcore movie fans(which are great, but only looking separately from canon books) who think that Draco is just so misunderstood/that he secretly likes Hermione/Harry is much more suitable for her anyway/Snape is actually the only man for her etc, or aren't just great readers after all(Ron critics are a completely different thing). Ron got the harder end of the deal, cause he was the fan favorite from book 1 to book 3(people stated that, and there were polls about it, it was his golden age), then after Kloves influence(cause he made Hermione a Mary Sue), Rowling just realized that her self interest must have a broader meaning than she already has(reducing Ron's exposition as a wizard who is a pureblood, and knows a lot of things about it to a person who "forgot" that his friends weren't raised by wizards and they don't know their stories for children/he doesn't know inheritance laws), cause she could have read it in a book(even DoM, and half the time when they were at the Horcrux hunt, which blantanly prove that Hermione should not be placed in the front lines of the battle, where some of the best Ron moments in fights were just mentioned by Tonks(or Hermione when she was surprised by his quick wits)).
