Honestly depends on the level. Personally, I don't really like Ron much for his own actions.

Harry was much too forgiving in general, and that's due to his complete lack of self worth. He let Ron and other characters get away with too much and too easily, and it sucks to read in canon.

Bashing is usually shitty writing, but I genuinely like when authors either make Ron actually grow the fuck up and change his behavior, or have Harry realize that he deserves friends that treat him better.
