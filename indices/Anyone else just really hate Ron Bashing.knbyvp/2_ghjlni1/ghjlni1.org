I like Ron and agree he's a great friend. People may be more inclined to bash him because they don't think he's good enough for Hermione, he gets jealous of Harry, says blunt rude things occasionally...people might also hold his fight with harry in book 4 about the triwizard and him walking out on h/hr in book 7. And although I think he's a way better wizard/much smarter than he gets credit for, he doesn't have Harry/Hermione's talent. And he comes from a family of talented siblings who excel above and beyond in at least one area...Ron is just known for being brave and helps Harry during the adventures.
