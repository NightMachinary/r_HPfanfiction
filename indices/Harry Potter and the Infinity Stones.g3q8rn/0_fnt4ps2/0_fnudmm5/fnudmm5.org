Well first, it's just a prompt so certain facts can be twisted to "fit" the stones into the HP world, so to speak. And to answer your question, yes, perhaps the Soul Stone is in a different reality of sort, and to access it you have to go through a soulgate or something like that (the veil in the ministry comes to mind) and if you aren't ready to bear the burden then you immediately become a Dementor. I must confess that the idea comes from the similarity betwenn Red Skull and the Dementors though.
