Hmmm... Seems fun.\\
So what I'd like to know how the Azkaban stone came to be in that state? Did someone hook it up to an enchantment that causes the effect, or set the stone itself to do that and became its first victim, the stone continuing the actions in absence of new orders, or maybe something else?

One thing I don't think could happen is for any of the Stones to be permanently without a wielder. Sure, there have been quiet periods in their history, but like attracts like and the stones itself are an administrative tool of the universe, unbreakable and wanting to be used. So, no matter how improbable, there would have to be a possible way to retrieve the Soul Stone.
