Well it's used mostly in bad fics where lots of other bad tropes are rampant.

And maybe I should stop here and rescind the bad epitaph and use something else.

Harry being a protagonist that has things happen around him and to him while he rarely becomes effective until the plot demands him to can drive certain readers to spare.

So when they go to ‘fix' everything in their own they make Harry a ‘Man of Action' that Rights all wrongs and takes action! So mote gets to be this awesome thing that shows Harry either gets a new ally of sorts or proves once and for all he's not a liar.
