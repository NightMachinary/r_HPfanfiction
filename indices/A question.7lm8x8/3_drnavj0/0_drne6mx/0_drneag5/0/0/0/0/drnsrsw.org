It's not just bad fics that it pops up in, I was reading this really good fic the other day (I honestly couldn't tell you the name of it, I've been on a bit of a fanfic binge this past week), everything was fine, good writing, characterization, and above all a good plot, and then out of nowhere there it was, so mote it be.
