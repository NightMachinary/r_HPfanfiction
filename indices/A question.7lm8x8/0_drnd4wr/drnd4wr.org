I'm no expert, but from what I understand the phrase itself comes from certain oaths in the Free Mason fraternity/society. I think it also was used during the tv show Charmed (even less sure on this), which got appropriated into Harry Potter fanfiction as part of magical oaths, something which we know exists in HP but we know very little of.
