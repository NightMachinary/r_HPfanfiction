[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley][Aleister Crowley]] used it in his magickal writings occasionally, so it's possible that some fic writers are taking their inspiration from there. If the story you're reading has some sort of occult spin to it, chances are there's some Crowleyan influence in there.
