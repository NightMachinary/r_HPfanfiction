I suppose I'm not the right person to ask. I don't believe in them in the first place and feel that if one did tell me to study more, I may take the advice but not something to change my life over. Like don't be lazy but that's considerably insignificant. I probably wouldn't believe there would be a point to it unless told the point. That's my problem I guess. I do what I do and none of it is immoral so who cares? Laziness? That's my own problem, not something for someone else to be bothered by unless it affects them.
