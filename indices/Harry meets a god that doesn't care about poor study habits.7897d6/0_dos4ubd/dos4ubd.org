See, that's /exactly/ what the gods are talking about. You need to study more.

But seriously, if a literal god complained about my study habits and gave me a 2nd chance, I'd sure as shit do my best in my next lifetime.

Either way, I think you're mostly referring to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6dtmll/archive_dont_fear_the_reaper_challenge_by/]['Don't fear the reaper'-challenge by reptilia28]]. Most of these are pretty similar and I don't know any stories in that challenge that /don't/ mention study habits, since it's mainly a 'mate you failed'-challenge, and thus there are things that Harry did wrongly - not studying enough is obviously one of them.
