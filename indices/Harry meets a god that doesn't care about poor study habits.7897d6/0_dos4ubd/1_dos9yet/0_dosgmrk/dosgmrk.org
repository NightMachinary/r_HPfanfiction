From a certain perspective, school should be Harry's main goal, and while some parents would be content with an average performance, I do not think that Harry's parents would approve of that.

They both were teacher's favorites and seemed to place value on their magical prowess, and I'd expect especially Lily to require some performance of him.

This doesn't mean that they wouldn't be proud outside of that, but I disagree: Education is an important part of Harry's life that Lily and James seemingly value.

I do agree however that these stories do have the wrong focus, but the question for education probably isn't the main problem with them.
