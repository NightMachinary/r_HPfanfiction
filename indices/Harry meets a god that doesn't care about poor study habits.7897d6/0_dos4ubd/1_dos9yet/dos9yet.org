I do have a problem with grammar while typing on my phone. I suppose I haven't read those. The ones I've read haven't given the impression of failed ambition. Mostly it's just seems to be pointlessly added. There has also been quite a few that mention how his parents would he dissapointed in him. It's not even like he did terribly, he got average grades with a couple good ones. Some parents would probably be disappointed in a 3.00 GPA. However, I can't get over that it seems to be such an insignificant aspect of life. Again, I haven't read those, and the stories I have with this involved never go to the aspect of why he failed and the danger of his failure.
