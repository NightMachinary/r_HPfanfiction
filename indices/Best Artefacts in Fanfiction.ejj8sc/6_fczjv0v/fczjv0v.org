In a fic that I have been writing for a while, the main character finds a sword in an old tree. The sword has the ability to warp the mind of the person holding it, causing them paranoia or anger. It can also possess anyone that has touched it, regardless of distance. Finally, it was able to communicate with the wielder, talking to them in their mind.

The sword also reeks of death, something wizards do not seem to pick up on, and constantly leeches the lifeforce of anyone nearby.

Of course, the kicker is that the sword is found by an eight-year-old that uses it to practice sword fighting on a hay dummy and speaks to it like a child would any object. The child also seems to dilute the sword and causes all of its powers, bar a few, to be useless on wizardkind.

The sword was created/enchanted by a vampire who wanted to create a weapon that was able to function as a wand. However, something went wrong and he trapped himself in the sword.
