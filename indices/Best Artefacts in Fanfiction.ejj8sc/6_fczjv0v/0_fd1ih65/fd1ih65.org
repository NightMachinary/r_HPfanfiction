Heh. That sounds almost publishable. I can totally picture a slightly insidious children's book where the young only see a kid befriending a grumpy sword and rereading when you're older reveals the more predatory aspects of the sword's behaviour. Very 'don't talk to strangers' metaphor.

Have you read a published novel called The Misenchanted Sword by Lawrence Watt-Evans? There's no sentience on that blade, but there's a good degree of... inconvenience to the magic on it that I think you might enjoy.
