Well, I have just the fic! Namely [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10200][Cursed Artefacts for Sale]] by Icarus, linkao3(10200) or linkffn(1753258). It's part of a series, but can be read as a standalone. It's Snape/Harry, but in this installment the Snarry is super mild and barely there at all. I could easily call it gen even. Anyway, in this series Snape is a rich pureblood and dark arts afficionado, who enjoys buying cursed artefacts and then trying to lift the curses off of them. In this fic, he and Harry go to a cursed artefacts auction, because Snape wants to add to his collection. They obviously see a lot of cool artefacts along the way. It's very imaginative and lovely and I think you'll enjoy it!
