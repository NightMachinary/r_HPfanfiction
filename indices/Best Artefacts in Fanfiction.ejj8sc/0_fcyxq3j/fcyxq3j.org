I don't know the specific ones, but there's a few where the Sword of Gryffindor imbibes other things apart from Basilisk Venom.

There's one with Fiendfyre, where a character accidentally deflects the curse with the sword and it basically catches it and makes the blade ever-burning with cursed fire.

There's a crossover with Mass Effect (I think) where Harry kills a Thresher Maul with it and the sword imbibes the ridiculously strong acid.

I think I remember one where the MC uses either a Lightsaber crystal or a finished one on the sword and it basically becomes a lightsaber itself.

It might have been a crack-oneshot but there's one where they stick the sword into all kinds of ridiculous things, like a neutron star, which immediately cooks the earth when it's unsheathed there because of the heat; Or a black hole, which immediately destroys the earth because the sword now has its gravity; or a pile of Antimatter, which makes the sword explode anything it touches, including air.

I also think I remember one where they basically cast all sorts of dark curses at the sword for days, until the blade becomes so cursed that it brutally murders everyone who even thinks about it or something.

There was a LotR crossover as well where it can de-manifest a Ringwraith, but also absorbs a tiny bit of the corrupting influence of the ring it wears, slowly making it into an Artifact of Sauron.

Most of these were back in the olden days, and I don't know their names or if they can be found on the popular websites today. Maybe on Spacebattles? I know that some of these were written when it was first revealed that the sword could do that, and I don't know if any of these have survived that long.
