So far I've enjoyed the portrayal of Morrigan's staff in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098062/1/The-Red-Witch-and-the-Nightmare-Queen][The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen]]". It seems to be semi-sentient and has a strong affinity for mind magic. The fic eventually delves into the extremely creepy backstory of who Morrigan was and how she got the staff. I like that the story shows how truth might be twisted in fairytales and things aren't always what they seem.

Another example of a malevolent sentient artifact: I love the idea of the /Matrix Aeternitatis/ in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]]". In that alternate universe one of the last un-destroyed copies of the tome was originally owned by Grindelwald. It is said to contain knowledge of powerful sacrificial rituals that Grindelwald used during the war, but it has a well-earned reputation of driving its readers to madness or catalyzing their transition to becoming the most feared Dark Wizards in the world. No one knows exactly what the tome is, or what it contains, because even the most obsessive collectors of dark artifacts prefer to steer clear of it. I particularly love the disturbing scene in which the main character finally tracks it down.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12957404/1/Subversion][Subversion]]" also has some neat worldbuilding and artifacts vaguely inspired by European folklore. In the past of that alternate universe, the forebears of wizardkind used forgotten ritual magic to seal malevolent or tricksome spirits inside of fanes. It is illegal (and exceedingly dangerous) to disturb a fane, but criminals occasionally brave the risks in order to steal the voidrope used in each fane's sealing. Voidrope is extremely valuable because when worn as a noose around a person's neck it can completely block any mind magic performed on them or by them.
