That'd be an amusing twist. The Magical World is like the classical idea of Faeries - they suck at actually creating anything themselves and just steal from the mundane world to get cool things to enchant. I know one of the myriad 'Harry pokes through the completely lacking logic and continuity of the Rowling Magical World' fics had the Knight Bus and Hogwarts Express violate the anti-enchanting muggle artefacts laws due to that.
