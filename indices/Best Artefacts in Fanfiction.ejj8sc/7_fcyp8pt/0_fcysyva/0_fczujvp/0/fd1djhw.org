Yeah, it's not the most well-known of series'. Shame, really. It's pretty darn good, aside from the Silmarillion-esque word usage and overuse of invented words that aren't explained very well. If you read and enjoy really long fantasy books that read like they should be intoned by a Shakespearean actor, you'd probably like it. If not, probably not.
