Aren't they all? :'( Thanks for the rec, though. I do love the idea of the Ministry using yet another insanely dangerous artefact as an entertainment piece.

Fanfiction really needs a repository of abandoned fics that the authors allow for adoption. Like the Orphan profile on Ao3, but closer in structure to the FFnet beta-finder. Set a marker as abandoned and another as 'up for adoption'. We'd get so many more fics completed that way.
