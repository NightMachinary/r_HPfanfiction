Not... really?

You make it sound like a stereotypical 'edgelord!Harry will make them pay!' fic. On the contrary, the fic doesn't wallow in Harry being abused or feeling bad (though he does go through some dark times), nor does his slow learning process come across as the usual path-to-power plotline.

I'd describe the fic like this:

Harry is kidnapped by a necromancer at age nine and is persuaded to sign an apprenticeship contract. Harry doesn't realize what he is getting himself into, and from then on he struggles to learn more about the unfamiliar world he has been thrust into to keep himself alive.

Unfortunately, Harry's new 'master' has a tendency to only tell his apprentice the bare minimum to get him do do what he wants. Harry is often confused about the roles that are expected of him and has little choice but to rely on unreliable information from untrustworthy people. Harry usually tries to do the 'right thing', but unfortunately he doesn't often get good advice as to what 'the right thing' is.
