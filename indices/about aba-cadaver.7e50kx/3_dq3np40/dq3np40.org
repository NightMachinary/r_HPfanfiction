/Casting/ the spell requires a true desire for the target to die, /for its own sake/, rather than as a mean to an end --- it requires a homicidal maniac, even one with a lot of self-control, to cast. This /can/ take the form of hating the target in particular. However, once the bolt of magic has formed and is out of the wand, it will kill whatever it hits whether or not it was the intended target. Heck, as long as you can work up the right evil mindset, you could cast a Killing Curse in the air with no target at all, just like you can cast the Patronus Charm without any Dementors around.

Lots of fics boil down the desire to kill to sheer hate. /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ had an alternate, thought-provoking idea that while normal wizards would need to work up a lot of hatred to cast it, the most psychopathic of Dark Wizards can cast it through sheer /indifference/, to concentrating on the extent to which they don't /give a damn/ whether anybody lives or dies.

Canon mentions that emotions or no emotions, the Killing Curse is very hard to cast successfully --- it seems to require a lot of control of your magic and concentration, a lot of "nerve" as Snape puts it. You can't just think about wanting murder, point the wand, say the words, and expect anything at all to happen.

Since it concentrates and sublimates hatred and murderousness in the human soul to cast, the Killing Curse is reckoned (although like most Soul Magic it's all a bit up in the air) to do great damage to the soul of the caster, just like the other Unforgivables --- knowingly doing wrong puts a strain on the soul, and if that is like getting slapped in the face once a day, casting a Killing Curse is like concentrating the slap-energy of a whole week into a single blow.

Now onto the effects on the /target/ --- the Killing Curse severs the body from the soul in a very traumatic manner that also causes instant, painless death for the body. The Curse also does not affect the target's soul once it is split from th body, unlike a Dementor's Kiss --- the soul is free to move on into the Afterlife or just stay behind as a ghost.

The backlash of magical energy can cause a sizable explosion when a Killing Curse hits an inanimate target too thick for it to go through, such as a large stone wall or a statue. If one takes the video games into account, certain enchanted reflecting surfaces like the Mirror of Erised's glass can also reflect Killing Curses.

Some creatures are immune to the Killing Curse: dementors (as well, presumably, as banshees and poltergeists) and ghosts are immune to the Curse by virtue of not truly having a /body/ --- their appearance is more of a magical projection, and when you get right down to it the soul is all there /is/ so there is nothing for the curse to sever it /from/.

It is possible that some creatures with thick spell-resistant hides, such as old dragons, can stomach a Killing Curse, though they'd probably sustain injuries from the explosion (see above).

Finally, a Love Protection like the one accidentally invoked by Lily Potter in 1981 will protect the loved one from any harm the caster's killer tries to deal to the loved one --- /including/ a Killing Curse, which will rebound harmlessly on the target while bringing fiery destruction to its caster.
