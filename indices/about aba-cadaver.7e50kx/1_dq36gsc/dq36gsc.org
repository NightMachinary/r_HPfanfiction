We see that a lot of the spells described as 'powerful' in the Harry Potter world contain an emotional component. The patronus for example is described as a difficult and powerful spell and requires certain emotions. Given Bellatrix's comments on the Cruciatus we can assume that too requires an emotional component. Fake Moody was the closest to talking about the mechanics of the killing curse. He suggested that a class full of fourth years wouldn't have the power to give him much more than a nosebleed. Either you can suggest that magic can be quantified or you can look at the trend of emotional components. It is highly unlikely the class of fourteen year olds have the mental discipline and understanding of mortality to 'mean it'.

We see missed killing curses causing things to explode in the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end of the 5th book. It appears that it can be blocked by physical objects but doing so seems to destroy them.

Though I dislike him Snape provides the best argument that you can kill someone without truly hating them. He didn't want to kill Dumbledore. He may have hated Dumbledore for making him do so but I doubt he truly hated him and yet we see Snape perform the curse with no difficulty. (Something that I hold against him since it appears he's well practiced and given his past as a Death Eater we can see where that practice likely came from.)
