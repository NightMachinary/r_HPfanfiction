Sorry for commenting so late, but I've always disliked how this was described.

Assuming that Crouch Jr. wasn't lying, he clearly states in his lessons, /"Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."/

However, nowhere in canon does anyone ever exhibit anything like magical exhaustion - that's completely fanon.

Because of this, I've kind of just assumed that when Crouch Jr. said "a powerful bit of magic behind it", I figured he just meant an intense concentration or accuracy in feeling/will that he didn't believe them capable of.

Whatever those requirements are, however, were never gone into detail on.

I suppose the /Avada Kedavra/ curse is at /least/ similar to the Crucio/Patronus spells in that pronunciation/accuracy with the wand movements simply aren't enough. You need something more.

Which is, likely, given Bellatrix's statement on /Crucio/ why people draw this conclusion about the Killing Curse: You have to /want/ them dead.
