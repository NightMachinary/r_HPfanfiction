A cracky FemHarry story where she becomes the sort of iconic dark figure which isn't entirely evil, like Darth Vader. The first few chapters are rather dark and badly written (the protagonist is mute, so there is very little dialogue and a lot of narrating, it gets better once notepads and sign language get involved).

Harry isn't outright evil, but is definitely a psychopath who shows no mercy to enemies and violence is used liberally. Friends are treated well, however.

It is an OPHarry story which avoids a lot of pitfalls of these stories. Harry/Cassandra does not act cringeworthy as you'd expect in this type of story.
