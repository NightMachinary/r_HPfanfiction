Yes, it's a Voldemort/Harry pairing.

Slash = yaoi/boyxboy

TMR = Tom Marvolo Riddle.

HP/LV = Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort.

It's not everyone's cup of tea, and I'd actually argue that in Xerosis, Harry isn't really evil anyway. It's rare to see a completely evil character in fanfiction - most authors tend to justify their characters' actions with some faux logic that's actually just eugenics, or end up making Harry so edgy he blinds you with every edgy word out of his mouth.
