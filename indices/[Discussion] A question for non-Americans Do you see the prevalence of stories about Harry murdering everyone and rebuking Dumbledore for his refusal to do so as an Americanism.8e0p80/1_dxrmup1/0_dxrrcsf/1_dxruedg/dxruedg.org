#+begin_quote
  A rather ineffective spell which is completely useless against a group of opponents.

It is not. But it cannot be used alone, in a fire-and-forget kind of way, if you want to make effective use of it. It is a spell to open up holes in your opponents' defences you then can slip other spells through.

A stunned opponent may be five seconds away from revivification but that means you have five seconds to hit TWO opponents with everything you got while they can't defend themselves.
