Well - you could use Stunners indiscriminately until you hit an enemy, then hit the unconscious and identified enemy with a more lethal spell. In my current story, Moody taught Harry and Ron to break the limbs of any stunned opponent, just to ensure that they don't rejoin the fight or flee. Of course, they still use lethal spells first when facing Death Eaters.
