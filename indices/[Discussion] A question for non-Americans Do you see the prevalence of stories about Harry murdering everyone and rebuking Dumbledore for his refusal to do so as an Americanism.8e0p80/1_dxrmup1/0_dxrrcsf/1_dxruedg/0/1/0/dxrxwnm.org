Are you failing to understand that you cannot simply spam offensive magic in a group fight? During the DoM battle, Harry&co were outnumbered 2:1. Even if they stunned two Death Eaters, there were two more throwing curses at them, giving another DE ample possibility to revive the others while the "good guys" were driven backwards by a barrage of unforgivables.
