In a way they are. Their magic is very difficult to defend against. If the "good guys" used unforgivables, it would be a fair fight and come down to numbers, position and tactics. But if only one side uses the hard to counter magic while the other stays at schoolyard level, "one-sided" doesn't even begin to describe the resulting confrontations. It is arguable that the Death Eaters were inferior fighters, but their willingness to resort to lethal spells was a great force equaliser.
