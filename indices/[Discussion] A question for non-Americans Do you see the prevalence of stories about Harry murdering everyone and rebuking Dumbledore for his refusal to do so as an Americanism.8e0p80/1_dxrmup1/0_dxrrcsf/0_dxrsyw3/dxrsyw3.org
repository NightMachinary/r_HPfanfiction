No no, I don't mean they'd look down on their parents. I just mean that it's a lot to take in, and it'd cause a certain loss of innocence. It's not practical perhaps to keep them innocent, especially Harry and those close to him, but I can understand why you wouldn't want them hearing about how dad killed Mr Thingabob, who used to work on the same floor as him, and so on.

I understand your point, but I'm saying that a group of fifteen year olds shouldn't have to think that way. A stunner, a taser maybe, pepper spray, or those alarm whistles should be all a kid needs - not a knife or a gun or sectumsempra.

I'm also pretty sure that a stunner isn't easy to recover from, not like some fics make it seem. Surely it'd take time to shake off the effects, even if someone did rennervate you. I mean, McGonagall was nearly killed from being hit by four stunners, and needed significant recovery time in hospital. I feel a fourth of that would make any non-resistant being groggy.
