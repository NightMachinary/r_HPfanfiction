  I just mean that it's a lot to take in, and it'd cause a certain loss of innocence.

By age 14, pretty much everyone in Germany knows about the gruesome details of the Holocaust, has seen movies with close ups of death camp survivors and was told that their ancestors are to be blamed for this by the public school. We all know that our grandfathers and/or great grandfathers fought and killed. When I was twelve, I was told how my grandfather dragged a wounded soldier (the future Bishop of Cologne) to the Soviet lines to get him treated there. I was told how he deserted in 1945 and hid together with a French Forced worker on our farm. I heard stories how allied bombers attacked Bullay Bridge but only hit everything around it. I know that plenty of people here have similar experience with the past and their ancestors. Maybe because we're German, but there was never much innocence for us. And honestly, telling Harry that his parents killed a bunch of racist bigots (there was no draft for the Death Eaters, unlike in WWII Europe) would probably make him proud that they were doing the right thing. I mean, the boy has a memory of watching his parents murder, do you really think that telling them about his parents fighting would lose his innocence. Or that Hermione has no World War veterans in her family?

  or those alarm whistles

Because that will be so effective if a Death Eater squad is coming at you. I'm not saying that you should take them on, but if you want to escape, you need to either disable or at least distract them. And unless you transfigure the whistle into a handgrenade, it will not help you. Yes, kids should not worry about killing, but if a SA ripoff is after them, it's better that children lose their innocence rather than losing their lives.
