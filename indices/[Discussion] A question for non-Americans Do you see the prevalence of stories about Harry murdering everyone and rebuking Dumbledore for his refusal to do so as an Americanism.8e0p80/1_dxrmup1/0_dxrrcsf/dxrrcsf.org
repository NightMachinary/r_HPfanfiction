That's bullshit in Europe. Most of us have ancestors who fought in the World Wars. It doesn't make them lesser humans or anything.

A rather ineffective spell which is completely useless against a group of opponents. I'm not advocating organ rotting curses here, but shouldn't you value your life and your friends life higher than their opponent's life? Because it really comes down to them or you and yours.
