I feel like you're massively underselling the value of a stunning spell in a group fight, because if someone tries to revive a fallen 'teammate' they take themselves out of the fight and leave themselves very vulnerable. Therefore, they will be much more likely to be hit with a curse while trying to cast rennervate.
