  Dumbledore chose to work with kids as a career, he's hardly going to talk about killing people in their hearing. And stunners are certainly all teens need to use in a fight. No one should be encouraging them to kill

That's why he should have taken a far more proactive role in weeding out those sadistic genocidal maniacs by himself and not leave those hard problems for kids to handle!

It was the utter incompetence of adults (the Ministry especially) in the Series that forced those kids to fight in the first place. Dumbledore could have done more, but I don't think he should be blamed/bashed that much in the fandom.

The British Ministry of Magic, however, was the perfect model of a failed state and an utter piece of shit. It should be seriously purged and cleansed after the kids had scored their hard won victory.
