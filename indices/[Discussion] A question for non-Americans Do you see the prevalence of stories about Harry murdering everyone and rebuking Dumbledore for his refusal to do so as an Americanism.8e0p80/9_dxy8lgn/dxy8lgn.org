As an American, I will take the controversial side of this and say "Yes". Americans have long admired the ideal of the rugged, independent hero, for whom the ends justifies the means. Furthermore, we have also a culture that enshrines the idea that an attack on your person or property is to be met with immediate, overwhelming and deadly force. Add to that the expectation that you are expected to resolve your own issues, up to and including threats and attacks on your life, without the expectation of any outside aid, and the result is that many Americans look at the "Heros" of the HP universe and scratch our heads.

Let's ignore the fact that Mr. Potter would have been a Columbine hopeful after ten years of physical and emotional abuse. Let's ignore the fact that Hagrid explains to him about his parents death, and then less than 24 hours later, he is handed his wand by Ollivander and has the idea of wands as murder weapons irrevocably linked in his mind by the wand makers creepy speech. Ignore all that.

Mr. Malfoy unleashes a basilisk on the school, and demonstrates a clear willingness to throw an AK at Mr. Potter. At that point, end of his second year of schooling, our hero has a clear and present enemy. Many American readers/writers at this point expect Harry to handle that shit, in no small part because JK wrote her story in such a fashion that, and this can't be stated strongly enough, it matches many American expectations that help either won't be given, or it will arrive too late to be of any use.

So, we have a teenager who knows his enemy, and has a deadly weapon at hand. We aren't expecting Mr. Potter to duel Mr. Malfoy, because even teenagers aren't complete idiots. But we do expect Mr. Potter to plot Mr. Malfoy's demise as best as he is able.

And that is just by the end of the second book. Honestly, the HP series is like a how to manual to put many Americans in a killing mood.

2nd book - Murderer who bribed his way out of jail tries to wipe out the whole school and directly murder the hero from ten feet away.

3rd book - Innocent man jailed without a trial, law enforcement told to kill on site.

4th book - Entered into a deadly tournament against the heros will, multiple brushes with death, terrorist/cult leader resurrected, asshole who tried to kill the hero attends the ceremony, still no resolution on that.

5th book - Tortured by a government appointed teacher.

6th book - Asshole murderers son joins the cult, attempts murder himself, not arrested, then lets more cultists murders into school full of children, more people die.

So... Yeah. Pick that point at which Mr. Potter has the skill to start delivering some justice, and go from there.
