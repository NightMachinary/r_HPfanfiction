  A German here. We do not have death penalty, but I still feel that the Death penalty should be used for the Death Eaters after they were tried under Veritasserum.

The problem is that Veritasserum can be fought by various means and isn't applicable in court. So it would be very hard to find out who was an actual supporter and who was under the Imperius curse. I mean in canon the only ones who were caught were either betrayed by a fellow death eater or admitted it.

  If you MURDER (if you plan to take a life and go through with it) or rape (not just drunk sex while neither party can properly talk) someone, your own life should be forfeit.
#+end_quote

that seems a bit harsh, considering there are some cases where a murder is understandable(not justified) and it can be predicted that it wont repeat itself in the future.

  Generally, I support a corrective justice system, but stuff like murder and rape have to be punished severly, a lot stricter than what we currently have in Germany.

I agree, I am from Germany as well and is ridiculous that criminals convicted of crimes with extremely high relapse rates like pedophilia can not be locked up for the rest of their lives.
