When is murder justifiable? Manslaughter, because things can escalate or a punch supposed to knock someone down ends in am unlucky fall, but murder? Planning the demise of someone and then killing them? We are not talking about a fight here, we are talking about breaking into someone's house and killing them while they are asleep.

Also, the Seven books do not mention limitations on Veritasserum.
