  If they have killed a human for the cause, either Veil or *Dementor kiss*.

Er, I'm sorry, but no. Just no. The Dementor's Kiss is literally the most unspeakably evil thing you can possibly do to another living being, and should be the most illegal thing in the book, no matter the reason. In fact, if you'll forgive the paradox, I'd argue the only person deserving of a Dementor's Kiss is a person who willingly inflicted a Dementor's Kiss on someone else.

  I still feel that the Death penalty should be used for the Death Eaters

Why? What's wrong with just sticking them in jail forever where they can't hurt anyone? As long as it /is/ agreed they definitely won't be released after ten years for good behavior or some nonsense. Sure, Azkaban was a crapshoot, but only because the Ministry was inexplicably unable to process that /the Dementors were terrorists just as much as the people they were meant to be guarding/. A wizarding prison that can hold even the most dangerous Dark Wizards is totally feasible: Nurmengard successfully held Grindelwald, even in the early years before he was overtaken by remorse; and post-1998 Azkaban, which had been deDementored, successfully contained all the arrested Death Eaters, and, later, even someone as dangerous as Delphini Riddle.
