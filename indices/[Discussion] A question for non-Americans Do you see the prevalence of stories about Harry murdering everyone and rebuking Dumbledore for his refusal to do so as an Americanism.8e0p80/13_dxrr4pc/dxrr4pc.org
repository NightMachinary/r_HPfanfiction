A German here. We do not have death penalty, but I still feel that the Death penalty should be used for the Death Eaters after they were tried under Veritasserum. If it comes out that they supported the cause, its lifetime in prison. If they have killed a human for the cause, either Veil or Dementor kiss.

Perhaps because I am quite knowledgeable about history and can see the obvious Nazi parallels, but the thought of not at least locking them away forever is disgusting me. If you MURDER (if you plan to take a life and go through with it) or rape (not just drunk sex while neither party can properly talk) someone, your own life should be forfeit. Not necessarily through an execution, putting someone to manual labour duty where they spend the next 50 years digging holes would be fine as well. Add to that the countless things you could change any Death Eater with (treason, terrorism, genocide), and their sentence quickly surpasses decades.

Generally, I support a corrective justice system, but stuff like murder and rape have to be punished severly, a lot stricter than what we currently have in Germany.
