I ( also an American) think that the way we see guns in general is realy wishiewashie. But if you dont have a gun you will have some ther weapon like englan having to ban selling kitchen knives to people under 16 and banning knives in almost every other context.

That being said i have read some of these stories and think its more fun for me if he goes the political route rather than a hate filled murder spree.
