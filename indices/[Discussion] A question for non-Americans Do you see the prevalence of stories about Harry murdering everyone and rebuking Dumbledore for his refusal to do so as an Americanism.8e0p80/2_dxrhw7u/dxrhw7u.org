(Yes I'm American but I couldn't help commenting)

I really just see it as edgy teens doing what they do, not solely American (although it is rather liked here, in an odd kind of way). American influence is possible, but teenagers and college students aren't always the deepest thinkers, so I take that into account.

That said, Canon Dumbledore never killing always seemed hopelessly idealistic to me. I mean, he had me interested when he said that killing Riddle wouldn't satisfy him. But beyond that, it just reeked of the Superman problem:

Dumbledore can preach about killing being the worst evil (and JKR can construct an in-universe explanation for why that is) but the real issue is Dumbledore is powerful enough to solve individual problems without killing. Next to no one else has that luxury so his ethical pronouncements on the issue ought to fall on deaf ears.

Like, I have tons of issues with cops and the malpractice that many of them engage in with the assistance of the legal system here in the states. But if a cop guns down a mass shooter I'm not gonna cry about it. It's not because of that crap, simplistic nonsense of "only a good guy with a gun" (because "good guys" with guns kill lots of people, in actual fact). Rather, that sometimes circumstances force one to prioritize certain moral principles. Most of the time killing someone is bad, but if that someone is about to (or already has) killed a bunch of innocents, well, what are you honestly going to let take precedent?
