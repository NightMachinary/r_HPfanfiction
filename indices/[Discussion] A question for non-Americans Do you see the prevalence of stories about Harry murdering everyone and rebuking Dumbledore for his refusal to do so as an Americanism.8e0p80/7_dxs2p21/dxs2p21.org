Respectfully I have to say that I am having a hard time seeing a connection between these concepts and how it relates to an 'American culture.' It seems you have three seperate concepts here. Firstly I will say that a story where Harry goes on a jihad against all who he disagrees with has no reflection on 'American culture.' I would actually argue that it's quite possible the most unAmerican thing. Secondly this killing crusade/rampage you're explaining isn't comparable to capital punishment nor is it comparable to the use of deadly force as defense against deadly force directed at ones self. None of these concepts overlap because they are all entirely different situations and entirely different from a moral standpoint.

Corporal punishment is certainly seen in-universe so we can disregard the notion that fanfics with corporal punishment are reflections of 'American culture'. In canon the Dementor's Kiss is magical Britains form of corporal punishment. I think JKR needed a less graphic form of corporal punishment that is in-universe, being that it's both uniquely magical as well as circumvents the issue of ghosts. A magical prisoner being sentenced to death but sometimes leaving a ghost doesn't seem to be the punishment it's intended to be. A person who is Kissed can't leave a ghost behind and can't move on to the afterlife (which seems to existing in canon). For a witch/wizard I would see this as being significantly worse then experiencing life in Azkaban or just dieing and moving on.

Now I think this one doesn't reflect 'American culture' in the way that it's actually already seen more widely implemented in canon. /Almost everyone age 11 and up has a wand/. I think everyone can agree that a wand would be more deadly and more versatile then a gun. Both can be used to kill and both can be used to disable. The difference I see is in the amount of training between the two. In American one has to be 18 to own a gun (people are pushing for 21, with military service still at 18, go figure üôÑ) but in-universe, wand use starts at 11 years old. I would argue that, even with a child having little magical ability and little knowledge of spells, the most mundane and harmless of spells can be used to kill on purpose or by accident. Full-Body Bind? Just bind them and push them off the astronomy tower or keep them bound until they die of dehydration. Horrible acts can be done when someone is bound that I won't even mention. Levitation Charm - levitate a sharp or heavy object above someone and let gravity do the work. This one makes me immediately think of childish cartoons like Looney Tunes which just makes me imagine it would be more common than first thought. Aguamenti - shot into a mouth/throat can cause asphyxiation or rupture a lung or the stomach (eww).

I think it's clear that stories of Harry going on a killing crusade/rampage/jihad against those who don't think his way have nothing to do with an 'American culture.' I also say that considering corporal punishment, as seen by the dementor's kiss, and the using of a deadly weapon in defense is in the canon universe, that those are going to be presently in most fanfictions and aren't indicative of the 'American culture' you state.

Hopefully that didn't come off as me being asshole üòù
