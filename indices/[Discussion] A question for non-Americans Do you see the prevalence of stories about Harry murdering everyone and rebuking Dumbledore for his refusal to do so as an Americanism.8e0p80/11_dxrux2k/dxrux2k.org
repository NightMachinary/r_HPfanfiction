  What I want to know is; do people outside the US see these types of stories as a reflection of American culture? ie: The continued use of Capital Punishment or notions such as “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun.”

As one who lives here, I can confirm that this is far from a universal sentiment in the U.S.

Same with capital punishment; 19 states have outlawed it and it's functionally paused in several others since drug companies that make the lethal injection drugs no longer allow their use for non-medicinal purposes such as executions. (It's both exposure to legal risk and really bad P.R. to do so.)
