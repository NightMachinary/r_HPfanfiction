/If/ they had managed to take over wizarding Britain, which isn't linked to the Muggle UK by law, then perhaps - but Voldemort's battles were clearly against Muggleborns and was a wizarding war, as opposed to Grindelwald's clear belief in Muggle subjugation. If Voldemort had conquered wizard Britain, perhaps - but never once is his plan to come out of secrecy and take over the Muggle UK made explicit.

In addition, the scenes with the UK Prime Minister make it clear that Voldemort is conserved a wizarding problem, and not a Muggle one in terms of both the war and punishment, so Muggle law wouldn't have jurisdiction.

  And the treason act predates the Statue of secrecy and was, to the best of our knowledge, not revoked.

Only the first part of the Act. The second part, disruption of the succession, was only introduced in the 1700's, after the Statute of Secrecy.

However, if you want to include the excuse of not having been revoked and that wizards are still under that law, then technically the whole MoM is committing treason, as they have hidden members of society from registration and census, and rule without democratic vote or Crown signatory, and allowing murder of prisoners etc which was illegal long before the actions of the books, and tell the Prime Minister (the Queen's official leader of government) what to do under intimidation.

To anyone versed with UK law, it's clearly obvious that wizards run their own show completely separately from UK law - fic writers just like to pinch the archaic and grisly bits that suit them best.
