  And it is arguable that all Death Eaters were in rebellion against the crown

No, no, no. This is a common HP trope but it completely misunderstands both the actual law and the role of capital punishment in the UK.

Firstly, only High Treason, as in against the Head of State or national sovereignty, was even punishable by hanging. The Death Eaters never tried to take over Muggle government, let alone rebel against the Head of State or invade the UK as a foreign power - and the MoM was clearly stated as being outside the realm of Muggle government, so taking over magical government was clearly not the same thing. What they did would have been classified as terrorism under UK law, which most definitely came no where near a hanging offence.

Secondly, hanging was still legal until 1998, but it had been obsolete since just after WW2. Marcus Sarjeant /actually shot at the Queen/ in 1981 and was convicted of High Treason and didn't face hanging, and there have been other High Treason convictions for selling state secrets to foreign powers prior to 1998 that equally were given jail time over capital punishment. It wasn't something that would have been sentenced for the Death Eaters.
