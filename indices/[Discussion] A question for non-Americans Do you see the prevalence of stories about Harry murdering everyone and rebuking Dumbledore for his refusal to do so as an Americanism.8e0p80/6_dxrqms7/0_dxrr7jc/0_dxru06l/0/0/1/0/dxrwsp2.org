Nope. Our laws about citizenship aren't like American ones - being born here doesn't make you British.

Your parents have to be British citizens when you are born (and you can be born outside the UK for this too) or have permanent residence or right to abode when you are born in the UK.

If wizards live under the radar, and don't register themselves for taxation and census and other things required of them as citizens, then they aren't citizens.
