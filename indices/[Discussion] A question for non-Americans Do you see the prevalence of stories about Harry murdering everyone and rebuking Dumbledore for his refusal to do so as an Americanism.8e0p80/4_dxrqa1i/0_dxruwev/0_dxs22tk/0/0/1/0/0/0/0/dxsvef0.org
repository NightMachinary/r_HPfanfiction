Well, if Dumbledore knows about Malfoy trying to murder innocent children, and doesn't do something about it, then he really has no ground to stand on to berate Harry for killing Malfoy.

(The main problem with those fics is that plot-mandated (in)actions which are common tropes in children's novels are taken seriously and in character. Dumbledore would have acted quite differently, if he had stayed IC.)
