Okay, maybe Malfoy is a bad example. It would be common knowledge, even if you couldn't prove it completely, that he did it, based on your comment.

But suppose there was a spy in the Order, or someone who Harry/the trio trusted, who was shown to act for Voldemort, but maintained a disguise as a useful and loyal Order member, and hid any traces of their actions.

My point is that if this person were in canon, they would be killed by Harry if he acted how the OP suggested, because he "had a suspicion" or had some bullshit intention-understanding/mind-reading power. And you and I both know there would be people who would gobble this up.

But consider what that action means in-universe. If Harry killed this person, who wouldn't be horrified at the death of someone believed to be loyal in fighting Voldemort? After all, what proof would the Order have that Harry was right?
