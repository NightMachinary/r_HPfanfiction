Crazy idea: What if it's the result of fanfic writers asking themselves the question, "How would I deal with this issue?", not, "How would Harry deal with this issue?"

Because from our perspective, we know everything there is to know. Of course Voldemort and Pettigrew are evil, just look at the little Hangleton scene! Of course the Malfoys are involved with Voldemort, just look at (I don't actually remember if there is a scene like this, but pretend)!

But the characters can't know that. If you told Sirius Black that Peter Pettigrew would grow up and help bring Voldemort back, he'd probably laugh and ask if you'd taken a look at meek, shy Peter. And can you really tell me you know for sure Lucius wasn't Imperiused, considering it was Voldemort who might have been doing it?

If our world was a story for some other world, I can guarantee you someone's written a fanfic in which they drone strike every terrorist/terrorist sympathizer in the world simultaneously and then berated the UN/US for not doing this. But we don't know who those people are, and so we have to exercise immense restraint, lest we kill someone innocent.
