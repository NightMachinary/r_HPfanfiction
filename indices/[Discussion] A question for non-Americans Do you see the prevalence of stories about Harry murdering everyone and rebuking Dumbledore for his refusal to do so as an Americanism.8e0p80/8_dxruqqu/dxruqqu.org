I see it as immature. American, though? Nay.

Personally I'm all for punishment in the form of capital punishment and/or straight-out torture for people who show themselves to be irredeemable fucks, because people like that won't become better human beings if they can help it and they have no qualms about hurting others for their own amusement. However, I am aware that this is something of an extreme world-view in some ways, and I cannot take seriously the idea of applying such punishments to a group people just for belonging to some group when there isn't, neither de juro nor de facto, any knowledge of what was required of those who joined that group. I mean, where do we go from there, to murdering all slytherins just because they were ambitious, including some muggleborns whom the hat saw as ambitious because they always aimed for A+ when doing homework in their muggle school because they wanted to prove something? To murdering all the hufflepuffs because if they aren't loyal to Harry that must mean they are all, down to the firsties, plotting to murder Harry in his sleep? To killing the Dursleys to prove that you are better than them?

Fenrir Greyback was an irredeemable fuck. Bellatrix Lestrange was an irredeemable fuck. Narcissa Malfoy was just a bigot, but one who throw her beliefs aside for a moment to give life to someone she should have hated, even if in exchange for something of equal value. Peter Pettigrew was a coward who made all the wrong choices and hurt all the people around him, being left with nothing but fear, no purpose, no anything, no anyone, but at crucial points he made his choices, acted with purpose when doing horrible things, and that too makes him an irredeemable fuck. They may not be good people, but not all of them deserve death; many do, but not all.

No, horrible punishments are for people who have proven, with their own choices, that they are horrible people who would keep on doing horrible things just because they can if they were let go. You don't need a trial for this, but you do need to at least look at the person as a person before you can know, and if someone can't even do that and yet handles such punishments nilly-willy it is, to me, a sign that they aren't mature enough to understand the oh-so-complicated concept of people having motivations and sometimes being forced to act against them by outside circumstances.
