Sorry, did you see my edit? It was a bit late. I wasn't trying to argue how/why the house was damaged, just that a killing curse would destroy Voldemort's body, because that's what happened (imo). Your theory is certainly a possibility as well, but it hinges on things that were never expressed in the books. So, I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.
