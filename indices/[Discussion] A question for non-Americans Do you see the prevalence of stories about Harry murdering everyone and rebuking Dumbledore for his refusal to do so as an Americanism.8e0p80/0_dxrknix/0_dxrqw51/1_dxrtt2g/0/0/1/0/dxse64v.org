To be honest to me Achille's reasoning makes sense.

Granted, it's just a theory, but you can't deny that Voldemort's first disposal couldn't possibly be the result of a standard killing curse. The results are totally the inverse of what a killing curse does. We have utter obliteration of the body+distruction of part of the house vs painless and markless death.

So in my opinion it's still the result of Harry's protection. Whether directly as in "smiting Voldy for attempting to harm him" or indirectly as in "the curse rebounded and was morphed as a result.

So Achille's theory that a normal AK wouldn't harm him is still sound.

Also, I'd like to point out that whatever happened isn't actually known. We may have Dumbledore's explanation but for all we know it might be totally wrong. As he himself would say, he can also make mistakes, and when he does they are usually bigger. The books are still mostly described from Harry's pov and what we know of those happenings is only what Harry has been told.
