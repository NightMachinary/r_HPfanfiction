  I dunno how you came to that conclusion.

Well, perhaps I'm influenced by the movies here, but it seemed to me that the sort of thing that happened with Quirrell in /Philosopher's Stone/, magically amplified, seemed very similar to Voldemort's body being obliterated in 1981.

Your interpretation works as well, of course, but it sits on ice exactly as thin as mine: it requires one to accept that ripping apart a soul produces outwards, physical effects like an explosion. We don't actually see the process elswhere, but no evidence of such was found in the Riddle House after Voldemort Horcruxed the Ring there, and overall souls don't seem to have much physical existence.
