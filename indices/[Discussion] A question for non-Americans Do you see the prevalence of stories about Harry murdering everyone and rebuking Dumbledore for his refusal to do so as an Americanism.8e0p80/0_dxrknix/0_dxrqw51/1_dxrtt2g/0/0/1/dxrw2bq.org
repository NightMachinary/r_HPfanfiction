I dunno how you came to that conclusion. The sacrificial protection was just protection, it bounced the curse back, there was no 'infusing', in my opinion anyway. The explosion was the result of his death, not the cause; the result of his soul being ripped apart, one fragment latching onto Harry, the rest, the 'master soul', bring expelled violently outward. After all, the explosion only detonated in one direction, the direction of the destroyed wall, so it's less that he blew up like a bomb and more that the curse violently forced his soul away.

Edit: To keep things in focus; that explosion stuff is just speculation on my part, but what I do know is that the books say the curse was rebounded because of Lily's protection, which caused Voldemort to be reduced to a spirit instead of dying (because of his horcruxes, obviously). There's no mention anywhere of the protection 'infusing' or enhancing the curse, or 'gigantic magical backlash', so I tend to believe the killing curse is what 'killed' him.
