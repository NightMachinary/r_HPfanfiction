As I understand it, what killed him then wasn't so much the Killing Curse itself as the sacrificial magic it had become infused with upon rebounding with Harry, causing a sort of gigantic magical backlash that blew up the Potter House and deep-fried Voldemort's body as collateral damage. I frankly don't see how else you'd explain that the Curse destroyed his body (and the roof) rather than just rip a soul out of a body as it would have if it had worked normally.
