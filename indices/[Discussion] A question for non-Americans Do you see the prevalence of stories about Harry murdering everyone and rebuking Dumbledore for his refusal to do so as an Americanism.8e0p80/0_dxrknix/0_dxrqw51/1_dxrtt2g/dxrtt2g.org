Quite right. Slight correction, however: I find it unlikely a Killing Curse would do /anything/ to a Horcruxed Voldemort. It doesn't physically alter the body, seemingly just affecting the soul (in that it violently kicks it into the beyond), so as long as Voldie's soul was anchored to the real world he might imaginably shrug it off.
