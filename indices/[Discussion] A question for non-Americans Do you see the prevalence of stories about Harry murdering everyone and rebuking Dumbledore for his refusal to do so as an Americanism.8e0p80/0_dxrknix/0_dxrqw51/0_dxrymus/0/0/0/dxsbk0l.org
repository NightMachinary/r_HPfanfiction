Say Dumbledore hits Voldemort with a killing curse, and someone from the ministry sees it. The ministry will of course say Voldemort is now dead - if they mention it at all. So the ministry is still hiding its head under the sand, and Dumbledore is still insane when he says Voldemort is still alive. And frankly saying that Dumbledore would just cast a stunner or something similar is ridiculous. If Voldemort being dead wouldn't satisfy him, why would a stunner satisfy him? Unless he has a lot of faith in the judicial system and wants to see Voldemort go through it, I think he would use spells or curses that cause pain or mental anguish.
