I agree that this time Dumbledore would be on much more solid ground in stating that Voldemort is still alive, and /maybe/ the ministry would listen, but I wouldn't bet any money on it.

Saying that there are no circumstances where a temporarily dead Voldemort isn't better than a live one is wrong. Which is better? A temporarily dead Voldemort or a Voldemort who has all his memories wiped a la Lockhart? Maybe throw in cutting his limbs off with sectumsempra, put a draught of living death down his throat, and you have a living Voldemort who would be hard pressed to do any damage. Maybe hide him under a fidelius. By saying that a dead Voldemort is always better, you are buying into (well some of ) the same beliefs Voldemort has - that death is the worst thing that can happen to you.
