Dumbledore could point to the fact that he came back to life as proof that he's able to do so, and could point to the fact that he was right about Voldemort being back as proof that he knows what he's talking about in that area. And the alternative of shrugging your shoulders and saying, oh well, he can come back later, so there's no point in trying to kill him now, is moronic. There are no circumstances ever where an even temporarily dead Voldemort isn't better than an alive Voldemort. Voldemort being alive is the main impediment to stopping his followers, so once he's dead, they could have a real chance of preventing his resurrection entirely, leaving them free to hunt down his horcruxes in peace.
