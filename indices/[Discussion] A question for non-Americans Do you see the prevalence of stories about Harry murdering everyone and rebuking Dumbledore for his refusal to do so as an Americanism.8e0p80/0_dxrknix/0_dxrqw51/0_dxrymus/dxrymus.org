Yeah he'll come back to life eventually, but last time he died there were 13 years of peace, and his resurrection involved significant effort and resources. Killing him takes him out of play, it redirects his followers efforts, and it frees up the good guys to search for and destroy his horcruxes. Seems like an excellent plan to me.

And it's not like the prophecy means he can't die- he already did die with the prophecy in place. I never understood why they wanted to avoid killing him until they destroyed his horcruxes, just because he might come back later. Dying and coming back later is still better than staying around the whole time!
