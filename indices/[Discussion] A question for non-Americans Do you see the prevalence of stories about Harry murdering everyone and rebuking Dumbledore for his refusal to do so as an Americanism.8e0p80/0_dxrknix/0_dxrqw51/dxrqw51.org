I think Dumbledore's refusal to take Voldemort's life actually stemmed from his knowledge of the horcruxes. Dumbledore knew that a simple killing curse would just allow Voldemort to revive himself later. Not only that, but then he'd be in the same position he was just in - the ministry would say Voldemort is dead, and Dumbledore would insist he is alive. On the other hand, incapacitating Voldemort would still end the war. Dumbledores excuse stems from the fact that he can't let Voldemort know he knows about the horcruxes. Voldemort just dismisses it and takes Dumbledore's refusal to kill as more evidence that he is a fool.

Edit: and also the prophecy. It says Harry has to kill Voldemort and it also says it in the part that Voldemort didn't hear.(I think) So that's another reason for the waffly excuse - it'd give away the prophecy.
