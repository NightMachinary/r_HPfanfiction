As a Swiss, no. Europe might not have the death penalty any more, but the police here aren't that shy about shooting to kill.

Both "Kill everyone who disagrees" and "never kill, no matter what" are extremes and moral failures of the worst kind. Sometimes, the only morally acceptable action is to kill, since letting someone get murdered is the more evil action.

In canon, Remus berates Harry for not risking the death of his enemies, so it's not as if Dumbledore's Order was pacifist. I see Dumbledore's refusal to kill Voldemort as yet another (stupid) plot device to keep him from ruining the plot since "Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit" isn't exactly what a man who thinks life is sacrosanct would say. That sounds more like the aforementioned edgy teenager, actually.

The thing is, once the conflict with Voldemort changes from what can still be seen as a police action to outright civil war, the characters should react accordingly.
