  In canon, Remus berates Harry for not risking the death of his enemies...
#+end_quote

Wasn't the actual discussion a bit more complex? From what I remember Harry accepted that he had to kill his enemies (and did so during the flight from Privet Drive) but Stan Shunpike was an Imperius-victim of the Death Eaters... So the question here was not "do you kill your enemies?" but "do you kill innocent people, who had no choice in the matter?"
