There is such thing as overcorrection. When I had my glasses tuned, there had been lenses that allowed me to see better than my current setup --- in exchange for a huge headache ten minutes in. If Harry's eye muscles can handle this stress, his glasses can actually overcorrect his vision to the point where it is better than 20/20.
