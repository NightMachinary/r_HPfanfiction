And even after! The Cod Wars, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Turkey invading Cyprus, the Bosnian War, the Kosovan War, the Georgian Wars, and civil wars in Greece, Hungary, East Germany, Croatia, Georgia, Portugal and Albania just to name a few! And that's all 20th century, plenty has gone in in the 21st century too...

You're totally right in that just because we don't have personal firearms, doesn't mean we don't fight each other. We just have a lower civilian murder rate.
