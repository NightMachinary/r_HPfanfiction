Not really. The London murder rate was higher in February and March this year (14:15 in February and 22:21 in March), but overall for 2018 New York has had more (46:50).

And this was the first time in /modern history/ London had a higher rate, hence why it hit the news big time. Yearly stats for the last few years for example have had London at less than than half the murders of NY (2017 116:290, 2016 102:335, 2015 109:352).
