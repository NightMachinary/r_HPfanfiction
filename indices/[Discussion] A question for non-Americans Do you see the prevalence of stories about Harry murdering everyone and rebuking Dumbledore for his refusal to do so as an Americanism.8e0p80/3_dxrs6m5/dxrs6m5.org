  What I want to know is; do people outside the US see these types of stories as a reflection of American culture?

Not at all.

Eh, Europe decided to disarm altogether (personal firearms), for good or for ill.

However, the idea that Europe is liberal hippie land of peace and love is a fairly recent one. Europe was in an almost constant state of warfare for *2000 years*, until WW2 ended. If you study a bit of each country's history up to WW2, you'll see it was skirmish after skirmish, civil war after civil war, massacre after massacre. This shit is stamped on the population's collective consciousness. Two or three generations are not enough to evolve beyond that. If the necessary conditions appear (i.e economic collapse, enviromental crisis), I am fairly convinced violence will reappear in a heartbeat.
