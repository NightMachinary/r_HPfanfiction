There was a story where Harry summoned an RPG to take care of the Dragon during the first task. Lupin spent some time as a weapon trader and had the necessary connections. I don't remember much else about the fic but that scene was good.

Also, why are you sticking to melee weapons? Flamethrowers would be the shit because even if you can freeze the fire there's still a lack of oxygen and maintaining a flame freezing spell and a bubblehead charm while fighting a duel would be very hard. Bury landmines you transfigured out of something if you have time to prepare an ambush. Trigger the taboo in a spot surrounded by landmines for maximum effect.
