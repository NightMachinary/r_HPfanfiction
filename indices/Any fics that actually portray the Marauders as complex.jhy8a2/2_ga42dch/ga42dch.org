Here are some fics that I feel have good Sirius characterization.

linkao3(22220911) is before the door of hell lamps burned, and is the first in the brilliant difficulty series. It's not set in the Marauders' era, but is an AU where Pettigrew is captured in PoA. Lots of good Sirius and Harry interactions, lots of Black family drama, and reminiscing of the first war.

linkao3(13095258) Pot, Kettle, Black is a good character study fic of Sirius. Pretty dark, but very good. Check out the rest of the author's work too.

linkao3(5986366) face death in the hope is a time travel fic that switches POV between Harry and Regulus, but it has really good characterization of James, Lily, and Sirius.

linkao3(11914698) renascienta is set during the 90's and is a Regulus lives AU. Excellent portrayal of the Black family, and great characterization of Sirius and Regulus.
