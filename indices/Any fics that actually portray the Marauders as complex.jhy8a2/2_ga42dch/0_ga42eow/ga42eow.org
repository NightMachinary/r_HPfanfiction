  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.
