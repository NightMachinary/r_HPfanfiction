linkao3(1110486) - The Lost Generation

My favorite canon complaint Marauder's fic. I know it starts in the first year but I think the fanfic moves at a good pace and each chapter follows a different character so it doesn't get too boring. There are minor changes to canon but the changes make sense and everything works out in the end. Right now, the latest chapter is a little bit after the start of their 7th year and it's great to see the characters develop and plot points come together.

linkao3(11344203) - The Dog You Feed

This follows Sirus after his incident of telling Snape about Remus's wolf whereabouts. It provides some backstory of Sirus and shows more about his complex thoughts on his decisions. Hence the title.

linkao3(6510730) - Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban

If you want adult Remus's thoughts during the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is it. There's also a lot of Marauder flashbacks that Remus looks back to when talking to Harry, which provides the Marauders with some character.
