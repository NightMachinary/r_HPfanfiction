May I suggest an entire series? It's called the Unbroken Universe, by Robin4. It's a Marauders focused series, with Sirius as the main protagonist. Although it's a post-Hogwarts series.

It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], then follows with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1567001/1/Promises-Remembered][Promises Remembered]], and finishes with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2204188/1/Promises-Defended][Promises Defended]]. It has a prequel, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4881348/1/Promises-Honored][Promises Honored]]. The author recommends reading them in chronological order, but I found myself enjoying the prequel more after I read the 3 main titles. It's up to you. Word of warning, these are all long and sometimes heavy. So if you're not really into it, it could bore you and feel like a chore to finish.

The series is an AU that begins when Sirius becomes James and Lily Potter's Secret Keeper, instead of Pettigrew, inadvertently changing everything. It focuses in the relationship of the 4 Marauders during the war. It's a bit dark, but I found it enjoyable. Although I read it a very long time ago, when I was just beginning to read fanfiction, so I don't know how well it holds by today's standards. Do check it out. Who knows, you'll probably like it.
