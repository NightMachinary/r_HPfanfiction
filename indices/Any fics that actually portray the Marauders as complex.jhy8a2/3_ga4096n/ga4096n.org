linkao3(10057010) All the young dudes

I just finished this fic, it's wolfstar but that's slowburn and not that graphic. Really well-written, it's Remus' POV. I know you said fourth year up but this goes through from 1st year up. Having read a lot of Marauders fics this one really stuck out to me as granting all the main characters complex behaviour and growth throughout
