You rang? I could list good Marauder fic all day.

Edit: Sorry, didn't see until it was too late that you didn't want stories that start at first year, so a few of my recs don't work. I'll leave them in in case someone else is interested.

Glass of Water by Lyin gets recommended here a lot. It takes place in the aftermath of Sirius' prank, and that aftermath is taken so seriously by all concerned that I don't think I could call it whitewashing.

The Outcast by Gilipin touches on how painful some of the internal dynamics of the quartet are, even though they're all well-intentioned.

In Marauder Lover's White Flags, there's emphasis on Sirius' past bad behavior being a problem as James/Lily grow together.

MarieKavanaugh does a lot of Black family fic (I think all of the authors I've mentioned so far have multiple stories) that doesn't shy away from portraying Sirius as a stubborn, difficult kid. I'll just link An Education here because that's one I really like.

And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle is after the Marauders leave Hogwarts, in a very dark AU where Voldemort's first reign lasts longer. I think the characterizations are particularly good, and Remus' self-pity thing gets called out hard although he's still loved.

The work of the Divine Comedian is also popular here for a reason. There's a lot of sympathy for Sirius, but no hiding the fact that he can be a lot to take. I'll link The things that lurk in the dark because there's Sirius-criticism right in the summary.

Stoplight Delight's unfinished epic Against the Moon is a classic for a reason. There's periodic emphasis on Remus thinking James/Sirius have gone too far (which they always have) but not stopping them, plus a hard line drawn about the different ways Sirius and Regulus behave toward house-elves.

You might find Star of the North's Story of Four Friends too pro-Marauder, but I've never seen James' realization that he's been a brat and needs to do better done more beautifully.

And I'm tossing in Hyphen's classic comedy The Speculum Curse because the entire premise is that the curse flips the Marauders' personalities inside out and makes them hard to deal with.
