linkffn(12085137) Seven Normal Years of Harry the Hufflepuff.

Voldemort didn't read the fine print on Horcruxes and dies permanently the first time around. Harry ends up in Hufflepuff and just ends up having a relatively normal life at Hogwarts because Voldemort isn't there to make it miserable.

Story's told in the form of diary entries.
