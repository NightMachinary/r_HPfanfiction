"Look, I specialise in taking apart 1000 plus year old enchantments using only my wand and my wits. I once had a muggleborn reporter tell me that I was disarming mines by solving math puzzles and using the results to figure out which wire to cut. It's really exciting in its own way to the tiny, tiny number of people who get it."

"Uh huh."

" Dad... His job once had him take note of the effects an Eastern European animation enchantment had on mould patterns around the casting area. He had to wait for the mould to grow and was tasked with preserving the area from any attempt at cleaning up until that happened. So he spent a solid six months watching mould grow in a room, memory charming any muggles that came near and taking pictures of mould when it started sprouting. That was his most exciting assignment before he was tasked with going undercover at the Muggle Liaison Committee."

"Oh Merlin."

"Trust me, 99 percent of all that classified stuff? Dead boring. I once read an account of a DOM operative chasing a Death Eater across central London in the sixties. It... It put me to sleep. The author spent ten pages hypothesising on whether the Death Eater was using tile patterns as a means of communication with his colleagues. The chase scene was a map with an itinerary, followed by five pages detailing the effect a cutting curse had on fabric upholstery used in muggle cars. It bored me to tears! But look, if you like doing things like gardening or collecting postage stamps, then that really is the job for you. Otherwise, stay away."
