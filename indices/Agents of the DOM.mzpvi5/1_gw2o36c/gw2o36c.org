Well, to be honest, proper spycraft would actually be super boring compared to the Hollywood version. The idea is to gather intelligence and confirm its accuracy. The more sensitive the intelligence being gathered, the harder it is to gather and confirm it, with only the most dangerous things such as imminent invasion or nuclear weapons being given to terrorists prompting intervention by teams that specialise in Black Operations (mostly belonging to nations that don't bear any noticeable outward affiliation with the country that gathered the intelligence if you want the Intel pipeline to remain 'safe'). The James Bond stuff wouldn't be handled by the agencies directly, nor would a field agent be asked to go and put themselves on the line when they can hire a guy to do it for them and not blow the local spy network's cover to kingdom come in case of capture.

Arthur would be an example of just such a field agent, tasked with doing his job, taking notes on the side and /not engaging the enemy/. The Order of the Phoenix seems to operate in much the same way-gathering intelligence and only acting in the most critical of circumstances. Passing info to the DMLE would be both useful and risky enough without the whole 'engaging in direct combat' thing.

In the meantime, actual work at the DOM would go something like this:

"Got a new file from our muggle liaison office." The shadowy figure said in as bored a voice as his vocal scrambling charms allowed for.

"Pass it over." Analyst 15 said, grabbing the file and opening it. "Huh. A painting?" He asked as he pulled a photo of the object out.

"Something about it triggered the Brains." The figure said. "Can't see it myself."

"That's because you were looking at the painting and not the frame. See those twists in the age lines? Classic enchantment-induced physical distortion. Must be a pretty powerful one too. Where was this picture taken?" Analyst 15 asked.

"Stockbroker's private collection. Lives in a place called, uh, Sloth?"

"Slough. Hmmmm... Forward it to the Americans. Bet it's the MACUSA snooping around again."

"And if it's not..."

" Then our stockbroker has some explaining to do. He should be a muggle. What's he doing with an enchanted painting in his house? Who does he know? Where did he buy it? Why is a wizard spying on him? We need to know."
