My headcanon has an entire branch of the Ministry dealing with 'Muggle Liason'. Most of the day-to-day work is handling money transfers and providing legal advice to magicals involved with the muggles world e.g. buying a house. However, they also have staff working with the police and intelligence services to steer them away from wasting their time chasing after magical stuff, and Inland Revenue, because whatever method the Ministry or the Goblins use to return pounds back into circulation would technically be money laundering.
