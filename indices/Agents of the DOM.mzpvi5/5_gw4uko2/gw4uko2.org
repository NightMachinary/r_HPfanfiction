My headcanon for the Dom was always that they are these crazy scientists (but with magic) who enjoy breaking laws that were never meant to be broken, who enjoy creation abomination just for the sake of knowledge, who would willingly tear a hole into reality just because they can and want to know what would happen. I always thought that the Dom was a lot older than the MoM, that they are the sort of people you would go to if you want to know how to summon cathulu because they would find out just because it's something they didn't know before, and that they would also be the type of people who would then summon cathulu just for the sake of studying it
