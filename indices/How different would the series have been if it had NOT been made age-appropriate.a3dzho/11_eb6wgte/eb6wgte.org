I think Voldemort would act different compared to canon and would be more effective in getting things done.

​

In book 1, he could've killed harry as early as the welcoming feast. He can make Quirrel brew a poison (slow-acting to prevent detection) and put it in his goblet (switching spell? personal house elf? there are a lot of possibilities). If that is too open for his purposes, he can place the poison on harry's bed or pillow. He can make the death of harry potter an act of revenge from the death eaters. He can even send a letter or return a graded test/assignment laced with poison (absorption through skin contact).

Harry being killed at this time can be an effective statement for the English wizarding world. If he is caught or he did the more overt option, he can own up to it and show Voldemort's face for everyone to see. Voldemort can talk to them to show people that he's actually alive and has done the "impossible" of "defeating" death. For a more dramatic effect, Quirrel could have shot morsmordre at the Great Hall while shouting "LONG LIVE THE DARK LORD!" He doesn't have to live for Voldy to be resurrected later on. But, this move would be like a message to his Death Eaters like "Hey guys, I'm back. Let's get things moving."

Voldemort's spirit(?)/ghost(?)/wraith? would make an appearance like how it happened at the end of book 1. Everyone at the great hall would see him and realize that the Dark Lord is not limited by the confines of a body. Kids from death eater families would tell their death eater parents. Kids from neutral and "light" side families would tell their parents. These parents would tell their friends, siblings, acquaintances, etc.

Rumors would start and these death eaters would act on getting the political and social landscape prepared for the return of the Dark Lord. Those who had family and friends die from death eater attacks would relive the fear during the first rise of Voldemort. There would be an undercurrent of fear and the Death eater-backed ministry and hogwarts can take advantage of the situation by placing reforms to prevent Voldemort's rise from happening again. Misinformation can be spread through the daily prophet to make public sentiment favorable to the reforms being done.

This is just in book 1 and just one scenario for how things could go.

​

Voldy didn't even have to wait for 1991 before he starts possessing people. He could possess people and get in touch with his loyal Death Eaters to get things started.
