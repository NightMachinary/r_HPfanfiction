Can we have that as a fanfiction? Especially since say Ron dying in year one (he sacrifices himself and the chessboard kills him!) would be a wake up call for Harry (and Hermione, too! Seriously, if their friend dies in front of them? They might either buckle down and learn to the best of their ability or they might even run in order not to be next!)
