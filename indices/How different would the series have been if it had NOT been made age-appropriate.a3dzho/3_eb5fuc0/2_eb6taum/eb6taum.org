Indeed, Fleur would have gone back to France IMHO (the Weasleys humiliated and bullied her constantly after all and Bill with his cursebreaking is probably not home all that often!), Hermione would have left Ron....etc.

Hell, 19 years later might be about a new Dark Lord (or Lady!) - at least if nothing changes (I bet the muggleborns harbor a lot of hatred for the incompetent ministry, the purebloods who sat in their mansions (while they were interred in camps!), the Order who was practically worthless, the older generation who were so incompetent that children had to fight etc. etc.)
