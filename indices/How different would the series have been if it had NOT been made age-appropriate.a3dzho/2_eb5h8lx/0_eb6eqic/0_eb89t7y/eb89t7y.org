For me the most annoying thing was thinking about how ridiculous it was that Dumbledore was trying to lure someone (potentially a Death Eater or Voldemort himself) into a school full of children.

Absolutely insane in hindsight. Could've gotten so many children murdered, and it would've been entirely Dumbledore's fault.
