The Mirror of Erised was the real trap, the others were just decoys, something to perhaps slow Quirrelmort down, nothing too dangerous so students can escape, but enough that it's obvious something is going on, can't lay a trap in the target doesn't know of the bait.\\
A lethal riddle or trap really wouldn't be much help, when things go badly Tom can just fly away as a wraith.\\
Either Dumbledore had some plan to handle said wraith, or he was deliberately setting Harry up, perhaps to ensure Voldemort knows Harry is protected (and that his survival was no mere fluke), either to ward him off further attempts on his life, or to ensure the ritual uses his blood giving him that one chance at survival.
