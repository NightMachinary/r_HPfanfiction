The biggest problem rereading book 1 is that it's largely pointless. Yeah it introduces Harry the the magical world, but the big confrontation? The Philosopher's Stone? The Mirror of Erised worked. Every trap before was pointless. Quirrelmort ended standing in front of the mirror with no clue how to get the stone. Then Harry shows up and actually gets the stone. An '/Accio P/hilosopher's Stone' and the series is over.
