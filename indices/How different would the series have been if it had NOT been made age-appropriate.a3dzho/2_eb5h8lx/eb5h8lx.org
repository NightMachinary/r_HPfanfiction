The first few books would definetely be very different. One of my biggest problems with HP canon is how little sense it makes when re-read after reading the further books. You learn in book 3 that there's a spell that allows you to hide a location so well that only actual betrayal by a single specific person can lead to it being found. Why not hide the philosopher's stone in a house under the fidelius, rather than at Hogwarts, full of schoolchildren? And while we're at it, why make one of the obstacles a RIDDLE that lets you deduce THE CORRECT ANWSER? Rereading the first books after the final ones just makes me feel that manipulative dumbledore is actual canon. I like to think that if all of the books were targeted at an older audience, we wouldn't get results like this.
