Well...Voldemort would probably be more of a bogeyman in the background. A charismatic leader whose rhetoric inspires the Death Eaters.\\
Harry wouldn't be facing him head on; his years at Hogwarts would be less life-threatening, he might not necessarily be as famous...I dunno.

If Hogwarts were 'adulted-up', I figure that a lot of the civil-rights themes that started in later books would come to the fore a lot sooner. The indoctrinating beliefs and values and practices of the Death Eaters, and how to counteract them, would make up a significant part of the plot, as would the rights of various magical creatures.\\
Far from being a background element alluded to by Binns, the goblin rebellions may be significant struggles for civil rights, and what's recorded in pureblood aristocratic history (centaurs chose to be beasts, giants are dumb savages, house-elves love to be slaves) may not be the same as the truth at all.
