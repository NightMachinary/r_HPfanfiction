  Well...Voldemort would probably be more of a bogeyman in the background. A charismatic leader whose rhetoric inspires the Death Eaters.

I agree. I think Voldemort's first appearance in the books was a waste of his "bogeyman"'s potential. Him being so feared that no one dares say his name should have him being much more terrifying that he first appeared to be.
