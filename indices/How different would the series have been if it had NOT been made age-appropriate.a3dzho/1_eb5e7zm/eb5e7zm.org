I keep joking I want the adult versions now. I think we'd get more info on the first wave of terror. Oh, Voldemort used reanimated corpses? Let's have more than a sentence or two on that. How was he so scary that everyone basically drops whatever they're holding twenty years later at the mention of his name.

I think mental illness and trauma would get more than a handwave: Harry, Sirius, the Longbottoms, Remus. These people need help. They definitely don't need Mrs. Weasley calling it "fits of the sullens".

We'd get more insight into the wizarding world because Harry would be more curious. HOW he doesn't find out who Voldemort's supports are until book five is beyond me. That would be lesson one for most older teens.

And yeah, sex drugs and rock and roll.

Edit: and also, Harry, you most likely weren't planned and Padfoot is gonna let you know that.
