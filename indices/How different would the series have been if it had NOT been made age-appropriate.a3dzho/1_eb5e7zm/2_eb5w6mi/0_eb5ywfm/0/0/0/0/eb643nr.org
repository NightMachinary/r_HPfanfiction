Commonality isn't really a justification, and I guess we're arguing degrees here. Does Lupin need help the same way Sirius or Harry clearly do? Nah. Was he a sad guy who made repeated bad decisions stemming from a lack of self worth that could benefit from therapy/discussion/friends who are in a position to give support (sorry Sirius)? I think so, yeah.
