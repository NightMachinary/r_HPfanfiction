For sure, but also not what I'm saying. Wasn't meant to draw a comparison between him and Harry, or any other character. Just that he - like many others in the series - isn't as “okay” as a childlike Harry views him and that would come out more in a work skewed for adults.

(And in no way disparaging Lupin; he and Sirius are my favorite characters by a wide margin.)
