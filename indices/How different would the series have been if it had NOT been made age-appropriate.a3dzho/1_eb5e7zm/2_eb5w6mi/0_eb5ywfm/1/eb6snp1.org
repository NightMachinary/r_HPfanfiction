Silver bullet! (Sorry, but I don't like people doing a runner when they have kids! Frankly that (not wanting kids, because I'd never run out on them - unless threatened by my GF, no not wife! I don't like marriage either! - but don't want any (seriously, I am not father material!)) is why I am not dating ATM, because I want a vasectomy first!)

ps: Tonks deserves better, hell Fleur deserves better, too (her husband to be didn't stop her family from bullying the girl...seriously, that seems to be a theme in HP! People end up with the wrong people, parents bully their kids' spouses etc. etc.)
