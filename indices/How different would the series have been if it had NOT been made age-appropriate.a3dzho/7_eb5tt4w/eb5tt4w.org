Even removing the "age appropriate" requirement would still leave most things within the stylistic preference of the author. People in real life have sex, yes, but not every story targeted at an adult audience is crammed full of sex scenes.

Ultimately stories contain matters which are relevant to the story the author wants to tell. So if you're just changing the target audience of the books from kids to adults, I doubt much would change.
