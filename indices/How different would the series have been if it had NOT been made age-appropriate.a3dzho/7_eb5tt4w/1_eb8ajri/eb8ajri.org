Whilst you could /technically/ change absolutely nothing and simply say the story's aimed at adults, that kind of misses the point of OP's question entirely, and somewhat disregards the fact that there are general expectations of stories aimed at children vs adults.

The implication of OP's question is clearly about changing the story based on those general standards.
