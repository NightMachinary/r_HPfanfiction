Not to mention for magic being used against others! Draco would probably learn to obliviate somebody ASAP and the Imperius soon after (he's the right kind of scum that would put a fellow student under the imperius (hell, he might even not do it and just tie them up or freeze them in place!) to rape them and later delete the girl's mind)

​

Seriously, magic is basically a limitless toolkit! Fact is that it is being used by particularly dimwitted people in HP (they all lack creativity IMHO)...then again: Creative people can create wounders, but they can also create Adolf Hitler's wet dream or become a Dr. Mengele on steroids!
