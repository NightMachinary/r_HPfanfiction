Dumbledore makes dubious choices even in the later books (allthough nowhere near as ridiculous). Ignoring Harry in 5th year, allowing Umbridge to run rampant and /vanishing/, drip feeding information about Riddle in 6th year instead of giving a condensed version and actually useful information comes to mind.
