His actions in later books are things the reader can locate within the plot and come to understand through careful reading. They can discover how Dumbledore felt before, during, and after almost any choice Dumbledore makes GoF onward and especialy OotP onward. The first book on the other hand, we are vaguely led to believe that Dumbledore has controlled everything that year, but nearly all the plotpoints don't makes sense for his motive if he had known about them (detention in the forest, Harry thinking Snape was the one working for Voldy instead of Quirrell, the fact that most of Harry's knowledge comes from him overhearing conversations by chance) and also it is impossible to understand which parts he controlled and which he didn't, and it can't be figured out backwards because a lot of plotpoints contradict each other.

For example, Harry discovered the mirror because he was searching for Flamel and Dumbledore appears surprised because he didn't know Harry knew who Flamel was. Immediately after Dumbledore expresses his surprise that Harry knew about Flamel, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that Dumbledore secretly helped him discover the Stone. Except why would Harry think that considering that discovering Flamel was THE MOST IMPORTANT CLUE in Harry discovering the Stone! Sure, one can sweep it all under the rug and say "Dumbledore works in mysterious ways and didn't want it to be obvious he was giving Harry hints", except if this was Dumbledore's motive, then surely Harry's statement to Ron and Hermione proves that Dumbledore is not very good at this. This is only some of the ranting I could about this book.

I mean, it's like a knot of inconsistencies! Still love the book though.
