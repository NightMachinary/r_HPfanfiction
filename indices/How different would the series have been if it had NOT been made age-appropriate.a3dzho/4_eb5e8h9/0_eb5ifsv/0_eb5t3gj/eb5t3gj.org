Thing is, trying to apply any sort of logic to the things Dumbledore does in the first few books doesn't /work,/ because Rowling wrote them to be a kid's romp in a magic school. At the time they weren't a cultural icon, they were just somewhat more successful children's tales in a world with literally millions of children's tales. They hadn't become /THE/ Harry Potter series, and I think Rowling just didn't think that they'd become so... them. So she wrote about a magic deadly snake in a school because it was just a magic snake in a magic school in an imaginary story.

After a while, the books /blew the fuck up/ and now nearly every man woman and child on earth knows about them. So Rowling starts building this huge magical world, and it's wonderful, but it's inconsistent with the first two books because at that time, they were just... books. Another story. An author trying to /become/ successful, not one that had made and given away a billion pounds already. They didn't have the weight of The Wizarding World hung on them. They were just a fun romp in a magical school for kids. And in the fun Harry Potter kid's romp, a responsible Dumbledore who cares for the children and who is responsible isn't allowed, because then there is no romp. No romp means no story.

Which is why I think Dumbledore will never make sense to anybody trying to make sense of him through the lens of the canon storyline.
