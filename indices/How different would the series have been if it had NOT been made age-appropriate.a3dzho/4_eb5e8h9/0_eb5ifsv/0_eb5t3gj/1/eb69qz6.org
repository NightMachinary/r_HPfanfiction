In the list of my all time favorite books, Sorcerer's Stone absolutely makes the list, but my /god/, do I agree with you that Dumbledore's actions make no sense in it. Regardless of whether you think he's good or bad or somewhere in between, his actions do not make sense based on /any/ supposed agenda. I might even go so far to say we can't determine if his actions make sense because there's really no way to determine what his actions even /are/ in the first place!

  Which is why I think Dumbledore will never make sense to anybody trying to make sense of him through the lens of the canon storyline.

I think he makes sense GoF onwards, and especially OotP onwards, but only to readers who do not treat the first few books as if they are as thought out as the last few books.
