I think this is a great question, and the only better question I can think of is putting stuff in his will, which makes a permanent record of his gifts to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, clues that tie Harry to the Deathly Hallows which is not something I think should be on public record especially considering how famous Harry is. Dumbledore didn't foresee how the Elder Wand would play, so he can't have predicted that, but even without that, for probably hundreds of years, conspiracy theorist would likely correctly guess that Harry has the Invisibility cloak Hallow and Hermione being gifted the Tales of Beedle the Bard would all but confirm this; this is the exact opposite of what Dumbledore wanted for Harry and the Hallows. The only explanation I can think of is that these objects needed to be introduced into the story and because it created interesting characterization for Scrimgeor and gave us a dramatic scene for Harry and him to fight the day before Scrimgeor is murdered and that JKR didn't consider that it doesn't make sense for Dumbledore to do this.

I think your question is a little easier to make sense of though. I have nothing against Harry having one longer lesson, but I also don't think having a few lessons across the school year is as crazy as your question implies. I think Dumbledore underestimated Draco and this was his biggest downfall that year, because Draco organized the murder faster than Dumbledore expected. If you consider that a reasonable interpretation, then it goes to follow that Dumbledore's timing was off and that he planned his year thinking there was no reason to hurry.

What does Slughorn's memory have to do with it, though? I'm not really sure, sorry.
