Dumbledore surely can make or buy a small dwelling, ward the shit out of it, place magical contraptions there (and have it watched so that if Voldemort comes? He can apparate there ASAP and maybe even destroy Voldemort's new body (the one he possesses) while the Dark Lord is busy with the defenses!)
