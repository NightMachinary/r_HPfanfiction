I just finished reading a piece called "The Deadline" by Lena Phoria. It's a future Dramione, but I found it really endearing and fun if you are looking for something light. I'll try to the do the Fanfictions.net thing below... I've never tried it so if it doesn't work, my apologies!

I can actually recommend a crap ton more but it's all Dramione, so I'll stick with one for now. If you're curious, feel free to pm me. It's definitely an acquired taste, but once you find the good stuff it's hard to go back to anything else! :)
