I've now got the series on my list to read when I get the chance. From what little I picked out from Bobmin's work, it seemed interesting.

Bobmin had some great stories, it's definitely sad, but at least he's out of the pain now. There's some details in his FF bio, but he had Lung cancer, and it took him rather quickly.
