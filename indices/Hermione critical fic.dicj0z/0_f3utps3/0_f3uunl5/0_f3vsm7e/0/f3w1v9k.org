Exactly!

Its why in my opinion after the first book she never had any issues that needed working on.

Even when she did it was handwaved away or someone else was more wrong than her or it was justified in someway.

Because of this she never had an arc

What a waste so much more could have been done. I know when this series was coming out Hermione being the competent smart badass who was in the right was likely a bigger deal and great representation and a good rolemodel. But its 2019 now there are tons of more female characters like Hermione who still had flaws that had consequences and got character arcs. You can have both. Sure canon cant be changed but fanon can. And this thing of giving characters arcs that dont exist in canon? This is a thing Fanfics do alot. Not as bashing but just having them grow from flaws. Even in the hp fandom.

Like alot of people get salty about Malfoy getting redeemed in fics because its not uncommon for him to get woobified and he was a bigot growing up.

But its also not uncommon for him to be dragged for his actions. For him to face alot of reprocussions to earn that redemption. And chances are if you like fanon Draco youve read a story like that. And if you do...who could blame you? That is a really interesting story that makes the character compelling. And some are very well written too. You can dislike canon Draco but appreciate the fanon version for capitalizing on that potential. But all that effort for a canon character that people have mixed feelings on. Wouldnt it be great if Hermione a fan favorite had an arc like that in fic? Wouldnt that be super compelling and make you root for her?

For some reason people have embraced this concept for other characters but not Hermione. At least not in my experience. And maybe thats true for more than just me because it seems more people have hopes of reading a fic like this but few have.
