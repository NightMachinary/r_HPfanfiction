I will do that, I've opened a doc for it in Scrivener, though if you'll allow it, I might bug you (and the rest of the sub) for inspiration and ideas. Some are pretty obvious, like Scabbers and the attacking birds, but what other chapters could there be, SPEW and the hats comes to mind, I don't think she was ever informed that Dobby had the clean the entire tower alone because of her. Personally, I wouldn't mind if someone complained about her just barging into the boys dorm, because that's totally not ok, but I can't remember how often/which years she actually did it, will have to look it up.
