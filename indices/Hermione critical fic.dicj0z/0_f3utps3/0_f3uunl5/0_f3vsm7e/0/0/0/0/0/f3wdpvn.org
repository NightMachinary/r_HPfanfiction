Bug away I love this idea !

For the houseelves personsally i thought the issue was she didnt consider their feelings about being unpaid labor. True they could have been indoctorinated. But if she wanted to free them of that she should have changed their opinions about their status first try to understand things from their perspective and then when they were more comfortable with the idea leave socks around the common room. If you dont consider their feelings and go straight to socks even if you are right it wont work

Maybe her growth from the fireboldt incident ( maybe talk to Harry and Ron about it being from Sirius black instead of going straight to a teacher could be a lesson she learnt because not taking into account others feelings regardung your actions about their well being will hurt them despite your best intentions) could make her handle the elves differently
