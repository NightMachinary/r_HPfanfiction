Exactly this. And it can be excused by the fact that she is still a child, but again, if no one ever actually brings it up with her, and I'm sure she'd be horrified to learn about Dobby having to clean the whole tower alone because of her actions, well, she won't know, won't be able to learn, grow, adapt.

Was talking to a friend and she brought up how, unfortunately, often when a girl is wrong in fanfic she's portrayed as 'a silly girl' and put down, and I really want to avoid that. While I'm sure there's characters that would react that way to her, say Snape, that's just not really what I'm aiming for. There's a difference between constructive criticism, and just tearing someone down just because you can. While I think some stuff might require a harsher dose of reality check, possibly Marietta and her permanent disfiguration, and the whole attacking Ron, I still don't want to hit her with a big bashing stick? And I do feel she should have a right to reply. There was a story linked recently that was just a list of flaws read outloud to her, some real, some made up, some taken out of context, or exaggerated, and she never got a word in edgewise, and then ran out crying and that was the end of the fic, and while I guess that could be interesting once or twice, it doesn't leave room for character growth, that's just being mean?
