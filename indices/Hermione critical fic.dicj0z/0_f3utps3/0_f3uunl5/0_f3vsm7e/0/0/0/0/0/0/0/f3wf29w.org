To be honest i feel like rather than call outs there should be consequnces

The scabbers and fireboldt situation shouldnt be resolved by Harry and Ron telling her she was insensitive and took things into her hands without discussing it with them even thoughit involved them, its resolved because they start avoiding her because they are upset and feel it was a breach of friendship for them . She has to figure out on her own why they are upset why that sort of thing is damaging and try to rekindle the friendship which works because they do like her. .

Or a consequence about her lashing out physically with Ron is that he becomes even closer to Lavender and she applogizes for her actions and realizes that making Ron take respinsibility for her jealousy is making them more distant. She has to at least for a time accept their relationship

She also learns a lesson and yes she feels bad but grows

Its not a author mouthpiece ranting away about all her flaws.

Show dont tell
