Alright. So. I'm maybe not the best writer in the world, but this has all raised my interest, and it won't be like a 7 year 'what changes if Hermione changes' fic, more like a series of what could've happened if someone had either talked to someone else, or brought things to Hermione's attention directly, and/or what consequences there are, and what could change. So if we'd start with Scabbers and the eating of him, maybe Random Gryffindor Prefect overhears the fight, and thinks Hey, I should tell McGonagall about this, because students' pets shouldn't be eating other students' pets, and it rolls from there.

Then there can be a chapter on Why You Shouldn't Assault Your Best Friend.

Also You Shouldn't Confundus People On Brooms. Because seriously, that could've gone really badly. Reaaally badly. But mostly sticking to canon things, and not having McLaggen fly into the Whomping Willow.
