I think this would be interesting, especially if you could take these instances, make a series of one shot stories about the consequences. Also, I'm pretty sure the centaurs hate her after the whole Umbridge thing, quite surprised she didn't somehow get arrested for that. I recently read an NCIS fic which was a set of standalone chapters following each episode of season 1, with the consequences of the teams action, or inaction, ranging from just getting called out and a talking to by the boss, to legal action taken because the team messed up big time.\\
I would like to see something like that in regards to Hermione, not just her being bashed into the wall, but basically there being consequences, and potential for character growth. If you're never called out when you mess up, how're you going to grow?
