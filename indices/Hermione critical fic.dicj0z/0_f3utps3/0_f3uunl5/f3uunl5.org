I like it!

But as neat as this would be id prefer a fic where she sufferred consequences because of this when it happened.

Like for example the cat thing. What if Hagrid hadnt called Harry and Ron out for distancing themselves and she slowly had to make amends while they decided that while they were upset they still liked her as a friend? And they came to that conclusion on their own.

Or like with the bird thing if people gave her the cold shoulder or this only drove Ron further from her and he ended up becoming closer to Lavender and Hermione just had to accept that sometimes the person you love doesnt love you back and you have to move on. They shouldnt answer for your jealousy.
