Ya thats more my thing Harry and Ron make mistakes and when they do they face consequences or the narrative makes it clear they are in the wrong by calling them out. Like when Ron is jealous about Krum and hurts her feelings the narrartive makes him look like a dick. Which in that moment he is.

But when Hermione lashes out in jealousy in a similar set up only in reverse its poor Hermione she had a one sided crush.

I want a fic that makes her suffer more consequences and call her out more.

But the only time i see it is in bashing fic which exaggerates things so much that it doesnt resemble the character. Or just dismissises all good qualities she has and twists them into bad ones instead.

So im looking for a fic that does this with a Hermione thats in character and is fair about what they call out or bash.
