Ya...i mean if thats all there is i suppose ill take it.

I guess i just want a more grounded potrayal about her actions and the consequences of them.

You dont always have the luxury of being right and even when you are that doesnt always matter especially in relationships.

But Hermiones behavior is excused in cases where others dont have similar behavior excused. She also has flaws hand waved because shes right about something.

She is suspicious of the HBP book because she is jealous. Shes right about being more careful with the book but this came out of jealousy. And being insecure about her intelligence is something she never has to deal with ever again.

Theres never a smarter person, a skill she values in magical academia she cant exel in.

You have that set up with her why not follow through with it.

The answer isnt Hermione is dumb. Its Hermione isnt good at everything and has to accept it and focus on what she can do not what others can do better.

But you never get that in fics

So it feels sue ish. The world is being altered to make her look good. And unless its a bashfic just shitting on her in a unfair way or "putting her in her place" there is no alternative...and i want it i want.that alternative.

It has to exist somewhere...please someone give me.
