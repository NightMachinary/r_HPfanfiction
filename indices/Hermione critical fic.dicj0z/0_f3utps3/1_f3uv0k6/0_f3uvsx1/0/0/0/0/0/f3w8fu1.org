I mean I agree with the idea, I'm just a pessimist.

It's not that Hermione is a bad person in the books. In my opinion the books' portrayal of her is probably the best official one. It's that she does get away with things Harry and Ron would not because she's an author favorite.

It's still way better than movie and fanon portrayals of her. I don't want bashing and I don't want her worshipped. I want an intelligent person who grows up and realizes she's disregarding people.
