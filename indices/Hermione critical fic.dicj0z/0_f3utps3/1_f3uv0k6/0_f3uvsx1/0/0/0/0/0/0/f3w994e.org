For me its not so much about making her a good person but i just think giving her this struggle makes her narrative more interesting.

And avoiding consequences for her in situations where you could expect it based on what you know about the characters just to make her look more sympathetic seems...less interesting feels too convenient like youre cheating. You can make her sympathetic but you got to do it in a way that works not make the world bend to make her sympathetic
