I'd like such a moment after war when the Trio sit down and discuss about their shortcomings during the past 7 years.

As for Hermione, here are the things that could be mentioned:

- Totally insensitive about her monster cat eating her best friend's pet rat
- Curse the DA contract without telling people before hand. Even worse, her little scheme could not prevent traitors.
- Refuse to consider Draco Malfoy a Death Eater bent on carrying out terrorist activities
- Assault Ron with birds in a fit of jealousy
- Refuse to consider the possibility of a Horcrux hidden in Hogwarts
- Refuse to believe the validity of Deathly Hallows

Of course, the list of Harry and Ron's mistakes are also long. It actually makes sense for them to work out these issues.
