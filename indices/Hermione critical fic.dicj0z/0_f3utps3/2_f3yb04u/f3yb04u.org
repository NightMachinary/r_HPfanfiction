  I'd like such a moment after war when the Trio sit down and discuss about their shortcomings during the past 7 years.

Woah, woah, woah. Why would they have such an open and frank discussion of their personal issues? You're talking like they had an incredibly powerful Dark artifact in their midst that was actively trying to use said flaws to drive them against each other and managing their relationships in a mature manner was critical to their success. I mean, what's the worst that could happen in that situation - one of the Trio starting a massive fight then leaving the camp, only to be unintentionally kept out by the others' safety precautions?

Balderdash.
