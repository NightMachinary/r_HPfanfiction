You are claiming unrealism, when in reality people will face the same challenges in a new capacity and have to keep making the right choice. Ron will always have issues of insecurity, Harry will always be impulsive and Hermione will always be too much of a know it all.

The important bit for each of them is how they improve across the series and learn to utilise their strengths. Ron learned how to treat Hermione with greater maturity and respect. He learned to have greater confidence in his abilities both as a Quidditch player and as a person, and the major part for Ron was how he realised instantly his mistake rather than stew on it as he did in Goblet/Prisoner. Hermione learned to respect Luna in spite of their differences and relaxed much more about the spirit of rules.

It was just meant to be an offhand joke on the license at the end to make one laugh that Ron cheated, it's not something to take too seriously, but he did at least nearly pass.
