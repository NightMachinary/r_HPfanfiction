In book 1 Ron struggles with jealousy, laziness, feeling inferior and controlling his temper. In book 7 we see all these same issues in force. I will grant that he does confront some things with the locket but he still cheats to get a license in the epilogue. And we never see any real consequence for his jealousy and anger, he just comes back and everyone act like it never happened. Show me where in books 2-6 he deals with his issues.
