Where is Ron lazy in book 7? Where is he unable to control his temper in book 1?

  Show me where in books 2-6 he deals with his issues.

Him dealing with jealousy is all over; from his gradual realization that Harry's life is actually kind of shit because for all Harry has going for him, he lacks all the things that Ron has in abundance; to his fears about Hermione finding someone else.

His laziness is given stark relief - he's only lazy about things he doesn't believe matter. He works hard in the DA, and never shirks one of the year-long projects or mysteries that form the main plot (except year 6 because he and Hermione have decided that Malfoy isn't evil for some reason). He spends half of year 1 in the library looking for Flamel, he helps Harry train for the tournament, he's there for the Ministry raid, etc.

He controls his temper enough to make it through year 5, when an entire group of people who hate him, specifically, have Inquisitorial powers. He defends Hermione to Snape when he and her were in an epic fight (that she started), he swallows his pride to check on Harry when he's out of bed in year 4 because he's concerned for him after an epic fight (that Ron started), etc.

His inferiority is the same as his jealousy.
