I don't agree with that. Hermione and Ron act their age and mature in the books steadily throughout in a realistic way. It's one of the many things you actually see fanfiction fail regularly at, they forget that the characters are still young and people are flawed.

Draco does not exactly have character growth. That's not really the point. Draco simply reached the point where he had to back up his words, and it turns out he wasn't truly capable of being a murderer. His character growth happens post-series.
