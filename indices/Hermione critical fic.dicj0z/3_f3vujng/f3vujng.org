The thing that both Hermione “apologists” (for lack of a better term) and her detractors tend to overlook is that canon Hermione is a smart girl with little to no social skills dealing with people her own age. It's understandable for someone who's an only child and didn't have friends growing up. Unfortunately JKR isn't very good at showing realistic character growth (my biggest issues with canon Ron and Draco also stem from this). So we have teenagers often acting like they're still eleven.

I don't think you could do a realistic fic with her making all of the same mistakes as canon, she would probably be mostly the same in books 1 and 2 with steady improvement from book 3 onward
