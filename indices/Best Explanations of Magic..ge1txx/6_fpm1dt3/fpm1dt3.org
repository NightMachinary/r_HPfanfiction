If you're up for some Snape/Hermione, I'd suggest you read Ordinary People by Hayseed. It's only available on fictionalley though. And Hermione is young (18), so if it bothers you no point. But it's about Hermione and Snape trying to discover the very origin of magic, if it's genetic or magnetic, etc, and it's very academically-oriented, with real research, so it could be an interesting read if that's what you're looking for.
