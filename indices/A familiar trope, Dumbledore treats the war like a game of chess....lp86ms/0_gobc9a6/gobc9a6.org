"And me, sir?" Harry asked Dumbledore, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. "What role should I play?"

"You... Harry... You'll be a pawn."

--------------

"Wonderful Harry. You brave, brave boy! You've reached the end of the board!"

Harry blinked. All around him was white, the last thing he remembered was Voldemort raising Hagrid's umbrella at him, then a flash of green. "The what, Headmaster?"

"The board! The board! Remember that long-winded chess analogy I belaboured all those times you were grievously injured through my machinations, and I meticulously, excruciatingly, detail-by-detail explained why wizards /ought not to meddle with time?/"

Harry stifled a shudder, remembering those joyless months where Dumbledore had broken fully amidst the time-madness, and had him write down the pertinent details of every timeline he'd shattered. It was two-thousand pages long. Dumbledore had to clone thirty Hermiones and meld their minds just to begin to grasp the cracked continuities, and then Dumbledore made him re-write it /using Umbridge's Blood Quill/ when his Phoenix!Animagus form incinerated it.

"... Of course." In the aftermath he and Dumbledore settled their differences. Their new solution to counter adversaries who nonsensically meddled with time, was to make plans that made no sense.

"What do pawns do when they reach the end of the board?"

Harry thought for a moment, his mind whirring to all those times Ron trounced him. "They... bring... stuff... back?"

Dumbledore smiled warmly, then reached a hand into his voluminous flamingo-coloured robes and pulled out a revolver. "That they do Harry, now grasp my arm, and let's finish this. /Up and Atom!/"

Harry clasped his forearm and they slipped through the incorporeal death-chamber floor-door through to the land of the living. There was an almighty obnoxious clap of thunder and a blindingly pink light. Suddenly Harry was back in his body on the floor of the Forest, Dumbledore's feet planted themselves next to him, while Harry--stuck between the forces of magic, the laws of nature, and the mocking tendrils of fate,--rose six feet into the air and slammed back down again.

All was silence as Dumbledore, wand and revolver akimbo, faced down the rather green-looking Voldemort, who was being helped to his feet by a gawping Bellatrix. "What the f--"

The Death Eaters surrounding them, as they always did, rushed to reach into their pockets and hip fire themselves backwards through time to understand how something they /couldn't/ understand could be understood /enough/ to explain it to future version of themselves until the battle was done. The last time this happened, the battle lasted thirteen years and created six traitorous original characters who got stuck in the time loop with them: fortunately their lack of experience allowed Dumbledore, by way of Dobby, to trap them in a cross-over universe where time-turners hadn't been invented /yet/ by the universe-hopping Merlin!Harry (who they tasked with cleaning up after them).

"It's over, Tom," Dumbledore intoned gravely, years had passed since the last paragraph. "I have the high ground." And he did, perched atop a tree-branch as though he weighed less than a feather -- a trick he'd learned from Kung Fu movies during one of his forward-hops to the near future, hoping against hope for a Sane!Voldemort to acquire as an ally. Alas, he had failed in this task, but from the flames of failure he discovered an essential manoeuvring tactic. But even that barely broke the stalemate until the Dark!Ginny timeline erupted, and he and Voldemort begrudgingly teamed-up to fend off the hordes of Harrymorts Ginny had cloned. And once that was over, given the rising mound of bodies and basilisks beneath them, the dawning horror of their surroundings forced them to call a truce to jump-backwards and track down Gilderoy Lockhart for a scent-based Memory Charm. Now, at last, Dumbledore had trapped Voldemort between two Indy!Harry corpses adorned in goblin war-armour.

A moment passed as Dumbledore beheld the faces of a hundred broken Harrys surrounding Voldemort, even a backwards-hop to mentor Harry... to mentor Harry's /father/... to take Harry away and hide him in Argentina... even to trap him in a sun-bound asteroid -- none of it stopped Harry from taking the Indy!Harry route, even sans-Dursleys he seemed incapable of understanding the difference between a /trustee/ and a /beneficiary/ of a trust fund, which Voldemort, via-Malfoy, used as the lynchpin to secure Harry to his side. It was a tragic tale as old as time itself.

Spread around the hundred flavours of Indy!Harrys' were also the remnants of Voldemort's forces. For the past month Dumbledore had been cutting down the straggling remains of a counter-attack originating from the side-hop Harry had made into a Snape's son Slytherin!Harry AU. This mistake cost them dearly, almost as much as the Creature!Fic fiasco--but the less said about that, the better.

Before he could utter another cultural reference, Voldemort beat him to it.

"Say hello to my little friend."
