I never claimed that anyone doing it would be morally right. I was just speculating on what would happen if someone did it.

Genetic modification is certainly possible, even if it hasn't been done on humans yet. Apart from the three gene edited babies currently living in China.

Genetically modifying human babies to, for example, have a lower cancer risk is something that has been seriously discussed for quite a while, and many people see it as far less ethically problematic than other attempts to "improve the gene pool" as it'd be an optional medical procedure not unlike cosmetic surgery. Of course many are against it as it can easily turn into a dystopian eugenics state.

Gene editing is a serious topic. It works. It's been done with countless plants and animals. If gene editing humans to decrease cancer risk is a thing that people might be doing in a few decades, editing in magic might also happen in the HP-verse. And that allows for some interesting scenarios. Utopia where everyone has magic and is always in perfect health? Or dystopian GATTACA crossover? Considering that a form of eugenics (keeping the blood pure, excluding/killing muggleborns, discretely erasing squibs from the family trees) is already a thing in the HP-verse, it'd be very fascinating to speculate how it'd compare to gene editing.

The one doing the gene editing might assume that they're morally right, since the Death Eaters are killing muggleborns and the gene editor is only gifting people with magic in order to increase the numbers of muggleborns to no longer be an easily persecutable minority. Meanwhile other people might be appalled at the idea of messing with the very essence of living things and consider it a sin worse than even what Voldemort is doing (at least he's only mutilating his own soul!). And the muggles involved might dislike the fact that nobody even asked them if they'd like a magic baby.
