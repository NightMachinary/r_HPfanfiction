What the OP is proposing isn't eugenics; it's genetic engineering. That said, there is very little stopping an enterprising wizard from impregnating a hundred or more Muggle women per year, flooding the wizarding world with muggle-raised halfbloods a decade later.

He may even be able to do it ethically. "Hey, baby, how would you like your kid to have magical powers and live to 200---but you won't be able to remember how until they turn 11?" may well be an effective pickup line if one can prove that one can deliver.
