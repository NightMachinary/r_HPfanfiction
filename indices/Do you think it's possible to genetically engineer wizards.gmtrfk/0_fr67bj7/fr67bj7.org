I doubt it.

Think about animagi. Sirius can turn into a dog and he still has his magic (which he can use to turn back into a human), even though a dog isn't a magical species.

Or think about Voldemort. Even without any body at all, he was still a magical being capable of possessing people.

To me, these suggest that there's an aspect to being magical that isn't biological.

We know from JKR that you need the right genetics to become a wizard. But something being /necessary/ doesn't mean that it is /sufficient/. I suspect you need to have the right genetics *and* something else, potentially something relating to your soul.
