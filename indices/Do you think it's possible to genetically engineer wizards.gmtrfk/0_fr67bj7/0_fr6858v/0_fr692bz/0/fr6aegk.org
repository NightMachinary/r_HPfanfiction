What would decide whether you have a magical soul? Whether your parents had magical souls? How would it decide who your parents were if you were assembled in a test tube from DNA fragments of more than just two people? I think regardless how it works, there's almost certainly a workaround where you can trick it into accepting a magical donor parent as source of magic while keeping most of the DNA of the muggle parents.
