I'm assuming that a unfertilized egg cell doesn't already have a soul, and it forms sometime later, either at conception or at birth or somewhere in between. If you edit the DNA in the cell before doing the whole test tube fertilization thing, then the soul would form with the edited DNA, magical baby. Of course giving an existing person magic would be something completely different and far, far more challenging. Editing the DNA of an existing person is only possible in superhero comics, while editing the DNA of a new baby has been done already (illegally on humans once in China, and thousands of times legally on animals).
