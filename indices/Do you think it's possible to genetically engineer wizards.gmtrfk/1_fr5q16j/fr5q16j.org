Magic is from genes so yeah its possible.

My headcannon is that there are way more magicals than stated because of things like expansion charms, squib lines, the high frequency of them living past 100 and that wizards can produce more food because of magic and don't need to use as many calories to function.

I calculated about 274.8 million magical humans on Earth existed as of 1990
