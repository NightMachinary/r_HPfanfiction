Yeah, I'm not sure in a magical world where mere concepts have power (the unspeakables study things like 'love' and 'fate'), that any combination of amino-acids is the difference between being able to alter the world and not.

Indeed, it would probably be a magical feature that decides wether someone can wield magic or not.

Perhaps you can engineer something magically, but I honestly don't think that this would be worthwhile or probable.
