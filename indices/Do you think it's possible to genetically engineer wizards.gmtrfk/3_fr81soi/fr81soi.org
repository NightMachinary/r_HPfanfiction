I don't know if it is or isn't possible. But it shouldn't.

IT'S MAGIC! If you turn it into just some exaggerated sci-fi concept, then it looses its mysticism, its wonder.

That's why I don't like fics that go too technical. Consistency and proper magic syster is good and all, but not everything needs to have a concrete solution. Not everything needs to be explainable.

Remember canon: "Well of course it's happening in your head Harry. But why should that mean that it's not real?"
