Just skimmed through your fic and the most obvious turn off to me was that you didn't use capitalize the first word, names, etc nor did you format your fic properly. I believe that bad english and badly formatted fics are the biggest turn off to any reader. So it will be for the best if you rectify that.

Those lines at the end of the fic felt as if you didn't put any effort. It felt as if you were trying to convert a movie into a book without changing anything. You should try to put an average 'x' lines in a paragraph.

Can't comment for the actual content cuz I have little experience in writing fics.

Edit:- It's much better now.
