I do think this is a very interesting idea. But yes it is just plain text and you do not have capitals or anything in it. Not even for the character names at least. :( Please fix this most of all and people will read it; but also try to not have so many single lines - make them into paragraph blocks of four to six sentences. :) Yes, that will make it so much better.
