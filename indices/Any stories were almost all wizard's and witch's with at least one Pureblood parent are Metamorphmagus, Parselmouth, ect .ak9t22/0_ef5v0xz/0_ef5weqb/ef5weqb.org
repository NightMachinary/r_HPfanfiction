Parselmouth in Canon seems to have been for want of a better term a recessive gene, even then considering Salazar Slyhterin lived 1000 years ago there should have been a hell of a lot more that just Harry and Tom Riddle(Really just Riddle since in Canon harry got the abilty from the bit of Tom's Soul).

I am personal not a Fan of Muggleborns being descended from Squibs, I feel like It takes something away from the MuggleBorns instead of being something new they instead something old and dead that was revived.

I feel like the Muggleborns are descended from Squibs is the Argument a pureblood would make.
