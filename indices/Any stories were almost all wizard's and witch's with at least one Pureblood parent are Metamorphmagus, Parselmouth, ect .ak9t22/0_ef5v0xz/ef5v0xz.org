Well Tom Riddle isn't quite the same, because his maternal line were all Parselmouths. It wasn't buried by inbreeding. And Teddy had two half-blood parents, and Dora's pureblood parent did not have any abilities.

I'd say the ability probably came through Ted's line, since Muggleborns are descended from Squibs.
