The original series is fine - I still find the first 4 books to be very good, but a lot of that is nostalgia. Book 5 is fine, but 6-7 really aren't great in my opinion. I tend not to re-read past 4 when the intent strikes me.

JKR is great at a few things - conversations, setup/payoff of worldbuilding in a book (as in, in the early books she does a great job of setting up aspects of the world that are important for later in it as a payoff), a sense of wonder/expansiveness to her universe, etc. But she's really bad at some other stuff - numbers, consistency from book to book (since so much of the universe was expanded on in each book depending on the plot, it can make it hard to go back and try to justify things). Subjectively, I also did not find the romantic pairings to be particularly satisfying (they seemed rushed and forced), and the resolution to the conflict (as well as its course/scale) was not my favorite.

Fanfiction can often be similar in having strengths/weaknesses compared to the original, as long as there is a good writer doing it - but the universe is a very appealing one to imagine/change, and in my case the things I don't like about JKR's writing style and the plot is one that fanfiction often changes.

(Also, after the last year I think a lot of people are finding it hard to look at the original work the same way, as her views on certain issues (particularly her TERF views) have come out more prominently)
