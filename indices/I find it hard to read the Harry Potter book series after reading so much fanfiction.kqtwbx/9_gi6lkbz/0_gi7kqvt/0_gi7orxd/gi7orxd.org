I don't see why you'd think they're irreconcilable - what makes it incompatible between them? There's a lot of feminists that are perfectly trans-inclusive. And the argument that TERFs make about the differences growing up and privilege and the like extends to a lot of different aspects of life (race, sexuality, etc), and often ignore the heavily negative and destructive view a lot of society has towards transgender people.
