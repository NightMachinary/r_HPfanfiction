God, I read so many back then. I read most of the top stories on SIYE, The Refiner's Fire by Abraxan I remember enjoying. It also has a sequel.

This Means War by Jeconais I also enjoyed. The Seventh Horcrux by Melindaleo was good.

I think I was more tolerant back then of things like overpowered Harry.
