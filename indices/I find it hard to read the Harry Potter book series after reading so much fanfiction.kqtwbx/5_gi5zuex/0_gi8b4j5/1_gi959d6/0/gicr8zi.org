HBP was extremely hard to read. Harry - who has known Ginny for years and never shown anything beyond casual indifference - is suddenly consumed with jealousy and passion for the girl that is dating his roommate (?? did he want to have some 'guy-talk' with Dean?), while Hermione is all about the guy that publicly humiliated her at the biggest social event of their lives to that point?

Harry's inaction concerning Voldemort could be excused as psychological avoidance, but it is still pretty hard to believe, just out of a survival instinct. Young men fight wars because they're the only ones willing; Harry, rather, upon learning he is the only human able to save the world, decides quidditch and making it with his pal's little sister is more important.

They're meant to be heroic teenagers, but instead come off as socially inept grade schoolers (Ron pulling on Hermione's pigtails bc he likes her, Harry playing make-believe that if he doesn't pay attention to the Prophecy it will go away, and Hermione... well, lots of young women go for abusive guys, so that's fair).

Teenagers get a bad rep, but that's because they are impulsive and immature, not mentally handicapped.
