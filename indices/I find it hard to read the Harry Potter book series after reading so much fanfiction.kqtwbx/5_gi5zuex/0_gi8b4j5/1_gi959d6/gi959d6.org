I'm curious as to why you find JK Rowling's grasp on being a teenager unrealistic. As someone who recently reread the the series and is coming out of the teenage phase (as an 18yo) I found a lot of the characterization she made of her star teenagers, especially in books 4-6, pretty accurate to what I've seen and gone through in my life. I found Harry's angst, Ron's jealousy, even the romantic drama that was going on in their lives, to be a lot more relatable now compared to when I read the series as a young child.
