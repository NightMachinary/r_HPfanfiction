Oh this is interesting! I've been hearing similar things lately, specifically about how JKR isn't really good at YA.

And that sometimes fanfic authors have a better grasp of her characters than she does.

Can you mention a few instances where this happens? Where the characters are just off.... Or not behaving like teens?
