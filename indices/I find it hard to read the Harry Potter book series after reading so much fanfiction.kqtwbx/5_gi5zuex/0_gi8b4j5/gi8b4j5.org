I tend to think of canon as two separate stories: Books 1-3 (children's series) and 4-7 (YA series). JKR is maybe the most compelling children's author I've ever read, for all of the reasons you give. She is also one of the most unreadable YA authors I've ever had the misfortune of reading. Even Stephanie Meyers, in her fancy Mormon underoos, had a more realistic grasp on what being a teenager is like. The later HP books were near-unreadable.
