I think I am with most of the others in this thread. No fic comes close to the original series. Sure there might be some plot holes, some plots may be less interesting than those we may find in fics and some characters may act irrational on second thought. However keep in mind that JK had to do world building, character development and write a coherent plot. Most fanfic authors have the foundation laid down for them. Yet rarely had I seen a fanfic author being such a natural storyteller as JK. Her characters' conversations happen naturally and perfectly blend in with the action which is neither too fast paced nor dragged endlessly. Also I love her descriptions... you can clearly visualize her world without having to read countless pages about every little detail.
