Snape's sense of humour is dark and certainly not suited for kids but he's actually quite dry and funny.

Like:

  Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?”

  “Certainly not. You must kill me.”

  There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.

  “Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?”

  “Maybe he's ill!” said Ron hopefully. “Maybe he's left,” said Harry, “because he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again!” “Or he might have been sacked!” said Ron enthusiastically. “I mean, everyone hates him ---”

  “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.”

  "You are on probation!' shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. 'You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!'

  Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave.

The way he's characterized in fanfics, you'd think if Snape bowed sarcastically at someone, it would be out of character. In fanfic, he's made out to be the angstiest person alive who did nothing but angst. But no, he has a sense of humour, like most of the characters in the series, and hardly anyone ever portrays this part of him in fanfic. It made me realize there's no one in fandom who can actually show how characters are multi-faceted as well as Rowling does.
