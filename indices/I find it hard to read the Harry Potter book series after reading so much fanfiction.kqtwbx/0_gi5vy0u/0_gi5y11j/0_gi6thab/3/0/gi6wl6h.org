I mean....I'd argue that he's not an incel villain in canon either but that's going to be a never-ending debate.

Yes, I quite liked his and Ginny's relationship in 'The Changeling'. It felt like you were learning a few more layers of him than we were allowed in canon, while also being perfectly in character. I doubt he helped her out from true altruism (as it should be), but to elevate his own self-image. But still, he helped her, and his contributions mattered. Very well-done characterization despite the fact that he doesn't appear much in the fic.
