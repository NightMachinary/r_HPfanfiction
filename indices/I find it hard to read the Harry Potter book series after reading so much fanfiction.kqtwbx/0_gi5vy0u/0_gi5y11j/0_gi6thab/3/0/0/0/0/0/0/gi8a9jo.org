Granted, I'm a big Hinny fan so incredibly biased, but I always thought that annerb's depiction of Ginny is what made her Hinny stories among the most interesting to read for a non-Hinny fan. The character is so nuanced and interesting, especially in how she deals with a relationship with the equally-interesting and challenging Harry. I think her fics are one of the best Hinny fics for readers who aren't necessarily fans of the ship.
