As unsatisfied as I am with the last leg of almost everyone's arc, their canon personalities are so much more enjoyable and multifaceted. Fan fiction makes them so boring.

Like, to me, Dumbledore, Fleur, and Harry are funny assholes. Snape has a dry wit and McGonagall has her own moments. And even the fans of those characters ignore all that.
