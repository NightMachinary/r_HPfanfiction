Yh. Like Dumbledore is quite possibly my favourite character and well, most fanfics either portray him as an evil megalomaniac or an idiot.

Harry also, is ruined in a lot of fics because they take away his sass and mean streak that's present in his internal dialogue and even the things he says out loud in the books.
