I'm still peeved that McGonagall took 150 points from /her own House/ while only taking twenty points from the rival House for literally the exact same thing.

(It's the scene when Harry and Hermione take Norbert to the Astronomy Tower and they overhear that Draco was caught after dark and then they forget Harry's invisibility cloak and they're discovered with Neville. McGonagall takes 50 points from each of them for being out, but only took 20 from Draco.)
