I agree that JK Rowling is a significantly better than the vast majority of fanfiction.

But a lot of the things you mention like conversation, small situations and particularly flow of the story are usually more to do with having a good editor than a good author.

Honestly, I feel professional editing is what separates published works from fanfiction.
