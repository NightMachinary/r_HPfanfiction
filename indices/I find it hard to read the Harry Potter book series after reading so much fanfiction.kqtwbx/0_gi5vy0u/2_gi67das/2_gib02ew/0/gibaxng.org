Editors do a whole range of stuff. From changing the tone of a story, to rearraning the structural elements, all the way down to what I'm talking about, which is line-editing.

This is when an editor goes through, literally line by line, and makes lots of small adjustments to improve the overall story. See [[https://blog.reedsy.com/line-editing/][here]] for more details!

One common misunderstanding is people hear "editing" and they think of /copy-editing/, which is specifically fixing spelling, punctuation and grammar. Copy-editor tends to be a more junior position, and is not what people mean when they talk about the editor for a book.

Note: I say "editors change", but really editors suggest changes to authors. In general, authors always maintain creative control and final say over their own work. Although this tends to change over time - a more senior and experienced author is usually more free to ignore an editor, often to their own detriment.
