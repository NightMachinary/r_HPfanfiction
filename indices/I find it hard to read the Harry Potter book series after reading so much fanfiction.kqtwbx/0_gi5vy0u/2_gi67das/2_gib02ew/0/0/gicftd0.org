Wow! It never ceases to amaze me how something apparently simple can become so nuanced and complex when done on a professional scale.

Like "writing a story". I mean, we've all written stuff for our school work and we certainly didn't need editors (the maximum would probably be showing your work to +Hermione+ a classmate to proof-read and point out spelling errors). But not only is the art of writing so complex (there's stuff like narrative perspective, pacing and what not), now there are even people with full-time, proper, professional jobs solely dedicated to improving another person's written work. Blows my mind, honestly.
