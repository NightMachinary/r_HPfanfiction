Of course. I love it. One of my favorite stories of all time in fact. (I enjoy it more than Harry Potter actually, though not as much as Sword and Sorcery) Just as I love many other rational stories. Including their progenitor - Methods of Rationality. Though that one - as amazing and thought provoking as it is - falls a bit flat in its characters and plot. But not every story needs to excell at everything, and as the story to start a wave of rational and rationalist fanfics, I will be forever grateful.

Thank you for the suggestion though. It was exactly the kind of story I love.
