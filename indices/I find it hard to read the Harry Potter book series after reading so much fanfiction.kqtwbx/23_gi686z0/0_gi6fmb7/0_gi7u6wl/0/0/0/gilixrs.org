Hmm. Just finished reading through Swords and Sorcery. It feels like it /should/ have been dull due to Shirou being over-powered, but it stayed interesting with the Einzberns and Hagrid's pets, plus the interaction of better-understood magic with intuitively-powerful magic. And Shirou finding that no matter how many swords you have,/sometimes/ a problem just can't be fixed with a sword. (Although they can be quite versatile.) Having multiple Voldavatars promises to keep it challenging, too.

I can see why you would like White Squirrel's work.
