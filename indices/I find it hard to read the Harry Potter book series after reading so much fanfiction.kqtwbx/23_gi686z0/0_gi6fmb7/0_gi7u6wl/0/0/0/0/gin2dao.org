Not every story needs to have a physical obstacle as the main source of conflict. Shirou's main problem is research based in nature, something he's never really been good at, and the thing that most opposes that is his own personality and inability to /not/ help people in need.

Shirou is indeed vastly overpowered, but that doesn't detract from anything. One of my favorite parts of the story was when he went out into the forbidden forest to make Iris's birthday present. It's just such a Shirou thing to do. He thinks nothing of spending an entire night non-stop fighting giant spiders and talk off centaurs to forge a single (admittedly awesome) knife. Given how exhausted he was at the end of that, he really pushed himself and risked life and limb to create it, but that's just how Shirou rolls. It's so in-character for him and creates some wonderful and natural interaction between characters that otherwise never would have met.

That story is flushed with things like that. It's character driven, not plot driven, something I appreciate a lot.

I'm glad I could get another person to read it. :)
