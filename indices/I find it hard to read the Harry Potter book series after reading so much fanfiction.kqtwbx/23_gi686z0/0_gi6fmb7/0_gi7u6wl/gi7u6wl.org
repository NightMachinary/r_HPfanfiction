Sure, though I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy them as much as I did.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/#post-23006877][Sword and Sorcery]] is a Fate/Stay Night crossover which kind of supposes you already know who Shirou Emiya is and like him as a character. Decent understanding of the Fate franchise is also recomended (though not anything crazy thankfully). Though if you have all that, the characters are /amazing/, their interaction sublime, the worldbuilding amazing, and the humor spot on. I'll stand on a rooftop to proclaim this fic's greatness to anyone that would listen, and it's also the only HP fanfic I've read more times than the originals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], is purely Harry Potter, and I can probably say this one is even more directed towards me and my personality type. I know a lot of people doesn't like them, but I love this kind of story (rational, and focused on magical growth). Sure, the writing is not as good as the original, and the characters and interactions are not quite as compelling, but the worldbuilding is quite a few steps better from my perspective. This is the series I go back and forth on. Sometimes I will place it above the original, and sometimes I'll put it third on my list.

In comparison the Harry Potter books are probably the best mystery books I've read. And the characters and their interactions are just amazing. Their atmosphere and nostalgia factor is /really/ hard to beat, and they have very few flaws. Less than either of the fics above even, so I'd probably say the canon story is 'objectively' the best (if such a thing can even be applied to literature), but the two fics above is better aimed at my personal tastes so I prefer them.

Fanfiction also has the advantage of forgoing a lot of setup and investment compared to an original story, so the competition is not entirely fair.

So... yeah. Anything else you wanted to know?
