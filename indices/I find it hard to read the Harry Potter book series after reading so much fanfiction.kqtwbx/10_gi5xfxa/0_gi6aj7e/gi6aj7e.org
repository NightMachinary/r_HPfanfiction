The reverse is equally bad. No, Snape, Riddle and the Malfoys aren't misunderstood good people. No, a woman who would slut shame a 15 year old girl based on a gossip article written by a "journalist" she called a hack a few months ago and tried to break her engaged son up is not a good person. No, a teacher who did absolutely nothing about most of the problems her charges faced isn't a good teacher, let alone honorary family.
