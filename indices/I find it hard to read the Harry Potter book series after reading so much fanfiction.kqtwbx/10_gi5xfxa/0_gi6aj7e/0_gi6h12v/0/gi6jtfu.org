We will have to disagree on that point. The whole thing with Rita, in my opinion, makes it absolutely clear what kind of person she is. Not only her hypocrisy (she was mortally offended when Rita went after Arthur, but a schoolgirl is fair game?) and prior acknowledgement that Rita was a hack, but also the fact that she didn't apologise until Harry put her on the spot, much like a 4-year-old who only says sorry because his parents make him do it.

And the business with Bill, Fleur and Tonks is not the mark of a good person. The best I could agree there would be "well meant is the opposite of well done". And actions matter, not motivations.
