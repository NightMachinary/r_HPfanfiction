You know the saying "Let him who had not sinned cast the first stone."

I think Molly is a good woman towards her family and towards Harry, whom she sees like a son. At that time she only had interacted with Hermione for like a week. I like her like that because she's more relatable. In real life we're good and we care about our families and friends but we tend to not care about those that do not affect us and treat with suspicion or be mean to those whom we perceive as a threat to us or to our loved ones.

You have the hindsight so it's easy for you to say that Molly was in the wrong, but Molly only relied on what information she had from the papers.
