And? You don't have to be close to someone to not believe ridiculous lies about them. I'm not saying I think Molly is a bad person, to be clear, but that's nowhere near an acceptable excuse. She knew Rita was a hack, she knew her son and his best friend were very close to Hermione, but she still believed the malicious lies printed by said hack without any attempt to ask her son about it.
