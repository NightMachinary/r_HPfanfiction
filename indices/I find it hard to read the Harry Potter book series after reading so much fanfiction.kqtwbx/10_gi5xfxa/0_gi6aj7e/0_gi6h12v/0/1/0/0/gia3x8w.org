No one seemed to remember Rita was a hack until they were the victims of her writing. In fact people believed her interview in OotP more than Harry's attempts at telling them Voldemort is back. The excerpts from her "The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore" had not only cast doubts on Dumbledore's intentions in Harry's eyes but they also destroyed his reputation for many real world fans considering Dumbledore bashing is quite a popular trope in fanfics.

  I'm not saying I think Molly is a bad person

The person whom I responded implied they believe so.

Anyways, all my ramblings aside, we know Hermione and we feel bad for her, but from the information Molly had at the time, she seemed like an attention hungry starlet and treated her with the same contempt that most people treat, say, the Kardashians.
