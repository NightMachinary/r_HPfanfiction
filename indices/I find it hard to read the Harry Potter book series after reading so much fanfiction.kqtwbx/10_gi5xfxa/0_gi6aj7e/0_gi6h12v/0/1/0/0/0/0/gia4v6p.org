Parents questioning the quality of the people their children hang out with is a problem most people had to deal with. I agree Molly was in the wrong but I don't find that as an unforgivable mistake which should warrant her bashing. Actually the whole thing is only mentioned in two small paragraphs and then never brought up again, with Hermione ending up in quite good relationship with Molly.
