I suppose it depends on what fanfic I'm comparing it to.

If its the 99% of fanfics out there where Harry is one-dimensional character; good at everything he does, going around giving verbal smackdowns to everyone, Lord Hadrian of Too-Many-Houses, then quite frankly the books feel like I've finally reached the promised land after wading through the muck.

There is that 1% however that I think I probably enjoy more then the books. All the characters have great development, and have their strengths and flaws; both "good" and "bad" guys alike. Fantastic world building. Etc.
