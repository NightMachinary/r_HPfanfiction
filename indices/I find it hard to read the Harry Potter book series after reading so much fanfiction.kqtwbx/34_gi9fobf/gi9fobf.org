I can still separate them quite easy even though I've never officially completed the whole series whether it be books or movies. I do know a lot of things that happened during the timeline for the last 3. But I do prefer fanfiction in most cases because they have more world building throughout the series and they make Harry more relatable by making him an actual teenage boy dealing with hormones and stuff like that. I get that it was geared towards kids but kids grow up too. Growing up I had plenty of guy friends and they were gross sometimes, would it have killed her to create that in some aspect. Teenagers are gross and inappropriate sometimes, it being in the 90s doesn't change that in the slightest.
