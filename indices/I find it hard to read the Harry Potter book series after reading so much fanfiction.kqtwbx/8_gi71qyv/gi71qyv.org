It's always strange to go back to canon, but only because it's almost like having the famous Harry Potter become just Harry again.

Plus, in canon he's an insert for the audience, in fanfic he's most commonly an insert for the author.

The thing about fanfic is that it typically has a short half life- it feels dated very quickly as trends change. It depends on the niche the author falls into and it can either over-embroider canon to the point it stands on its own, or just use it as window dressing.

Most characters start to be written according to a rubric created by whatever is popular. Fan!Harry is as much a product of every fanfic an author has ever read, as much as he is a product of canon.

You have to respect what JKR achieved with Harry Potter- in the conceiving, writing and the publishing of it, even as you also have to respect fanfic authors and their achievements.

(The respect does not have to be wholehearted and universal. I personally feel that Harry Potter is a very late 90s early 00s thing and doesn't fit as well anymore because the world changed. Also, the books were written with children in mind, and that is reflected in the plot, wherein everyone is incompetent.)
