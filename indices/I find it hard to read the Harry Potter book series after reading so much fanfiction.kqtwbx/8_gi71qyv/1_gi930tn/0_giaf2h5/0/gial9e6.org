Thanks for the detailed reply! Was really interesting to read through.

Yes, I could see even as a child that many characters provided a sharp satire for public figure stereotypes, including journalists.

As for the plot - there are a lot of convolutions that happens in the novels, primarily the ones that keep Harry alive till the end and keep him on a level footing with Voldemort. The series fails there.

Out of curiosity, is there a good place where the plot fixes over the years have been compiled?
