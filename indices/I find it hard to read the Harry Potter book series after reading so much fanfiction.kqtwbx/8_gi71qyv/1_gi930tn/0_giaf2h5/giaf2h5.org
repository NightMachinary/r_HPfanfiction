Perhaps that's unfair. When I try to bear in mind that it's set in the early 90s- which was a very different time. 1997 and the Labour victory changed a LOT of things in the UK. It's not so much that everyone is incompetent, as that a goodly portion of characters are semi-satirical versions of ineffective archetypes, and the rest are serving the plot as much as anything else.

The plot must happen, so the characters must behave in such a way as to make Harry able to discover the Philosopher's stone and be able to defeat the obstacles to getting it. They may not be sensible/robust protections, but they serve the plot.

The plot must happen, so nobody who was aware of the opening of the Chamber of Secrets the first time was able to use that experience to help- aside from wondering how Voldemort did it, did Dumbledore take any actions which suggested he was treating this as Voldemort infiltrating the school?

Etc, etc. There is a general lack of concern for the safety, which, once again tracks with the early 90s setting. There's the lack of decisive action from any adult not on Voldemort's side.

I suppose I fall victim to the same thing as OP- I've read so many fix it fics that a)canon is cliche, b) when you aren't genre blind, like the characters have to be, then there are so many obvious courses of action, c) attitudes have changed massively over 20 years and I forget that, d) I want to help and power up Harry rather than creating an uneven conflict.
