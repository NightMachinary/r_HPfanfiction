  Some fanfiction I've read had brilliant character development, romance, magic building and even seemed more realistic - describing war and relationships objectively perhaps better than Rowling ever did

"Changeling" did this. Ginny's experience during the year of the Deathly Hallows and her subsequent efforts to deal with her trauma was excellent writing, and the story also showed Slytherin students in a much more positive light than the one-dimensional portrayal in the canon books. After all, if Slytherin House was just a hatchery for future death eaters, why was it allowed to remain at Hogwarts?
