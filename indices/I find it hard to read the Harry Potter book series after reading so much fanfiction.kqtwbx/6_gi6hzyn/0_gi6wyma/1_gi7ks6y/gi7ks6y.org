I'll have to check this one out, thanks for recommendation!

My most favourite war/after war portrayals (and in my opinion also beautifully written) are The Nietzsche Classes by Beringae and The Fallout by everythursday. It's been a long time since I read them though, hopefully they aren't just blown out of proportions in my mind haha. Must do a reread soon.
