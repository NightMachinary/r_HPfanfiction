Annerb is one of the very, very few writers who is on a publishable level. But she's also heavily scaffolding off the canon plot, not writing an original one. Her sequels are noticeably weaker for the lack of that scaffolding.

Even her short stories, which are some of the best HP fanfictions out there, aren't very original in terms of plots. They are cliche romances (amnesia, forced to share a bed, etc). They are some of the best written versions of those cliches in the fanfiction world, but there is a pretty noticeable lack of originality that I think makes real comparison to JKR's writing impossible.
