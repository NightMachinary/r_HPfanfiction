  But she's also heavily scaffolding off the canon plot, not writing an original one. Her sequels are noticeably weaker for the lack of that scaffolding

I'm ok with working off the canon plot. Rowling never bothered to write what happened between the Battle of Hogwarts and "19 years later", and in my opinion she missed a huge opportunity. The story of what happened after and how the wizarding world adapted and recovered would have been classic, so someone had to do it.
