Some fanfiction I've read had brilliant character development, romance, magic building and even seemed more realistic - describing war and relationships objectively perhaps better than Rowling ever did. I adore them and it blows my mind every time that someone was able to write such a gem, often among working/studying etc.

But canon, ahh. Canon is reading the books over and over with flashlight under the duvet as 13 year old. It's a world someone managed to build, one I've often ran into during harsh times or simply for the fun of it. A world I let myself sink into when sleep eludes me, one I couldn't possibly imagine living without getting to know. That magic I felt upon first reading those books lingers, and I suspect it's the reason why reading fanfiction is so enjoyable - there are plenty brilliant books out there and yet I usually prefer to seek comfort of Hogwarts and Diagon alley.

So yeah, I love fanfiction, but almost every year around Christmas I still pick up one of my plenty canon copies.
