I had this issue a ways back but I started rereading every ~4 months and I feel like I have a sense of balance back.

For some reason, having read so much fanfiction has gotten me way more invested in the canon characters than I used to be. I loved the books when I first read them, but my anger at Draco when he insults Harry after Cedric's death makes me want to throw things now, whereas I barely remembered that happening the first time. When Harry thinks he's all alone and then Hermione brings him toast in GoF I go "aww", where at first I rushed through that because I wanted to know the mystery of why Harry is in the tournament / get to what the tournament is like. I have to put the book down for a while when Sirius dies, and I never have that experience with any other media.

I guess there's this feeling that in fanfiction I'm immersed in a lot of what if's, but canon is the "real people", so everything hits that much harder.
