Not trying to fight back against the guy that murdered your parents and was about to kill all of your friends is pretty much the definition of weak, pathetic and stupid.

JKR started the series as a pretty standard 'hero's journey', then abandoned that in book 6 when Harry and Hermione developed a ginger fetish, then dropped a deux ex machina in the form of the Deathly Hallows in an attempt to fix her mistake, and even THEN she still couldn't have Harry fire a lethal spell at the man that had brutally murdered his entire family/pseudo-family. I think the only reason I read HP fanfiction is to try and bleach my brain of how genuinely cowardly and unfeeling canon-Harry is.
