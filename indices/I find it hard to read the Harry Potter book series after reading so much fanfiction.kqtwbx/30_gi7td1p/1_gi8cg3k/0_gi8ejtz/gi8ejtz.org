Harry does fight back: the duel in the graveyard, the fight at the Ministry, and the quest for the Horcruxes are three good examples of many. I'll agree that he likely doesn't drive enough of the plot events with his own choices, but he's a kid for most of the books. With his childhood, it's a wonder that he turned out as well as he did. I understand some of your frustration, but not all of it. Harry Potter wouldn't have the popularity it does with a terrible protagonist.

And “unfeeling” really doesn't make sense. Just look at the graveyard duel, or the fifth book, or Harry's frustrations with Dumbledore in the seventh, or how much he cares about everyone who's fighting in the last battle. I really don't understand your problem with this part of his character.
