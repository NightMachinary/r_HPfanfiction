One of the things I appreciated with Harry in the books is how eventually, a lot of the novelty of being magical wears off and he becomes like any other kid dreading writing feet of parchment on some goblin rebellion. People forget how quickly we become accustomed to our surroundings. I remember doing a trip of Europe where I saw a ton of Van Gogh and other legendary painters. At first, I was continually in awe, but by the end, I was pretty sick of yet another Monet.
