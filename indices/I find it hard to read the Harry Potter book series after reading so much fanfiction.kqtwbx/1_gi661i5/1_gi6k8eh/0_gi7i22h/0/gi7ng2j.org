  You refer to the "audience surrogate" as if it's an insult to the character, but it's the lens that allows us as the audience to watch as a person with roughly similar experiences or expectations of the world as our own experiences and learns about the fantastic or magical new rules of reality that they're suddenly facing. It's why we generally find those characters so engaging, because we identify with them as we both learn about the world around them.

I did not refer to it as an insult to the character - I referred to it as an explanation for why Harry becomes the self-insert so readily.

  Canon Harry isn't passive or lazy, he's fulfilling another archetype- the reluctant hero. He's a child who's entire life that he can remember has been abuse and neglect at the hands of his caregiver, and when he finally gets a glimmer of hope of "normalcy" and happiness, he quickly finds himself faced with a megalomaniac who is determined to murder him, and an impending civil war and genocide that hinges entirely on whether or not he can kill the megalomaniac first. All canon Harry wants to do is be a child and learn magic, but there's the crushing weight of needing to commit murder in order to prevent the murders of hundreds to thousands of muggleborns on him, and he learns this when he's fifteen, right around the time he suffers an immensely tragic personal loss without time to grieve.

Canon Harry is pretty passive on a lot of stuff, in my opinion. Yes, it's the reluctant hero, but at the end of book 4 he's confronted Voldemort 3 times (4 if we count when he was a baby) and has seen him come back to life. By that point, it's pretty obvious that he doesn't have a choice to sit out of it, and that Dumbledore has no real chance/ability to stop Harry from being in the thick of things.

The training to the DA is fine, but it's not that much on the whole, and doesn't really seem (to me) like Harry is putting that much energy into it. Hence why fanfiction that involves him working harder/more diligently is a popular one for many people. It doesn't make any approach wrong, from a storytelling perspective - but canon's approach isn't the only way to take it, and people have different tastes/preferences.
