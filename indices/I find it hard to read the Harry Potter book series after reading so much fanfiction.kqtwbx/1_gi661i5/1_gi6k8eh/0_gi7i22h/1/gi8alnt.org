When I was 16 years old - Harry's age in HBP - I was working 10pm-6am shifts at a diner, taking AP classes during the day at school, and playing on an indoor soccer team in the evenings.

Harry Potter, who knows that the whole world is depending on him to beat Wizard-Hitler, spends his time trying to get in Ginny's pants, consoling Ron/Hermione over their abusive quasi-relationship, and playing quidditch.

Just imagine if in 1938 someone in Germany was told "Hey, you're the only one that can save a whole race of people from genocide" and they were like "Yea, yea, that's pretty important, but my batting average has really gone up this year and I think I might be able to make it to the pros!"

Fuck canon Harry. JKR was a great children's author, but there are dozens (hundreds?) of fanfics that make for way better YA novels than OOTP/HBP/DH do.
