Oh I've heard this precise sentiment from a few other people, that JK Rowling is a good children's author, but not a YA author.

Curiously, why do you say so? And what are some of the best fanfictions that you'd recommend?

And trying my luck here, but I am looking for that one fan fiction that was released just around the time that Deathly Hallows was released - and many people think it is better than Rowling's own novel. Do you know which one that is?
