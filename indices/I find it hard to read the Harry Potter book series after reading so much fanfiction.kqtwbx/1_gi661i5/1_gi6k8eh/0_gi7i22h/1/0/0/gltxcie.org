I think Harry's arc is unsatisfying because he follows the Hero's Journey of development, but his development sort of... looses the plot? Or maybe sputters? The important plot points that would define his character (besides Sirius) just happened around him, so it never felt like he developed consistently. And I feel like it wasn't intentional, like JKR meant to but didn't achieve a well-rounded Harry, or perhaps a good balance between your average teenager angst and a compelling plotty protagonist for a book. Like his backstory as an abuse victim is almost too subtle at times: Having it be reduced to the plot point for why Harry accepts death can demean the trauma of living people. If it had been acknowledged or grappled with then I'd be satisfied with another example of Harry's compassion which would reinforce some literary theme. Buuuut...

Maybe I've forgotten too much of the books...
