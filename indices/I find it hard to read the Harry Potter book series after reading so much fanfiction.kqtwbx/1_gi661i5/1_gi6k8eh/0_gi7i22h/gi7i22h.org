The everyman surrogate exists in most fiction where the world is strange enough to need one. Watson in the original iteration of Sherlock Holmes, Luke Skywalker, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, Dorothy in /Wizard of Oz/, Bella Swan in Twilight, Peter Parker during his transition into Spiderman...

You refer to the "audience surrogate" as if it's an insult to the character, but it's the lens that allows us as the audience to watch as a person with roughly similar experiences or expectations of the world as our own experiences and learns about the fantastic or magical new rules of reality that they're suddenly facing. It's why we generally find those characters so engaging, because we identify with them as we both learn about the world around them.

Canon Harry isn't passive or lazy, he's fulfilling another archetype- the reluctant hero. He's a child who's entire life that he can remember has been abuse and neglect at the hands of his caregiver, and when he finally gets a glimmer of hope of "normalcy" and happiness, he quickly finds himself faced with a megalomaniac who is determined to murder him, and an impending civil war and /genocide/ that hinges entirely on whether or not he can kill the megalomaniac first. All canon Harry wants to do is be a child and learn magic, but there's the crushing weight of needing to commit murder in order to prevent the murders of hundreds to thousands of muggleborns on him, and he learns this /when he's fifteen/, right around the time he suffers an immensely tragic personal loss without time to grieve.

When I was fifteen, I was concerned about passing math, and getting my driving learner's permit, and exams. I can't imagine facing what he was without trying to hide from it. From my perspective it's totally understandable.

And as far as not training harder, in fifth year, even before he knew all this, he /was/ training. He was teaching defense spells to the DA and practicing them, and the one bit of training he was assigned by his mentor ended up turning into repeated assaults by a teacher who despised him. In sixth year, the only training he was assigned by Dumbledore was looking at old memories, this was on top of having to manage classes and his grief for Sirius.

His training harder makes sense from a logical perspective, but in the logic of the books, I think up until the moment Dumbledore was cursed, it was expected that Dumbledore would do most of the heavy fighting. Harry didn't know that the onus of the fight was on his shoulders until Dumbledore died, and then spent most of the next eleven months hiding in the woods trying not to starve or be found using a wand that he couldn't properly use.
