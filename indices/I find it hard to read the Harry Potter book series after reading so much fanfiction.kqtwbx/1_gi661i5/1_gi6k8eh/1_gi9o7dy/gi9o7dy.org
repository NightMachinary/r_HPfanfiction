  A Harry that trains harder in preparation for Voldemort is something that I think people jump to a lot, because it makes a lot of sense.

I get this mindset but I'd argue it actually does make sense. Voldemort and Dumbledore are very clearly portrayed as being above and beyond anyone else in the series in terms of pure magical power and talent. They're S tier. Harry is like at best B tier. No amount of training is gonna make him be able hold his own toe to toe in a duel against Voldemort. Thats not the point. I see so many fics where they have Harry get mad that Dumbledore is wasting his time with useless memories instead of training him in advanced defensive magic, as if half a dozen training sessions would miraculously put him on Voldemort's level lmao. Remember Voldemort singlehandedly fended of not 1, not 2, but /3/ of the series' best wizards simultaneously and it wasn't like he was even struggling that much. People who expected Harry to take him down with brute force if only he'd trained more over the years are idiots. It was never gonna happen, never a realistic option
