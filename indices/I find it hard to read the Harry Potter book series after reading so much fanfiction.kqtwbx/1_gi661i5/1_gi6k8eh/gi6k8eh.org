  He is none of those things. I'm sure y'all were already in university and could deadlift 200kgs by the time you were 11. However, at the start of the books, Harry is an 11-year-old child who has led an abusive life and is thrown into an unknown situation. The problem with Harry in fanfiction is that he is too often nothing more than a self-insert.

Harry in canon is meant to be a self-insert of sorts - or at the least an audience surrogate, so I can understand why people gravitated towards him in that role (even if I dislike the lazy super!Harry aspects in a lot of fanfiction). But it doesn't help that in canon he's /literally/ the chosen one ><

I think there is a real complaint that canon Harry is too passive, and not focused enough on, well, preparing for his destiny. We see that he can get results /if/ he is focused enough (in Goblet of Fire, he prepares pretty assiduously for the third task), and that he's talented in Defense - but it doesn't really go further than that. A Harry that trains harder in preparation for Voldemort is something that I think people jump to a lot, because it makes a lot of sense.
