I want to add in linkffn(12924292) , which is an incredible fic that was started in February of 2018, and still being updated once every few weeks. It's very well written, there are 259 chapters so far, and unlike lots of crappy fics, the chapter are a good length. It's only been roughly 3 years, and every character Breanie (the author) has used has (IMO) stayed true to who they were in canon, and has molded realistically to the events she's outlined. Not to mention I've not found a single plot hole, and the story actually makes sense.

Edit: canon has roughly 1084k words, while this fic has around 2227k words, so at this point the fic is over twice as long as the entire series. It is a /very/ good fan fic.
