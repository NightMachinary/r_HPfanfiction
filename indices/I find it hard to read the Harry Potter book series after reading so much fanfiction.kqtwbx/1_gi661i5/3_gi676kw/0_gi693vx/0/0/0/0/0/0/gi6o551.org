I think the closest we can get to it in the US is things like studies - like [[https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2017/07/17/study-finds-notable-increase-grades-high-schools-nationally][this writeup from 2017]] that says 47% of high school students had an A average. But different schools will have different standards.
