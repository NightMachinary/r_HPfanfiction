Yeah, that's basically how GCSE's were graded (A* instead of A+, E instead of F, but similar point scale and meaning of each). That said, she'd really be drawing on British grading systems in the 70s or 90s, which I have even less familiarity with.

OWLs and NEWTs are pretty clearly analogous by the GCSE O-level and A-level examinations
