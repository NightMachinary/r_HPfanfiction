I think it probably makes sense to look at it from the context of British grades - but I don't know how those distributions look like.

The reason I say that is because every country grades a little differently - the French system (that does out of 20) is not at all comparable to the American one if you were to simply adjust it to a 100 point scale, because an 18/20 (90%) is much much harder to get than a high B (7 point scale) or A (10 point scale) - it's probably comparable to an A+, and a perfect score can often be impossible depending on your teacher.

Since we don't get a good grade distribution from Hogwarts (far too small a sample size, and very inconsistent when getting told the past grades of former students) I'd expect the British grading system to give some indication of what to expect (since JKR did draw a lot from Britain, obviously)
