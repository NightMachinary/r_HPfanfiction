  I don't think he's a bad student, think he and Ron are just average (students). He got mostly 'E's on his OWLS, the equivalent of a B. Granted that measures taking a test but you can't get so many Es on these tests without some study. He could be like Fred and George, who are clearly very intelligent yet only got 3 OWLs each bc they don't care.
