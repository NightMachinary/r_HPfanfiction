  Harry is so weak and pathetic and stupid
#+end_quote

He is none of those things. I'm sure y'all were already in university and could deadlift 200kgs by the time you were 11. However, at the start of the books, Harry is an 11-year-old *child* who has led an abusive life and is thrown into an unknown situation. The problem with Harry in fanfiction is that he is too often nothing more than a self-insert.

And yes, I still enjoy re-reading canon from time to time. Like I've said before there is a certain innocence to it. While I don't mind sex and violence they can be very easily overdone and lose their shock value. Also, canon was written over a period of 10 years and has been through professional editing. As much as I love fanfiction it is just a hobby for people who still have to go to school and/ or work. As such it will never be as finished and polished as canon.
