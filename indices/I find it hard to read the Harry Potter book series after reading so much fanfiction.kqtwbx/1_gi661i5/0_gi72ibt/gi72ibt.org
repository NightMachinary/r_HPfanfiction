The thing is, until the GoF, he is a great character. Proactive, curious, excited and exciting. From the beginning of GoF and till the end, he's nothing but a sounding boarx for the plot. I recently listened to the whole series and at the end of first book, my love for the series was renewed with vigor. At the end of three, I was rearing to start the fourth. At the end of fifth, I was treating it as an unending task. Not because of the angst or anyrhing2. But because, nothing ever happened because Harry made it happen. Everything happrnrd3 to him. Nothing he discovered was through hard work or quick mind. It was all happenstance. After third book, the series stops being adventure books and become dull drama.

P.S: Still miles ahead of any fanfiction I've ever read. Even most geniune fictions. But comperatively, first three are hands down the best part of the series
