I raise a glass to the first trilogy. Chamber of Secrets will always be my favorite because OF THE MOFO BASILISK AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS! Talk about a Chekov's gun for the later books, I don't understand how we never returned to the Chamber. Like, Dumbledore's Army could have used it as a double insult to Voldemort.
