Agreed! Not so much because hes weak or pathetic in the original novels, but because the wizarding world has expanded soooo widely, i love finding stories about something thats not touched on in the books. And i have found some AMAZING fanfics. The authors of some of these are just phenomenal. Ive probably got a few hundred fanfics saved on multiple websites, it makes it hard to bring my reading back to just 7 books and 7 years
