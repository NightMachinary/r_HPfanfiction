I disagree about harry being weak and stupid. Remember, he's a child while he has to deal with immense death, grief, and trauma.

I do think though that some fan fics have spoiled me to return. I just read Running on Air and I will never ever look at harry and draco the same again but I LOVED that fic with all my heart. Probably one of the best things ive ever read period.
