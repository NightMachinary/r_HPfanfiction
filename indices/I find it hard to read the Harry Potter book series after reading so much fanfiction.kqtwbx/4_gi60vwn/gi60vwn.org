A bit of both, personally. I enjoyed the writing, but not the plot. Rowling has this great ability to make a shallow facade of a world seem magical and interesting, even if there's very little worldbuilding and detail beneath the surface (and what is there is... contentious, to say the least).

Her technical writing and storytelling ability is definitely appealing, but the plots and concepts of fanfic are often more interesting to me. Not always, I admit, but often.
