When I look back on it, Harry Potter canon is pretty well-written. But I feel it's aimed for younger readers, although there's no problem with everyone reading it. Some fanfics are atrocious though and some are exceptionally well-written. Like Murkeybluematter's Pureblood Pretense or A Marauder's plan are written so well that I love them more than canon because the characters are developed so well. I haven't read Harry Potter canon in almost 6 years.... so I guess I have the same problem, though it's not because Harry is weak or pathetic.
