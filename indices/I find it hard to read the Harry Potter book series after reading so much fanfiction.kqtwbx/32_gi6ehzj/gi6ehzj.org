I'm having that issue currently, but luckily, I'm writing a time travel fanfic where pretty much almost everything is book canon until some parts of the Epilogue, so I'm going to have to read them again!

Also, I just ordered about fifty bucks worth of HP books off of eBay and three of them are books with different covers for Prisoner of Azkaban and I got them because they were pretty. It would be kinda stupid to not read them after buying them, lol.
