Short answer, no.

Longer answer, I do find it harder to read the books than I did initially though it's no fault of fanfiction. While I do have fanfics I prefer to canon (apparently a rarity here), really the issue is that I've learned more about world building, character development, and story telling. This combined with other things I've learned makes it so I do have more issues (I already had some in my initial read through) now and some of them do genuinely really bother me. My biggest issues are really with her Character development, and how she treats abuse (her inability to have a backstory that actually does characters justice(only Snape comes out a better character from backstories), literally everything about Voldemort, how Harry's abuse seemed closer to flavour than an actual thing). I will acknowledge she's very good at surface world building which is why there is so much fanfiction. All that being said, this problem isn't exclusive to Harry Potter for me. Whenever I consume media I have that voice in back of my mind analyzing it and if something weird happens it comes out in force wondering why something was done the way it was.
