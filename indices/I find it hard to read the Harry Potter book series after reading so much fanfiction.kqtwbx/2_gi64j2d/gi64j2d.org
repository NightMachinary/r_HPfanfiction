I can see where you're coming from. I like that fanfic can sharpen things in canon you might not have consciously picked up on (for example, fanfics show/tell more obviously the manipulative side of Dumbledore), that you can see perspectives of other characters besides Harry, and you can show them as younger kids or older. The characters can curse and go further than kissing.

Appreciate Jo's careful planning and her unique humor in the books, especially when Harry is being sassy.
