So I have read the books about 100 times. Right now I am listening to them via audiobook for the first time. I've also been reading FanFics and while there are some good ones, I find them harder to read than the real books. There are talented people but Rowling is just a damn good story teller. The books almost never feel like they are forcing something whereas fics seem to a lot.
