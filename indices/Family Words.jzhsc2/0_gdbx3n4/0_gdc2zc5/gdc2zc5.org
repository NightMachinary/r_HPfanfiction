So I'd call myself something of an armchair herald, most of my knowledge is in Scots Heraldic law (Heraldry in Scotland by J.H. Stevenson, and ‘Scots Heraldry' by Sir Thomas Innes of Learney).What you say about the relative positions of the motto scrolls is correct. There is a whole art form to designing a motto, and some armigers (People who have a grant of arms) will have two mottoes. The one displayed above the crest (Decorative ensemble affixed to the helm), this is usually a short ‘sluagh-ghairm', Gàidhlig for ‘army/ host/ war'-‘cry' and anglicised as ‘slogan'. Examples include: ‘In Defens' Scots for ‘In Defence' or mine own ‘Gu a chrìoch' Gàidhlig for ‘Until it is finished' or ‘Until the end'.

If a second motto appears it will be longer and placed beneath the achievement. Example being ‘Nemo me impune lacessit' Latin for ‘No one provokes me with impunity'

In Scots Law and the Court of the Lord Lyon, the motto is a legally protected element of the armorial achievement, and as such can only be changed with a new matriculation of arms, which is not typical. Multiple armigers may bear the same motto or the same crest individually but not both.

No such restriction exists for the College of Arms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the motto is not a specified part of the grant of arms, and so mottoes may freely change with the Armiger who bears the grant.

Traditionally, a language of vogue for mottoes was Latin, in anglophone areas of the UK. In Scotland, a fair amount of armigers either use Gàidhlig or Latin, though the current consensus is to use a language that you actually understand and speak, so now there are mottoes in Gàidhlig, Latin, English, Irish, Welsh, French and Scots.

The motto is also typically emblazoned on a pennon, guidon or standard, if you meet the qualifications for being granted one (Either as an armiger in England or anywhere with College of Arms grant, or in Scotland as someone who would command a following historically, eg. Clan Chief or Nobility)

Addition: typically the motto is supposed to tell you something about the armiger, or something about the values they stand for. Its unusual to see actual mottoes that are just common latin proverbs.
