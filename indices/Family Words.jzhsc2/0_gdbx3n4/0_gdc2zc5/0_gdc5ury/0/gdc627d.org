Guilty as charged. Feels like a bit of a pointless hobby because very few people actually care these days, so when people ask I tend to go far overboard. As to some choice ideas for mottoes for pureblood families,

Ollivander: ‘The Wand chooses the Wizard'. Potter: ‘Hallowed be our friend' inherited from Peverell. MacMillan already has a motto as Clan MacMillan, whether you'd want to follow the rules and copy it for the Wizarding MacMillans is up to you: ‘Miseris succerrere disco' ‘I learn succour the unfortunate'. Fitting as MacMillan rendered as MacMhaol-Iain means ‘Son of the one who bore the Tonsure of St. John'.

Sometimes elements of heraldry are used to create a pun of the armiger's name, known as canting, so have fun with that.
