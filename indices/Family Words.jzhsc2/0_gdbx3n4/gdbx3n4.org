Those actually occur in real life, not just Game of Thrones. I'm not overly familiar with the books or show, but I know there are jokes about him basically just plagiarising real life for a lot of his worldbuilding and backstory - this is one of those occasions.

They're called 'Heraldry Mottos' and a lot of older families do have them - they were most often used by individuals and specific titles though, so they really were all over the place, which lead to a truly obnoxious level of complexity overall. Generally, if you look at the crest or coat of arms of any UK family old enough or powerful enough or prominent enough to have one, they'll have some words written on somewhere like "Strength in God" or "Nobility in Adversity" or something like that. Scots tend to have theirs above, English tend to have theirs below - I can't remember the reason why. If you check 'Fleurdelis.com', they have a big list of real world examples of mottos and you might find some ideas there.

EDIT - in terms of actually making one up yourself, it's a little difficult since there isn't really as strict a ruleset for mottos as there is for heraldry symbols. If you wanna make a proper Heraldric Crest, you technically have to have reasoning and originality for everything on it in order to get it officially registered, but I can't find anything specific on what rules a motto might have to obey. I'd say just to remember that they're usually either a battle cry or a slogan, so keep in mind that it either has to inspire people going into battle or convey an image of your family to your rivals or opponents.
