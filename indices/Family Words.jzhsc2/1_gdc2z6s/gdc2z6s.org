There is at least one example of it in canon - namely, House Black, with its motto being "Toujours Pur" (Always Pure).

The Potters also have "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" on their tombstone, and some fanfic writers believe these words to be their motto, but I'm not sure about it. In any case, the phrase originates from the Bible (Corinthians 15:26 to be precise).

Still, I think that old pureblood families having mottos (likely in French or Latin) is absolutely canon-compatible. Go for it.

P.S. The Malfoys supposedly have “Sanctimonia Vincet Semper” (Purity Will Always Conquer) as their motto, but I'm not sure if it was in the books.
