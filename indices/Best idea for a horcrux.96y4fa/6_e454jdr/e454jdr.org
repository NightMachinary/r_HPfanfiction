I would think that the entire concept of a Horcrux defies any attempt to make it impossible to find. You are creating an abomination of the natural order by tearing off a piece of your immortal soul. It's /supposed/ to be something significant and personal. It's /supposed/ to be something easily tied to you. That's the natural price of the /freaking Black Magic/ that you performed to escape Death itself. Without this it's just a cheap bullshit +1 life mcguffin that any dark witch or wizard can make as they please.

So, the best idea for a Horcrux is what is most personal to you, the creator. And to hell with the difficulties in hiding it.
