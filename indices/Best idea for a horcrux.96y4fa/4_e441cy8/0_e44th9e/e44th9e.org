this is what i was thinking. The Mona Lisa, The David, US Declaration of Independence, Liberty Bell, any Holy relic held in a cathedral or even in the Vatican. Or if you were set on an animal, how about a tortoise, or shark in a zoo/aquarium.

Honestly anything in a decent museum is going to be well preserved and as a witch or wizard it would be pretty simple to borrow it, take it with you to a murder and return it before anyone notices it missing.
