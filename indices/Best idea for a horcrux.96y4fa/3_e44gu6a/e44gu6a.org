Well if you have a way to regain your body without the use of your Horcrux, sending it in a place beings (even magicals) will have high difficulties to get like space or inside a volcano (or a star to mix the two ideas) wouldn't be such a bad idea if indeed it cannot be destroyed by other means than Fiendfyre and Basilisk Venom. Having on it a Fidelius (either the place, the object or both) and killing the Secret Keeper without letting him telling anyone or being the keeper yourself wouldn't hurt.

If you need it to resurrect well you better put it in a place hard to reach on earth but attainable if following a set of instructions. As for the location well either a place magicals wouldn't think of (muggle world) or just hidden in plain sight and even better in something that is already guarded by the actual government (might be risky though).

If you could put it in an animal well Phoenix can't be destroyed apparently (except if you consider it's rebirth as a destruction of the body...) so you would more or less have a indestructible Horcrux even more indestructible. Add to it that you would surely have control of the bird you could avoid people by flashing wherever you want and hiding during your burning days.

As far as we know Dementors are also indestructible so it could be an idea though maybe putting a part of your soul in a Dementor might have adverse effects.
