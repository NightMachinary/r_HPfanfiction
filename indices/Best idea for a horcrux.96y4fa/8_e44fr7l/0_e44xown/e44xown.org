People assume Horcrux are invulnerable to all damage, minus the 2-3 very specific counters. So throwing your soul into somewhere a wizard won't likely find it is better security than hiding it in an easy tofind place with the best protections.

Further they assume your soul can float around and possess animals/Quirrel without them needing to come into contact with your horcrux. Which seems to be canon since there were no Horcrux' in Albania
