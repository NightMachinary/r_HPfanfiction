Why? It's not like Hufflepuff's cup was significant to Voldemort (he's not related to that house, is he?), he just wanted to possess it and went a step further when making it into a horcrux!

Seriously, canon doesn't say that! Yes, you can write a story that says that, but Harry himself could still use a golden snitch (the one his father was tossing about, because it is significant to him - it was his dad's after all!)
