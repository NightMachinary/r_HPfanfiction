Voldemort was very ego-centric. It meant as much to him that others he considered unworthy would /not/ have it, as it would for him to have it. Also, the houses themselves did not matter to him, but the fact that these artifacts belonged to the founders of Hogwarts, the only place he ever called home, did. It was not significant and personal in the memories he had of it, but of what it represented. You'll remember that he also had Ravenclaw's Diadem and Slytherin's Locket. The only reason he didn't add Gryffindor's Sword to the pile was because he could never find it.

Yes, canon doesn't say that. This is explicitly headcanon, but really now! You. Are. Splitting. Your. SOUL. You are using the darkest of magics to disrupt the cycle of life and death and prevent yourself from passing on. This HAS to have a price to it, otherwise the action has no significant weight to it. In my opinion, the dire severity of this act absolutely necessitates natural counterweights in the form of personal significance and difficulty hiding it. Otherwise people could do exactly as they're suggesting in this thread and avoid death for as long as they please, and I simply don't think that's what a Horcrux is about.

Yes, Harry could use the snitch. No reason he couldn't. The only requirement would be personal significance, which you provided.
