This line of thought always pisses me off. It cheapens the concept of a Horcrux so much. I will always maintain that a Horcrux is required to be something extremely personal and significant to you due to the fact that you are /tearing off a fragment of your eternal soul/ to stuff inside an object. It's literally an abomination of the natural order of life and death, not some anchor you shove off the edge of your boat and then cut the rope later and forget about it.
