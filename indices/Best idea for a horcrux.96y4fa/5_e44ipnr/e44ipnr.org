HPMOR had an interesting way of addressing this, where Voldemort literally made hundreds of "horcruxes" (not actually pieces of his soul, but rather copies of his memories and experiences) out of ordinary objects and hid them in inaccessible locations- he put one on a space probe, one in an underwater trench, one in a volcano, etc. The issue ended up being that he couldn't use them to "possess" anyone since people weren't in contact with them.

Prince of Slytherin made a rule about Horcruxes needing to be magical artifacts, so he literally couldn't. but also gives the person with the Horcrux access to the magical abilities of the artifacts, i.e. it has Slytherin Locket drastically augment Voldemort's Legilimency capabilities.

Another common fanon interpretation is that the spells needed to make the Horcrux indestructible work better on magical artifacts than random rocks, and maybe Voldemort is aware that destroying his soul jars will destabilize him in some way.

In canon, the best explanation is just that Voldemort was super cocky/grandstanding in his choice. Canonically, we don't /really/ know what would've happened if Voldemort died but still had one or more Horcruxes destroyed. With less of a soul and no body, it's perfectly possible that he go would completely insane, but he could just stop existing altogether. The closest analog to a Horcrux I can think of are phylacteries (which hold whole souls for liches, the body doesn't have a soul at all), with a twist, but the mechanics of how a "fractional" soul works don't really have an clear existing basis.
