Snape/Dumbledore. Their dynamic fascinates me, and I love stories that explore it. I'm a fan of cross-gen pairings and power imbalances, plus there are vague parallels in their backgrounds where each made a tragic mistake as a young man that cost the life of someone dear to them. And Dumbledore has a huge impact on Snape's life (and death), while not really seeming to give much of a shit for the man himself. That kind of tension and leader/follower relationship interests me, because they're both complex characters and Dumbledore always has the upper hand.
