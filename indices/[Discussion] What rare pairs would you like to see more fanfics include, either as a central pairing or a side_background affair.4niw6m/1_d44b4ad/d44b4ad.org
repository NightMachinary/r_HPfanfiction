Harry/Luna: Actually there is quite a lot of it, but most of them have Luna as a side character to some other female, or even worse, have her as some all knowing seer. It's not like Harry/Luna would be the complex pairing to write, so I don't know how it can get fucked up in so many ways.

Hermione/Lavender purely for entertainment value. I know it's stupid, but I need some stupid fics in my life. The funny kind of stupid.
