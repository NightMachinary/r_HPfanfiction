Explain! I mean Harry doesn't bully Luna and they are friends...but they aren't that close and I don't think Harry really likes her imagined animals...he doesn't mock her, but that's it IMHO...

ps: I'd really like to know why people like her so much...call me an ass but IHMO she and her dad need a therapist because they never really dealt with the death of Luna's mother!
