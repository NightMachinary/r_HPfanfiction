Harry/Luna is exactly what I was going to write. It shouldn't be a rare pairing, since it is one of the most logical (despite how illogical Luna is) possibilities. Yet somehow, there are almost no good stories with the pairing. I know personally, I haven't written it at all, since Luna is quite possibly the hardest character to get right, which has led us to the position where there are tons of awful stories with her.
