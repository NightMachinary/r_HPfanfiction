tbh there shouldn't be Anyone/Multi, because it's a bit spastic to think that eight or nine girls would want to share one bloke like he's a communal dildo. That being said, I think Ron/Multi could be achieved very easily: make him the superstar English quidditch keeper and a "harem" isn't out of the question, so long as you make it clear that it's not a harem so much as Ron shagging around, attachment-free.
