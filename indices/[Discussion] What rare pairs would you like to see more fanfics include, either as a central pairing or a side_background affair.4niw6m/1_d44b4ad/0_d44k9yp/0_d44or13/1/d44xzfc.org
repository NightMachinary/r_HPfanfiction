Harry/Hermione/Ron is my favorite non-canon pairing. But there are very few good fics about it. [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works]] has 95, but none of them good imho.

*Just The Three of Them*, linkffn(6807742), is nice, but only an one-shot.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is a great story, but their relationship is implicit.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is very good, but still a little too short and has Theo Nott instead of Ron.
