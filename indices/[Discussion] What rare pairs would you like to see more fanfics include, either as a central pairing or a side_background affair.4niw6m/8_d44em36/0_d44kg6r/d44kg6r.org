I love Draco rare pairs. Neville / Draco , Bill/Draco, Charlie/Draco.. I love werewolf mentor fics with Bill or Lupin showing Draco the ropes. Just before breathing is one do my faves.

I also love Angelina Johnson with any Weasley twin, which is canon but so unexplored it might as well be rare pair.
