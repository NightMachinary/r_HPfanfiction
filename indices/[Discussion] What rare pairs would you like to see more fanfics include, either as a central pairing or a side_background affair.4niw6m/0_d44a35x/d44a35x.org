I think pretty much anything that is between two minor characters tends to be overlooked. (With perhaps the exception of Dean/Seamus).

And I'm not just talking about romantic pairings but even the background noise of other people living life around our main characters is often lost. I'd love to read about Filch and Madame Pince playing dominoes and eating stale cake if it meant you understood a bit more of the world as a whole.
