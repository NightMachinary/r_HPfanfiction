I personally would love to see more Luna/Ginny, as well as more Neville/Hannah Abbott. I'd love to see more Argus Filch/Severus Snape, honestly, which is really well done by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Delphi][Delphi on Ao3]].

Fleur/Hermione is very much a good, as is Bill/Fleur, and I am also partial to Fleur/Tonks, not gonna lie. Any Fleur is good Fleur, honestly.
