Well, I'd like more Harry/Fleur (or Gabrielle)...maybe some more Harry/Pansy etc.

All in all: I'd like more pairings that push Harry out of his comfort zone and maybe revise his world view and maybe change his habbits (study more for example or decide to just get out...I mean IMHO Britain doesn't deserve saving for what they (mostly Dumbledore, but also the ministry, his fellow students and the society as a whole) put Harry through!)
