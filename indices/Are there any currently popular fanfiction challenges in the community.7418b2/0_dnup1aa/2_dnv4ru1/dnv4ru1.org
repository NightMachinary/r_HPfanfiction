  DLP Challenges Board - People will post challenges back and forth here on the board, sharing their writing. If you're going to write on DLP, though, make sure you have a thick skin: they say exactly what they think, and they won't sugarcoat a thing. They have a particular dislike of certain pairings, particular H/G, and they won't go in for M/M fanfiction. A lot of them will express a vigorous dislike of "slash".

Need thick skin? Yes.

Reflexive hatred of H/G? Not so much, provided it's decently written.

Dislike of M/M slash? Pretty much. unless it's by one of the greats, like Sam Storyteller/Copperbadge. They've a couple of his fics in the Library.
