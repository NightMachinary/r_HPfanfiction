There aren't any challenges that I know of here on HPFanfiction, but I can recommend a few banks of challenges.

- [[https://hpkinkmeme.dreamwidth.org][*The Harry Potter Kink Meme*]] - prompts posted anonymously by individuals that you can fill, anonymously or with a link. The HP Kink Meme is relatively new, but it's been publicized across different communities, so there are a lot of different challenges up; the vast majority of them will definitely be of a smutty and/or kinky nature, though.
- [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forums/challenges.44/][*DLP Challenges Board*]] - People will post challenges back and forth here on the board, sharing their writing. If you're going to write on DLP, though, make sure you have a thick skin: they say exactly what they think, and they won't sugarcoat a thing. They have a particular dislike of certain pairings, particular H/G, and they won't go in for M/M fanfiction. A lot of them will express a vigorous dislike of "slash".
- [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=challenges][*Potions & Snitches Challenge Board*]] - Again, individuals on Potions & Snitches will post challenges to their heart's content here; in contrast to DLP, Potions & Snitches is very gentle and generous with praise. One could say too much, but some people do prefer that! Potions & Snitches is specifically a Gen Harry Potter & Severus Snape site, meaning that all fics should have Harry and Snape as protagonists, and they don't accept HP/SS pairing fics.
- [[http://hpfanfictalk.com/forum/20-story-challenges/][*HPFanficTalk Challenge Board*]] - HPFanficTalk is a Harry Potter-focused forum that sort of rose from some people leaving HarryPotterFanfiction: they have a pretty wide variety of challenges, and people definitely laugh back and forth with them, so they're pretty comfortable with changing challenges and the like.

Barring the Kink Meme, which is a very new development, these challenges all have their own cultures associated with them - in a fandom as huge as Harry Potter, with hundreds of thousands of readers spread over all kinds of different sites, "trends" aren't likely to go quickly through the fandom in the way they might a smaller, more compact one, but it can still be fun to play around with challenges and the like.

If you haven't already, I would also recommend looking on Fanfiction.net for any groups that would be to your interest, but if I'm honest, a lot of the fanfiction groups over there are heavily dominated by very young people and some of them are very repetitive in the ideas offered and explored.
