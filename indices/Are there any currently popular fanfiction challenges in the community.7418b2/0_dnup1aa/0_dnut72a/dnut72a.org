DLP monthly challenges have been on hiatus for a few years, though there have been some preliminary talks about restarting them. The challenge board itself is currently inactive, but technically you can post a challenge and it might get answered. In fact, I'd say that if it was a really good challenge, it might even cause a brief resurgence. There's still plenty of excellent writers on the site.
