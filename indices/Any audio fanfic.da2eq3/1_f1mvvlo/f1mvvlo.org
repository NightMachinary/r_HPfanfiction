I almost exclusively listen to audio recordings of fanfics. In order to do so I convert fics through text-to-speech with [[http://www.fromtexttospeech.com/][fromtexttospeech]] or Ivona reader (when available).

I remember it was pretty jarring at first, but now that I'm used to it, I actually prefer some TTS voices over certain voice actors.

I've got about 100 GB of Harry Potter fics and another 150 GB of Worm fics. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to upload them though. Would the authors take offence? And I think there might be some restrictions on what the TTS services allow you to do with the files.
