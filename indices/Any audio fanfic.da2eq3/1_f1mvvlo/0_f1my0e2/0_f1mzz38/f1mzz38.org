I've never tried the FFN.net app, but it sounds like they are far better. There are only a few consistent mistakes with Ivona (I use the "Amy" voice) and FTTS ("Alice" as selected voice). I rarely bother correcting them (it's a short list of words, like Beauxbatons, portkey etc.), with one exception; if the author write three dots and no space between the words "like...this", it comes out as "like DOT DOT DOT this" in the audio file, so that has to be edited before I convert.

I also speed up the audio file to 1.25-1.45, but that's probably up to personal preference.
