Is this method better than the built in TTS on the FFN.net app? I've tried using that and I just tune out after a while. The consistent errors also get to me after a while. Only so many time I can hear "Mr. Weasley" pronounced as "Mister. (Long pause) Weasley." as the app can't deal with periods when they aren't full stops.
