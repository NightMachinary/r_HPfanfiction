There are two (long) fics I know of with good audiobook reads. Unfortunately I can't wholeheartedly recommend either.

There's the HPMOR podcast for Methods of Rationality. The guy who reads it is a good narrator and is an interesting person, but this is his first audiobook so it takes a while to hit his stride. The actual fic is....."eh." at best. If the story grabs you you'll like it but it meanders quite a bit from it's original premise.

There's also Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, which has a number of problems. First of all it's not complete yet, second of all the narrator for the first 10 chapters is not as good as the author who takes over for the rest of the fic. The fic itself is..well also "eh" at best. Cool ideas and world building, but very very slow pacing, weird "politics" that has no resemblance to politics in any place or time in human history, and some really, truly uncomfortable overtones about grooming.

Like you, I wish there were more podfics, but this is the best I've found so far.
