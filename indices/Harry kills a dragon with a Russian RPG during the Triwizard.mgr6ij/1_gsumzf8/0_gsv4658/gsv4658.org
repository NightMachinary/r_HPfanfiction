Well, Harry Potter is set in the 1990s and at least in the USA, the common perception is that basically 100% of the former Red Army's equipment was for sale in the mid-90s after the Soviet Union broke up... and that's after 7 decades of mass-producing weapons and shipping them (or their designs) around the globe for proletariats to throw off their oppressors.

I mean, if there'd been a Union of Soviet Socialist Sorcerous Republics, it would have been shipping the goblins and house elves wands in the 50s to overthrow the Ministry and providing training in magical combat to muggleborns assassinating rich purebloods in the 1960s and 70s.
