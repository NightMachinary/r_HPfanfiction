The collection of short stories called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368]["There's nothing to fear"]] have as premise an AU in which Voldemort was sorted into Gryffindor. He is still, well, Voldemort but instead of a pureblood supremacist, he is an equalitarian who claims to be fighting for the rights of muggleborns, hags, goblins, house elves, etc.
