Most of those are horrid. They often fail at the premise. Would a mother who loves her children enough to die for them really give away one of them, or outright ignore one of them? Disbelief not suspended.

The only way I can see this work is that Harry would form some sort of complex for being the one without the fame (if he's still the BWL, doesn't really matter). His brother /needs/ more attention from his parents because of that, the public adores him,... in the end Harry ends up being the one in the shadow.

But most fics go to these ridiculous extremes where Harry is /actively/ ignored and scorned on the breakfast table, or just shipped off to the Dursleys for some stupid reason.

I'd like to read only one of these fics where the family dynamic isn't that black and white. Maybe Harry finds that when he shows interest in academics, his mother pays more attention to him and he becomes a bit of a bookworm that way. Maybe he's the one that shows natural talent on a broom and James dedicates time to him to further that talent. But in the end he struggles to keep their eyes on him, because his brother, in addition of being just as much their son as Harry, is in constant need of guidance through the blinding limelight.
