Well, thanks for that write up. A shame that my reply won't be as complex.

I was never entirely happy with that fic, tbh. I was greatly uncomfortable with how Harry - an adult - plans to train, use and eventually marry all those 6 to 8 year old girls. But that is an discussion for another time.

I retract my statements then, about the cliche not being done well. But I guess you see that my opinion of it is blackened and therefore my memory of it was as well.
