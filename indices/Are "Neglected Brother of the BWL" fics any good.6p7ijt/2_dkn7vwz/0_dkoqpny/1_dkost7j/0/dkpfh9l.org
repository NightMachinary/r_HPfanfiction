Clichés alone don't make a fic bad. Poorly done clichés do, and I don't think DP&SW does them poorly.

And you're right in that Dumbledore is super OOC, which could be a turn off for some folks.

So what PoS does is tries to make a workable story out of as many clichés as possible. Because of this, Harry must grow up abused by Lily's sister's family. There are /tons/ of issues with this, and the PoS solution is to add in external factors/motivations.

For example, regarding why Aurors didn't just storm Hogwarts in the chamber of secrets when kids started getting pretrified. In PoS, the aurors do come, but they're severly limited because the headmaster must swear an unbreakable vow upon taking office to maintain Hogwarts' autonomy from the ministry as much as possible.

So coming back to the Dursleys issue: the following must happen in a WBWL story (massive spoilers ahead):

- Lily, James, Remus and Dumbledore must agree to send Harry away

This is because they think Harry is a squib

- Lily must trust the Dursleys to take good care of her son

In PoS Petunia and Lily didn't really have a falling out. They stayed good friends well after Lily left Hogwarts.

-Petunia and Vernon must abuse their own nephew, and everyone in Little Whitning must ignore obvious signs of Harry's abuse

This part still hasn't been revealed, but we know that Harry has some condition that causes every Muggle he meets to instantly hate him. This also affects Hermione's and Justin's parents too. The author has dropped lots of hints how this works (and there is magic with a very similar effect that has been introduced), but it hasn't been revealed fully. I have my own pet theories why.

- Remus must not seek out Harry

In PoS Remus and James have a huge falling out when Remus requests custody of Harry (to raise him in the Muggle world) and James denies because Remus is a werewolf.

Note that in PoS being a werewolf is very different than in canon (lycanthropy is also a mental disease that slowly corrupts the minds of werewolves and turns them into man-eating monsters like Greyback). Lupin has dedicated his life to curing the mental part of lycanthropy, but James was concerned that, if Lupin's efforts aren't successful Lupin would be a danger to Harry.

- Dumbledore must not check up on Harry

Dumbledore hires Mrs. Fig to keep a watch over Harry. However Squibs and Muggles are very, very similar in the PoS universe (being magical is more of a spectrum between Magical and non-Magical, with muggles being on the low end, wizards on the high end, and squibs in the middle), so Mrs. Fig was also affected by Harry's mysterious ailment.

- Lily and James must not check up on Harry

This has also been hinted at, and a few characters have outright insulted Lily/James for this but nothing about why they didn't has been confirmed. This and why Harry's ailment exists are 2 huge mysteries that (based on how the author has handled everything so far) I'm excited to see be revealed.

- James and Lily must not want Harry to join the family after Harry is found a wizard

There is a prophecy that says if a Potter becomes the "Prince of Slytherin", the world as we know it will end. James is initially ashamed over how he's treated Harry, but once Harry is sorted into Slytherin James tries everything he can to disinherit Harry before he becomes the "Prince of Slytherin".

This prophecy, which has existed in the Potter family for centuries, is why every Potter, including James and Jim (the BWL), were raised to be extremely biased against Slytherin.

Lily doesn't see the point in pretending her and Harry can be a family while James is trying to disinherit Harry, but she being reaching out to Harry against James' wishes while trying to convince James to stop.

--------------

The above is a lot of little explanations, but the idea is that PoS tries to do whatever it can to make the premise and canon work logically, which necessitates, at times, lots of external stuff. And they do this for basically everything.

I'm not really doing it all justice, as this stuff is all revealed slowly over many chapters (allowing the reader to make their own predictions and letting the author drop lots of hints).
