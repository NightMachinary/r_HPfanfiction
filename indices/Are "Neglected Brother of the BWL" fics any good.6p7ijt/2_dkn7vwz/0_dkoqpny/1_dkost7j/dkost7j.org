I'm not sure if Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches is a good example. I mean, its practically famous for indulging in every cliche there is, just in a way that its not awful.

The next thing is... Dumbledore, the guy who has more forgiveness in himself than anyone else in the HP books condemns a child who /maybe, possibly/ could become a Voldemort 2.0? Disbelief once again not suspended.

The thing is, even if Lily ships Harry off to Petunia. He ought to live among muggles to be prepared for their world. Thats all fine. But then: Why wouldn't she check?

This is bullshit. A caring, loving mother would pop in once or twice to talk with her child.

Anyway. I thought Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches to be a fun read. But it has its flaws, and the premise is certainly one of them.
