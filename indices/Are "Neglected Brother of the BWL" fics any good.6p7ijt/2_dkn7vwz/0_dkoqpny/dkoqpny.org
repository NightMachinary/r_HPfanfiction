  Would a mother who loves her children enough to die for them really give away one of them, or outright ignore one of them?

the two WBWL fics I really like take different answers to this question.

In Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches, Dumbledore is convinced Harry could become worse than Voldemort (which isn't unjustified as he does do some pretty heinous things). Because of this, he manipulates Lily & James into leaving Harry w/ the Dursleys and later frames Harry for a crime.

in Prince of Slytherin, Lily actually hates the wizarding world and, due to a false negative, her and James though Harry was squib. So she jumped for joy at the chance to have Harry raised as a muggle w/ the Dursleys and have a "normal" life (she had no idea he'd be abused/neglected).
