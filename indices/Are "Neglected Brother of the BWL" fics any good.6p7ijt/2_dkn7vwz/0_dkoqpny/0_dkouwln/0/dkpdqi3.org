It depends on how AU you want to be. Dumbledore in DP&SW is ridiculously out of character. At least for me though, I don't mind that at all.

I know some people dislike when Harry is "only Harry in name" (i.e. so different and OOC that the only thing he shares w/ canon Harry is the name Harry), but I don't have a problem with that. Fanfiction to me is more about exploring the world and the magic/setting, and less about the characters.
