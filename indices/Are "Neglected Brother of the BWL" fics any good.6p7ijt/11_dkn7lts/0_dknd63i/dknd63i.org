Maybe part of it is projection? I never had good relationships with my parents, especially my abusive mother, so endless praising of Lily/mother figures in fics can rub me the wrong way.

While WBWL fics are definitely about forced drama and basically never pull off a convincing Lily and James, I also really like fics that don't just treat them as ideal individuals, which is fair because people change and we see nothing "really" negative about them in Canon.
