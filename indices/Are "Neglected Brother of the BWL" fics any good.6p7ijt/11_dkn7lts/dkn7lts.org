Haha, no. People like to say you can make any trope work, but that's a lie, because WBWL ignores so much of canon's features. James and Lily are shown to be loving parents and overall great people. Why would they neglect their son/kids just because? If the curse scar is a result of the Horcrux latching on, why doesn't it appear on Harry? Why would the brother of the supposed BWL not get any attention from people? Yeah he'd be overshadowed, but he'd still get some recognition. Why do they always include a cardboard cutout as the love interest? DP&SW is literally the only decent WBWL fic I've seen, and even that suffers from a lot of shit.
