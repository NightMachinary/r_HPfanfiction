I think WBWL could work if done well. Such as, making it so that Lily and James actually care about all of their children, James Jr (or whatever they call him/her) just happens to be the BWL so they're always outside of the house and Harry stays with his sitters most of the time (though, great wizards they are, Sirius, Dumbledore, Lupin, etc...) On a side note, I always imagined an Albus Dumbledore baby sitting fic where he sees Harry doing incredible feats of Magic at a young age, and no one believes him because no one else was there to recount the tale.
