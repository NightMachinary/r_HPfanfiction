The problem with those stories is that they need OOC behavior to work. I don't really mind that so long as it is set up as an AU element in the premise of the story, rather than jarringly appearing out of nowhere. Other people who care more about canon compliance aren't going to like the premise out of principle. I do agree that most of these stories are full of ridiculous angst though.
