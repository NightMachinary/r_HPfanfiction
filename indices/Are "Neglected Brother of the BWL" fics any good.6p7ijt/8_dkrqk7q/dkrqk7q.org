The problem I have found with most Neglected/WBWL fics I have read is that the neglect factor is brought in too fast and too hard, usually through cringe-worthy OOC premise and behaviour.

I can only think that in order for this to work in any kind of 'realistic' fashion, the neglect would have to creep up, over enough time for the psychology of the situation to really settle into the Neglected sibling so that in they end they start viewing themselves as more disposable and less-worthy. From there, out of love for their family, they start distancing themselves into the background, etc. Assuming no psychotic break into the typical 'psychopath neglected sibling' I can even conceive of this sort of character eventually coming to the conclusion that they must protect their sibling from the shadows etc. It would certainly tie into that love being the 'power he knows not' idea - for as has been remarked more than once, self-sacrifice for another's gain is one of the greatest acts of love there is.

I can only imagine it would be very hard to balance the storytelling required to sell this situation against keeping it an interesting read.
