Indeed, same here (note: Maybe that's why I don't have a problem with background slash because then the gay is less prominemt/important)

ps: I am not homophobic after all - I don't care what people do in their bedrooms and I am all for gay marriage (I was PLEASED that Germany finally had a vote on this in parliament (which passed of course, so it's now LEGAL!) a few weeks ago!)

pps: I am against marriage (hate the idea/custom), but if straight people are allowed to get married, then why shouldn't gays get married? :(
