Like with any other type of fanfiction (except those that you personaly don't like and therefore have a hard time enjoying (for me that would be slash! No matter how well writen and great a slash story might be, I wouldn't read it because it's slash. I have tried to read slash but I simply can't take it!)):

They can be good, but the trope itself is NOT what makes a story good or bad - it's the writer's skill and imagination that makes a story great!

I've read some stories that pull the "WBWL"-Concept off well, but I've also read some that were crappy as fuck!

I wouldn't know if they are the exception because I rarely look for this trope (I sometimes pick up those stories from recommendations or when searching for keywords)...if I look at those I've read versus those I never finished, then I'd say yeah, they aren't the exception - but: As I've said, my sample size isn't large enough to state this with confidence, it's not a trope I enjoy so much that I read it all the time...

Frankly I kind of enjoy somewhat (I love it if he isn't a slacker, like in canon, and studies more and is interested in magic etc.) canon Harry (somewhat independent orphan kid) more than Harry with parents, even if they are almost as bad as the Dursleys!
