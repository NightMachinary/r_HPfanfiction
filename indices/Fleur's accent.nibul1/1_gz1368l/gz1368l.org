As a reader, I don't like it. I'm not a native speaker so sometimes it's doubly harder for me to understand the "accented" lines of Hagrid and Fleur because I have to try figuring out if it's supposed to be a butchered English or a French/regional English words and reconstruct its original form. So forget about "sexy" or "cringy", I'm struggling to understand it in the first place.
