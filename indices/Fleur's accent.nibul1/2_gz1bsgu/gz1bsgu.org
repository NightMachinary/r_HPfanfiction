I use the same things that JK did in the books-- Fleur drops her H's & does the 'z' sound instead of 'th' for words like they. She routinely uses that to show Fleur's accent & its easy for me to keep those 2 rules in my head when I'm writing her.

As a reader, I also prefer seeing her accent remain like that.
