You could also think about changing her accent as part of her character growth. When she first arrives at Hogwarts her English may not be good, she is essentially just quoting from a phrasebook. As she spends more time around British people, and especially gets closer to Harry, she may put effort into improving her English and slowly drop the accent. This can also be used to show high stress or distraction if the accent temporarily returns. IMO I would avoid having her deliberately keep the accent to fetishise it, because especially for Fleur, well written relationships should be about being attracted to the person underneath the superficial traits.
