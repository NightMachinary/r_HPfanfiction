[[/u/Avalon1632]] pretty much hit the nail on the head for what I'd do and prefer. But to summarise, if I were told to write Fleur speaking, I'd likely only drop her H's and sprinkle a few 'ze's, but keep it to English otherwise. The only time I'd go further would be to emphasise emotion; in which case I'd likely drop English entirely and write in French.
