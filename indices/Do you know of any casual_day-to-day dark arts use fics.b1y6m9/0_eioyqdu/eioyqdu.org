Would it still be legally classed as dark magic?

The definition of Dark Magic is magic used maliciously to cause harm against other people, but if it's harmless then it's not "dark". Or with dark spells, trying to cast them with a harmless intent wouldn't work, eg, casting Crucio while thinking about tickling someone.
