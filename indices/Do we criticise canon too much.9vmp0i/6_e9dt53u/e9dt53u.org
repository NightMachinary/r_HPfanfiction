I mean I'll start by saying that I only write and mostly read canon compliant stuff, so that my bias out the way.

I think it's fine to criticise canon and poke holes in it, I do myself often, but I do get irritated sometimes by people that have read so much fanfic that they don't seem to like /anything/ canon anymore. Sometimes I think people should feel comfortable to admit they have outgrown the series rather than insult or belittle canon - things like exact student numbers and stuff seem silly to me to fuss over, because I think it's ok in a children's series to suspend your disbelief.

That said, there's no need to get upset and it's important to recognise that in the same way you'll never find me mentioning Grawp in any of my fics, some people feel that way about things much more crucial in canon. It's not up to me or anyone else to decide how we interact with media. I just think we should all be careful about the tone and language we use around certain criticisms.
