If you just tear apart canon for the sake of doing so, then you achieve very little. But if you try to eliminate a few of the plotholes because you don't want them in your stories, and not do it in a MOR fashion, then that is generally ok.

That being said, there are a few issues canon simply does not address which need to be addressed, most related to criminal justice.
