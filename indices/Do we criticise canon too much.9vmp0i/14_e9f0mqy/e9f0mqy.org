Your friend got butthurt by the truth.

​

It is true the first book was incredibly nonsensical and the "traps" ridiculous. Ninja Warrior has better traps.

​

As for the camping trip, it was crap. The entire trip was useless and ridiculous, just going to an abandoned warehouse and just protecting it would have been more useful. Apparate, confuse some burgerking or mcdonalds employee to give them whoppers and your food problem is over.

​

And yeah the population thing was a joke unless there was a more famous english school that took about 98% of the population because if that isn't the case I don't see them surviving a century more.
