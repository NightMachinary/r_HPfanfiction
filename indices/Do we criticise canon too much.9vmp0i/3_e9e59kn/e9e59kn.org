This may not be where she was coming from, but personally I find criticism of the series about stuff that's ultimately a constraint of the genre to be... not wrong, but just kind of uninteresting? Like, HP is about plucky young kids saving the world - of course the obstacles in Philosopher's Stone had to be easy enough for them to get through. "Harry, Ron, and Hermione bravely went off to stop Voldemort, but got stuck at the first obstacle so they gave up and went back to bed" may be a more realistic ending, but it's far less satisfying. (This is also my objection to the complaint that all the adults are useless.) It's a fair criticism, but honestly the only way to fix it is to have HP be a fundamentally different series, which is not what I (or presumably most fans) would want.
