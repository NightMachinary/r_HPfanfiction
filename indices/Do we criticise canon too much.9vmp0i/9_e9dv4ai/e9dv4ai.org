I think that you have to realize that 1. The series started as a kid's book even if it got more Sirius (see what I did there?) later on, so she didn't seem to be too concerned with realism. 2. The books seem to be written the same as a cop or kids tv show with a bad guy every episode theme. As such, as an entire work, its not super comprehensive.

JK is clearly more worried about the story being entertaining and carrying a message than she is about logic and cohesion. I mostly have issues with her characters not acting in accordance with what we've seen of their personalities I.e. harry not doing anything to improve himself after hearing the prophecy or Dumbledore manipulating everyone when he's supposed to love harry and be an overall nice guy.
