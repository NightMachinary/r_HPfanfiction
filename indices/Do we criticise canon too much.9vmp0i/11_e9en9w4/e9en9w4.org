I think it's fine to criticize canon in certain degrees where it's warranted. Frankly, I feel no qualms about tearing apart The Cursed Child since so much of it is just nonsense. That being said, there's obviously a point of excess, and I think "too much" depends on the intent and behavior of the person taking note of the flaws. For me, the "too much" range is when the intent is malicious or the criticism appears to be for the sake of criticism and tearing apart something popular.
