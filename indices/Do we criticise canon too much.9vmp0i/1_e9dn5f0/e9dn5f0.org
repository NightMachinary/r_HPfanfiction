I think that fanfic writers tend to focus a lot more on the worldbuilding than the average reader, and that's where canon's greatest weakness lies. Rowling doesn't let world building get in the way of a good plotline, even if it means contradicting earlier details. Her general weakness at maths isn't helping either.

But in the end, I think the magic of the Harry Potter universe doesn't lie in rigorous worldbuilding, but rather in its whimsical nature with seemingly endless possibilities, as well as the characters that populate it.

Take LoTR for comparison. Worldbuilding perfected to the degree that you can write a historical atlas about it, but it's hard to care about most of the characters. Don't get me wrong, LoTR is a masterpiece, but I read it more for the world it's set in than for the characters.
