I agree with what you said. I also think that there is worldbuilding that rests on internal fact and worldbuilding that rests on feeling/mood. I feel that even though the details in the HP universe don't always add up exactly, they have an emotional consistency that makes them uniquely Wizarding World. I would argue another example of strong "emotional" worldbuilding is Wes Anderson. You can't write the Silmarillion about it, but you know the Wes Anderson world when you see it, and you know/feel the Harry Potter world when you see it. Sometimes I find fanfiction that focuses on internal fact over maintaining the feeling of the HP books frustrating. I see all kinds of criticism about JK Rowling's poor worldbuilding, but I actually think she had pretty amazing worldbuilding in the sense of creating a unique world with a salient, consistent tone, that most people around the world now know and recognize. I think focusing on the facts and the methodical details is one style of worldbuilding but not the only one, and I think getting too lost in it can actually make the world being built less compelling.
