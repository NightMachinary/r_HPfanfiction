You can't think to hard about it. You just can't; no story is going to be perfectly logical and internally consistent unless it gets written by obsessive nerds in which case it isn't nearly as much fun. I recently ran into this problem with Naruto. HP is what it is. It is fun. It is cool. It is a great basis for fanfiction. The characters make dumb decisions and lots of the world doesn't really make sense. It's fine to point out the problems and try and fix them- */fix them/*- with fanfiction. One reasoning I've heard for the easy philosopher's stone run is that the trio was only hitting the very first layer of the challenges, which were actually a lot more dangerous but got dumbed down by Dumbledore following them to make sure they didn't kill themselves. There are lots of interesting things you can put into the story, and maybe someday someone will release the patched version where the story is basically the same but all the plot holes have been addressed. Until that day... don't think about it too hard.
