  However, I do think that in order to disect it you should never forget what it originally was. A fun, whimsical, not-too-serious adventure novel for kids and teens.

I used to hate Dumbledore and ranted against him on Reddit several times. No more, I now fully recognize him as a literary plot device, and will no longer grind my axes with this character.

Of course, I still diss him whenever my family is having a discussion about HP. At least both of my children have embraced my dislike for Dumbledore, whether as a literary character or about his in-story behavior. Lol.
