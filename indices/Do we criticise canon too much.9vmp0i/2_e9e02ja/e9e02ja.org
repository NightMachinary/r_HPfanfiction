As someone who writes himself, I kinda understand how Rowling ended up where we all are right now. You very much get into the mindset of the book you write. I write grimdark arcanepunk Fantasy, and that creates its own blindspots during writing. Harry Potter was always a children to teen adventure novel. It was colorful, whimsical, had some mysteries to it and characters you could identify with. I can see how Rowling also ended up having her blindspots there while she immersed herself in her text.

Now that I'm in my late 20s, many of those things that didn't bug me about HP when I was 13, get on my nerves now. Incompetent adults, some mechanics of the worldbuilding not making sense, or even the inconsistencies. That were things that I didn't even notice back then, because I didn't care. Now that I'm an adult, things are looking different. And that is what I think is the main issue. All of the original, release-readers are now adults. We now have the mental capabilities and knowledge (and the interest) to disect this novel series.

However, I do think that in order to disect it you should never forget what it originally was. A fun, whimsical, not-too-serious adventure novel for kids and teens.

Thats one of the reasons why I think its more fun to think of reasons why something that seems like an inconsistency /isn't/ one, than to tear canon down because of it. I see that tearing down mentality here a lot and, frankly, I think its just lazy, boring and in some rare, very emotional cases, rather pathetic. We all know of the plotholes and things not adding up. Pointing those things out adds literally nothing to the shared knowledge of the community. If you prattle on about it you're just beating a dead horse.

What I always love to see is new explanations as to why something made sense. I appreciate the fillers and explanations, may they be ever so convoluted. Here is some potential for creativity that, after all these years, still isn't depleted.
