Great question, it's easy to get hate confused with criticism... I live in the US, the US has a lot of issues, doesn't mean I don't love living here, doesn't mean I hate the US, it just means there are issues ...

It's the same with the HP books, just because there are issues and you criticize those issues doesn't mean you can't love the books. It just means the books aren't perfect.

The great thing about books though is they are art, as a reader you should interpret them to make sense for yourself(like the teacher issue, maybe they are using timeturners, maybe they have a hologram that teaches classes, maybe they have assistants that is polyjuice potion....you can fill the blank yourself and that's fantastic)

Now I will say if a person can't sit down and read the HP books without getting "triggered"every 2 seconds, then they probably aren't for them, but that's okay they can't be for everyone
