  She didn't take too kindly to what I said, even though I did not yell/scream etc. She told me that I was "ruining" the magic of the Potterverse and that those things "don't matter". What do you guys think?

I actually agree with both perspectives. I love poking holes into stories and if someone wants to discuss logical errors in the Hayrry Potter books with me, I'll enthusiastically join them.

However, at the same time I do think that the best way to enjoy Harry Potter is to shut down that part of your brain and instead just accept that not all things in the HP universe make perfect sense.

For example, I tend to really dislike it if a fanfic starts explaining every little plothole as a lie that evil!Dumbledore told Harry to control him because I feel it goes against the spirit of everything I enjoy about Harry Potter in the first place.
