I am someone who likes to dissect and digest canon. I think it's fair that if something sets off your internal "that can't be right" alarm you can question it and either think your way around it or accept it as a flaw/plot hole.

However, the way I get enjoyment out of engaging with the material is not the same way the next person does and I think [[/u/Iniga123][u/Iniga123]] set out the most sensible suggestion for how to move forward from there.
