He's an inbred bigot that lived in his own filth after his sister left. He's so deranged that he only spoke in Parseltongue. He despised muggles, so I can't see him ever forming any kind of connection with Tom. And Tom is pretty much the only person besides Harry that would understand what he's saying. He seems so unstable that any fanfiction version of him would need to be OOC. Giving him a child could be intresting, but OC's related to the big bad are often bad.
