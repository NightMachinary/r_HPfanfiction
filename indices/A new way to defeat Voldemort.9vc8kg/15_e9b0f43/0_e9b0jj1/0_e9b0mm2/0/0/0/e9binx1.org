It depends on how Horcruxes work, and if the Diary is a weird exception. Are Horcruxes more like backups, that preserve the mind-state of the creator at the time of creation? Or are they anchors, that keep the "main" soul/mind from moving on?

The diary /seems/ to be the former, but if that were true you would expect one of the Horcruxes to be "used up" after Halloween 1981, as the soul bit inside it instead /becomes/ the wraith, who then goes to Albania, possesses Quirrel, etc. It doesn't fit with the rest of the facts. The latter option ultimately has more explanatory power.
