Now I want to read a KOTOR type story with a mindwiped Voldemort as the main character... It starts with a man named Tom Riddle waking up in an Order safehouse under attack, and he has to escape and get to safety, and then way later he meets his second in command Bellatrix who tells him who he really is... :)
