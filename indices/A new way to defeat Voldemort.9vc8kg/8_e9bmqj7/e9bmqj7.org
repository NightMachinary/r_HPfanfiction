I am pretty sure there was a Robst fic that did this to a whole nother level, where they had Lockhart go to albania trying to do his whole "find the story then obliviate everyone and steal it" thing, finds Voldemort, and then accidentally obliviates himself at the same time Voldemort possesses him. Resulting in a Quirrel-Mort like situation, where it's Lockhart instead of Quirrel, and neither of them know anything. Lockhart may have renamed Voldemort Bob.
