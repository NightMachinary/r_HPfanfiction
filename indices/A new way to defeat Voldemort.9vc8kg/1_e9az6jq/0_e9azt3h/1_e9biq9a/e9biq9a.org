According to whom, the guys that use dementor radiation/kisses as default (and almost the only) forms of punishment?

Also, I don't agree with your statement even without the canon setting's context. Lockhart became a vegetable because the spell misfired, so I don't see why the “lights” couldn't erase specific things (e.g. magic-related knowledge, personality traits, etc) and then brainwash/re-educate the target into a new person.

A better argument would've been that it takes too much time and concentration for an Obliviate to be a practical choice in the middle of a fight. Or that the Death Eaters could be storing encrypted memory backups with people they trusted.
