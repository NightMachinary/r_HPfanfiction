That's the problem with the series. It's too black and white.

Most of the villains are evil for no real reason. JKR stops one step short of saying Umbridge was born evil. Voldemort was apparently irredeemable before he even became a teenager. Bellatrix fulfilled the insane blood purist Black stereotype for her generation.
