Fair point, but I'm sure there are some people that wouldn't. Would DH Neville feel bad if he did that to Bellatrix? It'd feel like Justice for his Parents, wouldn't it? It's circumstancial, I suppose. If someone had killed my loved ones, I'd want them to die or suffer and think Prison wasn't nearly enough, so I could probably rationalise it on them, but would feel inhumane if i did it to Generic Death Eater #12. It'd only be for the Worst of the Worst (Umbridge for the Concentration Camps, Bellatrix for the Longbottoms and everything since, Voldemort for being behind it all) As they got rid of the Dementors, it'd at least guarantee they didn't escape Azkaban.
