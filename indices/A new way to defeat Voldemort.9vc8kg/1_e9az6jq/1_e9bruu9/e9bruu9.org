Who says you can't restore the mind (or that potential for evil isn't still there? - Yes: Nature versus nurture...sorry, we don't know because we have never made a truly evil person a blank slate, we don't know how yet!) - dark rituals (something no normal healer would try, but the DEs would, they kind of need Voldemort because they themselves can't fight Dumbledore), sacrifices (again: No healer would do that, unless threatened ("I'll kill your family if you don't perform this sacrificial healing ritual!") or under the imperius!) etc.

Still you can try and lock the guy up (heavy guard, a fidelius etc.) while you have decades to look for the horcruxes and for hunting the DEs down :D
