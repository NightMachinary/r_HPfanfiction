  Hermione has been looking forward to this vacation for a very long time. Well, she would have been if she hadn't forgotten she booked it! Now, she has to either cancel or find someone else to go in her place. But when her new boyfriend finds out about the trip, he insists she take him along. How can she say no to that face?
