I always wondered how they drew the line with Muggleborns. I mean, Hermione's parents knew she was a witch. I'm assuming if she had siblings they would have known. Would her grandparents have known? Other extended family? What's to keep them from letting something slip? The Ministry could not possibly keep track of all the relatives of all the Muggleborns and anyone they might talk to about where their kid was going to school or whatever. I liked the story, though.
