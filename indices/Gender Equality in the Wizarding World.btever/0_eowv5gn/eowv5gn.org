I'm pretty sure that women have as much power as men. Amelia Bones occupie an important position and so do Dolores. There even was a female minister of magic during Voldemort's first war if I recall correctly. The reason why Wulburga Black couldn't strip Sirius' status is an easy one: She just doesn't have the right. Imagine if your crazy aunt tried to disown someone of the familly, how would the rest of the family react? Even if she is right, she wouldn't have been listened too. And the reason why wizards doesn't have much children is the same as ours nowadays, we just don't want too. I don't plan on having more than three children. We used to have tons of children cause half of them would die. I think that despite racism against muggleborn (and halfbloods), the wizarding society doesn't have a problem with race (even Draco never made a racist comment, or Flint against Angelica, plus Schackelbot had an important position) or gender.
