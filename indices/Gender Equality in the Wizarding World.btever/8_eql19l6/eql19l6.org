Im not sure if its patriarchy or matriatchy but it does seem to have biases about men vs women. There are still sterotypes.

And certain moments like how Hermione can go into the boys dorms but Harry and Ron can't go into a girl.

Or how love potion is dismissed as this harmless thing girls use but it can literally brainwash people. Why isnt this considered as dangerous as imperio? And why is it treated as a girl thing?
