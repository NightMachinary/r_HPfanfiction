The idea that men and woman must be equal in magical society is popular, but evidence of it is thin on the ground. There's a simple test that reveals that what we actually see in Rowling's books doesn't live up to what it should probably be: how many female characters can you name who have important roles, plenty of time "on screen," have careers, are mothers, and are married? Next, how many male characters have important roles, plenty of time on screen, have careers, are fathers, and are married?

If men and women are equal, then we should see equality here as well, for this is a good test for how equal a society really is. Women with strong careers and roles is good, but if they are all unmarried and childless, that isn't equality and they aren't as good as role models as women with careers and families - especially when they are depicted alongside men who haven't had to make such sacrifices.

Now, to be fair, we don't have a ton of examples of either of those. We spend most of our time in a boarding school where none of the staff appears to be married (probably because that would complicate things - let's be honest, here, what are the chances that no one on staff in a school is married?). But in the two clear-cut examples of families, the Dursleys and the Weasleys, both fathers have careers and both mothers don't. Coincidence? Perhaps, but it's still evidence against equality.

And what kinds of careers do we see among women? Teachers and nurses, traditional female careers. Amelia Bones is in law enforcement, it's true, but she doesn't have enough of a role to matter. Fudge's predecessor was a woman, but she has no role at all (also, she served at the same time as Thatcher, and would anyone really like to argue that Thatcher was proof that women were equal to men in Britain in the 80s??). The two most powerful women with the biggest roles and who don't have traditionally female jobs are Bellatrix Lestrange and Dolores Umbridge. Villains! Again, not role models. Coincidence? Again, perhaps, but it's still evidence against male and female roles being equal in the books. And let's not forget that Bellatrix seems to be unusual - she's the only main Death Eater who is female (aside from the Carrow sister, who has barely any role).

We can add here the fact that while Hermione is a strong female character, there are still plenty of instances where she is relegated to more traditional female roles. When going after the Philosopher's Stone, her contribution is to solve an intellectual puzzle while the boys do things that are very physical and action-oriented. In the Chamber of Secrets, her contribution is research while the boys go out and have physical adventures. This is persistent and recurring problem in children's literature: boys charge out to have physical adventures and take risks while girls stay home and do safe, supportive things.

All in all, while I believe Rowling did a better job than most, I also think she probably still had a lot of unconscious assumptions about male and female roles which influenced her while she was writing. This is normal - we all have such assumptions, and sometimes they aren't clear unless someone else can step back and point them out.

And that's why I'm posting this answer. By recognizing where Rowling fell short, fan fiction writers will know where they can improve on things. Don't simply imitate and repeat her mistakes. Write stories where girls go out and takes risks while boys hang back and play supportive roles. Write stories where an adult witch has a family and a career while the wizard stays home to tend the house.
