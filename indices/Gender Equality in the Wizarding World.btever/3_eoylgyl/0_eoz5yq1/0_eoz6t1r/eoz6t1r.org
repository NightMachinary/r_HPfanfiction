Chasers do throw the Quaffle, not use spells to propel it forward. That's physical strength.

Even the simple activity of clinging on to a broom that is going at 100kph or more (Harry's Firebolt has a top speed of 150 or something - can't remember) subjects the flier to very high inertial forces. Flying isn't as simple as simply sitting on a broom and doing whatever. It's definitely physical.

There would be no contest between 17/18 year olds and 12 year olds. There's a reason why we have brackets like U18, U16, U14 and U12, and why those brackets are split between boys and girls.
