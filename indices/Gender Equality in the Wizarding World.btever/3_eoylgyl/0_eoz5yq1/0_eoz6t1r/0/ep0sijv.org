I doubt Rowling thought about it that far considering she herself has stated how little thought she put into magical sports (as a result of not caring for sports in general herself).

Your interpretation could work, but considering the age variations we see at Hogwarts I'm not sure if I'd buy it entirely.

Harry being as good as he is at 11/12 and pretty much being the best seeker in the school from day one is kind of absurd if magic doesn't play a massive part.

And I'm fairly sure we see a number of younger-ish, 14/15 and under, playing Quidditich for the school team.

  Even the simple activity of clinging on to a broom that is going at 100kph or more (Harry's Firebolt has a top speed of 150 or something - can't remember) subjects the flier to very high inertial forces.

You can't really start taking the numbers seriously though because then the whole sport falls apart.

Can you imagine trying to throw a ball around whilst zipping at 100 mph? Even general mental processing of images and actions at those speeds would be damn impressive.
