Pretty sure that all the fanfics that go on about pureblood women being property of their families are just written by retards.

During Voldemort's first rise to power, the Minister for Magic was Millicent Bagnold - a woman. A woman was holding the highest office in Britain's wizarding government. You cannot get much more egalitarian than that.

The whole thing about robes, candles, quills and rest of the stuff to make it seem like Britain is somehow "backwards" is purely cosmetic.

The only place where there should be an imbalance is in sports, where physical prowess is the only factor, but the way Rowling wrote her books somehow has 12 year old girls going toe to toe against 17 year old guys in Quidditch, so...
