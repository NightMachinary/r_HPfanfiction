Exactly! Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in Britain in the 1980s, but does that mean men and women had full equality in Britain? Of course not!

Granted, the fact that there are women in the stories with careers and power means that they aren't completely second-class citizens, but that's not exactly a high bar, is it? Just because they could be a lot worse doesn't mean they couldn't be a lot better, too.
