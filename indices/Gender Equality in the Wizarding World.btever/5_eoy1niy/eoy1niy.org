There seem to be at least some kind of gender equality in the Wizarding world.

You have women in position of power, both in Magical schools (Mrs Maxime, Mc Gonagall . . .), and in the Ministry (Amelia Bones, Ex Minister Bagshot, maybe even Umbridge . . .). I have sometimes read the arguments that the Wizarding World is sexist because women have to choose between careers and children, but to be fair, it is not necessarely true (we don't know if Bagshot has a family or not for exemple), and even there is seems to apply to the men too (Dumbledore, or Snape has no wives or children).

There is also the argument that the Pureblood society only see the women as potential mothers since neither Narcissa nor Molly work (the 2 exemples of pureblood mothers), but I think it's because we only see the world from Harry's (limited) vision. Molly doesn't work because of her children, but she has 7, which is considered abnormal in their society. And Narcissa doesn't work because she doesn't have to, from what we know, Lucius doesn't work too (unless going to the minister from time to time to give him money count as work).
