Canonically, the wizarding world might as well be post-scarcity in terms of affluence. Gamp's Law doesn't allow for conjuring food out of nothing, but apparently you /can/ duplicate food.

Still doesn't exactly explain the Weasleys. They're "poor", but they've never seemed like they go hungry (except when Ron got the wrong sandwich). So did they just have 7 kids because they were trying for a girl or something?
