The most affluent societies have the lowest birth rates. Strange but true. Look at birth rates in various countries. Malthus was wrong. The wizarding world could just be another affluent society.

I've always assumed the sexes are more equal in the wizarding world, since wands are equalizers, but pureblood women of childbearing age face restrictions because of the obsession with blood purity. There would be exaggerated jealousy, defending witches' honor, witches ostentatiously defending their reputations for purity and virtue, etc.
