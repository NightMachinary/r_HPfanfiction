It's an oligarchy, where reputation for wisdom and clear thought is most respected. The rest of the society is mostly interested in trading comforts and entertainments. The ruling bodies are mostly populated by people well-past the child rearing stage.

There's no indication that witches can have children well beyond the normal range, which sort of figures; they have the same 400 or so potential ova of a normal human being produced each month from menses to menopause. A woman still bearing children probably is discounted opinion-wise as being affected by hormones, so many witches may rush through having children at an early age so that they can move on to the 'good part' of life, where their voice can be heard without prejudgment.
