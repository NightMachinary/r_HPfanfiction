There's at least some sexism in the Wizarding World, as evidenced by Molly's treatment of Hermione after Rita's article in the 4th year, but on the whole, there seems to be much more gender equality compared to muggles. And in spite of the pervasive fanon of "proper Victorian pureblood women", I think that muggleborns and some muggle-raised halfbloods were much more sexist until quite recently, bacause magical world had women in power and in all areas of life for much longer. Dilys Derwent was the Headmistress and a presumably renowned Healer before in 18th century, Millicent Bagnold was the Minister for Magic in 1980s, Amelia Bones is the head of the DMLE. Umbridge climbed quite high up the career ladder. There are quite a lot of female Aurors (Tonks, Hestia Jones, Alice Longbottom, probably Amelia Bones back in the days). Bellatrix Lestrange, pureblood fanatic, doesn't feel the need to sit at home and wait for her her husbund to return from the Death Eater raid, she is a high-ranking Death Eater herself.

So all in all, the vaguely Victorian feeling is there probably because many wizards and witches of those times are still alive, and it doesn't reflect the mores of the society.

As for Walburga, maybe she did have the right to disown/disinherit Sirius, but reinstated him after Regulus' death. Or maybe she just blasted Sirius from the tapestry, but never actually went through with anything legally. She did, after all, keep Sirius' childhood bedroom intact for many years. Humans are complicated.
