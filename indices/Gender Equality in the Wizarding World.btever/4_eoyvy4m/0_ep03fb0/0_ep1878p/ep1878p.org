Women aren't as prone to violence as men, even if they agree with the ideology? Riddle recruited primarily from wizards because of his own prejudices ingrained in him in the muggle orphanage in the 30s and 40s or simply because he knew how to appeal to them better? We see him converting young men using their insecurities and anger like a cult leader he was, as evidenced by Crouch Jr., Snape and maybe Quirrell, but the few female DEs, Bellatrix and Alecto, seem to be in the organisation mostly because of their own sadistic inclinations. Umbridge could have easily been a Death Eater because of her own beliefs and sadism, but she isn't.
