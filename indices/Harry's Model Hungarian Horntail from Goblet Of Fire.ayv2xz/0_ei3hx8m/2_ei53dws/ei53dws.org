There was one... I think I've read the fic you have but I can't remember it's name. I know that there's a mentor!Salazar_Slytherin fic where Harry uses a time turner and leaves himself a hint about using the mini-dragon against the real one. It's one of those fics where Harry has skillz in transfiguration and transfigured his lungs and airways to give himself real gills. Gets right into the details too.
