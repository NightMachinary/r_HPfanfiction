My head canon: Dobby had hoarded Harry Potter junk the same way Kreacher had hoarded Black Family heirlooms. Somewhere in the smallest dormitories of Hogwarts there is a Harry Potter shrine with a broken sneak-o-scope, some chocolate frog wrappers, an empty vial that once held lucky potion, and a scrap of parchment with “Mrs Cho Potter” in a heart. The horntail model would be there too.
