The was a fanfic that had Harry keep it as a pet but I don't remember the name. Harry also had a couple of pixies from second year living in his robes pockets as well as his tamed Monster Book of Monsters from third year as pets. I think he also had something from first year, but I don't remember. Might of been hedwig though.
