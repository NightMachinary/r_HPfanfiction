1. Calista Snape from linkffn(Always in Your Shadow:Calista Snape Volume I) and sequels is the most detailed OC in the fandom. Around 1M words of what amounts to a detailed character study from age 6 to post-Hogwarts. Follows canon plot with mc 5 years older than Harry. Interaction with the trio is minimal. The story heavily focuses on OC's relation with her father and recovery from childhood abuse/torture with pairings later on in the series.

2. Guinevere Weasley & Co from Linkao3(Rose Petal Red): Not your typical SI fic with tons of original worldbuilding. An entire year full of Slytherin!OC's with their own backstories and interactions. See also a unique and complete Dark!AU of this fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14154777/chapters/69533256]]

3. Amalia Gray from linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) is a slightly OP OC with an innovative backstory. It is rare to see a character interact with Riddle on equal footing. Highly recommend.

It is difficult to find well-constructed male OC'S any recs?
