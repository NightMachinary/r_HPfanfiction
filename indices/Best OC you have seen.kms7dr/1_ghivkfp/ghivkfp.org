Kitty from "Behind blue eyes" of elmembrila.

I know the name "Kitty" might not be the best (it's not her actual name but it's still a bit cringe worthy in the beginning), but she's honestly the first OC I ever cared about. The first two or three chapters of the fic aren't the best, and pairing is Harry/OC so if you like Hinny be warned, but her character has such an amazing growth throughout the fic it's amazing. By the end of the fic I cared more about her well being then pretty much anyone but Harry and Tonks.

It is an Angst fest of a fic, so be warned about that too, I think I stopped reading angst for abouth 2 months after I finished this fic.

Bonus points because it's got a great struggling Tonks trying to make her way in a world that doesn't exactly care about her.

Harry's development is amazing, as is his way of moving on from Sirius' death.
