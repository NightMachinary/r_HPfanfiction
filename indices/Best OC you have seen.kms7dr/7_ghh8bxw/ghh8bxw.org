Grace Potter from Flying. Shes James' younger sister with a magical disease. Theres a sequel that takes place in her 7th year but I haven't read it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18000086]])

The reason I say its the best is because its the longest OC fic I've read/finished. There's also Mayumi from linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24711019]]) but she's just a massive troll and that story is crack.
