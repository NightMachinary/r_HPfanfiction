Peter still lives mostly in my mind! I have two very short ficlets [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/tagged/peter%20pettigrew][here]]; I've been more interested in writing about the perception of him, because fandom like to ignore him or put up giant warning signs going "hey, this boy's gonna turn out evil." The girls I like to explore more in how they challenge the perception of bravery.

I read very little nowadays, so I always choose the stories that have a strong voice, because that's usually an indicator of quality elsewhere. For me, if the prose is boring, the story is boring.
