I totally agree - I love seeking out those characters. Can you link to your Peter fic? I've never tried to read from his POV or on his experiences before.

I agree, writing in different tenses is a great way to shake things up.

I click out of a story, even if the plot seems promising, if someone hasn't formatted their dialogue correctly. Especially with a space after a speech mark eg. " Harry, what's wrong?" gahhhh
