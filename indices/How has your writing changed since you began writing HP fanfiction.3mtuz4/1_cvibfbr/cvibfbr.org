1. I like seeking out characters I didn't like in canon and writing about them to understand them, or at least, their motives. I'm much more sympathetic to Lavender and Cho now, and I've dabbled in writing Peter.

2. My prior experience in writing was mostly theater scripts for Speech. I was a dialogue nut and descriptions terrified me. The best thing that I did was alternate between a third person rotating PoV story and a first person present story, because it forced me to write two different styles of descriptions, and they would improve the other. Also, tenses don't deter me from reading anything anymore.

3. I have an immediate reaction based on writing style that'll determine whether I'll likely like the story.
