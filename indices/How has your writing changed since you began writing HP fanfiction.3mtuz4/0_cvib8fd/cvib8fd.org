The more stories I viewed, the more I hated Ron. When I started writing my own stories, I based the characters off friends, family, exgf's, ect. I ended up liking Ron a lot more than I did in canon or fanon since he was partially based off of my best friend.

I've also started writing reviews on stories I read, which is something I never did before.
