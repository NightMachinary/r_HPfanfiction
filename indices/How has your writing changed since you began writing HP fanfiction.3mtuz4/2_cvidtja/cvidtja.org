Nothing's really changed in terms of HP fanfiction. In terms of fanfiction in general, my first few fics are a special kind of crap, but I like to think I've gotten good at it by now. And yeah, what author hasn't written a stupidly long author's note? I used to be one of those writers who would make characters blush a squillion and a half times a second. It was baaaaaaaaaaad.
