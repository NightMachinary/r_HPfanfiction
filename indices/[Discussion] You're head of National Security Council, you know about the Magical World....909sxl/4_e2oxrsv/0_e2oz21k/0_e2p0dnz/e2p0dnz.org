  their children are just as vulnerable as any children. Voila, instant wizarding cooperation.

It wouldn't work. Even with the witch burnings wizards mostly seemed immune to it, with one book in-universe mentioning how a simple Charm made them ineffective. Wizards were almost never caught in witch burnings in HP. And as I mentioned, Imperius makes it trivial for wizards to get at any muggle, in addition to this assymstrey: wizards can blend in, Muggles can't blend in, nor even find, wizards.

Fidelius was only brought up to show how even if Muggles were willing to nuke /themselves/ to kill wizards with them, wizards have a defense than can stop it. But even barring that, typical defense (Muggle repelling, /Protego Horribilis/, Muffliato and the like) will stop any muggle attempt at getting at any wizard who intended to defend their home.
