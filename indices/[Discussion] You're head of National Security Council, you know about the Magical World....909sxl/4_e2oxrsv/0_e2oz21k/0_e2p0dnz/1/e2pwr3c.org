The discussion prompt says that we're head of the National Security Council and we know about magic. The next time a wizard apparates into the office we could tranq them, take their wand and remove them to a secure location. They're still human and vulnerable to interrogation. I mean, there are so many ways this could go, but witches and wizards are clearly not invulnerable to muggles who know they exist.

And about the witch burning... How explicit were your school textbooks about the history of genocide and slavery and labour conditions (e.g. coal mining in the 1900s) when you were in school? I can tell you that mine were pretty tame. We don't want to traumatize children with actual knowledge of how awful the world can be. Even if this doesn't apply to fictional witch burning in HP, what happens if you don't know the flame freeze charm? What happens if while you're running from the mob you drop your wand? What happens to the kids you've left at home? Assuming you manage to get away you'll still have to leave the community, now you're stuck alone in the medieval countryside having to build a house, farm and find supplies. You are isolated from human contact and vulnerable to attack by marauders and the only magic you have access to is whatever you can still remember from highschool.
