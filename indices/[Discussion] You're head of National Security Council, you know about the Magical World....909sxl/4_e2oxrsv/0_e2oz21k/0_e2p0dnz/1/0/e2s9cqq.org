  The next time a wizard apparates into the office we could tranq them, take their wand and remove them to a secure location.

You realize tranquilizers don't act instantly, right? They could just Apparate away. Not to mention the issue of keeping a team permanently on watch for a teleporting being who can also manipulate them into leaving several different ways (Obliviate, Muggle repelling, Imperius, etc.). Not to mention the obvious problem: they have to return the wand for the wizard to help them. Bam, they lose because otherwise the wizard is useless to them.

  Even if this doesn't apply to fictional witch burning in HP, what happens if you don't know the flame freeze charm
#+end_quote

It's noted to be a simple Charm in the textbook. Again, this requires them to be completely caught off guard by attempts. If they tried to.come after their kids (somehow, given magic dwellings are hidden from muggles) they would be more apt in their response given the witches burnings already happened and were, in HP history, regarded as mostly failing since Muggles aren't good at spotting magic.
