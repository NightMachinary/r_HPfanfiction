I think I've already kinda addressed this. The problem is simple. If they capture the wizard, eventually they have to give him back the wand if they're to be useful at all. And then in that case it's over because then they can escape or fight out. Fudge isn't a weak wizard so mentioning him alongside Stan is kinda silly.

The examples you gave seem pretty clear. The Shield Charm creates.an actual wall that's invisible and deflects minor spells at a minimum. The wall knocks away physical objects too. JKR has said a bunch in Pottermore that, as a general rule in HP, the magical trumps the non-magical. There's no real reason a Shield Charm can physically keep out hundreds of Wizards when Harry cast it yet a bullet or explosive gets through it. It has nothing to do with the person being magical or not, it's a wall.
