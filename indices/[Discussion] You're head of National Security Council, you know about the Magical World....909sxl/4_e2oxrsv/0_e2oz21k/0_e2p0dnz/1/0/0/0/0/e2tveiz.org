I guess that explains where you're coming from. But it's obvious to me that you're inflating the capabilities of wizards: they're still human, they will make mistakes and they're limited by their personal skills and abilities to strategize. And it's debatable whether protego would protect them from physical projectiles and gas or rear attacks, and since we know nothing about the physics of magic there are all sorts of avenues available to experiment with disrupting apparition too. A motivated NSC chief would have all sorts of resources to bring against someone like Fudge, who doesn't seem like he would be prepared to evade them.
