But do most witches/wizards have those skills? We're actually shown over and over again that the average magical human has pretty weak skills. People are charged for apparating without a licence because they've splinched themselves, and legilimency is so rare that occlumency doesn't seem to be a standard part of the Hogwarts curriculum. The muggle repelling though, I'll give you, because I don't think there's ever a scene when a muggle accidentally stumbles into the magical world.

So given how most witches and wizards are not prepared to fend off trained muggles do you really think that in a contest between Stan Shunpike and intelligence operatives, or Fudge and the head of the NSC the muggles really have no change of winning? And once you've capture one wizard it becomes easier to capture others.

On the second point about the Shield Spell, you were so emphatic that I thought I'd better check. There is never a single occasion when Protego is used to repel anything material from the non-magical world. It repels spells, the enchanted waterfall at Gringotts and other magical humans. It never repels anything remotely like a small highly energetic bullet. It might be able to, but it's certainly not silly to question whether it could, let alone whether it would work against gases or non-frontal attacks.

/He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary,invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs/ Jinx CH31GoF

It's possible that the wall doesn't do anything other than repel magic. That would be consistent with the way a strongly cast protego forces magical humans back, like magnetic poles repelling.

/“Protego!”/

/His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk./ CH9HBP

/“Protego!” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell,/ CH15DH

/“Protego!”/

/The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor./ CH19DH

It looks to me like these examples (and I didn't include them all) are consistent with magical repulsion, but I guess it could be a physical barrier too.
