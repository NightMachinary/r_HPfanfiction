If they're trying to use the wizard to deliver nukes (as mentioned in the OP) they're going to need their wands. Unless that wizard is experienced at wandless magic, they're basically a Muggle without the wand. And once that person goes missing, the Ministry isn't going to be blindsided by Muggles again because they've already seen they can be brutal towards them.

I don't really see how a Pottermore article written by JKR can be considered anything other than canon. That said, I'll try and find it later, but she has said before that in general magic triumphs over mundane things (and has elsewhere given examples of this, such as saying they can cure any non-magical illness).

  This second thing is that the examples I gave are consistent with multiple explanations about how the physics of the magical environment works. It could be an invisible wall, it could also be magical repulsion field, it could also be an invisible spot that moves around to deflect material so quickly that it looks like a wall. Not all of the millions of possible explanations are equally likely, but you don't get to call them silly and rule them out without counter-evidence...which I don't think you have.

Except you quote exactly what clears this up from canon. Look (emphasis added):

  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, /invisible wall/ around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx CH31GoF

Stan is clearly made out to be not particularly noteworthy with magic. Fudge isn't just politically powerful, he holds the top office in the land. Subpar wizards can't get that far, the entrance requirements to get into various Ministry positions makes that nearly impossible (he was a junior Minister before he became the Minister for Magic). Remember, Fudge arrived on the scene to catch Sirius when Pettigrew blew up the entire street they were on, he came with the Hit Wizards.
