You addressed the issue of capture by assuming that the wizard would get his wand back. And I didn't bother explaining that if you were the first wizard I caught I might never give you back your wand, you might not even survive the interrogation. But I would definitely learn more about the magical world and it would become easier to capture other witches/wizards (or muggleborn children) and use them differently.

As for the issue of the wall, two points: we might draw the boundaries around what constitutes canon source material in different ways (I don't include Pottermore, but would be willing to consider anything you quote).\\
This second thing is that the examples I gave are consistent with multiple explanations about how the physics of the magical environment works. It could be an invisible wall, it could also be magical repulsion field, it could also be an invisible spot that moves around to deflect material so quickly that it looks like a wall. Not all of the millions of possible explanations are equally likely, but you don't get to call them silly and rule them out without counter-evidence...which I don't think you have.

And I still think brains beats magic, so a smart muggle could catch a stupid wizard. (What evidence is there that Fudge is a powerful wizard? he's political ly powerful, but is he a good spellcaster?)
