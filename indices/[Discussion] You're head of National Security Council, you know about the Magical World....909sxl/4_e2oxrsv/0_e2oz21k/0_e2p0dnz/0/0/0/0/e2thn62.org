You're looking at it too simplistically and ignoring some facts. The magical community had been persecuted from /centuries/ before enacting the Statute of Secrecy. Sir Nick, for example, was killed in the 15th century, and Lissette despite Lapin had been using magic to have fun with attempted witch burnings as far back as 1422. The real changing point was the refusal of William the 2nd to liaise with the newly created Ministry of Magic is why they suddenly did the SoS, because by that point Muggles had become so crazed that they were killing a bunch of other Muggles in their attempts to eradicate wizards (meaning they were failing to even find wizards a lot of the time).

To say they were effective is to ignore a lot, especially as the wizards could have (as many wanted) waged war and won against the Muggles.
