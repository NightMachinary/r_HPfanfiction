The average wizarding family is distinctly vulnerable given their ignorance of Muggle tech (canonically true in the 1990s, likely much worse in the 1950s-80s) and their children are just as vulnerable as any children. Voila, instant wizarding cooperation.

Not to mention the fact that the Fidelius would be effective against Voldemort too and yet no one outside of the Order appears to use it. The average magical family really doesn't seem capable of the kind of defense you're describing.
