There's no effective policy. Not only could wizards, if pressed, learn to do whatever Muggles do, they can Imperiuse a few to do whatever technical work they'd need. Combined with their ability to teleport, Transfigure and charm whatever they need, completely hide their dwellings from any Muggle interaction or attack, what policy is going to do diddly against them?

Worst comes to worst and the Muggles are willing to nuke themselves to take the wizards with them (which could probably be stopped by just transfiguring the bombs into something harmless, or using Fidelius over every magic home). But since they're trying to win a Cold War, that's out. There's just nothing, ignoring them is the only option.
