Initial paranoia, but giving way to rational thought before doing anything rash. That's /if/ they understand enough about the magical world to make that assessment. The only canon indication we have of that is Fudge's interactions with the Prime Minister, and Fudge (we hope) isn't a representative sample.

A national security chief will recognize that the greatest nuclear threat actually comes from muggle-borns. The magical population is so small that nukes could wipe it out almost completely, and no would-be dark lord would be stupid enough to use them. Indeed, purebloods might undertake actions to detect and/or stop missile launches.

A muggle-born, on the other hand, could easily be a true believer in Soviet communism/American capitalism and might have means and motive to Apparate a nuke into Washingon/Moscow, thinking the sneak attack would be enough to swing the inevitable nuclear war.

Now presumably, for whatever reason, there's no way to transfigure a nuclear weapon. If that were possible, someone would have tried it by now and more than likely blown themselves up by accident. However, the existing nukes would be a very great security risk, so it would be important to load them up with enough security to thwart a lone or small group of magical attackers--enough guards that they can't subdue or memory wipe all of them before they sound an alarm and enough computer failsafes that even a muggle-born wouldn't know how to disable them all.

Of course, the weak link is leader of the magical government. If they try to pull a Fudge, grab them or call security on them if you can, and impress upon them that wizards are under greater threat from "unimportant" muggle politics than the muggles are. It's far from a sure thing, but then it was far from a sure thing that we made it through the Cold War without nuking ourselves on purpose either, so it's probably the best you're going to get.
