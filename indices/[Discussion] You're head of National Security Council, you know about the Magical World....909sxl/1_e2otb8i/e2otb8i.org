Well, I doubt that the average wizard knows enough about nuclear weapons to operate them or to circumvent the safety. You need to do more than pressing a red button, you know.

Also, what's stopping him from transfiguring iron into uranium U235and building his own bomb (rather difficult, but should be doable with enough trial and error) or simply creating a dirty bomb? You might be able to defend the storage sites against wizards, but there are so many ways how they could get around it that actually bothering to construct any defences seems pointless. Especially considering magical mind control.
