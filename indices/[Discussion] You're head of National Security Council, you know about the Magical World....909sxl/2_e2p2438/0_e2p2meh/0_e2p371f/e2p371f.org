Take downs? If you're subverting peoples beliefs you aren't taking anything down. You're letting them continue on as they have been while undermining their culture.

What do squibs have that muggles do not? They can live in both worlds. They are allowed to know about both. Use that. Squibs and the families of muggleborns would make up a support infrastructure for the muggleborns.

Make a new side. Instead of just muggles and wizards, muggleborns and squibs would be their own side of things. Make a modern magic world that makes the traditional wizarding world look like barbarians.

Those muggleborn families that grow up there will eventually become pureblood families that will hold the worldview that you have created for them to hold.
