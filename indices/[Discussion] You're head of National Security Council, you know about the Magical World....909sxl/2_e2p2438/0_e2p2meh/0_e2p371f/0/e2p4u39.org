Squibs have next to no influence on wizarding culture, whether it's in their values or their government. They have no means to undermine it, culturally or militarily.

As I said, this wouldn't work outside the UK. There doesn't seem to be much, if anything, made of about blood status outside there. The closest we know of is the US, where Muggle-Wizard interactions were almost entirely banned until the 60s.

So all in all, Squibs won't be able to do any subversion, there's hardly any of them (they're noted that be rarities). Muggleborns have a better shot, but again the issue is in canon they mostly abandon the Muggle world.
