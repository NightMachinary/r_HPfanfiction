The disanalogy is kind of obvious though. Muggleborns, outside of the times around the Death Eater movement, didn't live in a Jim Crow-like system. In Jim Crow, African Americans couldn't become president, yet just a decade or so before Voldemort, Muggle-borns attained the highest office in the land, and thus (unless we're being silly) also managed to get whatever positions come before that individual got up to Minister. Those are too disanalogous situations.

It doesn't mean discrimination didn't exist, it just means the type of discrimination wasn't refusals for muggleborns getting high-level government jobs (some had already been on the Wizengamot as well, I believe).
