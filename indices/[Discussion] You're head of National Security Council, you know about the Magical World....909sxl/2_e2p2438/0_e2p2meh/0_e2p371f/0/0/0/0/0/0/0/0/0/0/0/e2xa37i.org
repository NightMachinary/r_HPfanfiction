  Have you ANY shred of evidence that muggleborns weren't discriminated against?

That wasn't my argument. There is no evidence that there was a glass ceiling for them in government, that doesn't mean other kinds for discrimination didn't exist. That they reached the Wizengamot and Minister of Magic is literally proof of this because if they barred them from advancing at all there would be no way for them to get into the high Court and the highest political office.
