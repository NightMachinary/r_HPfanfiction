You aren't making sense. Unless the /entire/ magical world is completely caught off guard as Squibs attempt to subvert their entire system, it has no shot of succeeding because they'd fight back against the changes. Family members of muggleborns would have zero influence and so aren't worth mentioning.

  Muggleborns abandon the muggle world because there is no place where they can have the best of both worlds.

This is a fantasy. Outside of very obviously problematic times (The Voldemort Wars), muggleborns didn't have any reason to abandon the wizarding world. Hell Wizarding UK, which seems to be more conservative than other magical societies, had a Muggleborn Minister of Magic a few decades before the start of the series. There was no glass ceiling mentioned for them in workplaces the way we see in real life so again they've no reason to leave (especially since the Muggle world would inescapably treat them as bad or worse as blood supremacists do). You're not making any sense.

  Cultural impact will happen on its own just by such a place existing. [...] Media, Music, and Architecture are powerful influences. Especially to young people.

You have completely changed your argument. You initially said Squibs & Muggle-borns could be used to subvert them by "offering them cushy lives outside the wizarding world". None of your suggestions would have any effect on policy relating to using wizards to win a Cold War...
