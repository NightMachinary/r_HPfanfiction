That's not comparable. I didn't say there was no anti-Muggleborn bias or discrimination, I said there was no glass ceiling (that is, jobs that are formally or informally impossible for some demographic to attain). The argument I responded to was suggesting Muggle-borns are basically poor and so they could be persuaded by Muggle governments in leaving the wizarding world for cushy lives they would be offered. That isn't even hinted at in canon, they aren't an economic underclass.
