And my point is that if we have discriminatory laws, it's stupid to assume that everything is fine for muggleborns and they aren't, you know, actually discriminated against.

It's like taking a look at the Jim Crow laws in the South, then going "since I haven't actually seen any example of African-Americans facing a glass ceiling, just the laws (and I didn't take a look), there isn't one".

Where there's smoke, there's fire. If you have discriminatory laws on the books, odds are society is fucked up as well.
