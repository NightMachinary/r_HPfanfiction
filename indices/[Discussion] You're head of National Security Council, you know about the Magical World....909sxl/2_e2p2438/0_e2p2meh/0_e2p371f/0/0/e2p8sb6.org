A squib or a family member of a muggleborn:

Can know about magic.

Own magical creatures.

Own magical items.

Own magical plants.

Shop in magic stores.

Own a magic store.

Use a magic bank.

etc...

That is significantly more than a muggle is going to be able to do. This makes them a resource. The applications should be obvious.

Muggleborns abandon the muggle world because there is no place where they can have the best of both worlds. Make that place and they'll come to you.

Cultural impact will happen on its own just by such a place existing. You don't need to actively change wizards minds about anything. When your people live in a city that [[https://i.imgur.com/mBzcSZr.jpg][looks like this]] and they live in the past, the contrast speaks more than any words you could say.

Media, Music, and Architecture are powerful influences. Especially to young people.
