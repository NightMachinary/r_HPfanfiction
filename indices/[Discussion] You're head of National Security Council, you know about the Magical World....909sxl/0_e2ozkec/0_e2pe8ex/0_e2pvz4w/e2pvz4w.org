You might have noticed that nukes weren't actually dropped on major cities during the Cold War. That's because the goal was never to "fuck everything" but only to threaten to. Look up nuclear brinkmanship.

You want your enemy to know that you can match their weapons capabilities (mutually assured destruction) and you want to keep your technological advances secret for as long as you can while also collecting intelligence to make sure they haven't surpassed your capabilities (arms race and espionage.)

So I stand by the original statement. Magic would be better applied in espionage than bombing.
