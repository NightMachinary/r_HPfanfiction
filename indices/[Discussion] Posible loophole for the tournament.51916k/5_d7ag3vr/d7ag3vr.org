You could certainly write that. You could also have it require at least a token effort, so Harry can't just step across the starting line and immediately retreat. Or the Goblet might produce a mental compulsion that forces Harry to try to win. Or it might track his intention to compete, so that he must try as hard as he can, and Dumbledore could shut him in the dungeons during the event and trap him in bonds he can't break.

There are a lot of ways to play with the tournament relative to Harry's degree of participation and desire to win.
