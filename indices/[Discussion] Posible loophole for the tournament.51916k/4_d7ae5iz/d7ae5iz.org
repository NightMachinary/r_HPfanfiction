The goblet binds you to participate. It may bind you to participate actively, but it certainly doesn't bind you to use a given strategy or type of strategy.

I'd like to read the story of Harry in the first task. He enters the arena, sits in a corner and simply waits for the dragon to fall asleep and then catch the egg.

Meanwhile, the story would focus on an impossible (and really cracky) situation that would emerge from the actions of some people in the public and grow out of control. Something with a lot of misunderstandings and shenanigans. Some slapstick maybe...

Is there something like that out there?
