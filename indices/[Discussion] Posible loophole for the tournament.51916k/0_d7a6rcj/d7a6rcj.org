It's certainly not excluded by canon.

However, it should be noted that even in the Muggle world, contracts can contain terms which refer to parties using their "best endeavours" or "reasonable endeavours" to procure some result. I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that the binding magical contract of the Goblet of Fire contains such a provision, simply because if it didn't, you'd think Dumbledore (not to mention Maxime and Karkaroff) would have taken advantage of it to de facto exclude Harry from the tournament.

Further, consider the alternative. The Goblet can't bind you into winning the tournament, because then the losers would be in breach of contract. So it surely must bind you only into participation. You'd think any definition of participation worth its weight would be one of active participation.
