I dont think he could simply forfeit without breaching the contract as its "participation" implies active participation. But without reading the contract no one really knows so it could certainly be written and be perfectly believable.

That said, the loophole I have always been curious about relates more to "cheating". You never hear about whether there are any provisions in the contract relating to cheating. And since many of the champions do get "help" from someone, what constitutes cheating and if someone does cheat, what would happen. Cheating of course covers a pretty wide variety of possibilities, from spells that are darker, to useage of things that bypass aspects of challenges (for example a portkey to the bottom of the lake or secret path directly to the center of the maze).
