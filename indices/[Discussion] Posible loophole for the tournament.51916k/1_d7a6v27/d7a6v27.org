There was recently a story request thread about that:

  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4yqea0/any_stories_in_which_harry_deliberately_flanks/][Any stories in which Harry deliberately flunks the Tournament tasks after being roped into it?]] I don't see how even a “magically binding” artefact could make him not merely participate in it but aim to win as well. /(submitted 15 days ago)/

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/][/Harry Potter: Unchampion/]] (25,236 WL; Complete) --- the most realistic outcome portrayed. In other stories Harry's decisions of non-competition suddenly ends up being beneficial for him in various ways. Here it's mostly what it is, him saving himself the trouble and risks attached to TWT.

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/][/Muggle-Raised Champion/]] (106,020 WL; WiP) --- technically well-written story and interesting to read, but unfortunately also has wishful thinking elements. Harry decides to waste minimal effort on each task, but somehow the odds end up on his side each time and he ends up winning without even planning to.

    - +/Here's to the Losers/+ --- badly written, wishful thinking, crackfic

    - +/Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion/+ --- badly written, toilet humour, wishful thinking, crackfic, Weasley bashing
