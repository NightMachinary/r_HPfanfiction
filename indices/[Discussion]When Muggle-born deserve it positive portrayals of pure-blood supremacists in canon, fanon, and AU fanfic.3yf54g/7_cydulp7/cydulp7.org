The system I tend to gravitate towards is, I think, a combination of all 3... in a 'sort of, kind of' manner:

Rather than it being some manner of ancestor worship, muggle-born magic is different in the sense that it's more generalized. Think Specialist Wizard in DnD compared to a Mage.

In a DnD party of adventurers you might what the generalist because finding out your prohibited school would be super useful right now is a major inconvenience.

But in a society of wizards? If the Yaxleys are known for having a family knack for 'charms that relate to fire' then if you don't cast them yourself, you're probably going to want to hire a Yaxley to install your home's fire suppression charms.

Providing a rational basis for the purebloods reaction to muggleborn is easy enough if you assume that not only do they lack a specialty, but that any kids you have with one might not get your family's specialty. Especially if you couple that detail with a tendency, back in the day, to be a security liability during witch burnings.

Obviously the way magic works is probably far less rigidly defined than straight genetics would usually indicate, but you could even establish a a basis for the definition of pureblood being no muggle grandparents if that's how long it takes a wizarding line to settle down and stop bucking family traits. It might be that Muggleborn merely introduce some randomness to the outcome and that introducing some new blood to your family line can kick out an old trait that was lost (Like Nymphadora being a Metamorph. That might be Ted shaking out a trait that used to be a common thing for blacks.)

The idea above originally came from a Peggy Sue / Dimension Travel fic I read once but I can't recall anything else about it (like the name) at the moment.
