If you want a fanon explanation that would make both sides have valid points, a version of #3 could work. Let's say that studies suggest the influx of Muggleborns and Muggle blood will eventually weaken magical ability. Thousands of years down the road, magic could eventually become very weak with too much breeding with Muggles. Hence, Blood supremacists have a valid reason to fear the mating with muggles.

On the other hand, there isn't enough magical individuals to maintain an appropriate genetic variance. Wizards need muggles to continue to survive. So it's a bit of a catch-22. Wizards need to mate with muggles to continue to survive. But by mating with muggles, they are diluting their magical abilities. Not only is this a conundrum, but it also poses an interesting debate. Incredible Power for the few vs A little bit of Power for the many.

Of course, this goes completely against canon but it might be interesting to think about in an AU.
