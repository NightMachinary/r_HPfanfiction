  *Gun Safety Program Sets off Community Dispute*

  Wasilla Alasksa: The dispute began last year when the Wasilla's school board passed a resolution allowing middle schoolers to carry loaded handguns on school property.

  The board initially restricted this practice to only those students who could demonstrate their understanding of firearm safety but has recently made handgun ownership mandatory for all incoming students.

  "This was a matter of practicality and safety" explained board member Cornelius Fudge, "Firearms are a tool, and one that is key to both our local economy and the safety of our towns residents. That is why the board has always supported Firearm Safety classes as a core part of our curriculum."

  These firearm safety programs have historically included 'Theory of Firearms', 'Marksmanship' and instruction of 'Defense Against Dangerous Creatures.'

  Fudge went on to explained that the board's decision came about after two students were badly injured by a polar bear attack. "We realized," explained Fudge, "that disarming students wasn't the way to keep them safe."

  Some parents, including local trapper John 'Fenrir' Greyback, disapproved of this move. "Our society limits underage firearm use for a reason. Yes, I've taught my son to shoot. But he knows that he can only use a gun when I, or another responsible adult, am there to supervise. I trust him, but for god's sake, he's only a kid."

  Asked to respond to these remarks, Local Principal Albus Dumbledore explained that the school keeps careful watch over students. The Principal pointed out that the middle school had four instructors who, except for their other duties, are entirely focused on supervising students.

  The controversy expanded when Principal Dumbledore announced that, as of the beginning of the year, all students would be required to carry a loaded revolver as part of their school supplies.

  "We realized," said Garrick Olivander, local gunsmith, "that many students came from households where neither of their parents owned a gun. In fact, many of these parents didn't even know how to find my shop."

  Several parents, mostly long-time Wasilla residents, have protested the policy of arming children from non-gun-owning households.

  Leading the opposition was local guide Barty Crouch, "I trust my kid," said Crouch, "I've been teaching him about gun-safety and woodcraft since before he could walk. He's responsible, even if he is 11. But it's different when you're talking about kids who've never seen firearms outside of a movie."

  Crouch said that he'd told his son to stay away from students from non-gun-owning households, at least until they'd had a chance to receive basic firearm safety.

  These remarks were echoed by local parent Narcissa Black, who added, "These policies are terrifying. I've seen these kids from newcomer households. They're waving their pistol around like it's a toy. Some of them are even using their guns for games!"

  Dumbledore pushed back against these remarks, saying that games like "Exploding Snap" or "Cowboy's Checkers" were an accepted part of the NRA's curriculum and built students accuracy and comfort with firearms.

  The principal's strongest words were reserved for parents advocating different treatment for children who'd grown up without knowledge of firearms.

  "You can hear this unreasoned tribalism in the way these parents talk." said Dumbledore, "They draw lines between 'locals' and 'newcomers', as if a child's bloodline determined their ability to eventually become an expert marksman or skilled trapper. Worse, they even try to push this horrible notion onto the next generation."

  "There is no reason, literally no reason at all, to think that a perfectly responsible middle-schooler shouldn't be given free and unsupervised use of an instrument of destruction, merely because they've never had an adult role model teach them how to use it safely." concluded the principal.
