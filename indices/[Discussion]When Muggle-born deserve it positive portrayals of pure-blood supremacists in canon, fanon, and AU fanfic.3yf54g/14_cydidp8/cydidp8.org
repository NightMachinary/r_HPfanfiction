I'm not sure why you think its hard to justify, the muggleborns are newcomers coming into the wizarding world with ideals and values that don't necessarily mesh with those of the WW. Culture clash is very much a thing even in the modern world ie Refugees.

Super patriotic American raised during the Cold War might like very much to hurt those evil Reds.

Someone from the American Civil war might want to enslave humans or even their fellow wizards.

A Traditional Muslim might try and force their views on women onto the Wizarding world, or use magic on other muggles to force their compliance.
