I don't see* Magical Britain's Wizards not thinking themselves British. They aren't a separate country. It's more like a religious enclave.

Though now that I think, while I've seen some really cringe-worthy "Hermione is a devout Catholic" or "Wizards are really quite religious behind the scenes" fics, I don't think I've ever read a Muggle religions vs. atheist/Old Ways Wizarding world as a central conflict. Sometimes as a sidenote, or a "they'd burn us for heretics" angle. But not as just pure religious strife and discord. Hmm.
