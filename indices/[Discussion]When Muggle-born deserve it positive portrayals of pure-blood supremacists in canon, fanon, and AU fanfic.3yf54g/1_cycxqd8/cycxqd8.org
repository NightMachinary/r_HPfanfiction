As for the “blood supremacists are right” thing, I really like how Racke explained it in the second of the three one-shots in 41st chapter of his assorted Harry Potter stuff collection (linkffn(8527691)), the one titled “The Founders”.

It does not present them as right, per se, but it does give us a realistic case of how it could have started: the discrimination, Salazar's disagreement, the reason for the existence of the Chamber of Secrets. I'll let this quote, a mere fragment, show what I mean:

#+begin_quote
  "The witch-burnings that are nowadays laughed at for the ineptness of the muggles performing them, take on a very different tone when you realize that it wouldn't be muggles dragging the 'witches' to the pole. [...] To teach muggleborns, is to invite spies. Both from children who wouldn't know to keep certain things quiet from dangerous ears, but also from desperate children wanting to be loved, even if it means to betray their own peers and sentence them to death."
#+end_quote

And from there, as time passed and the wizards did not interact with the muggles all that often, it has gotten twisted into something ugly. Because after some time, isolated from that which they hid themselves from, they forgot the reason why they hid in the first place. Fear became arrogance. Caution became delusions of superiority. A justified but hard potential choice became propaganda of blood purity. There is no “right” to be found there, only “left”, a leftover of what once was, a history with truly no history to learn from, and in the end made into one big mistake. The blood purists feel safe in their arrogance, feel better with their delusions of superiority, because they do not remember how it was to have been afraid, to have been forced to be cautious. How could they have remembered, after all, if the rare dealings with single muggles can as far as they know easily be taken care of with a memory charm and if none of them even remember anyone who truly interacted with muggles.

So they aren't right, as far as I see it. They were justified. And then they were lost, like children wandering in the fog. And that is it.
