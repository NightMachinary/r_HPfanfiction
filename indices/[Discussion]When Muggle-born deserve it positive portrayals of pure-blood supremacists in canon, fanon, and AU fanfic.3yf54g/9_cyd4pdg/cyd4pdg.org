I much prefer the ideas you call "dreck" to any of your "good" explanations.

Incidentally, numbers 2 and 3 are not canon compatible. The Ministry of Magic has no institutional or legal connection to the Muggle government. And we know Muggleborns descend from Squib lines, they're not spontaneous.

Number 1 is I suppose compatible with canon in a very minimal sense of canon. Everything we're shown indicates Muggleborns are the magical peers of Purebloods and everything that magically authoritative characters say affirms this. So it's an idea of canon-compatibility where something is still compatible even when it contradicts those things the characters tell us about magic and which we see borne out in magical interactions.
