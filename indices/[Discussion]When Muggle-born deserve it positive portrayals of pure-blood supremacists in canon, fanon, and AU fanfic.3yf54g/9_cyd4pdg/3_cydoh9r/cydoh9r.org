  Incidentally, numbers 2 and 3 are not canon compatible. The Ministry of Magic has no institutional or legal connection to the Muggle government. And we know Muggleborns descend from Squib lines, they're not spontaneous.

Neither of these are irreparable, I think:

- Item 2 could have happened not due to appeals to the Muggle legal system but as an idealistic reform pushed by Dumbledore and Nobby Leach.
- Item 3 can be fixed by postulating that Muggle genes can interact with magic in unpredictable ways: there is no way of knowing how a particular Muggle's genes will manifest when crossed with a Wizard's, and doubly so for Muggleborns. Now, Wizard genes can interact in weird ways too, but since they come from Wizards, how they are likely to manifest is a known quantity. We do, IIRC, have JKR's word that Vernon Dursley's would have suppressed any magical potential, so that's not inconsistent with canon.
