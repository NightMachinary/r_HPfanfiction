If someone like Genghis Khan was part of a Squib line, then a decent chunk of humanity would be capable of randomly producing magical offspring without any clear close ancestor being magical or Squib. It would present itself like random occurrences in the population. Do we know if Squib+Muggle can produce magical offspring or if Squib+Squib is the lowest requirement?
