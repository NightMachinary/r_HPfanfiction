  Q: How exactly do muggleborns receive magical ability?

  A: Muggleborns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The gene re-surfaces in some unexpected places.

  Q: You promised that someone will do magic late in life in book 7. I've now read it three times but cant work out who it might have been! Please help!!
