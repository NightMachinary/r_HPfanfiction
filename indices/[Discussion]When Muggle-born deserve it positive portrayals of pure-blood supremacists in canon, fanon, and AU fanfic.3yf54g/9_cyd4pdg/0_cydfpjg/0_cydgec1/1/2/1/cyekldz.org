I think HP is pretty radical, actually. Besides the coded language for racism, homophobia/ AIDS, a rag tag group of teens and young adults take down a corrupt government, create their own diy media, their own tiny militia/study group and defeat a despot. Even Dr. Seuss talks about racism. The best media for children always has larger messages about the world.
