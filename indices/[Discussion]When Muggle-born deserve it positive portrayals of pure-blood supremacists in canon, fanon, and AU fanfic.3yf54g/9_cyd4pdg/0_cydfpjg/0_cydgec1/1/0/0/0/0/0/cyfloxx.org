Thank you, and I hope that I can keep on making what I write understandable; since this time I know where the problem lies, if I start slipping just write where I am doing it and I'll fix it, though here's to hoping it will not be necessary. And thanks for replying, while I'm at it.

  But see, if Hermione is from a squib line, maybe her blood is that of someone great, reemerging. Once you start saying it does matter that you were related to some wizard in the past, it blows the idea of everyone being born equal, and anyone possibly being born to magic.
#+end_quote

Ah, that is true, and I have to admit I failed to consider this particular angle of the problem in my previous comment. I could say that “in my defense ...” and follow with a note about how I was looking at the propaganda of blood purity as applied to muggleborn with the default assumption that the muggleborn are inferior, but in the end that would only be making excuses since I was the one who didn't note that.

Though I don't think it's necessarily bad storytelling, per se. If anything, I think the fact that this wasn't actually explored properly (and many people, probably including you, will agree that the recurring problem with the last books are that they were too narrow in scope of the world presented while trying to show some sort of big conflict; things weren't explored properly, in other words), is what can make it bad storytelling. I mean, the idea itself that blood matters even if people are not aware of it and that spontaneous occurences of people with some sort of special power (being a wizard or a witch, in this case) is a result of people not tracking their blood properly, rather than it truly being spontaneous, is nothing new and I've seen it presented fairly well a few times.

And to be honest, it would actually be ironic, and I think in a fairly delightful way, if Hermione really was descended from some really important wizard from times long gone; it most likely isn't the case, but the possibility is something I find amusing. I do agree about the fact that it all being genetics takes away much of the magic; however, I will note that we only care because we are adult people trying to get into it in-depth, and children usually don't try to analyse it that deeply so for them the magic still holds, sort of like with Santa Claus or any equivalent.

  I think it means something that the only Metamorph is the daughter of one of the oldest bloodlines around.
#+end_quote

Yes, but on the other hand her blood would be considered tainted by some because of her father being a muggleborn wizard, so I think she's meant to be an example for both sides. But I do agree that the trait of metamorphmagic passed down in the Black family does mean something for this, yes.

The entirety of metamorphmagic is woefully underexplored in canon, though, I have to say; the ability is supposed to have very wide boundaries, and yet in the books it amounts to a bag of tricks with no real use.

#+begin_quote
  I think it means something that the only Animagus we have in canon seem to all pure-bloods (based on how Voldemort and the others treat Pettigrew, he seems to be one, just not well liked). No one even tries to teach Harry, almost like there wouldn't be a point for him.
#+end_quote

I think this is mostly because, “cool factor” aside, changing into an animal probably isn't all that people think it is. It did help Sirius escape from Azkaban, yes, but we still see him being pretty much a broken shell of a person (constantly mistaking Harry for James because something isn't quite right with him, for example). And if we ignore Minerva whose reasons we don't know and Rita whose reason is probably her want of a good (and scandalous) story, the only people we see changing into animals are people who actually have a good reason for even trying, a reason that has nothing to do with blood (Remus's lycantrophy, namely, and the fact that werewolves don't attack animals).

Also, I have my own headcanon, which probably has no grounding in anything in the series but as far as I know isn't contradicted by anything, that being an animagus isn't about changing into an animal but about being able to retain one's self fully in this form and being able to change back on their own and then finally being able to change without a wand; we did see people get changed into animals (Draco and Victor, one by someone else and the other partially on his own), so I think it stands to reason that if one wanted they could transfigure themselves into animals, they just would have problems changing back on their own unless they trained for that which would make them animagi. On that note, I use an extension of this to explain why it was only in Prisoner of Azkaban that the map actually picked out Peter Pettigrew: he could have simply allowed the rat to take over rather than being a rat himself, which would make the map pick up a rat rather than a person, but after Sirius's escape he was simply too self-conscious to be able to do that anymore.

But yes, it is possible for anyone trying to write a story to ascribe one's ability to become an animagus to the purity of their blood. I don't think I've seen it happen yet but it might make for an interesting plot point.

  I think it means something that the most unusually perceptive and intelligent girl who isn't Hermione is Luna, another pure-blood. The bravest and most classically heroic characters? Ron, Cedric, and Neville, all pure-bloods.
#+end_quote

Good point with the heroic characters, though that might or might not be because of their upbringing (or the fact that they simply happen to be important enough characters by Madame Rowling's random choice) rather than because of their blood; still, the fact that Harry and Hermione aside we don't really have any prominent non-pureblooded characters among the children is fairly telling.

With Luna however ... well, I do want to agree here, especially since I do like her portrayal as someone perceptive and intelligent (for as long as it's not overdone), but I think that canonically she might actually be meant to be a character used to show that being wrong is fine. And I think this kind of muddles the whole point that Luna might be used to make, because we can never be sure if anything she says is being perceptive or intelligent or if it instead is her making things up and just happening to be right.

  It really looks ugly when no other Muggle-born or even half-bloods seem to do well in the story.
#+end_quote

That is true, yes, and very telling. Because even with how rare muggleborn would be with the decision that Mademe Rowling made, even if there aren't all that many half-bloods in the series, we only see two muggleborns (Hermione, and posthumously Lily) who amount to anything plot-wise, and four half-bloods; of note is the fact, however, that all of those half-bloods are fairly important characters: Albus, Harry, Tom, Severus. I think many people forget about blood status of three out of four of these characters, really, but I guess it's understandable since Harry is the only one that isn't “just sort of somewhere there”. Still, there were half-blooded and muggleborn characters just waiting to be used in the seventh book at the very least, so I think the question should be “why didn't Madame Rowling actually use them for anything worthwhile?”

#+begin_quote
  That someone has to be from a lost wizard lines means blood does matter. There is a line to carry on, a single point spreading out through history. This makes pre-blood supremacist wizards more functionally (if not morally) right in their exclusionary, anti-muggle breeding habits than any Nazi ever was.
#+end_quote

A scary though, isn't it? I wonder if Madame Rowling actually noticed that at any point. It still does not justify their approach towards muggleborn, mind you (especially in case of Dolores Umbridge, who is just one big ball of emotional issues), but it does put some things in a different light.

And it goes even further: If muggleborns are not actually a thing and are simply old blood reawakening, are wizards even truly human? Or are they simply something looking like humans and able to reproduce with humans but that's it? And could it all have been avoided if only the wizards of the past had simply killed off all of their squib children rather than allowing them to live?

#+begin_quote
  I just happen to think they're not exploring the logical conclusions of JKR's casual breaking of her own world.
#+end_quote

Hmm ... yes? No? Sort of?

When I called their behaviour not right, I was referring to the dismissal of muggleborns on the basis of blood purity. Because no matter which version we choose, in the original material this dismissal has no leg to stand on and is just nonsense; and based on Madame Rowling's words about why the Stature of Secrecy happened, I think the reason for this dismissal is fear that is long-forgotten and is now only being remembered as “muggleborns are bad”. And since I was mostly writing about that particular but, I might have come across as fairly close-minded in that regard, yes.

But if we get to the part that is not about the muggleborn, yes, I'm with you there. Because if we throw the bits about muggleborns from the propaganda of blood purists, all that they preach about how blood matters is actually right, even if the way they deliver it isn't (since they're kind of jerks, in many cases). And I am aware that the world of the story is really broken and can be moulded into many other things; I just like the challenge of putting the broken thing that is canon together without throwing away any of the pieces simply because I don't like how they look, which basically leaves me AU for exploring most of what Madame Rowling did to her world. Though, of course, what one calls AU varies from person to person, so I guess I should be asking myself if it truly matters whether it's AU or not.

I'll end here, since the character limit is hitting me with a stick.
