I don't want to be taken as arrogant (sorry, we ended butting heads in a different comment line, and that ended up being kind of sad to be honest, and I really don't want a repeat because I think it is possible for us to interact civilly if we try not to aggravate each other), but I think that this is actually the point. And by “this” I mean the fact that the blood purity propaganda is not rooted in anything rational and is instead just something that had formed over time as people kept on forgetting about specifics from their past (namely the exact reason for their separation from the muggles, and anything pertaining to the time before the Stature of Secrecy).

I mean, in an AU story it's fine to set up a situation in which the blood purists are right, the idea itself is sound and honestly I'd like to read a well-written story exploring that. But in canon, there's really no support for blood actually meaning anything (the one known metamorphmagus is a child of a witch and a muggleborn; the so-called “brightest witch of her generation” is a muggleborn; the one to neutralise Tom Riddle for so many years was either a half-blood or a muggleborn, depending on whether you think it's Snape's or Lily's part that mattered more; and so on, and so on) and the blood purists are clearly meant to be taken as extremists. And to extremists who forgot why blood ever mattered and now just take pure blood for superior, to the extremists who think that being a squib is no better than being a muggle, I don't think it actually matters any that the muggleborns are really from squib lines.

Well, that it's from me. And I'll add that I did not mean be arrogant or demeaning here, and I hope to get a reply if you are willing to talk about it. And I apologise if that very mention (about me not meaning to be arrogant or demeaning) is something you find insulting; I just really think that our conflict earlier was really bad and I hope we can talk without going to another war, and since the previous time we both seemed to presume the worst of each other I am hoping that this mention will prevent that.
