But see, if Hermione is from a squib line, maybe her blood is that of someone great, reemerging. Once you start saying it /does/ matter that you were related to some wizard in the past, it blows the idea of everyone being born equal, and anyone possibly being born to magic.

It is even bad storytelling. It removes from parents reading much of that idea that hey, maybe their kid would be one of those randomly born to magic; and it removes from the kids at least /some/ of the idea that they too might get a letter. It makes magic less magical, in a harmful way, to say it is all just somehow genetics who gets magic.

  But in canon, there's really no support for blood actually meaning anything

I think it means something that the only Metamorph is the daughter of one of the oldest bloodlines around.

I think it means something that the only Animagus we have in canon seem to all pure-bloods (based on how Voldemort and the others treat Pettigrew, he seems to be one, just not well liked). No one even tries to teach Harry, almost like there wouldn't be a point /for him/.

I think it means something that the most unusually perceptive and intelligent girl who isn't Hermione is Luna, another pure-blood. The bravest and most classically heroic characters? Ron, Cedric, and Neville, all pure-bloods.

It really looks ugly when no other Muggle-born or even half-bloods seem to do well in the story.

That someone has to be from a lost wizard lines means /blood does matter/. There is a line to carry on, a single point spreading out through history. This makes *pure-blood supremacist wizards more functionally (if not morally) right in their exclusionary, anti-muggle breeding habits than any Nazi ever was.

In a note that I hope keeps this otherwise completely separate from any past messages, I found your points very clear and concise. I just happen to think they're not exploring the logical conclusions of JKR's casual breaking of her own world.
