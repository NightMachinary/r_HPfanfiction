One thing that I find is a lot of people talk of Muggle vs Pureblood and relate it to race. The pureblood supremacists are the KKK and the Muggleborns the hated minority group.

But you can think of it another way. The Wizards with their traditions in the wizarding world are the Tribesmen living in the wild and the Muggles are the British Empire. Coming into the land of the Wizards decrying that their ways are inferior and stupid and then attempting to change thousands of years worth of tradition that they do not fully understand. Yes, wizarding culture is stagnant, because it doesn't need to move past where it is now. They don't need cars, telephones, tvs, planes or any of that. Magic can replicate, or do better and due to the nature of magic they don't need the distraction of television.

Slytherin hated muggles and muggleborns because during his time muggles where attempting to murder magic users. To me that's a fairly decent reason. Current witches and wizards hate muggles because of a now deep seated idea that the muggles either want to kill them again or that those that don't wish to kill them wish to exploit them. They hate Muggleborns because many walk into the world of magic, shit all over traditions that are ancient and try to convince others that the muggle way is better, the muggle way is better, if you lack magic. Ie, some muggleborns portray classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film][White Savior]] tendencies.

That's not to say that the Wizarding World is without it's problems. They are rather discriminatory towards other races, however I feel that in many of these ways it is not without cause. The Goblins and Wizards have waged on and off wars for centuries if not millenium, some distrust is only natural and it is rather clear that Goblins are just as dissmissive towards humans as vice versa.

That's really all I have to say, I disagree with many of the methods of the Pureblood supremacists, but they do have some legitimate gripe with Muggleborns in particular.
