To explain Magic Britain, we need to have a reason why it exists in the first place.

If Wizard life is really as safe and easy as the books make it seem (+/- the danger from other wizards) then prejudice is irrational.

But so is having an oppressive day job, or continuing to live in an English war-zone when you could easily teleport to anywhere else.

Muggle Britain hangs together because people need each other for food and shelter. Muggles can't just pack-up and leave a country because they'd lose their fixed assets and jobs.

Those things don't apply when you can teleport, magically multiply food, and live in a cheap, condo-sized tent.

Instead, it seems like British Wizards come together for mutual protection. This implies that there's some sort of major danger that can't be solved by just teleporting to Fiji.

One option is that *Magic Is Really Dangerous*.

Maybe Dementors come from some sort of relatively-easy magical mistake. Maybe there are magical accidents that summon unquenchable fire.

If so, Wizards need their society to keep tabs on one another and prevent humanity from falling to the unkillable, soul-eating demons or endless fire.

In that case, you can justify prejudice by pointing out that magical ignorance (born of too much focus on muggle matters) is legitimately dangerous and anti-social.

Another option is that *Magical Creatures are Really Dangerous*.

Make magical-diplomacy hard. Or, at a minimum, harder than, "all problems are due to wizards being jerks."

Perhaps England -- every square foot of it -- was made by an ancient goblin spell. The wizards thought they purchased it in 1066. The Goblins thought they were giving Merlin a short-term loan.

Now the Goblins want their property back. And they see every English resident, wizard and muggle alike, as a thieving trespasser. Did I mention that Goblins are ok with debt-slavery?

If the British Wizards leave, their country will fall to a bunch of magically-armored goblins. Or to trolls, who gain intelligence as they gather in groups. Or to centaurs who are peaceful now, but tend to fall in behind a sufficiently powerful leader.

This puts Britain into a continuous, slow-burning war. Everyone has a cousin, or a brother, or a parent who's fallen in defense of their country.

Everyone, that is, except for the people who go live among the muggles.

Those people slip out of the war. They're free-riders who let Magical Britain bear the costs of protecting society.

Those people don't have to build clocks that let you know that your children are safe. Because "Mortal Peril" isn't so common, in their world, that it's an option on living room fixtures.
