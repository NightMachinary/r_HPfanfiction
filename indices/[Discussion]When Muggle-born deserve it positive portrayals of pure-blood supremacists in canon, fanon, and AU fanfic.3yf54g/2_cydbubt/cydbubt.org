Magic is a scary and familiar thing. It's able to conjure whimsy and deal death with a mere whisper.

Wizards saw first hand what non magicals were able to do without this terrifying comfort.

Non magicals have wiped out entire species with little thought and wiped out more with thought.

There's a certain pause that anyone would take as an outsider looking in.

And while wizards should advance a little more technologically seeing what non magicals are capable of can make them pause.

Genetically wizards are superior at the base level because they can seemingly make things appear from nothing.

But just like the mutants in comic books they are not superior in numbers.

So if they take caution it's understandable. They've witnessed their kin be demolished and eradicated in the blink of an eye.

They've witnessed their culture forced to concentrate and hide.
