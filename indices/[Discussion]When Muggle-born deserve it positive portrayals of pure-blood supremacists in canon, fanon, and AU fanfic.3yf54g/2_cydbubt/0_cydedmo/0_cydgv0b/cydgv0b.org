There's no reason for hate. Not if it had started out as hate.

But it didn't. It started out as fear. Because muggleborns were a link, and when something links you to those who might hurt you if they so desired, it is bad. And when you no longer remember why you feared something, why you felt disgust at that which was happening, what is left is bitterness. Bitterness that turns into hate.

That that happens is “rational”. Because this is a process we had seen many times with humans. You fear something, so it is bad. Then you no longer remember why you fear it, and it remains bad. Then you no longer do fear it, and it still remains bad. And then your mind makes up an excuse for why it is bad.

Admittedly it is not “rational” if by that you meant that it would have only come from logic. Because it comes from emotions and from how human brains work. But it isn't a piece of nonsense the way some people think. Just something with a lot of lost history behind it.
