I am afraid that you've rather misunderstanding what rational means in this context. Allow me to explain:

Rationality: a way of looking at the world that is based on testing things to achieve accurate beliefs about reality. Involves figuring out the inherent biases of the human mind so that they can be worked around or ameliorated. Often utilitarian.

Rational hatred/discrimination: reality being such that after dispassionately collating all the facts and looking at all the options, a person decides that hatred or discrimination is best for everyone. For example, if there were a fantastically beautiful and appealing race similar to ours with the exception that children of mixed race relations exploded like megaton bombs at random it would be rational to try and avoid letting the two races intermingle, because teenagers will be teenagers and that will kill lots of people.
