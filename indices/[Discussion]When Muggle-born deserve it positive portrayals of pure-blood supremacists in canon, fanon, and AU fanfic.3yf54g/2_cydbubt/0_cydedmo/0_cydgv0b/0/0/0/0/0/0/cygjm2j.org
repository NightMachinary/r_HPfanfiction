It's not really standard in the field per se, just the higher-ups deciding that they need to redefine the terms used at work for whatever reason. Admittedly, that inanity aside they aren't that bad so I just grumble about it when nobody's listening. The fact that I'm the one breaking in new people and updating the manual makes it a bit more ... noticeable though, as the habit tends to leak out of work.

But it's computer stuff, basically.
