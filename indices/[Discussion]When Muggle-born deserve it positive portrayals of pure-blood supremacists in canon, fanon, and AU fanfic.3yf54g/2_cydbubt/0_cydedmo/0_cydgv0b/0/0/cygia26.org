I am afraid you are misunderstanding the reason why I used those particular words, and seem to be ignoring the fact that they are in quotes for a reason. I might sound mean, but I already replied to that when another person commented on it and I personally don't reply to comment without reading other comments leading from the one I am reply it to because I know being asked the same question over and over when the answer is visible for everyone is not comfortable.

That being said, what I meant by the word when I used it, and the quotation marks are being used to mark usage different from any accepted one, was that people in-story perceive their reasons as rational and accept them as such even if it truly isn't rational for us; since the post itself deals with searching for a rational explanation in-story, I'd thought that this could count too, even if it shouldn't if people in-story actually tried to look at it more deeply.

I do get that you were most likely trying to be helpful, I really do; goodness knows I reply like that at random often enough. And if that was the case then thank you for the attempt, it is appreciated for what it could be. But in your act of explaining as if I hadn't already replied to the very same thing, which I did, you made it a little bit ... I don't know, pretentious, I guess.
