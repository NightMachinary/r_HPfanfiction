  And if the quoted part has “incomplete sentences” then either I am much more illiterate then I thought or you simply couldn't find the right argument there and resorted to a random accusation.

It is hard to read and pretentious. So yes, you apparently are. I can't argue with what you said, because it had nothing to do with what /I said/. You never restated one of my points or quoted a line you thought deserved expanding on. You hardly made a single clear declarative statement at all.

Your response suggests you are aware of this, and just don't care. I'll still explain why I said that, though you seem to be cattily licking your wounds rather than attempting to engage in the original topic--hardly useful.

My issue was the series of chopped up, incomplete thoughts in sentence form not resulting in complete sentences and thoughts.

One can sometimes assume "it is" as a subject, but that should be used sparingly. And "because" should only be used with a main clause, as it will form a subordinate clause *always*. Use of conjunctions at the start of sentences is annoying, especially when it doesn't serve to enhance understanding of the subject of the sentence, and /especially/ when those sentences are so damn short--though isn't technically incorrect sentence construction in modern usage.

    Bitterness that turns into hate.

    Because this is a process we had seen many times with humans.

    Because it comes from emotions and from how human brains work.

    Just something with a lot of lost history behind it.

Also, all that had little to do with the subject--which again, you still aren't talking about. If you just like to read your own written words, fine. Do so. But I was expecting more than a Sociology 101 textbook formatted as beat poetry intercut with missing dialog from The Matrix.
