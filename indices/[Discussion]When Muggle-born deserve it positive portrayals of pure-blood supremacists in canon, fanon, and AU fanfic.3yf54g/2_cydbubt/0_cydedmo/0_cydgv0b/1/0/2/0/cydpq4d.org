Yes, well, I'll just say that the perception of how the other side is is similar here. We both seem to think of each other as arrogant buffoons with nothing constructive to say, it appears.

So I'll give you this, in an attempt to make it somewhat constructive rather than fully useless: There is no rational reason for all the hatred you are talking about, and any attempts to explain it rationally would go past “fanon” and be fully “AU”. People in-story do perceive it as rational and make up the reasons for why it would be rational because they no longer remember why exactly they had something against the muggleborns and it's much easier to ascribe inferiority to them rather than potential danger, especially since the muggleborns that people would care about---the ones at Hogwarts---are still children and it is therefore hard to see them as dangerous. Much of the anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn sentiment we see also comes from the most extreme elements rather than the regular populace, so it is not the level of hatred that most people actually feel.
