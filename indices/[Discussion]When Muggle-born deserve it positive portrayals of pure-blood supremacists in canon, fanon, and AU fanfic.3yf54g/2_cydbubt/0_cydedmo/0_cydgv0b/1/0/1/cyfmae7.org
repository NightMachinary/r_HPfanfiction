  Sometimes the fact that a certain phenomenon occurs is taken as rational because it's been observed to be happening before,

Honestly, I think you're the first person I've seen use that word in that manner. I don't believe I've ever seen "rational" as "it's happened before."

I mean, people do irrational things all the time. Multiple times. Does the "irrational" suddenly become "rational" through sheer repetition.

No, I'd call that "understandable" or "predictable." Prejudice towards certain minorities is depressingly predicable, and even understandable given certain conditions, but not "rational" simply because similar processes have occurred in the past.
