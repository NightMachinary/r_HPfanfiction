Have it your way, then. I won't go out of my way to insult you or anything equally juvenile because that's not the way to do it, but I'll let you know this:

Sometimes the fact that a certain phenomenon occurs is taken as rational because it's been observed to be happening before, even if the reason behind the phenomenon is not one you can comprehend yourself. That you cannot understand that the same phenomenon might have happened here when it's possible enough is your prerogative but it will not make people sympathise with what you are saying. The usage of the word surrounded by quotation marks was meant to signify that although it is not, for the people experiencing this very thing it might appear and be taken as such, which is something I made sufficiently clear one paragraph later. And if the quoted part has “incomplete sentences” then either I am much more illiterate then I thought or you simply couldn't find the right argument there and resorted to a random accusation.
