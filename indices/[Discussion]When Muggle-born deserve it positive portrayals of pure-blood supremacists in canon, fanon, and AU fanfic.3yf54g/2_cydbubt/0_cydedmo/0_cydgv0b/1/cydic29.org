    You can explain irrational hatred easily.
  #+end_quote

That's what I said.

#+begin_quote
  There's no reason for hate. Not if it had started out as hate.
#+end_quote

This is what you said. What does this argue for or against, exactly?

#+begin_quote
  And when you no longer remember why you feared something, why you felt disgust at that which was happening, what is left is bitterness. Bitterness that turns into hate.

  That that happens is “rational”.
#+end_quote

No, that's not what rational means. The happening and the hate are both simply there. There isn't reasoning, so it can't be rational.

Please stick to common usage, and use complete sentences and thoughts. I simply can't get what you're saying here. It just seems to be a series of completely false statements you then negate, and truisms you don't expand on or link to the topic or my comment.
