Aaaaand so why hate on newcomers /who have magic/? Hardly a Slytherin approach to the issue, especially when they have a literally captive audience for 9 months out of the year.

That's what I'm saying is missing from much fanfiction. You can explain irrational hatred easily. What I'm looking for is /rational/ hate for *Muggle-born*, with a good underlying reason other than stupid monkey ones.
