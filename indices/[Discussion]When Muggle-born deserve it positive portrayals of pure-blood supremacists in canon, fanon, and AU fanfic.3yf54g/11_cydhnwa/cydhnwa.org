The problem is that there's more to racism then just thinking one race is superior. Hitler wasn't bad because he wrongly thought that Aryans were better at everything. Had he actually found the people that had the worst genes and killed them, he'd have still been a complete monster. His problem was acting like they had no ethical value.

There's all sorts of reasons why purebred wizards might be better at magic. But if you want a reason for wizards to treat muggles like lesser beings instead of just giving them disability payments, the only good reason is the one explored in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie][Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie]]. If muggles don't have souls, then you can do whatever you want. But if they're people, then they might be disabled or even misguided enough to risk ending the world with a nuclear holocaust, but none of that justifies treating them like dirt. Treating them like dirt won't fix any of that.
