I prefer to use "soul" to mean whatever it is that grants you subjective experience. In real life, I expect it to be some kind of complex computation or something. In the universe of Harry Potter, it might be a magical entity that muggles don't have. Or that might just be a red herring. Madame Pomfrey might be right, in that whatever magical organ they have has nothing to do with how you treat them.

But my point is that them being P-Zombies is the only way to justify treating them like that.
