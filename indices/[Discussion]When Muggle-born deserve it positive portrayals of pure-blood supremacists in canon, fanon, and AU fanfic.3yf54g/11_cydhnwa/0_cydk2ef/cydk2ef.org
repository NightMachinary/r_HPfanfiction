That's a really bad interpretation. Why are they less /people/ because they don't have souls? Souls have observable phenomena, they stop polyjuice from turning you fully into the other person, they stop you from getting brain damage, etc.

But none of the phenomena are "personhood" and I don't see any reason why not having those protections would make you less of a person.

Just because they call whatever that is a "soul" doesn't mean it's important. If they called it a "magical core" would you still think it's okay to abuse muggles?
