That's not the correct argument to take from HP:PZ. People who treat the soulless like that would still be monsters. That line of reasoning still ends up with wizards being dicks because they're ethically questionable.

And it still doesn't answer the question of why *Muggle-born* should be treated poorly. I'm looking for a cause other than the usual classism and fear.
