I've never understood the irrational fear authors in fanon give wizards about muggle weaponry. I often read things like "guns shoot one bullet and take minutes to reload" or "we can stop the bullet but not the kinetic energy" or "their bombs would destroy us". It's like authors are attempting to incorporate magic into a logically and physically bound world when this isn't the case at all. Magic has its own rules and a prepared wizard would trump muggles nearly every time. I can concede that a muggle firing supersonic bullets from a sniper rifle might take out a wizard who wasn't expecting it but otherwise the wizard will win every time.
