Yeah, people get too caught up in the who would win in a one on one fight, and rarely look at the big picture. For muggles to win they would need to discover magic without revealing they knew, and coordinating several bombardments to wipe out out every major magic outpost simultaneously with no warning. Even then, a single determined wizard seeking revenge could cause some serious problems.

I wonder how hard it would be for a wizard to get a nuke launched, essentially starting world war 3?
