  I can concede that a muggle firing supersonic bullets from a sniper rifle might take out a wizard who wasn't expecting it but otherwise the wizard will win every time.

Rowling herself said rational man with a shotgun beats 99% of wizards.

Most wizards are less competent then everyone we see fight in the books, who all either have training, experience, or plot armor. The average wizard uses magic for household chores, travel, and work. Not combat.

Yes, Dumbledore and Voldemort probably trump most handheld weapons, but nothing below Fiendfyre is getting through a tank, and no magical anything except obscurity can deal with a supersonic missile strike from 200 km away.
