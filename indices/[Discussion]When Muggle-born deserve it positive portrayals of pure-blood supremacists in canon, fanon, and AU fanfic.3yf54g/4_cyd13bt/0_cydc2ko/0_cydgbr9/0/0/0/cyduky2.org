  It's been a while, but didn't they cast charms to hide themselves, not actual barriers?
#+end_quote

No, they also use the shield charm.

  That's not a counterexample, that's one person holding a shield while other people cast offensively.
#+end_quote

Harry used an offensive spell (expelliarmus).

  Waving a wand around and saying (or thinking) specific words is always going to be slower than pulling a trigger.
#+end_quote

Not really. Thinking a word takes less time than pulling a trigger.

  This may be an irreconcilable point of contention, but I don't accept the movies as canon. The movies do a lot for the sake of theatricality that doesn't jive with the books, like the Death Eaters' smoky "apparition".
#+end_quote

I do not consider movies canon either.

#+begin_quote
  Classes in the books establish wand movements as being important to proper casting, and I can't recall there being any mention of being able to stop using them in an equivalent to non-verbal casting.
#+end_quote

The vast majority of spells we see in canon are cast without any mention of wand movements, and another large body of spells are cast with lazy wand movements. I think it's fairly clear in the books that wand movements are done away with as one becomes more familiar with a spell.
