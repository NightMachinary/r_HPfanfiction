  You're wrong. Most obvious example: shield charm over DH camp site.

It's been a while, but didn't they cast charms to hide themselves, not actual barriers?

#+begin_quote
  They did. Example: Harry in DH, casting the shield between Voldemort and the rest of the fighters then going on to fight Voldemort.
#+end_quote

That's not a counterexample, that's one person holding a shield while other people cast offensively.

Waving a wand around and saying (or thinking) specific words is always going to be slower than pulling a trigger.

#+begin_quote
  we see many wizards cast spells without wand movements.

This may be an irreconcilable point of contention, but I don't accept the movies as canon. The movies do a lot for the sake of theatricality that doesn't jive with the books, like the Death Eaters' smoky "apparition".

Classes in the books establish wand movements as being important to proper casting, and I can't recall there being any mention of being able to stop using them in an equivalent to non-verbal casting.
