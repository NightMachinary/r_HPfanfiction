  I've never understood this argument. There's no canon backing for it.

1. Magic breaks the laws of physics in ways that are completely irreconcilable with what we know about the universe.

2. Magic doesn't even behave in ways analogous to physical forces, taking into account subjective human concepts as if they were intrinsic parts of the universe and permitting perpetual energy. A beetle is easier to transfigure into a button than other objects because, apparently, the words "beetle" and "button" sound similar. To be honest I think it's somewhat absurd to try to unify a magic system that behaves in this way with any kind of scientific understanding of the universe.

3. JKR has stated that magic has the general power to overrule "mundane nature", which all but declares magical nature and mundane nature to be separate.

  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you can maintain a shield while casting other spells.
#+end_quote

You're wrong. Most obvious example: shield charm over DH camp site.

  If you could, people would have been idiots not to have done it all the time during battles in the books.
#+end_quote

They did. Example: Harry in DH, casting the shield between Voldemort and the rest of the fighters then going on to fight Voldemort.

  You have to make these wand movements and say these words
#+end_quote

Non-verbal magic only requires you to think a word, and we see many wizards cast spells without wand movements.

  then at least some spells have a travel time perceivable by the naked eye
#+end_quote

There are various "light effects" that accompany physical spells but we have no idea how quick they are. Often a spell is interchangeably described as a "jet" and a "flash", implying that spells move too fast for you to follow their travel with your eye - all you get is a flash of light, like a muzzle-flash, with maybe the jet becoming visible over longer distances.

Furthermore, there's nothing in the books that implies that these light shows happen /after/ the incantation. In fact most of the evidence (HBP duel with Snape) seems to point towards the various lighting effects and spell travel happening /during/ the incantation, and when you finish saying the incantation, that's when the spell is complete i.e. when the spell hits the target.

Incidentally, there isn't a single example in the books of a wizard dodging a spell that was already "in flight".
