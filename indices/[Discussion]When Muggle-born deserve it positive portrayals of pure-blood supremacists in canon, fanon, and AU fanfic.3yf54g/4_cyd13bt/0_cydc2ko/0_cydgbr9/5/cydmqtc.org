I guess this argument boils down to an individual's view of the limits of magic. I personally believe that magic is escentially the manifestation of imagination. If you can think it up and have sufficient will then almost anything is possible.\\
The only supposed limit is resurrection of the "completely" dead and even that is not empirically proven. An AK kills a person but leaves the body intact. There are spells to animate corpses. The resurrection stone summons spirits of the dead. Who is to say that there isn't a means to combine these magics to bring someone back to life?

Edit: Why is this being down voted? The first statement is a valid point and the second is hypothetical.
