  Magic has its own rules and a prepared wizard would trump muggles nearly every time.

I've never understood /this/ argument. There's no canon backing for it. When it comes to combat we have no idea how well a shield charm can hold up against a bullet, let alone explosions. Generally when I see this argument it boils down to "It's [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][/magic/]], so /of course/ it will trump technology, because it's [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][/magic/]]." and that's not a valid argument.

In fact, a wizard who tries to take on a muggle with a gun directly is likely fucked, even if a shield charm can easily stop bullets. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you can maintain a shield while casting other spells. If you could, people would have been idiots not to have done it all the time during battles in the books. So you have to drop your shield to cast and then you're dead, because spells are /slow/. Like really, really slow compared to a gun. You have to make these wand movements and say these words, and then at least some spells have a travel time perceivable by the naked eye. In contrast, the muggle pulls the trigger the second the shield drops and you have a dead wizard.

Where magic /actually/ trumps technology is subterfuge. They can hide, manipulate, etc. very effectively. They could wage a reasonably effective guerilla war, though it may still be a losing one given how badly they're outnumbered. Really, the only truly effective way they could fight a real war against muggles would be to use tactics we (and most of the magical people we know of that aren't Death Eaters) would consider completely abhorrent.. like Imperiusing random muggles and using them as suicide bombers so they never have to expose themselves to carry out an attack.

On the other hand, muggles wouldn't be able to wage an effective offense against magical people either. You can't bomb people you can't find, or who are integrated with your own population.

A conflict between muggles and magicals would be a horrible mess. Consider the level of paranoia created by terrorism in the real world and then consider a world where you, your neighbor or your ninety year-old grandma could be suddenly mind-controlled into being a suicide bomber. The Statute of Secrecy is probably for the best if there's even a chance of conflict.
