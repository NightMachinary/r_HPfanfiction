The difference between fan fiction and canon is that we can allow ourselves the oppourtunity to think of a world larger than the one created by Rowling. With JKR, this world would not exist, but think of it this way: it takes you a single thought to shoot off a spell. A muggle will actually have to shoot off a gun by aiming and then pressing the trigger. By then the wizard could have apparated and shot a stunner, if they wanted to be nice. Or they could simply transfigure the muggle's weapons into flowers.

Muggle with a shot gun > than wizard. But in a war you won't have civilians fighting. You'll have specially trained soldiers vs wizards trained to fight. Also muggle troops will have to worry about the imperious curse. Any information they have can be gained through truth potions + cruciatus.

This next bit is a quote from the fic "In Light of Silver Memories":

There was a subtle quality that he added to his voice, and both the Prime Minister and the Director-General found their eyes drawn to him. Harry stared hard at both of them, and allowed the full weight of his seriousness press on them. "And now, Prime Minister, Director-General, allow me to address something you have till this moment been ignorant of: you have absolutely no idea how powerful magic can be. Of course, your experience with magic has been severely limited: you have only met wizards such as our former and present Ministers, both fools, and Auror Shacklebolt, who while powerful in his own right is nowhere near the upper echelons of the wizarding world in terms of magical power---it is time to correct your view of magic and the so-called strength of your science."

Harry twirled his wand, drawing their attention to it. "With this wand, this single wand alone, I can destroy Muggle London---and nothing you can do could stop me. Would you fire your guns at me? I could create a ward that would turn every bullet into a lovely flower. Would you direct your missiles in my direction? I would've been warned long before because of my proximity wards and Disapparated instantaneously to a location hundreds of meters from where I had previously been. Would you attempt to overwhelm me with numbers alone? With two words I could kill a man---now allow me to ask, how long do you think it'll take to whisper two words over and over again to destroy a battalion of hundreds of soldiers? Not too long, sirs, not too long. All the while I would have a magical shields that would protect me from any lucky shot, dragonhide clothing to protect me from those that manage to get through the cloak---and a single wave of my wand to heal anything truly powerful enough to damage my person.

"Would you hide within your mighty structures of concrete and metal? I could Apparate through walls, I could conjure a fire so fierce it would burn water, let alone melt metal; I could send a storm so powerful it would blow your walls down, or I could transfigure cement into sand and metal into straw. I could drop the earth beneath your feet, call lightning out from the sky, summon the ocean in the middle of your city, or put your nation to sweet sleep. Would you believe your hiding would save you? I have spells that could search whomever I wanted, wherever they may be. You will have no where to hide, to shelter, to cower from my might and power." Harry leaned back into his seat and stopped twirling his wand. "I may not be able to destroy Muggle London in a single day, or even perhaps a week, but if I direct my wand and my magic to her destruction, in the end, she will fall."

There was a stunned moment of silence. He sighed slowly, and asked gently, "A single wand, gentlemen; what can you possibly do against a single wand?"

The Director-General suddenly met Harry's gaze with a fierce blaze burning in his eyes, and he answered slowly but with authority. "I would snap that single wand."

Harry looked at him sadly. "Oh, Director-General, but I have another, and another, and another after that." He sighed again. "This, gentlemen, is what Lord Voldemort is more than capable of. And he has not just one wand, but many under his command. You say your people are dying? That you would do anything to protect them? To defend them against this unknown power? Sirs, the unfortunate truth is that you cannot. You cannot. At least, not on your own. In fact, you must be thankful that what I have just detailed for you has not yet taken place.
