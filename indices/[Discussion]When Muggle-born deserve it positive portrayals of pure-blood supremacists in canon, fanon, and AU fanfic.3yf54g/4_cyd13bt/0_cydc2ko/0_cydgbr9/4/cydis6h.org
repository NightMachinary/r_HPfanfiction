One of my favorite things on this subjects is from Forging the Sword. One of the character talks about how wizards would lose an all out war, but the combination of Mind Magics, Disguise Magics, and Travel Magics makes it so that they could just assassinate or control key people starting from the top down. Wouldn't take long for a military organization to be crippled.
