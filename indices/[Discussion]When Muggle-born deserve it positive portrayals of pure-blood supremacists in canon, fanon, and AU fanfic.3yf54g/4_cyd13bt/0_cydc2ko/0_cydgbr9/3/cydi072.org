Eh, I say let the quote be. Instead, you could concentrate on the fact that nobody, ever, could be prepared all the time. Maybe when you are prepared you can be invincible because magic. But what about when you are not prepared? When you are sleeping?

And one could argue that of course you could sleep in a place where no muggle could reach you. Except muggles, the ones that are parents of muggleborns, have their own children with their own magic, children often enough desperate to give their parents a reason to love them, to lead them to you anyway.

So really, it doesn't matter who would win if wizards were prepared. Because you can't live with your guard up the whole time; somewhen your guard is going to slip and then anyone and anything able to hurt you when you are /not/ prepared will be terrifying.
