Muggles are even scarier when the wizard contemplating their danger is of decent intelligence and merely lacking knowledge of their capabilities. In 400 years, muggles went from dumb assholes with knifes and the ocassional musket into a state of mystery thanks to ever advancing technology. While most wizards will probably have a basic understand that blackpowder makes stuff go boom, many of the newer stuff will be out of their understanding. Imagine living a hundred+ years and suddenly your mansion gets blown to the skies by some horrifying metal machination dropping weapons of unparalleled destruction. Muggles must seem like an ever advancing monster of destruction to the average pureblood and the worst: they are multiplying at an alarming rate. WW1 fucked them with mortar fire, WW2 with bombers, just imagine the horrors that are awaiting you in the near future if you let those cunts continue. Heck I would want to strictly control their movement and advancement if I could. Thx to random occurrences of the magical gene in the population, more and more wizards are born that are not immediately assimilated into your society. Could you imagine if the ever imaginative muggle monster would succeed in understanding or absorbing these universe shattering powers? Imagine hearing rumors of the weapon that ended WW2, imagine a weapon that can level an entire city. Imagine discussing this weapon with your friends and family and then imagine finally asking a muggle about it years later. He looks at you and says, "oh yeah, almost every country worth mentioning has hundreds of them." I would shit my fucking pants that those violent things could kill me and everyone I have ever known whenever they feel like fighting each other again.

At least that's the reasoning I will be using to justify muggle hatred in my FF.
