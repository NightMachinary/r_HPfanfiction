TL;DR

The book presents two very black and white ethical sides those for Voldemort's ideology in a extreme way and those against. What might a middle position be?

"...another faction felt it made better sense to negotiate with cronies for an out-of-court settlement. Court battles are messy; they take time before decisions are rendered. The prospect of out-of-court settlements, where Marcos cronies would return sizable amount of illegal assets in exchange for immunity from lawsuits, loomed as an option..."

What might the politics look like of someone who was elitist/traditional, but not an outspoken supporter of Voldemort?

"...Campos, low key and unassuming, was probably the most cooperative among the known Marcos cronies. Unlike other cronies who chose to slug it out with the post-Marcos government, Campos cooperated fully in surrendering the Marcos assets under his name..."

Obviously Lucius Malfoy cannot hide from what he has done, but how likely is it that other wealthy people are just slipping back into "normal" lives again?"

Very likely
