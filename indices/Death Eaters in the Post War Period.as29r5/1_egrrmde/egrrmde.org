2 is a little tricky because Rowling took a lot of Nazi themes and added magic but forgot why the Third Reich came to be. Hitler could only rise to power because of the abdication of the Emperor and the resulting democracy which lacked widespread support. The nation was crippled by the Versailles treaty and had to surrender a significant part of its territory. And due to the lacking democratic tradition, there was no stable government. Throw in two economic crisis (1923 and 1929) and people were desperate for stability and improvements.

Yet there is nothing similar in the magical world. The purebloods already appear to be fairly influential. After all, a good dozen managed to bribe their way out of prison. Voldemort's rise was a simple power grab and little more. He didn't rise because the people were desperate after almost two decades of war and hardships, he rose because the elite conspired to take more power. That makes it a lot more black and white than the Third Reich, which had a lot more nuance to it. Rowling took the street fighting gangs, the Death squads and the racial purges, but failed to build a foundation on which to rest that. That's why the Death Eaters are a lot more black and white than the Third Reich, at least until the end of 1940.
