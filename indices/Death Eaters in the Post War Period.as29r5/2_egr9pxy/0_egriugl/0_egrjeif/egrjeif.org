Well, I usually assume that the main motive of Voldemort was power - he wanted power over everyone else. And his followers wanted more power than they had. That goes for the dark creatures following Voldemort as much as for Lucius Malfoy. Others might have bought into the "mudbloods want to steal our country/culture" line.

With regards to revenge, depending on how far you stray from canon, some people might have legitimate grievances against the good guys.

Also, while I think all DEs who took part in the Battle at Hogwarts were captured or killed, there should have been DEs holding down the fort elsewhere - in the Ministry, Azkaban, perhaps some base. I don't think Voldemort took everyone with him and exposed his bases.
