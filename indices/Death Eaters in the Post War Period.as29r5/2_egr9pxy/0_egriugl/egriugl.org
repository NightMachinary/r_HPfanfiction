All good points thanks! I guess another thing to think about is that we don't have much in terms of an actual DE agenda besides blood purity, that's not a /small/ thing per se, but it is broad. Besides straight-up bigotry what drove people to want this (economics, preserving tradition etc.)

Dealing with Muggleborns who want revenge was another thing I will need to flesh out. If I go with the fact that no DEs escaped then I want to avoid the trope of a child out for revenge, but I might think of something else.
