1. Most frontline Death Eaters are likely captured or dead.

2. People who kept their heads down and didn't do anything in the war. Too cowardly to do what is right, not evil enough to support Voldemort.

3. Like "oh, let's not be too harsh... those people meant well, and they were only following orders... let's not make too much of a fuss about mudbloods, I mean, muggleborns, yes? Both sides were extreme, right? Let's try to be a little more balanced."

4. I would think that actual Death Eaters don't get to slip back, but those who didn't actually fight, but went along with the regime, and those who managed to keep their hands relatively clean and claim they were only doing their usual jobs at the Ministry have good chances to slip.

With a post war plot, revenge will be an important theme. What is revenge, what is justice? Can you stop people from continuing the war? Will you keep your own side from committing crimes now that they are in power? Can you mend the rifts the war tore up? How far do you take the needed purges? What about rebuilding and restoring that which was taken from the victims of Voldemort?

I've got my own take on post war rebuilding in "Divided and Entwined", where the war was far bloodier and more vicious, but the questions remain the same after every civil war.
