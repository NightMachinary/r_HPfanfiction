If you want to keep this story canon and epilogue compliant, here are my suggestions:

1) The role of Ministry of Magic immediately following the Battle of Hogwarts.

The British Ministry of Magic resembled more of a failed state. Although it properly tyrannized law-abiding citizens, it was utterly useless against sadistic genocidal terrorists. For example, after Voldemort came out into open in Year 5, it failed to capture a single Death Eater, despite Harry Potter (their supposedly Chosen One) knowing every one of his inner circle members.

Then, 6 weeks after the 'great' Albus Dumbledore died, it fell without a fight to Voldemort's forces. Then, large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically with those sadistic genocidal terrorists to exterminate a sizable minority of its population.

Finally ten months later, its security force, along with that sadistic genocidal maniac and his minions, were destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts by a group of teenagers and citizen volunteers.

This was an completely pathetic organization that should have lost all authority, legitimacy, and deterrence after the war. I expect it to be thoroughly purged by the winners of the war and rebuilt from the ground up.

2) The roles of our heroes (The Trio, Ginny, Neville, Luna mainly)

I know many people like the angst/comfort/hurt genre. But I don't think our main characters going broke immediately following the Battle would be canon compliant. They didn't just lead happy lives 20 years later, but ruled magical Britain, and that could not have been achieved if they had drown themselves in PTSD misery for years!

They were after all mentally extremely strong people. They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant number of Voldemort supporters were still on the loose or even hiding in positions of power. Their own hold on power immediately after the Battle was tenuous at best. They knew they couldn't afford to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

Their decision to send Harry and Ron into Auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional needs. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls recruiting more followers at Hogwarts.

We know Ron and Neville spent only a few years as Aurors, which meant that Death Eater threats were mostly gone by that point. Harry needed only 8-9 years to make it to the youngest Head Auror ever, which implied that he was very successful at this job. He spent a further decade as Head Auror before becoming the director of DMLE. Another implication of those canon facts was that Harry had the loyalty of Magical Britain's security forces.

Also, you can no longer assume our main characters to remain innocent children or naive teenagers anymore. To get where they are at in the Epilogue, they will have to become hardened warriors and cunning politicians.

3) Magical Britain will have to experience radical changes. I have written an one shot for the occasion of BoH's 20th anniversary. It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][an interview with Harry]], linkffn(12925628), and I have him saying "they had been very thorough with Voldemort sympathizers".

I don't expect them to carry out mass executions or torture, but they would take following measures such as:

- Establish their own political and paramilitary organization/network based on the DA. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna were working hard in their last year at Hogwarts to recruit followers for their cause. It started out as a self help group for students to overcome the trauma of the previous year, and Luna came up with the proposal to formalize it and expand it to the general populace after their graduation.
- Seize control of Magical Britain's security forces with DA veterans and Order members.
- Rile up and organize the general public to purge and reform Ministry/Wizengamot. The mass torture of Hogwarts students under the Carrows should serve as a primary rallying cause.
- Grant significant emergency and surveillance powers to Aurors. Auror office eventually became the equivalent of combined MI5 and MI6.
- Hold public trials and fully expose atrocities committed by Death Eaters, Snatchers, and Voldemort sympathizers.
- Reject “I'm just taking my orders” as a form of legal defense.
- Reveal the damages caused to Magical Britain by Blood Purity ideology, using examples of Bulstrodes, Carrows, Crabbes, Goyles, Lestranges, and most importantly, Voldemort himself.
- Make public support of Blood Purity high treason.
- Taboo the word “mudblood”. But instead of going after each trigger, Aurors would record the frequency and location of their occurrences, and send humans to conduct in-depth investigations.
- Vetting of all public positions (Ministry employees, Hogwarts staff) for extreme ideologies.
- Confiscate assets of Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to compensate their victims.
