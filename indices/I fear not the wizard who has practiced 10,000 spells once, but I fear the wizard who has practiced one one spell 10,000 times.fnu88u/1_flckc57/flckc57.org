I really hate that JKR made Expelliarmus his spell of choice. If he had to be a Master of One, why couldn't it have been transfiguration or some more complex charm so we could get some creative use out of it? There's literally no depth to it, and it would have made a nice contrast to Voldemort's usage of AK which is equally without depth. Could have used it so that his wins against Voldemort wasn't a complete Deus ex Machina, put his skills in Quidditch and fast reflexes to use too. I get she needed him to be Wizard Jesus, but honestly even Jesus had more than one trick up his sleeve and he was a well-spoken kind of guy, not an angsty teen.
