I watched a video once about how these spells ( avadra kadavra, expelliarmus,...)were one of J.K's biggest mistakes, because it limited her creativity when it comes to duels and combat spells.

She couldn't really come up with a more creative fight scene with many new spells and stunts, when the characters can obviously use stupify and expelliarmus to get the same results much faster and without a hassle.
