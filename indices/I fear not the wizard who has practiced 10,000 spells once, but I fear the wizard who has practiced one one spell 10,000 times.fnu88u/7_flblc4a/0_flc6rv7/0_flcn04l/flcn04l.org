Even if Harry only casts one spell during a single class of wand related subjects (which he should not as he would need to cast multiple times to practice the spell) and never again he would have cast spells over a hundred times in just book 1.

I am curious how many unique spells Ron and Hermione have cast over the course of the books and movies. I can also remember about 25 unique spells cast by Harry off the top of my head.
