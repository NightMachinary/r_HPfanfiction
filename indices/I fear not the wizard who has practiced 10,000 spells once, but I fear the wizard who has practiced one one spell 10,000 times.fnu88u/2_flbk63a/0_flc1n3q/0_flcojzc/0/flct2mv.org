I've heard a saying that "God looks out for children, fools, and drunks." I could google it, but I choose to believe no one has thrown enough of any out windows to make a proper study of it, lol.

Come to think of it, that's kinda the opposite of the HP reason kids survive. An untrained witch or wizard kinda grabs for their magic when they're distressed or want something very badly, thus why Neville's great-uncle was dangling him out a window in the first place, trying to scare him badly enough so that accidental magic happened. But regular babies (might) survive because they don't become stressed enough to tense up? I dunno, i can see it for drunks because their senses are blunted, but babies I'm not sure.
