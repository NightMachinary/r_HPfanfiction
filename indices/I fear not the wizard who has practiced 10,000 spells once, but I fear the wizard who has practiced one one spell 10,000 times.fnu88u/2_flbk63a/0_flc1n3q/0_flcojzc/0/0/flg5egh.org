I couldn't find a study - there have been some seriously fucked-up science experiments done (Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram Shocks, the Cat-Phone, etc), so it was possible someone had tried something similar - but no, just statistics, and all I could find of those were American. 5000 kids fall out of windows, and apparently only 1/4 of them actually required hospitalisation for their injuries. Children under 5 were more likely to be seriously injured and more likely to suffer head injuries specifically, so I don't know if [[/u/tokimi]] was right in their hearing.
