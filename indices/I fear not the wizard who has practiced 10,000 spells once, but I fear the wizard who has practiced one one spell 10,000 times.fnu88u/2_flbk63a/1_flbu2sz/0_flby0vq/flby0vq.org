Voldemort doesn't use any other spell to kill people, it's part of his own "code". He styles himself as having defeated, subjugated death, and thus he has the right to deal it. The Killing Curse is also much "purer" than any other lethal magic, and one of the darkest curses that can be cast by wand.
