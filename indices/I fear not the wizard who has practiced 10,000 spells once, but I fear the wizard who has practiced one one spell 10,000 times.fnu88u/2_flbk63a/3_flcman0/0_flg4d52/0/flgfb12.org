I think the knock back is strong enough to incapacitate or seriously hurt anyone who does not shield it as it is strong enough to hurl the target through wooden posts. Make sure they don't get back up. I remember some enemies sent falling down stairs in the final battle. Who knows how spells in Harry Potter actually works?

Till the Snape vs Harry fight in HBP I thought that Legilimency was a spell like any other that could be blocked with a Protego. The movies even support this. I also thought it was an extremely unpleasant if not painful experience. Then somehow Snape is inside Harry's mind in HBP without Harry noticing it.

Another example is to successfully cast Cruciatus spell you have to want to cause pain. Even Harry's white hot rage and hatred like he never felt for anyone before could not substitute the need for sadism in OotP. Then in DH we have students casting it on other students though we never see it. What we did see was Draco successfully casting it on Rowle because he was afraid. Like what?

The mechanics of spells seem to change over the course of canon. One of the biggest shifts took place from OotP to HBP in which you no longer need to know the correct pronunciation, precise wand movement and practice to be able to cast a spell as indicated by sectumsempra. What was the point of DA then? Umbridge was right that you don't need to cast spells before the exam to pass it.
