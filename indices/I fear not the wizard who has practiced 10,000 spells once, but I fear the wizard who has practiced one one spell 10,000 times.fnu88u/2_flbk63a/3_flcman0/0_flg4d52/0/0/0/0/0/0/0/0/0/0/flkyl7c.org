If you post it here, it'd probably be Discussion. Not sure what flair the main Harry Potter subreddit would be. You could also go down some of the specialist HP Fanfiction subreddits - Dramione, Harmony, HarryandGinny, etc. Again, not sure what flairs each of those would have, I only really frequent this subreddit.
