Oh, they are, you're right. In canon, Arithmancy is just numerology and Runes is just a language class, I believe. Anything else is quite likely just fanon - though fanon that significantly improves on canon, I would say. Two divination classes is a bit much, and Runes being magical methodology makes them far more interesting. :)
