For expelliarmus I think throwing targets wooden post one is the most consistent one. If you are asking in general how strong the knockback on the strongest knockback spell I think it would be? More than enough to blow someone through walls. If I recall correctly Flipendo Tria essentially creates a tornado and even the basic version can send someone flying over 10 feet.
