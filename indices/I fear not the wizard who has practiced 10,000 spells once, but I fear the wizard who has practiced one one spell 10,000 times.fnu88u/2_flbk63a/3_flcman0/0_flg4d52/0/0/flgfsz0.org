Ah, okay. Sounds about right, from what I remember. I was more curious as to what the biggest/strongest effect the knockback could have. Like, could it throw you through a stone wall? That kind of thing.

Oh, not even Rowling seems to know for certain how spellcasting in the series works. There's bugger all consistency between books in regard to the spellcasting. Each book seems to mostly remain logical and consistent and semi-sensible itself (aside from shit like chaining up Pettigrew immediately after the whole 'he can turn into a tiny rat' conversation), but you're totally right in that there's little to no constancy of spell mechanics throughout the series as a whole and the semi-established rules are broken most of the time they're mentioned outside of the book that introduces them. Rowling really needed a better editor to get her worldbuilding in order. Or just a continuity director, at least. :D
