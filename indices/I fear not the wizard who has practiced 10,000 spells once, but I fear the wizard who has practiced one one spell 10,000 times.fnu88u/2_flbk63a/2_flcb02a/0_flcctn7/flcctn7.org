I can't find it right now, but there's a crossover where Harry gets sucked into the DC universe and wanders around the US meeting various superheroes and others. At one point, the Joker tries to rob a museum that Harry happens to be visiting, and Harry removes his hands with cutting curses.

After Harley assures Joker that he wasn't wearing his removable hands gag, he makes a comment about being disarmed. Harry responds by saying that he unhanding him, causing the Joker to compliment him on his humor.
