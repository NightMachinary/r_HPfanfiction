Except Expelliarmus is useless if you're not armed, isn't it? If you don't have something in your hand, it doesn't do anything, no?

But then again, Voldemort did pull out an Avada Kedavra to kill Harry in 1981 instead of just punting the little brat out the window - would the Potter House be tall enough for defenestration to be fatal to a baby? - so disarming may be quite effective in a society that's forgotten how punching works.
