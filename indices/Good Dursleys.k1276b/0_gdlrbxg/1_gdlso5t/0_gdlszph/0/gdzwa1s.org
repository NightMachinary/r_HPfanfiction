Two other Good!Dursleys fics by kgfinkel are linkffn(13575326) and linkffn(13715486).

Wand Crafter's story I definitely enjoyed quite a lot, and would anticipate each new update. It also features Hufflepuff!Harry, Hermione and Neville.

I'm not currently up-to-date with A Pinch of Salt, but it feature a talented-at-cooking Harry, and meeting Remus earlier on.

If I can think of anymore Good!Dursleys fics, I'll link them (I'm sure I've read more) but I cannot think of any others at this stage.
