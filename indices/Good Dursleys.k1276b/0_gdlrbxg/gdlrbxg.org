Linkffn(A better man by Valandar) fits the bill. Vernon gets a second chance and tries to do right by Harry. I like it because it's not a total heel turn, he still has trouble accepting magic, but tries his best.

Edit: Been a while since I read it - started again and realized that Vernon doesn't come back with his knowledge of the original timeline, just a vague sense that he ought to be more tolerant of the Potters and it butterflies from there. EditEdit: Never mind, must have been thinking of a different fic where Vernon wasn't totally accepting, he's full on Mr Rogers-level tolerant in this one. Definitely fits your prompt though.
