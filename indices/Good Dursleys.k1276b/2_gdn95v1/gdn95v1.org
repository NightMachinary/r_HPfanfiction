Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian: linkffn(13308768)

Petunia's somewhere in-between a Muggle and a full-on Witch - magical enough to brew potions and generally be part of the magical world (eligible to take on magical guardianship, start businesses, have a Gringotts account et cetera), not quite magical enough to attend Hogwarts as a child. Features a misguided-but-not-evil Dumbledore, so fair warning on that front.
