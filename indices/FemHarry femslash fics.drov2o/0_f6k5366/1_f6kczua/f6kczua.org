To be fair I am here for fem!Harry femslash fics, and I like Hermione pairing. I liked the begining of the Yule Ball Panic series, i felt th eoriginal was adorable but lost track of it as it got more focused on the Veela part as the series went on. Do you have any more recommendations? :)

I do also recommend The Cassie Evans story though. its great fun!
