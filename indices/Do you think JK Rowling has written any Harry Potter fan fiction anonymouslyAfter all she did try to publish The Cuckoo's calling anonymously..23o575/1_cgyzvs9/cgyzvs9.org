I wish! But I haven't come across anything that even seems like it's written by her. None of the stories I've read have her signature style. Even with cannon compliant stories I enjoyed (Northumbrian, little0bird, DAYD, etc) you can tell that the characters and writing aren't exactly hers. Plus, any new content goes right to Pottermore or would have been set aside her for her encyclopedia.
