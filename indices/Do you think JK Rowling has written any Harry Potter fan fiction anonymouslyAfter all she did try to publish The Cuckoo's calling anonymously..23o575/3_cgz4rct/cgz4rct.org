I doubt she's writes fanfiction, but I do love seeing stories that are written well enough to possibly be her. I actually know of an author that started out as a Harry Potter fanfiction writer, so there is that wonderful idea that she inadvertently helped spawn other books. I think if JKR were to write more Harry Potter stuff, she would write under her own name. She has a certain style to her writing (I saw it immediately with Casual Vacancy and the like 3 pages I've read of Cuckoo's Calling), and I like to think I would immediately catch on if she ever tried to sneak one past us.

My question is does she ever read fanfiction? Like is there a chance she's read mine? Even that very slim possibility makes me light-headed.

Also, I've had someone tell me that I write a little bit like her. I think I write more like Phillip Pullman, but it was still a nice review. Made me feel all happy inside :)
