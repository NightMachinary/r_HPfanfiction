There is like a 2% chance she's never read at least one. Or a friend or editor hasn't sent one they've somehow come across. There's video of DanRad and Fiennes reading slash on Bravo, I would think she's seen SOMETHING in all these years! It could be any of ours! There's one fic of mine I would love for her to have read. The rest? Not so much :P
