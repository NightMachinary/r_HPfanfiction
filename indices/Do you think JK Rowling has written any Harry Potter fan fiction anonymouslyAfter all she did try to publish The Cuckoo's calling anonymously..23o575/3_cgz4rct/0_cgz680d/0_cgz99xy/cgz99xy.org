Aww, thank you! I've been writing fanfiction since I was twelve, but only like a quarter of what I've written has ever made it to the Internet. I also stopped during high school because I was too cool for that nonsense, but picked it back up when I was bored in college. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10162339/1/One-Summer][One Summer]] is the story that I'm currently writing. I have a chapter that should be up in a day or two. There are three other documents open on my computer with half a plot penned down, so I'm itching to get this one finished soon. I have so many headcanons, and my goal is create my own universe like little0bird and Northumbrian...except I also want to write about other characters (like the Marauders and Dumbledore).

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=18545&chapter=1][Innocent Until Proven Guilt]] was my first ever fanfiction. I lost this one for years, so it's funny to look back. I remember I had it saved in a plastic folder with a cover sheet.

And [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=33027][this]] is my page of mostly abandoned fics from over the years. The one furthest back says 2009, but it's more like 2006. Shades of Gray (/sigh/ published before 50 Shades of Gray, so no relation) is by far my best, and I'm hoping to rewrite that one for my new page.
