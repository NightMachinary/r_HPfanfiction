There was a (rather) famous cartoonist for a young-teen comic strip that went on for years in a certain country. One of the running gags was a pair with a girl who was proudly a virgin and her boyfriend's continuous failed attempts to get in her pants.

He drew a comic strip where they finally have sex for an underground comic magazine... and it jokes about how years of sexual frustration (though technically, the comic strip had a simpsonsesque "no time passage" thing going on) were released.

The point of this is that sometimes, an author has to keep to some themes in "proper" publication. HP books have no sexual content, the violence is toned down, and the writing style is purposefully restrained to keep it to a teenage-friendly format. Only in book seven do depictions of violence get gruesome, and even then some facts are glossed over (Lavender died a slow and painful death from Greyback's assault, for instance). There are so many things that JKR hints at and later told in interviews that are quite fascinating for a more mature audience, and the temptation to put it out there for people to read may very well exist.
