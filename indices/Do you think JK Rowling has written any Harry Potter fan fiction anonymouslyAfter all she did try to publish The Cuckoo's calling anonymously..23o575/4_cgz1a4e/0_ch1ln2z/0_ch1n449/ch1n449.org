I think the worst hinted-at-but-not-told is Umbrigde taken away in the forest by the centaurs... Well everyone knows what happens to women kidnapped by centaurs (in mythology).

It makes it that much more horrible and cruel that they laugh at her shudders when they mimic the sound of horse hooves.

Your explanation on why she would publish fanfics is interesting however. I'd believe that reason over wanting feedback on her writing.
