For shits and gigs, I suppose. Maybe she's written something that wouldn't be entirely appropriate for the young HP audience and maybe it only took her am hour to come up with it? She knows she can't publish it but wants to stick it out there and see what happens. We already know she is interested in what the world thinks of her writing outside of her JKR penname.

I wonder if she gets ideas for new parts of the books, missing moments and whatnot. I'm sure she does, like we all do - maybe she's put them online secretly. I would kill to have a peek at her head canon/missing moments.
