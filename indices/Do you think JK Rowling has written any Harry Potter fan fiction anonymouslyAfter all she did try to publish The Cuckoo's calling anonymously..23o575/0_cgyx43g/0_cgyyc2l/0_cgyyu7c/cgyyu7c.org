If you haven't read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, it's a classic.

Delicate by padfoot4ever is my favorite Scorpius/Rose story of all time.

I adore Harry Potter and the Summer After the War for a great post-war Harry/Ginny.

Consequences by Pandora Jones is an awesome Tonks/Remus fic.

I'll try to come up with more if you like.
