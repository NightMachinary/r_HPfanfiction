Well there was a one that I refused to read where Rose gets pregnant. It was one of the top rated fics on ff.net. I think Wizards should have perfect or pretty close to perfect prophylactics and I think of Rose as someone too smart to not be on birth control if she's planning to have sex, then she'd use some type of plan B Wizarding thing too if necessary. So it breaks my suspension of disbelief and isn't attractive in any way really. Not to mention she'd have to decide to throw away her future and not have an abortion as well
