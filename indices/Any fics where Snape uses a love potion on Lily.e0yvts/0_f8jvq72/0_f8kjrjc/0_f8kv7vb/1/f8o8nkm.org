a specific ingredient in love potions that is vital to them working that sadly acts as an anti viagra for men and makes them completely flacid. The substance is so strong that kissing someone who has consumed the potion will effect the male also. The effects of love potions are strong enough that someone under it's control will have extreme urges to kiss the person to show there love.

The ones in Fred and Georges shop could be a perfume that makes the user appear more attractive but in the end is used like make up or a low cut top and onlycapable of gaining attention.

They are important to the plot in the book for the purpose of making Voldemort even weirder by being the product of a squib raping a muggle.

The potion itself is barely touched on in canon and people just take it as a potion of mild difficulty that causes complete love to the person it is keyed to. Really it could be a fairly weak potion that has similar effects as alcohol by dulling someones mind and effecting decission making processes. It could also be extremely obvious to someone else that the potion is in use. It's effects could be mild on a magical person but completely controlling when given to a muggle. The potion could be incredibly difficult to brew and poisonous if done wrong so many do not risk it in case they poison the person they want to love them.

In the case of Merope Gaunt it is not known exactly what she gave Tom Sr just that it was assumed to be a powerful love potion. For all we know she could have used a dark ritual that sacrificed her ability to properly concieve children to cause Tom Sr to love her but the ritual is not permanent thus Tom Sr kicks her out and Tom Jr is born with severe brain damage.
