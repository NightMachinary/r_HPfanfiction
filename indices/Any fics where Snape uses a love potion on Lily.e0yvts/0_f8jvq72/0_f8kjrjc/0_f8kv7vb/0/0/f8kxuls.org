Of course, but that kind of goes along with my head canon of there being multiple kinds of love potions with different effects. Without those kinds of restrictions on at least some potions, the Weasleys are straight up selling super-powered magical roofies to minors, which is very morally questionable.

So my solution for this is to assume that Fred and George sell more “harmless”, milder potions, while Merope went all out on Riddle Senior.
