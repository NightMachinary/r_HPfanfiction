I don't think love potions are rape potions.

I think they're something which creates an obsession which a real wizard is supposed to have the capacity to resist and that this is why it's tolerated that children use them. Something like that it's expected that people are to have experienced and understood this kind of obsession before they are deemed adults, perhaps so that they can distinguish it from love.
