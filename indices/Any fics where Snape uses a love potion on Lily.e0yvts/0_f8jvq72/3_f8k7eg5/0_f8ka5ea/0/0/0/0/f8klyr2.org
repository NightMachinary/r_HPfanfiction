I fail to follow the logic here at all, but clearly people prefer to downvote a level headed discussion instead of arguing, so I'll probably stop after this.

So because love is a major theme of the series, it would be weird to /not/ include rape-potions? That's what you're saying, right? What does love have to do with rape?

  the Killing Curse is unblockable because Death is inevitable.

So they can only block spells that who's concept isn't inevitable? I mean, the heat death of the universe is inevitable, so why is it possible to freeze things?

I'm not arguing that you /can't/ have rape-potions in your story. I'm saying I'll never understand her decision to include them when there was plenty of room to come up with "excuses" (read: legitimate reasons) for them not to work.
