I'm sorry, but you're not making any sense, at all.

  Yes, it would be weird to use every bit of mythology except love potions
#+end_quote

How the bloody hell does JKR use "every bit of mythology"? What "mythology" are you referring to?

#+begin_quote
  But I'm also calling them love potions
#+end_quote

You can call them whatever you want. They're rape potions. And they have /nothing/ to do with love or any other "major theme" of the books.

  All life will end if that happens. Not every living thing will have the pleasure of feeling the big freeze
#+end_quote

Oh, so we're moving the goal posts then. Good to know. So it's about what "all living things must know", rather than something that is inevitable now, is it? How convenient.

It's been a pleasure gathering downvotes for arguing that rape-potions aren't necessary lol.
