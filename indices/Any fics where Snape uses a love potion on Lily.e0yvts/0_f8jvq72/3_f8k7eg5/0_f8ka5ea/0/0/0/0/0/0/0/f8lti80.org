  How the bloody hell does JKR use "every bit of mythology"? What "mythology" are you referring to?
#+end_quote

It's a clear exaggeration, but Harry Potter is full of the mythologies of the world. You can google which ones.

  So it's about what "all living things must know", rather than something that is inevitable now, is it?
#+end_quote

I didn't move a goal post. How is death is inevitable different from all living things will know death? Lmfao, people who died 20 years ago won't die from the big freeze, but they're certainly dead. I hope that's better wording.
