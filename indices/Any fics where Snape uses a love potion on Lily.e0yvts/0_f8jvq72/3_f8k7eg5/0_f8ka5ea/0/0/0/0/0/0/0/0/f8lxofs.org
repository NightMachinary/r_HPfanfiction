  It's a clear exaggeration, but Harry Potter is full of the mythologies of the world. You can google which ones.

No shit it has mythologies from the real world, congratulations. When I asked why it would be weird to omit rape potions, you said:

"Yes, it would be weird to use every bit of mythology except love potions".

There's plenty of mythologies from the real world that aren't in the books. There's no medusa, there's no cyclops, there's no chupacabra, there's no "magical beans"... the list goes on and on. You can't pick and choose some mythologies and then claim she uses enough (or "every bit", as you said) that it justifies including rape potions... that doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever.

  How is death is inevitable different from all living things will know death?
#+end_quote

Whoa boy, I really hope you can keep up with this: it's different because the logic behind the killing curse being unblockable was that death was inevitable, not something "all life will know". I mean, all life will also know what it's like to consume energy, meaning some form sustenance is inevitable (otherwise the lifeform wouldn't be alive), but wizards still can't conjure up food.

There's plenty of things that are inevitable. Using the inevitability of death as an excuse to not be able to block the killing curse is both lazy and illogical - why is it possible to block a full body bind curse? It's inevitable that "all living things" won't be able to move by their own will at some point. The inevitability argument doesn't make sense.
