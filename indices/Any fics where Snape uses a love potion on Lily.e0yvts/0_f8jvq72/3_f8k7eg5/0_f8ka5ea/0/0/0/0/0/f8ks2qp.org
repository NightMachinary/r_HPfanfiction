  So because love is a major theme of the series, it would be weird to not include rape-potions? That's what you're saying, right?
#+end_quote

Yes, it would be weird to use every bit of mythology except love potions. I'm personally not seeing the problem. It is established in every book magic has a dark side. It's also weird to draw the line at things we have near real life equivalents for, when we see two kids knock out two other children, drug them, and steal their personalities.

  What does love have to do with rape?
#+end_quote

You have to ask the gods of yore. But I'm also calling them love potions and remembering that JKR used them to establish that love cannot be brewed or conjured.

  So they can only block spells that who's concept isn't inevitable? I mean, the heat death of the universe is inevitable, so why is it possible to freeze things?
#+end_quote

All life will /end/ if that happens. Not every living thing will have the pleasure of feeling the big freeze, but all living things must know death. You can delay it, but we will all have to greet it like an old friend. That's the difference here.
