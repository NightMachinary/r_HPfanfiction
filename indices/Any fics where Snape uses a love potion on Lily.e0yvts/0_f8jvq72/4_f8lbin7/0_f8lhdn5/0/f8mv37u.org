Define it however you want in your comments. In HP-canon, as well as in folklore, classic literature and poems, that particular literaty device and fictional item is called a "love potion". Arguing definitions is outside the scope of this discussion.

  She didn't have to.

  I'm saying I don't understand the choice

That choice was perfectly consistent with the core spirit of HP-verse throughout the series --- that being a reflection of centuries-old folklore, as well as its morals and notions (I'd reckon also mixed with some criticism towards real-life Great Britain). Book 1 had a hag selling dubious nails and hair, quidditch with its Bludgers and falls from great heights, and a school being used as a bait for VD; book 2 had polyjuice, bone-vanishing Lockhart, and a Basilisk; book 3 had an unsecured magically contagious werewolf professor hidden from parents and the board of governors; book 4 had obliviation of muggles with no regard for their rights or safety, DE muggle-baiting with no repercussions, and an extrajudicial execution; book whatever had the Zabini getting away with a long chain of dead husbands; book 5 had ministry-approved child torture.

Magical Britain's society is not intended to be described as a rightous one, or even one "in sync" with modern Western morals and ideals. Love potions get smuggled into the castle for the same reason why the Weasley twins are testing on the lower year students their products and getting away with it: wizards (of Magical Britain, at least) don't much care about muggle-based morals, they have their own perspective. And cherry-picking out love potions while leaving everything else intact would've made no sense and just censored the characters to look less like themselves.

  a rape potion is specifically for raping

1) You are confusing [[https://imgur.com/a/3eObLmd][aphrodisiacs]] that are intended to increase the consumer's libido (like the cheering charm is intended to make the target cheer up) with Amortentia and its effects of obsessiveness / false love. Varieties of the former were what I assume the twins were smuggling, and the latter was what was used as a plot device in VD's background story. I am assuming being able to handle libido fluctuations (in the sense that if you fail then it's on you --- see characters' reactions to people overwhelmed by Veela allure) is expected from wizards and witches just as it's expected that they'll bounce off the ground when dropped from a window as a baby. 2) Counterargument scenario: a pureblood pair has to merry each other when neither likes the other. Love potions (of both varieties) help both of them throughout their marriage.

I assumed that you wouldn't have found so many things problematic, because otherwise you wouldn't be interested in HP at all. The fault is mine, so I apologise.

Because they all look like pieces of the same consistent characterisation of wizards and their magical abilities to me (see above).
