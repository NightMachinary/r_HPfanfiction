  Because she didn't introduce them
#+end_quote

She introduced them /into her story/. She didn't have to. I'm not saying she introduced them to the world at large. You're arguing something against something I didn't say.

#+begin_quote
  And if you want to criticise JKR for "rape potions", then at least be consistent and criticise her setting all the way through:
#+end_quote

First of all, let's be clear - the way JKR's "love potions" work makes them literally rape potions. Not "love potions" in any way, shape or form.

Secondly, I'm not criticizing her for introducing them, she can do whatever she wants to. I'm saying I don't understand the choice, and I'm arguing against people who say that it "makes sense" because "love is a major theme of the books", as if a rape potion has anything to do with love.

Thirdly, even if I wanted to, I can't criticize one aspect of worldbuilding just because I'm not /actively/ criticizing the rest? How do you know I don't have anything against the rest of the spells you listed? You're arguing a strawman, yet again. I never said anything about the rest of the spells. And for the record, I hate the Killing Curse because it ruins a lot of otherwise potentially cool duels where now instead every bad guy just uses that because it's so over powered.

I don't have any problem with Imperius or Obliviate or anything like that. They're not the same as rape potion. You can theoretically rape someone using Imperius (never canonically stated, maybe people wold resist at that point, but whatever), but a rape potion is /specifically/ for raping.

Furthermore, Imperio is /illegal/ in the wizarding world, whereas rape potions are apparently not only barely frowned upon, but Fred and George can freely sell it to hormonal and horny teenagers, no questions asked.

  But if we (or the author) sterilised the story to remove everything potentially offensive from it disregarding the context of the culture and intent, we'd be left with an insipid husk of a setting
#+end_quote

Again, no one is arguing for the "sterilization of the story" or removing everything potentially offensive. Well, I certainly am not, at least. You are arguing something that I am not saying, yet again, again. I'm just saying I don't understand the choice of introducing rape potions to her story. It baffles me. I have no problem with "potentially offensive" things in fiction.
