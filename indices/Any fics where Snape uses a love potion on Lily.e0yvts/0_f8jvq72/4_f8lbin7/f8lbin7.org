Because she didn't /introduce/ them. She stood on the shoulders of European fairy tales and lore and adapted parts of such lore to better suit the next generation of children. If you check [[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/864axe/i_just_found_the_link_to_the_university_of/][old, historical children stories,]] you'll find them to be generally much more brutal than what's currently being printed for the same age brackets.

Regarding the "rape-potions": [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LovePotion/Literature][love potions]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_magic][love magic]] are a common motif in the folklore of many different ethnicities. And it would've been surprising if they weren't, really. Many people would either be ending up with a partner they didn't want or fail to end up with one that they did want. So naturally being able to "love-charm" the object of love-interest would be a common fantasy and thus folklore.

And if you want to criticise JKR for "rape potions", then at least be consistent and criticise her setting all the way through:

#+begin_quote
  Avada Kedavra
#+end_quote

she introduces a murdering spell

#+begin_quote
  Crucio
#+end_quote

a torture spell!

#+begin_quote
  polyjuice potion
#+end_quote

a potion that can be used to make involuntary pornography

#+begin_quote
  Obliviate, Imperio
#+end_quote

tools for slavery

#+begin_quote
  Legilimency
#+end_quote

a tool for violation of privacy and creation of though police!

#+begin_quote
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_deity][house elves]]
#+end_quote

not only does she introduce slaves, but her slaves outright enjoy being enslaved to wizards! What argument is she trying to make with a worldbuilding element like this?!

#+begin_quote
  Cheering Charm
#+end_quote

Is she condoning drug addiction and antidepressant epidemic?

TL;DR is that if someone overanalyses a childrens' book series, --- one the setting of which is based on historical motifs and tropes, --- through the prism of outrage culture for long enough, then /of course/ they'll find things to be offended or outraged about. But if we (or the author) sterilised the story to remove everything potentially offensive from it disregarding the context of the culture and intent, we'd be left with an insipid husk of a setting that's not fun to even think about too long, let alone to read as a series of books.

p.s. JKR actually toned down her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_witchcraft#%22Witch%22_stock_character][source material]] by quite a bit by removing (or at least making it not directly cross the main character's field of awareness) things like pacts with the Devil, orgies, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel#Plot][cannibalism,]] etc from the adaptation.
