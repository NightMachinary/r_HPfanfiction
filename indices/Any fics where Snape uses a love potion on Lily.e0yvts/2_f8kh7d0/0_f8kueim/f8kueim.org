That sounds like a wacky idea for a fic, but could be interesting in execution. Care to share a link?

I do agree that the idea is disturbing. I don't think that such a scenario could ever really be "harmless" in real life because human beings are too prone to emotional baggage. That's one of the reasons that people opt for medical methods of artificial insemination instead of actually sleeping with the semen donor. I've read some fics which had fanon spells or potions that functioned like artificial insemination, plus Lily should have enough muggle roots to be aware of the non-magical options in the 80s, so I'd consider it unlikely that she would settle on sleeping with her gay friend as the only viable choice.
