I was never really able to picture Snape as a rapist. Sure, I can see him get the thought during his active DE days, but I could never see him go through with it.

I remember one Severitus fic where they wiÄºlingly fed each other love potions (Snape was gay -- probably specifically to absolve him of wrongdoing here because I think the fic was gen otherwise) for a day for the purpose of "artificial" insemination. James was sterile. Even in such a "harmless" (morality-wise) case, I was still rather disturbed by it.
