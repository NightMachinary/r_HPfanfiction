My advice is to suck it up and use the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?&languageid=1&rating=4&ppage=202][Beta page]] on ff.net to find someone to help make you a better writer. I've recently found two who are extremely good. Just send a polite PM with the details of your story and ask them if they'd be interested. I promise you'll gain some insight from a fresh pair of eyes on your work.

The link I've given is for all Harry Potter betas who have recently updated their profiles, hence they're more likely to still have active accounts.

You'll probably have to send multiple copies to people you think might help, so get a 'form letter' ready.

Mine looks like this:

  Dear XXXXXX,

  My name is XXXXXXX and I'm looking for a Beta reader for a story I'm writing in the Harry Potter universe. Here are the relevant details:

  Tentative Title: XXXXXX

  Genre: XXXXXX

  Rating: XXXXX

  Pairing: XXXXXX

  Summary: XXXXXXX

  If this sounds like something you'd be interested in beta'ing, please reply in a PM and I'll send you the Prologue. If not, no hard feelings.

Hope this helps.
