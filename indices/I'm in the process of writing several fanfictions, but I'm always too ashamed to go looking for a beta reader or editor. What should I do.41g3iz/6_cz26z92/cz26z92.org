I'm afraid so. I can guarantee that you're not going to be judged for writing what you want. I like to read harem fics; you don't get much more wish fulfillment than that.

Get a beta and let them have a look. If for some odd reason you do get a beta who judges (unfairly) what you wrote, drop them immediately and find another. You don't have to put up with that crap, nor do you deserve to.

If it's not graphic slash, I'd be happy to give what you wrote a once over, whatever it is. I'm a bit of a grammar nazi, so you can be sure your writing would be put through the grammatical wringer!
