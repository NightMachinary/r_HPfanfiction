I can almost guarantee that anything you've come up with has been written before, and I'm not saying that to be mean but to reassure you that others share your interests and that it's highly unlikely you'll shock everyone. No need to be self conscious :).

As for finding a beta I know fanfiction.net has messgae boards for it but I don't have a link. You can probably find them by googling combinations of 'betas' 'fanfiction' 'Harry potter' etc. Livejournal also still has active communities both for writing in general and more specific pairings. Not knowing what your pairing is I can't really link you but, again, Google will usually turn up some results.
