Ask. If you are trying to make a grammatically well done fic, you are already doing better than a quarter of other writers. It really depends on what you want your beta to do.

Also a point to look at is this: if you are worried about letting /one/ person look at your fic who is meant to help you improve, what are you going to do when /multiple/ others read it and have an open line to comment?
