I haven't actually read more than a dozen or so paragraphs (Abusive!Dursleys are just not my cup of tea), but I just wanted to let you know that I actually quite enjoy your style of writing. It's fresh and poetic. Unfortunately, I have to agree that it /will/ get extremely tiresome after a few chapters. I know you don't want to rewrite this, but this style should really be reserved for short stories. It's just too choppy to sustain a 400,000 word fic.
