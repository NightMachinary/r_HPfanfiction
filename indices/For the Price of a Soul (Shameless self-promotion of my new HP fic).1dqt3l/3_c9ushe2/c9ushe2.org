To be honest, I just went to take a look because of this fuss about your writing style - and boy I was rewarded.

I like your style. I /loved/ the bit about - about one of my favourite characters ever, there in the second episode, and the story went from nice to amazing just like that.

And I hate it that I found this before it was completed. Damn I hate waiting.

EDIT: I also checked out your favourite stories for new pieces to read, and was not disappointed. Will continue to stalk.
