Parentheses are generally used to de-emphasize text, or to include text that does not fit with the flow of the thought but you still want to include.

You shouldn't be doing either of those things in fiction because in either case, you're inserting your own perspective into the narrative.

Something like:

/Hi, my name is Jim and I'll be your narrator today./
