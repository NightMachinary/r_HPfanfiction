Hey in most states you can marry second cousins so legally for instance I could have married my grandmother's sister's grandaughter. Harry and Tonks are much greater removed than that if you prefer the canon Fleamont and Euphemia as Harry's grandparents. They are 2nd cousins if you prefer the fanon choice of Dorea and Charlus as Harry's grandparents.

And 6 years difference for magicals who can live to be over 100 is not that significant at all. Don't forget that women hit their sexual peak at 35-40 and men hit it at late teens early 20's. So the matchup isn't that strange. Add in Harry's fame, in fics wealth, and his normal treating women very well why wouldn't a slightly older woman be interested in him?
