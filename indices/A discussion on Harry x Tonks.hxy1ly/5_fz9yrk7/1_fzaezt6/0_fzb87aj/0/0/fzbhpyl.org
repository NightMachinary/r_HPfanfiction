Ok I can understand. As a guy I was almost out of college before I dated a girl who was my age or younger. Most of the women I went out with were 10+ years older than me. Now a big part of that was due to me working almost fulltime hours with adults from 13 years and up. In fact I got along better with adults than I did with kids my age. By the time I hit 16 between my size and how I carried myself/behaved most folks who met me thought i was in college or had just gotten out.

So I have little problem with a Tonks/Harry or Fleur/Harry ship. However, for it to work the fic has to have Harry acting a lot more mature than he does in canon. Otherwise with canon Harry it doesn't really work.
