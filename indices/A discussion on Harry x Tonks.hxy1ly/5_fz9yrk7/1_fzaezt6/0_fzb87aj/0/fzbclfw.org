I meant that Sirius and Tonks are cousins. Harry and Tonks aren't related at all AFIAK, so that's not really an issue with the pairing.

I am, however, of the opinion that's it's morally wrong for a 20-something to be with a 15-16 year old. I'm 23 myself, and I could personally not see myself going for a school age boy in a million years, despite the age of consent being 15 here. Harry would of course think himself more mature than the average 15-year old, but there's an ocean of life experience between him and Tonks. Add in that she is an officer of the law, and you have a power imbalance as well.

What I'm saying is I don't see a relationship happening between them before Harry is 19, 20. Then I would agree that the age difference is less important.
