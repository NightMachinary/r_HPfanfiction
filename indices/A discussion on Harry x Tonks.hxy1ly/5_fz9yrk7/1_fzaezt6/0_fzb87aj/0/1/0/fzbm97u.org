I think that in a relationship that is already equal, that's reasonable. Of course she shouldn't be prohibited from pursuing love because she's an auror. But as an auror, she is in a position of trust, of authority. I believe in some US states, for example, such a position changes the age of consent to 18.

This is of course a personal moral question, and I understand that people will disagree that her occupation affects the situation. It is my opinion that it, in combination with Harry's age, places them at vastly different power levels in a relationship.
