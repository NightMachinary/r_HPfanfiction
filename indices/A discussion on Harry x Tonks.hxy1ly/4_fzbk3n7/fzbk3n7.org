  Tonks has a stable job, and probably has met colleagues she has feelings for by that point in time.

Well, compared to Lupin, her canonical husband, almost everyone short of Draco Malfoy and the like would have been a better choice. But it shows that she did not have an interest in her colleagues.

  but even without that I still cannot understand this ship

Because Tonks was one of the coolest background characters in the series (before book 6 at least), with a sense of humour, a mischievous streak and a unique look (only one in the series outside of "natural" hair colours). She did not come across as a haughty bitch, isn't a pureblood and frankly sounds most "date-able". Hermione would be difficult to get through to, Ginny comes with the baggage of her big family, Fleur is out of the league of mere mortals and Luna is batshit insane.
