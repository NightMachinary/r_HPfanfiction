Eh, I can understand it when Harry is in his 20s...they get on well enough in the books and I think writers like to write a more "light hearted" Harry who enjoys pranks, etc. But yeah, barely graduated Harry with Tonks is bizarre and makes zero sense. If they're going to pair him with an "older" woman though Fleur makes far more sense as she's only 3 years older than him in canon. If anything, Fleur Harry makes more sense than Fleur Bill as Bill must be at least 8 or so years older than her. Not only he, but Charlie, had graduated by the time Ron started Hogwarts...so a newly graduated Fleur (17, 18 at the most) dating a 25-28 year old Bill is pretty yikes.

That said, there are far, far more bizarre pairings....Harry/Snape, Hermione/Snape, Harry/Tom Riddle, etc.
