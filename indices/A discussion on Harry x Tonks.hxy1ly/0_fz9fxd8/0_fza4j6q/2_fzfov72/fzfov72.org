True, in canon in Book 4 he still was a kid and she thought of him as a kid. 14 year old Harry is a stretch and pretty gross...I forgot he was only 14 and thought he was 15 in book 4. 15 and 17 isn't unheard of.

That said, if we're talking about an AU a 18 year old Harry does kind of make more sense with a 20/21 year old Fleur versus 20/21 year old Fleur with 28 year old (possibly older) Bill. Not that there's anything wrong with the latter, but I was 20 only a few years ago and I would find it kind of weird, but not that weird, of a friend dating an 18 year old but would find a friend dating a guy in his late 20s stranger.

TLDR: there's a big life gap between people 18-22 and people 25+.
