The only plausible scenarios I can see that happening are:

(a) Semi-AU: Tonks never had a kid with Remus, Voldemort has already been defeated, and they are both working in the DMLE in possibly a senior/junior relationship.

(b) Complete AU

...yeah my mind is limited. But I would expect to see something along these lines for a well developed, in character, pairing between Harry and Tonks.
