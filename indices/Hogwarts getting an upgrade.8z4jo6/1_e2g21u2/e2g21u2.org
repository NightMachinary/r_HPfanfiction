Hogwarts was a parody of a British boarding school. I'd also question whether (even more) grade segregation would be a good thing. Some systems, like Montessori, consider interactions across age groups to be a fundamental component.

Also, keep in mind that Hogwarts looks badly designed from the point of view of an adolescent who is not very studious or attentive, and who has a personal conflict with at least one of the teachers. Not only that, the school that we saw had been magically sabotaged by the DADA curse for decades.
