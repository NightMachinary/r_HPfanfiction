Not really, no. There were some thoughts about the backstory, however.

Basically, Department of Mysteries had this charity project to "uplift" Muggles and accelerate their development. This was done through prenatal interventions, imbuing some Muggles with varying amounts of technological talent and preternatural charisma. This was meant to create leaders who could both create and integrate big ideas and get others to go along to implement them. Some of their successes may have been Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, Elon Musk, and Craig Venter.

Naturally, the Unspeakables were strictly prohibited from experimenting on wizards and witches, so they carefully checked the ancestry of every potential intervention subject. Hermione Granger had no known magical ancestry.

At first, her intervention appeared to be a success: young Hermione was very good at designing and engineering things, and at getting other people to go along. However, in August of 1991, she suddenly went off the radar. When she resurfaced at Hogwarts shortly after, the Unspeakables were had the unenviable realisation that they had accidentally experimented on a witch and that if it came to light, they would be in huge trouble; but also an opportunity to study something that hasn't been seen before: the Muggle technocharisma uplift applied to a wizard or a witch creates a Spark.
