Ha, I've actually been roughing out a story that would have Hogwarts reforms be a large part of the background world... but I'll be honest, I don't think I'll ever actually write it, so I don't mind sharing what I had:

Basically the idea was that James Potter survived (and maybe Sirius and the Longbottoms were not incapacitated as well). He/they would form both a check on Lucious Malfoy and push Dumbledore towards being more active, although their actions wouldn't always have the intended/positive consequences. One of those would be educational reform, which Lucious actually supports (Dumbledore doesn't much), but they would clash over various issues.

Some changes I had in mind:

-more teachers or at least upper year TAs to help out. Slughorn for potions for sure.

-splitting some classes (like herbology and potions) into theory lectures for all houses of a year at once, then practical sessions for 1-2 houses at a time

-possibly some inter-House... I knew them as 'labs' when I was in uni but there's probably another name. Like these short group meetings with an upper year to ask questions or do quick review, usually in the evenings/weekend

-possibly an advanced track or remedial/applied/academic split, so students could be taught at their appropriate level

-more administrative staff, who don't teach. Maybe even House Head becomes a more ceremonial/unofficial position with a new role introduced for officially dealing with issues

-astronomy moved to a 3rd and up elective?

-Binns replaced- I had in mind it would be one of Lucious' choices, who unfortunately has a bit of a wizard supremacist bias

-two paired courses, one in first year as an introduction to wizarding society, one in fourth year perhaps about learning enough of muggle society to be able to blend in properly (Muggle Studies is much more in-depth though)

-some more clubs and activities beyond quidditch: although actually cannon hints that there were such things, since Umbridge banned them, but Harry never every paid any attention to them

-more quidditch matches per year?

But ah, hehe you probably want fics that actually exist right now, right? Unfortunately I don't have much.

There's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter]]) by Taure, who I think is a regular here? It's short so far but has a lot of world-building and thought put in. Like 'Flying' class is essentially gym class (not just flying, but running, archery, fencing, etc) for all the years simultaneously. There's supervised homework time, a bunch of neat character-building ideas for the House Common rooms (like... [[/spoiler][Griffindor has doors leading outside and brooms set by them, so you can go flying whenever]]). Very good.

It's not Hogwarts, but Charmbridge Academy in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/4/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]]) is very much set up like a large school would be. There's deans for each grade; common rooms by year; there's no Houses, just what dorm you're in; multiple academic levels for each class; various extra-curricular clubs and activities including a deuling club, a dance or two each year and a magical jrotc; multiple teachers per subject; the same sort of combined-year magic gym/flying class as mentioned before.

There's also linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7619993/1/Calculation]]), which is a one shot crack fic that deals with a bunch of this stuff. I... I feel like this may or may not be the one OP mentioned already having read but I don't know.
