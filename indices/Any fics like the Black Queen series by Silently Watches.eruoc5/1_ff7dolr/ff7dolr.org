All According to Plan by LysandraLeigh, and its sequels, are very similar.

The protagonist flaunts her power more, maybe, and it's a little bit lighter in tone because Bella is kind of manic and doesn't brood like Jen. It either took the whole "old magic" and powers thing from Silently Watches, or they both trace back to some other inspiration. linkffn(13001792)
