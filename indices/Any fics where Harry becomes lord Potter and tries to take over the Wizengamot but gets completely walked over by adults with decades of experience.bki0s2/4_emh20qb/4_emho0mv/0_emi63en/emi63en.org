I think 100 pages is enough benefit of the doubt for a reader to give to an author. It reminded me of the Enid Blyton novels I enjoyed as a kid, /The Secret Seven/ and /The Famous Five,/ Even /Malory Towers/ reminds me of Hogwarts, great for that age, not my taste any more. Weird though that I enjoy a lot of fanfic though.

Still, thanks for the tip. The movie was my favourite.
