The description is an extreme under statement, multi-wives? Fuck it 33 wives in the first three chapters already, multiple lordships? Fuck it, like 70 lordships and titles like "king of magical britain" and "owner of the universe"

Those crossovers? Only for Harry to have more titles.

Edit: never fucking mind the wives and titles were all in the first chapter
