I always thought that Harry had special emerald eyes. Like a color that people don't normally, if ever, has. I always picture that some people in the universe has green eyes, obviously, but not like Harry's. They're greenish-blue, greenish-hazel, forest green, sea foam green. And you get the point. Harry Potter is the main character so he's special. That's just how it worked for me when I was eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc reading the books. And since Harry is special with emerald eyes “just like his mother” so she had these really special eyes too. Read a great fan fiction where the emerald eyes they had were directly linked to the killing curse giving them an edge for necromancy. It was amazing! (And for added reference Lily was the child of a great-squib who was kicked from their family for not having magic. After a generation the Magic came back inside of Lily. She never knew.)
