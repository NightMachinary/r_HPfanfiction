This reminds me of editing my first-ever Nanowrimo draft, and realizing that every.single.character had "inky black hair." I face-palmed hard and then went through randomly assigning blond and brown and red hair to people.

Just like JKR clearly loves redheads, maybe SHE doesn't know lots of green eyed people? So she wanted her special snowflake boy and his magical mama to have the special pretty eyes?
