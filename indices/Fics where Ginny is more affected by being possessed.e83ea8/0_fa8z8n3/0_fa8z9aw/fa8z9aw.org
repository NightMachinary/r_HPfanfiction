  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "Innocent" and "Initiate".

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

Extreme Ron-bashing!

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

  What happened between Ginny and her curse-breaker brother when the Weasleys visited Bill after CoS? Because I never bought the idea that after a mug of hot chocolate, "Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again."

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
