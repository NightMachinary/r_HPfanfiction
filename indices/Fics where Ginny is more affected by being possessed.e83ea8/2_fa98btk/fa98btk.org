[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] linkao3(189189) - Slytherin!Ginny AU, eventual Harry/Ginny, part of a WIP series. You've probably already read it, given how often it's recced here, but I'm including it for completeness's sake.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/882572][Secrets]] linkao3(882572) - CoS from Ginny's POV, canon compliant, gen, complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21175184][stumble on a secret power]] linkao3(21175184) - long canon compliant oneshot covering her life from her first year to ~the epilogue, Harry/Ginny.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2249544][lost: in defense of ginny weasley]] linkao3(2249544) - canon compliant oneshot, Harry/Ginny. (The same author has another oneshot called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] linkao3(6997183) which doesn't strictly meet your request, but may still be of interest.)
