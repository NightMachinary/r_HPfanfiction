  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.

  All stories have a beginning. This is one of them: the diary, the girl, the quill dipped in ink. Don't trust a magical object if you can't see where it keeps its brain, Arthur would admonish months later, but Ginny had grown up in a house crammed with unknown magic, had no memory of a life separate from talking mirrors and singing teapots and the tinny complaints of Great-Uncle Alfie's chess set. She was just turned eleven years old, and she wanted a friend. Was this to be her crime?

  Or were they something else entirely, this trio who was not golden? They were the unchosen three: the discarded Horcrux and the last Weasley; the brave, broken backup Boy Who Lived; the loony girl who lost her shoes and had more friends in thestrals than in her common room.Ginny rallied an army in the Room of Requirement with her mother's knack for raised voices, Riddle's smooth words, Harry's agitated passion, and wondered if she was the hero of this story.

  angelsarenamederika asked: "Have you ever written any works about that clean, empty train station Harry ended up in? Or rather, what that place may have looked like for other people?" At eleven years old, Ginny Weasley almost died on the cold Chamber floor.
