[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry_Potter_and_Godrics_Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]] by hermyd. This is one of those "Harry strikes out on his own" type stories, with a little Dumbledore bashing if that bothers you.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5307000/1/Just_You_and_Me][Just You and Me]] by kq551. This is a retelling of canon if Harry and Ginny had become friends sooner. A couple warnings: a) this is not a complete story, though it was updated a few months ago so it might still be finished eventually, and b) it gets a bit dark after CoS, with some implied pedophila (onesided Tom Riddle/Ginny).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] by S'TarKan. Harry, having lived through Voldemort and gang killing everyone he loves, sends his consciousness back in time to his 11 year old self. This story is NOT COMPLETE, much to my dismay, and probably never will be (has not been updated since 2009). But it's fantastic, and there is Harry/Ginny. It's very limited, though, since Ginny is a kid and Harry is not creepy, even though in his "past future" he and Ginny were married.
