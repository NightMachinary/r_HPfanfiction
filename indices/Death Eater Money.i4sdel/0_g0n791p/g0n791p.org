I like the idea of only being able to take the Lordship if you are one hundred percent human. Use the Pureblood's own laws against the so-called champion of "purebloods". I wouldn't call book 5/6/7's Voldemort human, he's more of a necromantic homonculus. Even then, with Dumbledore saying Tom looked "remarkably different" when he showed up for the DADA position, he could have lost his humanity then with rituals and whatnot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/1/Ah-Screw-It][Ah, Screw It!]] uses the fact that Voldemort had the Death Eaters swear fealty to Slytherin House. Harry pulls rite of conquest and effectively becomes their leigelord/owner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]] also has the rite of conquest + fealty oaths. But it's more of a post-war society rebuilding fic.
