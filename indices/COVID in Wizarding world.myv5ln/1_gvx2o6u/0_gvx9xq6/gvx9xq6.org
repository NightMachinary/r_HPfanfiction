I don't remember all the details but I think in one of her Pottermore writings JK said wizards were affected by the black death just like Muggles (which might have been one of the Malfoys' curse that got out of control while trying to chase some Muggles off of his property or something). However she also said wizards are usually not affected by mundane disease. However even if that were not the case, wizards interact enough with people to bring the disease into their world (particularly Arthur who works with Muggles). All it takes is an obliviator who has to wipe the memory of a sick person. Soon the entire ministry is sick and considering how many people work for or interact with the ministry, you soon have the entire world infected.
