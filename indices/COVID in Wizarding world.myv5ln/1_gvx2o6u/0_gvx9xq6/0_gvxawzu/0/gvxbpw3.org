The wizards definitely have the common cold but they also have a cure for it. However according to JK's writings again... Linfred of Stitchcomb developed an early version of the Pepperup Potion with the final version being developed some time in the early 18th or 19th century. So it's quite likely that until the 13th century people could die of it just like regular Muggles and even in later years still suffer from the inconveniences of it until the final version of the Pepperup Potion was invented.
