You also have to consider 'how effective is magical healing?' All we see of it in canon is for magical accidents and physical injuries, not illnesses. There could be a potion that clears it up trivially, or at least the symptoms. If there isn't however, then potentially 'muggle' medicine with oxygen supplies and cocktails of anti-inflammatories and now vaccines don't necessarily have an equivalent in the magical world, so it could be far worse.
