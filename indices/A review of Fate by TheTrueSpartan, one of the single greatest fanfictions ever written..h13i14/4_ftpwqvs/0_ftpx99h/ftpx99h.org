I totally get that, like I said I think I get where the author was coming from with it, but it was way, way too big a deal. Like the beginning it was just a tournament in Diagon Alley that Ron won a couple of galleons from to buy nicer robes. Then it escalated to a weird level.

Like I said, if it had been duelling it would have made far more sense.
