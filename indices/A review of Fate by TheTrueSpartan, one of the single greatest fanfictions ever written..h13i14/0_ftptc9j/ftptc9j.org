  The writing is phenomenal. Like it's >1million words, updates very regularly and it's only been going for like a year and a bit and there are no spelling mistakes, no grammer issues, it's so well written it's unreal.

I mean, not to be more of a dick than I usually. But, well, it's grammar. And there's sentence structure and grammatical issues in the first paragraph. And they continue through the entire first chapter.

I figured maybe it improved so I went to chapter 114. Same things.

Again, not to be more of a dick than I usually am. I mean, hell, just ask [[/u/rpeh]] about some of my spelling errors in first drafts. But the sentence structure, which is a huge component of writing, is downright awful.
