Honestly, then you shouldn't be remotely calling something 'phenomenal.' There's a vast difference between 'phenomenal' and 'just incredible' writing and an author who doesn't seem to know the difference between a complete sentence, a run-on, and a fragment.

All you're doing by praising it is invalidating your own opinion when it is apparent by about the sixth paragraph that bad structure is going to stay through the entire thing. There's plenty of fanfiction that is capable of utilizing the most basic sentence structure principles.

It not bothering you is fine. But, well, that does not mean it's good writing.

And, as others have pointed out, the length alone shows that the author probably doesn't have much of a plan. I'd be willing to bet I could go through and edit out 80% of it and have the same story. A lot of it meanders. Two point five million words should be a red flag, not a selling point.
