If you're saying that this is "one of the single greatest fanfictions ever written" then you should be able to defend that position. Retreating behind a "It's just my opinion" defence is cowardly at best.

I read this story to somewhere around the chapter 40 mark before giving up. I excused the over-simplistic grammar at the start because I read the story as kind-of coming from Ron's mind, and eight-year-old boys aren't noted for their Dickensian writing ability. The trouble is that that doesn't stand up. Not only does the writing not improve as Ron ages, but it's still poor when the scene can't possibly be from his POV. So we're left with the result that it's just simple bad writing.

Fate doesn't come close to "tower[ing] above 99% of fanfiction in it's writting style". If you want examples of good writing in fanfiction, try [[/u/TE7]] since he's already here, plus - off the top of my head - [[/u/Starfox5]], [[/u/Taure]], and [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] since they're definitely on Reddit, and then murkybluematter, WhiteSquirrel, Northumbrian, Annerb, Shayalonnie, jbern, FarenMaddox, and AngelaStarCat. I'm not always a fan of what that lot write but I can at least appreciate that they know how to do it.

As to the length, Shakespeare used 884,421 words to produce 43 plays; the King James Bible has 783,137. To point out that Fate currently has 2.5M words isn't to compare the story to either of those but to show that the author is simply rambling. Whether or not the author has a plan, he's doing a hell of a lot of meandering along whatever path may or may not have been laid down. Pick any chapter in that story and you can cut out huge chunks of it because they're just not necessary. Want an example? How about this from chapter 33 - just where I happen to be:

#+begin_quote
  Ron woke up in his bed later that night. It was clear that a Healer had been there because there was an empty potion vial on his nightstand. His headache was still there, but it wasn't nearly as bad as before. Ron hoped that he never felt that kind of pain again. Deciding to go back to sleep, he closed his eyes and began trying to find a comfortable position.
#+end_quote

That paragraph appears between two lines in the story to indicate a separate scene. It adds nothing. If you really, really want to keep the information that the healer had been there, move that bit to the next morning. But personally I think there's 70 words that can be cut without losing anything - and there are examples like that everywhere.

In summary: yes there are definitely worse pieces of fanfiction out there. A lot of them, in fact. But this one is average at best. You should really read more widely before holding up this sort of thing as one of the best around.
