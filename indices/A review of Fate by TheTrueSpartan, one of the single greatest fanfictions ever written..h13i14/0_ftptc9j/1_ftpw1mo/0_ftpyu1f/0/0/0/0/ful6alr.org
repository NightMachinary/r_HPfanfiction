No you didn't. You whined about someone calling you out on the use of the word "phenomenal".

You also lack the ability to debate: I wasn't comparing fanfiction to Shakespeare and the Bible, I was using the total length of Shakespeare's works and the length of the Bible to point out that this one piece of fanfiction is far too long. If you want to bring the original books into it, those total 1,084,170 for seven books. This POS is already 250% longer.

If you genuinely think this story is one of the top five of all time, I feel sorry for you.
