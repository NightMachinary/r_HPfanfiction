And now you are misrepresenting what I said. Don't use quotation marks unless you're quoting what someone said.

If you use hyperbole, you should expect to be shot down. If you'd just said "I like this story" then people would have made passing comments and moved on. You invited this response by making outrageous claims that you have subsequently been utterly unable to back up.
