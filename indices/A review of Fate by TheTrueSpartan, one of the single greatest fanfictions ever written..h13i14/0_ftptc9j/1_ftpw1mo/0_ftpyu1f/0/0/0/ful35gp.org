I did defend that postition. You disagree based off less than half the story. That's fine. I won't get personal about it

I've read most of the people you're talking about, this is better, substantially in some cases.

I think complaining about the length alone is pointless, there's actually more words in Harry Potter itself than those things you mentioned. No complaints. Also comparing fanfiction to Shakespeare and the Bible...come on...

  You should really read more widely before holding up this sort of thing as one of the best around.

I've read enough thanks. I think this is easily a top 5 of all time.
