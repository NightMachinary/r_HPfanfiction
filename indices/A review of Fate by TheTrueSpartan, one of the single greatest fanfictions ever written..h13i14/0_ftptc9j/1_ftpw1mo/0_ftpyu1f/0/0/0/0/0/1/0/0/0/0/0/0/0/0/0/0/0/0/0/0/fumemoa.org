Still not responding to the points. Gotcha.

And yeah I can keep going as long as need be. I'm done for the day. I just proof-read a chapter of an upcoming story because I know enough about writing to be able to do that.

I do find it hilarious that you've obviously spent time going through my history, TE7's history and pdurrant4242's history (such as it is) and yet it's me and pd that are wasting time.

To spare you the time of finding my "alts", I use rpeh most of the time because it's my initials. I use Herbius in games because it's a bit more game-ish. I used "Suspected Replicant" on RationalWiki for a while. Others... When I used to play Quake I used "Innocence" purely because I was young enough to find the phrase "Innocence was destroyed by an ogre" amusing. And I use an extra special name when I'm chatting up your momma but that's between me and her.

EDIT: Totally forgot KarmaJunky in Ingress. Many apologies!
