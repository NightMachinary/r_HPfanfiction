You are being so beyond rude over all of this, it's so unnecessary.

I'm not interested in debating anything with someone that opens with "not to be more of a dick than I usually " then goes on to insult me and rather than discuss a book I reviewed would rather harp on about my use of the word phenomenal. Of course you haven't read the fanfic so you lack the ability to actually discuss it.
