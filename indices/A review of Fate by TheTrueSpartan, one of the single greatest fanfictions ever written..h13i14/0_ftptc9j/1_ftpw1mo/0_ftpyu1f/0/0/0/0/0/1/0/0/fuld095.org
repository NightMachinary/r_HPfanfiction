You have moaned and whined since people started to criticise the story. You didn't respond to the rather specific criticisms in my first post except to incorrectly cast aspersions on my mentioning other books / series. And now you're whining about people being rude.

Grow up.

One doesn't need to read a whole story to be able to judge it. I've read at least a third of the damn story and, like TE7, flicked through the rest to see if the quality of writing got any better. It doesn't. It is simplistic at best and should more accurately be described as childish.

The only thing I said in my post that could even possibly be construed as an insult was to suggest you read more widely before calling Fate one of the greatest pieces of fanfic ever. I stand by that suggestion. Just by reading the authors I listed you can find at least 100 stories that are far, far better than Fate. Not subjectively - very much objectively.

Of course, if you're actually 14 or so then this would all make more sense. If that's the case, I apologise. You'll appreciate the better writing when you grow up.
