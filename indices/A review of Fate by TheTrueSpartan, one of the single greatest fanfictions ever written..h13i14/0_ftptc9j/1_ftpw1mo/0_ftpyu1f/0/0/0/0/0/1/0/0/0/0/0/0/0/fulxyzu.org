I mean i'm not the one that spend half a day messaging abuse at someone for writing a review of a fanfiction they enjoyed. You've been nothing but unpleasant this entire conversation and i've only ignored criticisms like "how can you say you liked this, it isn't Shakespeare". Goes to show what trying to start a discussion here will get you if you dare to be enthusiastic about something.
