Wrong again, genius. It wasn't me that mentioned phenomenal. My problem has been you calling it "one of the single greatest fanfictions ever written" and then "easily a top 5 of all time" (by which I assume you mean "easily one of the top 5 of all time"?)

And again, it's you who has chosen to make this personal. You *still* haven't replied to the specific criticisms I made. It's those criticisms that are the basis for my issue with your description.

I'm less than two months younger than Dark Side of the Moon, by the way.
