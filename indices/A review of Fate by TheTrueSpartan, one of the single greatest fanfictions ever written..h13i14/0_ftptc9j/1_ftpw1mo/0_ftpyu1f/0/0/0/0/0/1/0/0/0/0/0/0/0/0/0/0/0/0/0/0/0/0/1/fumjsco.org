  Does it make me feel like a big man? No. But you need to learn that you can't just bluster and bullshit and get away with it

Hahaha well i'm glad the children of the world have men like you to send them anonymous abuse on the internet. Truly you are teaching the world. By spamming abuse over fanfiction.

  You even claimed that you were likely to be older than me - a claim that you ditched pretty fast
#+end_quote

Oh I absolutely haven't, my age just doesn't affect the fact that you keep asserting i'm a child then sending me abuse from what is clearly multiple accounts.

#+begin_quote
  I criticised the fiction you eulogised - something you should have expected.

Yeah and if you'd read it and talked about the content we might have had an interesting chat. Instead you've chosen to get hung up on my personal opinion of it and spam abuse for what is nearly a full 24 hours now from multiple accounts.

Btw you've started upvoting yourself again after I called you out on it. I wonder if you'll stop again now?
