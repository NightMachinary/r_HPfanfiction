I never mocked you for your opinion on fanfiction. I criticised the fiction you eulogised - something you should have expected. Since then yeah I've been mocking you because you keep shifting, obfuscating and just generally being a dick. You even claimed that you were likely to be older than me - a claim that you ditched pretty fast.

Does it make me feel like a big man? No. But you need to learn that you can't just bluster and bullshit and get away with it. I suppose it makes me feel like that time in history class where I tried to be a bit clever and the teacher invited me to come up to the blackboard and carry on with the lesson.

You are now in the position of being put in your place by a bastard teacher. Thank yourself that I can't give you detention like Mr Fiddler (great name for a teacher, huh?) could.

It's the least I can do for the public interest.
