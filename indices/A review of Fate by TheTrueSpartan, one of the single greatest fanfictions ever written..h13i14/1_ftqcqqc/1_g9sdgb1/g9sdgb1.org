Do you have any tips for how to write a Ron-centric fic? One of the people I know is writing a Ravenclaw Ron fic with Ron and Harry as protagonists. The lack of Ron fics is a problem too. The guy just want create an interesting fic. But I don't know what to tell him.

He said he has some cool concepts but is struggling with his writing style. His idea is broader and will take a lot of chapters to write. So he's confused. I don't know how help him.
