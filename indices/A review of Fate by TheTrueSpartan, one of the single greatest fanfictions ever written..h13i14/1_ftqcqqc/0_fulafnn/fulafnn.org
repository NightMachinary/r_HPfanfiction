  The character arcs and slice of life sections end up creating a fic with horrendous pacing.
#+end_quote

Yeah I did mention that, it nearly killed the fic for me and I genuinely forgot he was supposed to be 13 until one of the recent chapters when it was /still/ Christmas.

Just spreading it out would make it a loss less annoying, in particular the repeating family elements which I agree are a lot in the time frame.

  Don't forget the 11 year old being appointed as an ambassador to the French (did they not have one previously?).
#+end_quote

I did mention this, and iirc he was recently fired hence Ron stepping in, and it's stupid. Again make him 16/17 and keep the plot and it's /almost/ believable.

#+begin_quote
  all to politics and the future, the end goal of all the Slytherins is winning the house cup

  Ron thinks about women in the context of sex constantly
#+end_quote

I think both of these fit the age range perfectly actually. Ron's absolutely thinking about sex that much and the be all and end all of Slytherin politics being to win the house cup makes total sense to me. What else would they have to achieve?

#+begin_quote
  there's a magic dummy that can outduel and outthink aurors (but I'm willing to bet we'll never see said dummy in actual combat despite its ability to be repaired)
#+end_quote

It has an off command built in.

  Money makes no sense.
#+end_quote

Money never makes sense in Harry Potter.
