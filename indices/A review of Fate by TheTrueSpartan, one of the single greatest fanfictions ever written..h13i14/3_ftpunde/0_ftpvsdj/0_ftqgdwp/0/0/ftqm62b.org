We aren't talking Noble Prize here. But there are certainly fanfics which match the source material. "Chasing Dragons" would be a good example of this in the GoT/ASoIaF fandom (AU rebellion ends in Ned and Robert chasing Rhaegar across the narrow sea and building a kingdom there).

While I would not be as harsh as TE7 here, Fate certainly has issues when it comes to its writing. A lot of the dialogue tags could be removed and it would actually improve reading flow.

Hell, when it comes to "fanmade" fiction, I've read an insert into Sir Arthur Harris the other day over on alternatehistory, and the author had a research bibliography which would put most PhDs to shame. And even though it was stunningly researched and had very good characters, I would be hesitant to describe it in such a style like your review here.

Fate might be good or it might not, I have no interest in reading the whole thing since I find Ron boring (I had never heard of Fate before clicking on this thread), but "one of the single greatest fanfiction" is a bit too much for the writing as it is. Too dialogue-heavy and it could do with a bit of editing.
