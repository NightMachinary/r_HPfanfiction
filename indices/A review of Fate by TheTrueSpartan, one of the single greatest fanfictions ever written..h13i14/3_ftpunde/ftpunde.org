The same question I asked elsewhere: is it worthy of reading ten books of [[https://blog.fostergrant.co.uk/2017/08/03/word-counts-popular-books-world/][the Mobby Dick]] calibre? I know the answer, I gave up on the story, but really? 2,509,522 words? Better than George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series *COMBINED*?
