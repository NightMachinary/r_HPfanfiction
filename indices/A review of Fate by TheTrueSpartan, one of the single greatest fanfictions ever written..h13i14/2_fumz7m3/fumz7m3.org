I love it! I really don't understand why you're getting so much hate.

This /is/ fanfiction, if you want fullblown fucking Shakespeare then you're looking in the wrong place.

Fanfiction allows you to see MANY new ideas, and you'll have to deal with the fact it's badly written, or at least worse than normal.
