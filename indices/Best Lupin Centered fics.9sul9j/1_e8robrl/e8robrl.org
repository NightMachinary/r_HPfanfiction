[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862][Wolf, Wolf]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]] - Remus/Sirius; character study from Remus' point of view, alternating between present and past. (Don't be scared away by the first person POV!)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/927712][Common Woodbrown]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/imochan/pseuds/imochan][imochan]] - Raising Harry and character study dealing with Remus being a werewolf. Some Remus/Sirius, but the romance is pretty minor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/904][The Lost Years (Harry Potter)]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ignipes/pseuds/ignipes][ignipes]] - Remus' adventures from 1892-1993. Includes very mild Remus/Sirius (almost negligible).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want To Make A Memory]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/530161/enitsirk][enitsirk]] - Mild James/Lily; details the Marauder's years at Hogwarts. Remus gets the most focus of the four.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/974964][Sweet Home]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge/pseuds/copperbadge][copperbadge]] - The missing years between the Potters' deaths and Remus' return to Hogwarts; includes some Remus/OMC and Remus/OFC. The author has a bunch of other Remus-centric fics.
