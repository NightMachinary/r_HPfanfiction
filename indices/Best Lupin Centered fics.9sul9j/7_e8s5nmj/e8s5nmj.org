'Oblivious' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2063033/1/Oblivious]] and its sequel 'Imperius' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2469997/1/Imperius]], both by Jess Pallas, are my absolute favourites. Both are long, action-packed, focus on Remus discovering the secrets of his past and a mystery in the present, and the author creates her own unique take on the condition of being a werewolf. I would also recommend stories by Bratanimus and Gilpin.

At the risk of shameless self-promotion (not sure if it's okay to recommended our own fics in threads like these?) I have a whomping willow prank fic (6 chapters, 2 from Remus' perspective) called Raging June [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12876007/1/Raging-June]] and, if you're into Remus/Tonks, a story I'm currently working on called Flying Colours (half from Remus' perspective, half from Tonks') [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001458/1/Flying-Colours]] Both on AO3 as well.
