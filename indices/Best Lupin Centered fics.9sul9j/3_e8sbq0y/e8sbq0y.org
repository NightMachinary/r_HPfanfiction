I think I'll drag out some ancient ones:

Expecto Patronum was written in 2000, but it explores the wolf-as-patronus issue a decade plus before Rowling openly made it canon. It's young Marauders (and Snape) on a tour of Azkaban. Blaise was one of the first Lupin-writers out there:

The Speculum Curse, from the same time period, is one of my all-time favorite fics in any genre or fandom. It gives equal time to each Marauder as they pass a personality-bending curse between them, but you could always skip to Remus' chapter:

Fair warning that A Most Unusual Student was not only written before the canon material was finished, but was never finished itself. But despite the length, it has a slice-of-life feel to it so going unfinished is not as big a deal as would be if it were a suspense fic. It's Madam Pomfrey's point of view, though obviously Remus is the center of it. Very interesting take on the adults who are trying to keep a child with a stigmatized medical condition safe and get him educated:
