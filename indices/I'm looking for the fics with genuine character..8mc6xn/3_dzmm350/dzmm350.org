[[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_fleur/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]] one of the mist enjoyable and crazy Fics I've ever read, if you are looking fir character, this has it in spades.

Bit of background, it is a unique combination of crack-fic and plot-epic that only gets better as it goes along. Just don't expect anything resembling sanity to found within its pages.
