[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4316181/1/Thrice][Thrice]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2736892/10/Becoming-Neville][Becoming Neville]] are older fics that I love.

All stories by FloreatCastellum, including [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]].

I also love The Divine Comedian's stuff, including [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789035/1/The-Age-of-Lies][The Age of Lies]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12704985/1/They-re-Hiding-Inside-Me][They're Hiding Inside Me]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad][The Cactus and the Toad]] is a new fic that is being regularly updated and has a lot of promise.

And I'm going to kid myself by including my own fic in this list: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723602/1/The-Ollivanders][The Ollivanders]].
