That sounds even funnier; Harry, sick and tired of the wizarding world obsessing over his every action shortly after his successful vanquishing of the dark lord, goes to live in a small quiet muggle neighbourhood to just get away from it all for a while... Meanwhile intrepid, eclectic, lovable Luna, still writing for the Quibbler, goes deep undercover as a local Muggle to get the real scoop on Harry's hidings. Serve lightly garnished with crackfic, season with memory charm intrigue for a more filling plotline.
