It would be pretty hard for Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, Defeator of Voldemort, etc. to go unrecognized by a magical partner unless he was living under an assumed identity and had some permanent disguise.

I've never read anything exactly like you're describing, but I have seen fics where Harry dates a squib and assumes she is magical. It's been several years, but I remember they went on a date to a restaurant and after dinner she unlocks her car to Harry's utter bewilderment.
