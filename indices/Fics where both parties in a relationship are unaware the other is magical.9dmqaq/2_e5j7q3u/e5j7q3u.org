Never read anything like that, and as someone mentioned that it would be hard for Harry not to be recognized, but if she was a foreigner, like an American, he might not be so immediately recognizable.

Anyways I had a similar thought before. Basically my thought was Dudley in a committed relationship with a witch, as in engagement or marriage, without knowing she was one. Then he to try to explain to her that magic is real sometime when cousin Harry's coming for a visit. Anyone know any stories like that?
