Nah, we have too manycanon-compliant ones already IMHO. The idea of Harry trying to control a mischievous Teddy at a wedding though is cracking me up already. And adding to it your ideas of a potential romance makes it all round terrific.

Go ahead and start writing - you know you want to! :P

I mean, if I could write even slightly decent dialogues, I'd have ran away with it - a plot bunny, if there ever was one.
