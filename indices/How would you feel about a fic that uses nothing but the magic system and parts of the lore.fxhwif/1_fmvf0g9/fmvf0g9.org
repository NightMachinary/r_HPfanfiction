See I think you should just take those couple extra steps and just straight up write this as it's own book. Clearly you've got a really solid idea of what the setting will be, but since it involves 0% of canon characters or history why include it at all?

Make your own mark, write your own thing! ...plus making some kind of profit off your hard work would be nice, no?
