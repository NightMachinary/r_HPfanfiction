The exploration and experimentation with magic has been done before and I found them to be boring. A protagonist inevitably ends up weaker than a 4th year which is boring for the story or skips 5000 years of magical developments which requires too much suspension of disbelief.

For me, Harry Potter is about the magic, the world, and the characters with importance in that order. I can read a story from the perspective of any character and even an OC, so long as it's Harry Potter. I think a story lacking the magic, the world, and the characters would be better off as pure original fiction, or in this case, fallout fanfiction. Just my opinion.
