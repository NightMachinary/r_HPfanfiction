Unless they're a relative of a canon character, I probably wouldn't read it and even if you set it in Britain, I'm not sure I'd see it as a Harry Potter fanfic without this kind of connection.

That being said... I don't think it's a boring idea. This

sounds *really* interesting.

Maybe you could go a couple of chapters like this before they meet someone's great-great-grandkid or something like that. Or they're Dudley's descendant... or Molly's accountant's cousin's descendant.

(This would be length dependent, of course. If you're writing 200k words... 100k words of naive experimentation before encountering someone who knows what's going on and has tried to make a wand would work, I think.)

The other way to make it more Harry Potter fanficy is if the character ends up living in Grimmauld Place or something like that. I think this sort of location based thinking is both more limiting for you and would lack meaning without someone in the story who understands the significance of where they've ended up.

I'm also... as my username might suggest... a big fan of portals to other realities, pocket universes, digital worlds etc. etc. so the idea that the wizards mostly all left is another Cool Idea as far as I'm concerned. The hypothetical "self-aware" descendant (and my preference would be for one of Harry's but that's me) could work either like Bold (from Farthing Wood) who's travelled back through the portal or, as I think fits your ambitions better, a surviving descendant of someone who refused to go through the portal.
