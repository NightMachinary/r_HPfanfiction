I'd read it, if you did it well and in a way that was interesting and/or fun. I don't think you'd get an overly wide audience though - that whole 'Harry Potter characters only!' thing is quite prevalent here. On the other hand, like werepat says, Alexandra Quick is completely unconnected to any canon characters and that's hella popular, so maybe I'm wrong. I'd definitely give it a go though, and hope you post a self-promotion thread when you get it uploaded. :)
