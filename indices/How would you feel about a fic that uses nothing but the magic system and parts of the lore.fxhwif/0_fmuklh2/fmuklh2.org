This actually sounds amazing, and I'd personally love to read it.\\
I think a lot of the time, the reason people don't like to read non-harry stories are generally because they're poorly written OCs, often still set in Wizarding Britain in the 90s and can sometimes read like SI fics. I think there was a fic set in Wizarding USA about all OCs that was fairly popular but I don't remember its name.\\
In some fics, especially ones that focus on Harry getting abused or getting serious injuries, they talk about how the magic of a wizard/witch can mutate or change to focus on protecting the person, weakening their magic and spells, but often saving their lives. Maybe you could use something like this to explain how some could survive radiation? or maybe its much more likely for muggleborns to become ghouls than it is for a normal person?\\
Either way, I would definitely check this fic out, it sounds really good, so good luck!
