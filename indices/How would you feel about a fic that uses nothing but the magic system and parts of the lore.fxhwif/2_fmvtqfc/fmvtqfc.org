The Alexandra Quick series is the premise in your post title. It takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, but it's a story about an American witch that begins in 2007. The magic rules are the same, but the world is expanded to include magic from china, japan, and various native cultures. We get to follow an 11-year-old Alexandra much the same as we followed Harry, with resulting mysteries each year that build off each other, but things never seem to work out as well for Alex as they did for Harry.

I think they're great, and I recommend you check them out!

There are already 5 full books, with at least one more coming.
