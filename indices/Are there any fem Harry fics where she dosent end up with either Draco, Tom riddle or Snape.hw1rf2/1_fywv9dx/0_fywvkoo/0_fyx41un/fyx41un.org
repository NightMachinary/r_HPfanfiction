Okay, from the top. :D

A Long Journey Home - the 'Ancient Harry' fic, Jasmine Potter gets punted back into the past and lives through centuries. She has no active relationships going, but mentions some past romance somewhere (hence the semi-gen tag).

A Witch and An Amazon - Fem!Harry (I think she goes by Rose?) meets Wonder Woman in Vegas and gets drunk-married to her. Has a lot of homophobia from Magical Britain, but generally handles the concept semi-well. Fun fic with some relationship drama and superhero drama mixed into the plot.

Yule Ball Panic - Fem!Harry-Hermione relationship fic beginning in the Yule Ball with lots of 'Female Revolution!' vibes to the plot afterward. Fun though, not preachy. Also the tamest Veela-Orgy-Ritual fic ever written. Has homophobia and does deal with it more interestingly than Witch and Amazon. Not porny, but does have fields of Veela fucking for actual plot reasons. It wouldn't be my thing, otherwise, ace as fuck here. :D

The Last Peverell - Technically goes by another name in this fic as she's time-travel reborn into someone else's body in the Marauder Era (not a canon character, but she's basically Jasmine Potter in another body). Very Lordship-ey, but in a fun way. And does feature kooky-deadly Aunt Cassiopeia Black, which is always a pro in my book. :)

Charlotte the Great - Vaguely sociopathic-manipulative Charlotte Potter becomes a Slytherin and is basically an unpleasant and ambitious person for the whole story. Fun story, though.

Dahlia Evans - I haven't read this, but it's marked Harry/Hermione and it's in my fem!Harry folder, so I'm assuming this fits. Apologies if it doesn't.

linkffn(12026760)

Future's Past - fem!Harry goes back in time, getting time-travel reborn into a past person, and rescues Orion Black and ends up dating him and vaguely parenting Sirius. It's very cute and very fun, despite the Romance Novel-esque verbiage used throughout. It's a personal favourite. Ianthe/Ophelia is a fun character.

Harriet Potter is - Quite sad 'Slytherins fight against Voldemort' fic told in that epilogue-dreamscape style. Fun and interesting.

Holly Evans and the Spiral Path - I have no idea if I've read this fic or not, but it's in my fem!Harry folder and I don't know what the pairing is. I suspect not Draco, Snape, or Riddle, given that it's written by Wordhammer.

Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise - Fun fic about Iris Potter being belligerent and sarky as heck about being in the tournament, with some really interesting changed/extra tasks added in.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/]]

linkffn(12568760)

The Archaeologist - Another semi-gen fic where Harry gets punted to an alternate universe, wakes up in the body of his female equivalent, and basically doesn't care and wanders off to explore tombs. Fun fic, if a little clunkily told, with a lot of Bloodborne stuff involved.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290]]

linkao3(19328290)

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool - Harry also gets punted to an alternate universe where he's a woman. She gets with Tonks in this universe and there's a weird ending.

Magical Metamorphosis - Harry becomes Fem!Harry when she realises she's trans after walking up some stairs. Hermione is very supportive.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12507814/1/]]

linkffn(12507814)

Mistakes and Second Chances - Fem!Harry gains special powers from being MoD, goes through some shit (trigger warning for mentions of sexual assault, it's posted in the ANs of the relevant chapters) and makes new friends (and a ladyfriend).

Pranking the Tournament - Harry takes a sex-change potion to prank the tournament and goes through the fourth book as Fem!Harry.

Season of Change - Harry starts male, becomes female, finds out some family shit and there's family drama while she fights Voldemort.

Son of Potter, Daughter of Black - Basically Season of Change, but with more Sirius.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653847/1/]]

linkffn(11653847)

The Unbroken Saviour - Another fic I haven't read, but I know it's a time-travel fic where fem!Harry actually is honest and open with Albus Dumbledore. So that's interesting. Don't know the pairing, but nothing is listed.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12025821/1/]]

linkffn(12025821)

The Girl Who Lived - fem!Harry is kind of a tomboy, also told in the epilogue-dreamscape tone.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7809337]]

The Girl Who Lived Again - Trans!Harry and her experiences with her friends and family.

The Unexpected (and head-ache inducing) Time Travel - Rose Potter time-travels and fixes stuff.

I've also got two fem!Harry/Cedric fics somewhere, but they're currently mixed in with a thousand other fics I'm working on sorting, so I haven't got those to hand yet. Apologies.
