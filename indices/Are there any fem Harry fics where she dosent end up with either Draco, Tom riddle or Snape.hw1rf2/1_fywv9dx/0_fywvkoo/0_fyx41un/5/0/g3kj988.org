I still haven't found them yet, I'm afraid. I'm down to 756 fics to sort now, and none have any useful shorthand keywords (eg. most things with 'Time' in the title can go under 'time travel' categories) that help me work out if they're Cedric pairings or not. Sorting is the worst. I quite honestly don't understand how Librarians do it. :D
