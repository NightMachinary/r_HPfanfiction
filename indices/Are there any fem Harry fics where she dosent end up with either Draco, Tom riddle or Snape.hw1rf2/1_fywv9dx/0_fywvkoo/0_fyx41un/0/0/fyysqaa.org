I loved 'em. Yule Ball Panic is one of those series I go back and revisit like a comfort blanket every so often. :)

And I have not read that series, I'm afraid. I'm not the biggest fan of superhero things generally and the only superhero things I've actually enjoyed were the smaller, constrained stuff (I've seen exactly four superhero movies - the first Avengers, the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Logan, and Wonder Woman - and while I enjoyed both Logan and Wonder Woman, I found Avengers and Guardians to be incredibly bland and bombastic) so I tend to end up avoiding most superhero fics.

I only picked up your Wonder Woman one because it was her trying to integrate into the HP Universe and not overmuch about her doing superhero things and continued because the relationship was interesting and fun enough to outweigh the superhero stuff. Your Iris Potter series seemed to have a lot more superhero stuff than the Wonder Woman one did, so I've never read it.

I apologise if that comes off as rude - I've tried rewording and it seems brusque to me regardless. It's not intended to be rude, just explanative. I've never been able to pin down tone conveying in online conversation - but in a world where 'k.' can indicate irritation where 'k' does not, I was doomed from the get-go. That distinction will never not baffle me. :D
