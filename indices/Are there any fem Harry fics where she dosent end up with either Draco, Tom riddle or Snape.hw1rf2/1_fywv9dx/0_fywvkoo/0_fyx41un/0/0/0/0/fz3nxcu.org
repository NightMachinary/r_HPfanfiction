In regards to the rude thing, I meant the tone, not the sentiment. Tone is hard to convey or infer over the internet and I have an unfortunate inability to phrase things diplomatically when I'm tired - it's caused a lot of trouble when writing emails. There's a reason I express similar sentiments in every one of my little boilerplate disclaimers I put on my request post. :D

But yeah, I wasn't sure if I came off as "Ugh. Superheroes suck, I fuckin' hate them and you're terrible for liking them!" or the intended "Each to their own, but Superhero movies aren't really my thing." Good to know I came off how I wanted! :)

  Wonder Woman may be a superhero, but her powers are more in line with fantasy and sword/sorcery figures/stories than many superheroes

I like that - it's a really good way of putting it. She definitely has far more Fantasy vibes than Superhero ones.

  It's just a suggestion, though.

Well, I do like your storytelling and if the focus is more on the magic than the Superhero themes, it could be my sort of thing. I suppose there's no harm in adding it to the list and trying a few chapters, at least. Is there anything I need to know in advance to read the fic?

It's certainly going to be a while until I get to it, anyway. I'm resorting my fics back into their folders and I currently have eight-hundred-and-something fics I don't really remember and am going to need to reread/skim in order to work out where the heck to put them.
