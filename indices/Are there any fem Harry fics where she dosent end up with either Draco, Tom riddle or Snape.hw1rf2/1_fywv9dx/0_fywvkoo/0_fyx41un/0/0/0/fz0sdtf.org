I'm happy to hear how much you like the Jasmine series! I've got a few fanfics that I like to return to every so often, too.

And no, you didn't come off as rude at all. If you don't like superhero stories, then you don't like them. Nothing to apologize for there. “A Witch and an Amazon” does utilize superhero themes a bit less - Wonder Woman may be a superhero, but her powers are more in line with fantasy and sword/sorcery figures/stories than many superheroes. That's part of what made her a good fit for a crossover with Harry Potter.

That said, while the Iris stories closely follow the MCU movie plots, Iris is still a witch who uses magic. The stories focus on Iris' magic, her character, and her relationships much more than superpowers. Marvel superheroes may play a big enough role that you can't enjoy them, but if you like how I handled magic and characters in the others then it's at least possible that you'd enjoy Iris.

It's just a suggestion, though. I won't be offended if you still think the MCU context is enough to not want to bother.
