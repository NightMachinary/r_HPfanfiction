Good to know - and might I say a sincere thank you for putting some consideration behind the explanation, it's always nice to get some thought process insight from writers on their works. Many would just leave it at 'nah, you'll be aight', so the helpful explanation is also appreciated. :)

I'll note to get some basic background before I start it. It'll be like reading Ancient Literature all over again, only instead of being accompanied by an archaic dictionary, it'll be a Marvel wiki. :)

I have not - I'm not sure I've even heard of it, unless you're referring to the one with Adam West? And I only know he exists because people keep referencing him. :D
