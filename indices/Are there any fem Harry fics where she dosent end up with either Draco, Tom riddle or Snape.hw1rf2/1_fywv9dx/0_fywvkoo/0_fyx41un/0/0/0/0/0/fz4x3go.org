Anything you need to know in advance? I don't think so... general familiarity with the overall MCU plot line might help. I wouldn't say it's critical, but in order to avoid boring the people who have seen the movies (which I tended to assume on the part of readers), I didn't repeat a lot of the details from the movies when it wasn't absolutely necessary.

It's honestly hard for me to say how much you might miss if you're completely ignorant of a movie's plot before reading an associated story. Maybe not a lot in some cases, but probably a bit in others. The first story, for example, begins with the climactic fight at the end of Iron Man. If you don't know anything about why those two people are fighting, even though their fight (mostly) isn't the focus, it probably won't resonate as much.

So... I guess reading a basic IMDB plot summary would help to give context.

Oh, and since you're not a fan of superhero stories, I assume you never watched the old 1968 Batman series? If for some reason you have and liked it at all, then you'll want to try “Amy Potter is Batgirl”. If not, then definitely stay away because none of the jokes or characterizations will make sense, I think.

I hope you enjoy what you do read, though!
