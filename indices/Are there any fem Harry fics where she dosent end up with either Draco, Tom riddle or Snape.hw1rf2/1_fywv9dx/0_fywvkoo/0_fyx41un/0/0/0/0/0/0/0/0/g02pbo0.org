Oooh, nice. You definitely have a type, huh? What got you into the medievalist game, if you don't mind my asking? Big Tolkien fan? :)

Never had the chance to do anything linguistic in academia myself - the UK system doesn't do unaffiliated classes at degree level, so all my classes were in psychology - so it's been strictly a hobby for the most part. A mild necessity, too - I'm of Irish-Italian heritage, so pretty much everyone I share genetics with is Catholic-as-Hell and picking up old philosophy and translations of bible stuff is practically a matter of survival for family dinners. :D

I do have a fondness for camp media. The old 80s movie campness is one of my favourite things ever - and 'ole Palpatine's camp enjoyment of everything is the one redeeming facet of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. I'll add it to the list. :)

Ah, nice. In the end, that's really the best motivation - if you had fun. This is a hobby, after all, and the internet has the attention span of a frenetic goldfish. :)
