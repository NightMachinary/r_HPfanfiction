You're welcome!

And speaking as someone who has studied more ancient, dead languages than modern, living ones, I have a good idea of what you mean about sitting with a book on one side and a dictionary on the other. I started as a medievalist in college, so I spent a lot of time with Middle High German, Old High German, and even Gothic. And those were just the primary ones I dealt with!

Yes, I'm referring to the series with Adam West and Burt Ward. Even when it first aired, it was very campy and tongue-in-cheek, and that effect seems to have grown over time. I did what I could to capture the campy atmosphere and the characters' hokey lines - and as I'm sure you can imagine, my fic would just sound weird to anyone who isn't at least a bit familiar with that series.

That leads to a much smaller audience for it, I know, but I had fun writing it.
