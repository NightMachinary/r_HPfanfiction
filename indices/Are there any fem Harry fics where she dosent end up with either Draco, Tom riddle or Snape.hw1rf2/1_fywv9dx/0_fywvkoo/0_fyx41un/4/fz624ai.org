Charlotte the Great and Powerful is an underrated story. I usually dislike a lot of Harry in Slytherin stories because they tend to have him widely accepted which just seems...highly unlikely with the whole "pureblood" password slash half of them having Death Eater parents. I like how the author wrote her as kind of ignored but respected for her talent/fame with only one real friend and the relationships with Draco and Blaise. The whole "sociopath" who feels ambivalent was done well. And the age thing with Barty is creepy asf but also obvs. meant to be creepy & not explict and doesn't go beyond tame, thank god, and makes a bizarre sort of sense with the character.
