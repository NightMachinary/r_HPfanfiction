The whole thing about Voldemort and the horcrux at the end was a bit of a deus ex machina.\\
I personally felt like Harry should have been more upset with dumbledore. It seemed like the only reason he got angry at him was because Dumbledore didn't tell him about his personal life, instead of leading him on this gigantic ass scavenger hunt around the country to kill Voldemort.\\
The pacing was uneven to me, especially towards the end. They're having issues all year, but all of a sudden they find and destroy 4 horcruxes within a day or two?\\
Still a good book, IMO, but I wouldn't say it's the best of the series.
