The problem, for me, with HPDH is that it mixes two different fantasy conceptions of magic, and does a worse job of it than the previous books. Harry Potter had a sort "scientific" paradigm to its magic. There were methods, if you understood them you could use them, using them creatively lead to victory. It's essentially a video game, or perhaps Magic the Gathering, view of magic as granting powers that can be used in particular ways and countered in other ways.

By contrast, you have a "mystical" view of in-world magic more typical of say Lord of the Rings. The Ring doesn't give any particular powers for the most part, instead it just IS. Gandalf doesn't go around casting Avada Kedavra, he just IS magical.

I don't mind the horcruxes, the mechanics behind them were if anything a little too fleshed out, but what the book in my view should/could have been was an elaborate magical heist film. Harry and co. using tactics and strategy of magic to obtain and destroy the horcruxes, ending in beating Voldemort by clever strategem.

Instead, the magic ceases to be scientific, as in the rest of the book, and becomes mystical. Harry doesn't win by being quicker, or more knowledgeable, or having the better hand; he wins because reasons. That's a really unsatisfying conclusion. Essentially all the mechanical aspects of the world that we've learned (That AK is unblockable and lethal, that Voldemort is incredibly powerful, etc.) are thrown out and replaced with mystical golbedegook.
