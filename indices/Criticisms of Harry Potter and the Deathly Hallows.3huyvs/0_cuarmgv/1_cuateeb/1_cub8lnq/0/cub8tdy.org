  People often suggest the Rowling didn't have the balls to have a sad ending

That wouldn't have fit /at all/ with the general tone of Harry Potter, increasing darkness accounted for or not. Have sad parts of the story, sure, even have lots of really sad stuff near the end. But /ending/ the story on a sad note? That just wouldn't have worked, or made sense.
