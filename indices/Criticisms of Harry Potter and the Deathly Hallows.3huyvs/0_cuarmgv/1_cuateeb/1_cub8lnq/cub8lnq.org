I like it, though it's cheesy as hell. I think it's a proper ending to the story. I don't think I would have /missed/ it if it had been absent, but I like that I know what happens, and I think what happens is the perfect ending that completes the themes of the book. People often suggest the Rowling didn't have the balls to have a sad ending, but I don't think a sadder ending would have closed the story as nicely, and I'm glad she chose the ending that works best. I guess I'm not in the boat that a story has to be sad to be good. Still a cheesy epligue, but I consider that a minor quirk rather than a n annoyance.
