  It's her story, she can do whatever she likes with it.

That is absolutely true. I remember reading a few posts a few years ago about how people were angry that Rowling would go against the most popular opinions of the fans just so she could finish her silly fantasies.

It was ridiculous. These people thought that she somehow owed us. It was her story from start to end, no one else should be able to decide what is in it unless she accepts the idea.
