Without repeating what I've said in another comment, I'll just say this instead. (Don't worry, I'm not frustrated with you or anything, although I'm aware my first sentence could imply that.) You've got to end a fantasy series somehow and bearing in mind that the audience for HP was primarily children, that ending does make the most sense. It's short, sweet and to the point. Perfect way to end a children's fantasy series. So yes, I agree, it was a good ending for Harry.
