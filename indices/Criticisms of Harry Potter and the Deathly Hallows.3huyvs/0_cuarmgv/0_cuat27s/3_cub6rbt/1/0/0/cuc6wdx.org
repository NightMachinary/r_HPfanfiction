It /is/ a bit much, but any action that they took in support of the Voldemort regime makes them a collaborator.

Their guilt can be mitigated if they were coerced (like Reg Cattermole) but that doesn't remove the fact that they worked to keep that Ministry operational. They're still guilty. They just maybe shouldn't be punished severely--or at all.

I am in the minority in this opinion re: the Harry Potter fandom. A lot of people seem to believe that one positive action wipes out completely the negative actions a person has undertaken, e.g., Narcissa suddenly isn't so bad because she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead--despite the fact that she did it for a selfish reason AND had previously supported Voldemort, even if in a limited capacity. Narcissa's one act of defiance doesn't make her not guilty of everything else (like conspiracy to commit murder, harboring fugitives, conspiring to smuggle murderers into a school, etc.). It just mitigates the negatives and makes her punishment less than it would have been.
