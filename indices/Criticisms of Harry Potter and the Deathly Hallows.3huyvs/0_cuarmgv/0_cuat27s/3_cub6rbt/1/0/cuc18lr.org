To be fair there's a *big* difference between collaborators and ordinary Minstry workers. Mr Weasley worked at the Ministry and could've been someone they'd attacked as collateral...

Would he be considered a collaborator to you?

That's not to say there weren't collaborators in the Ministry. People like Umbridge and the like were definitely in with the death eaters. But to lump in everyone who worked there under the broad spectrum is a bit much, isn't it?
