I'm really not sure where you're pulling this from. He confunded a guy to pass a test for what was for him a pointless test, as I can't see Ron driving a car regularly, and when he does, as he said, he could just use magic to ensure he drives safely. I imagine he only went in to do the test because of Hermione.
