Confounding people/using love potions/etc. is dismissed as nothing because "the wizarding world is a cesspool of morality". 110% love potions are sick and twisted and used casually by teenaged girls looking for prom dates.

I agree with [[/u/hchan1]] that Harry and co. are supposed to be above that disgusting moral compass. That they're supposed to be the /reasonable/ ones that say it's ridiculous to execute buckbeack.

But by the end of the series, they /are/ saying and doing casually bigoted things that were so shocking to us at the beginning of the series.
