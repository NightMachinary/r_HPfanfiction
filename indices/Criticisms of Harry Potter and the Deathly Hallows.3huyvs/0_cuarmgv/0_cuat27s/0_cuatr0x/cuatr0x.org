If you look at it like that, then I'd say it shows that pureblood bigotry runs deep, even in the supposedly fanon dubbed 'Light' families. Not to mention that the corruption in the Ministry was never dealt with, it just underwent a changing of hands. One could also say that, as an extension to both of those: the oppressed have become the oppressors (or there's scope for that still to happen).
