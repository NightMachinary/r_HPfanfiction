I find that very interesting because i little while ago I was reading the pensieve Tom Riddle bits in HBP. Paying attention to Ogdens words shows the reason Morfin was in trouble/summoned was because he did magic in front of a muggle and not for the boils(?) he hexed. It appears though that Ron altering someones mind, Hermione altering someones mind, Dumbledore altering someones mind and liquoring them up aren't ever an issue from anyones point of view. For further DH goodness- McGonagall and Harry both use Unforgiveables, the Aurors have been (are?VWII?) authorized to use the other Unforgivables, but I guess those are... noble causes. Hell back to the mind alteration I guess repeatedly wiping the GoF camp officials minds is completely A-okay, funny even, but levitating them up in the air is sick and twisted torture.
