It feels very much like people are either good or evil, and that is an immutable trait, and while the trait might cause you to act differently in general, none of your actions affect whether you are good or evil. And furthermore good people should not like evil people, so it was right and good for Dumbledore to view Tom with suspicion rather than trying to make him a better person.

Or perhaps it's not immutable, but only a select few are eligible for redemption -- Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy, for example.
