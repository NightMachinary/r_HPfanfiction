I mainly find it stupid that using a confundus charm, one of the spells used to maintain the statute of secrecy, would be against the statute of secrecy.

But I also find it stupid that anyone, especially Harry, would care about using confundus charms on Muggles, and more generally that wizards would be using Muggle ideas about mental inviolability. This is a society where it's considered okay to use love potions and cheering charms. Manipulation of mental states is routine and accepted. And you can see why: wizards know that they have immortal souls which define their essence and nature. The mind would carry much less importance when you have a soul, because it's no longer the basis of who you are.
