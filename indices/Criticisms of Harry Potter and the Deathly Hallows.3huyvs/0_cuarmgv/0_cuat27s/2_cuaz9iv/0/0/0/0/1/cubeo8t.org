  Canonical Muggles do not notice irregularities, even without active concealment magic in play.
#+end_quote

I've read (part of) the fic in question. The muggles who noticed the irregularity was nowhere near the magic. IIRC it was the Confunded guy's supervisor, who noticed he gave an all-clear to a guy who, by the paper records, failed the test miserably. The guy loses his job and the Obliviators have to intervene.

The important thing here is that Obliviators are authorized by the Ministry. They follow the /rule of law/. Just as I can't go around giving people tickets, /even when they commit crimes/, Ron can't go around Confuding Muggles.
