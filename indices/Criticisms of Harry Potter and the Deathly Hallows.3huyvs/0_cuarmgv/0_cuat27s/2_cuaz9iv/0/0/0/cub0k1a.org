/Obliviators/ are authorized to use a range of spells to maintain the Statute of Secrecy. They are organized and controlled. They must file the proper paperwork and follow the correct procedures.

Ron Weasley in that fic did not follow the correct procedures. Muggles noticed irregularities. Then the Obliviators came in and cleaned up after him, which took multiple people and required altering paper records, because that level of thoroughness was mandated by their procedures and they were trained how to be thorough.

In general, members of a government agency who have training in a specialized field are allowed to do things that private citizens and members of other government agencies are not. Applying certain pesticides, storing toxic waste, imprisoning people, performing surgery -- those all require government certifications, and in some cases it's illegal for private organizations and individuals to do it at all. It would be stupid if there were no regulations on these behaviors and any citizen were allowed to do something if they could find at least one government employee authorized to do it.
