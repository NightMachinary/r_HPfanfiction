  Obliviators are authorized to use a range of spells to maintain the Statute of Secrecy. They are organized and controlled. They must file the proper paperwork and follow the correct procedures.

Nope, all wizards are authorised to manipulate Muggles' minds to maintain the statute of secrecy, or generally make navigation of the Muggle world more convenient.

Canon example: the almost constant obliviation of the Muggle camp manager at the Quidditch world cup by basically every single arrival.

Another example (from Fantastic Beasts): the obliviation of an entire beach of Muggles in Wales by two wizards who were on holiday.

Canonical Muggles do not notice irregularities, even without active concealment magic in play. This is a theme brought up multiple times: that Muggles have a natural response to magic that, even when they witness, they explain it away. Example: the Knight Bus doesn't have concealment charms on it but rather it's so beyond Muggles' accepted reality that they refuse to see it.
