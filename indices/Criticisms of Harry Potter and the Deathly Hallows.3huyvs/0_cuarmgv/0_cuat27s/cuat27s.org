It shows that Ron doesn't really think of Muggles as people. He'd never Confund a jobsworth at the Ministry, but he Confunded a driving examiner. It also suggests that Hermione only mildly disapproved of the idea. And Harry didn't bat an eye.

I read a one-shot that started immediately after the epilogue, where Harry arrested Ron (or at least demanded his badge) for using the Confundus Charm on an unwilling person and violating the Statute of Secrecy.
