Honestly, I don't think that there could possibly have been a book 7 that didn't disappoint a lot of people, ESPECIALLY people involved in fandom. The thing is that a lot of HP fans grew up with the books and were (are) very, very invested in the world and the characters. Over the years before the last book came out, they (we) developed their own ideas about how things would go and got very attached to them. No matter what JKR did, she simply was not going to satisfy everybody.

Which is okay. It's her world, and that was her ending. And that's what fanfiction is for, right?
