Imagine a 100K+ word fanfiction with thousands of followers. The The updates are a bit slow but the masses love it. Towards the end, the author is worn out and decides to wrap things up quickly. In their haste to conclude the story, they resort to prepackaged fixes to complex plots. Important questions are answered briefly: /what happens next in this society?/ Not telling, but people are happy now, so it probably went ok. /How do people feel about the past?/ Oh their past it and happy now. /What are they doing now?/ Giving their kids hipster and dead-people names, mainly. The end.
