I liked it is a whole.

Pros:

1.  After HBP's drought of action, the frequent fight scenes were welcome.

2.  Really liked how the book brought you into the 'anyone can die' mindset early on with Hedwig's death.

3.  Voldemort taking over the ministry and Hogwarts via coup was a masterstroke no one saw coming. The Death Eater Government was handled well.

4.  There was an air of mystery right from the start, with Dumbledore's Will and the Deathly Hallows.

5.  Dobby's death was done really well.

6.  The Battle of Hogwarts started out awesome. Voldemort giving Hogwarts his ultimatum and McGonagall spelling the suits of armor for battle give me chills to this day. The chaos of battle and the slow feeling of hopelessness when it seemed that everyone was dying and the defenders were surely going to lose and Harry walking to his death: amazing.

7.  Dat Snape/McGonagall duel.

8.  Many people didn't like it, but I thought the Harry death and resurrection was very thematically appropriate. Harry did what Lily Potter had done all those years ago, the event that was the focal point of the series, and I absolutely love parallels like this. Lily's sacrifice won them the first war, and Harry's sacrifice was the turning point of the second.

9.  The Dumbledore-Grindelwald backstory. Dumbledore revealed to not have been such a goody two-shoes after all. Harry's crumbling faith in Dumbledore and his obsession with the Hallows made for excellent storytelling.

10. “Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn't it?”

    "A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding."

    "If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you, but no pressure."

    "Don't let it worry you...It's me. I'm extremely famous."

    Never change Ron, never change.

And the cons:

1. Dammit Ron, /why don't you change?/ But seriously, Ron walking out /again/ has to be the least favorite moment in the series. Not only was it repetitive, but it completely negated his character development of the last two books. And we were stuck with Harry and Hermione angsting together for the next few chapters. /Sigh/.

2. Snape's death was kinda eh. A major character should have had a more fitting death.

3. The Deathly Hallows part of the book seemed quite tacked on. I liked the mystery of it early on, but ultimately it fell flat. It was as if Rowling couldn't think of any plausible way to kill off Voldemort, so she made up a super wand just to backfire on him.

4. Far too little of Ginny. Luna was present for quite a bit, but she didn't really do anything until she distracted everyone after the battle got over for Harry to make his getaway. I can't help but be disappointed that two of my favorite characters barely did anything, while another was mishandled. Still, the lack of Ginny brought me into fanfiction, so there's that.

So, overall, it had plenty of good stuff, and some not so good. Not as entertaining as PoA or GoF, but easily beats out HBP.
