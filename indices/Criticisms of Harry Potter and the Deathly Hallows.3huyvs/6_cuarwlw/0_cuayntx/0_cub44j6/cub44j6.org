Snape killed Albus with the Killing Curse. He let (or arranged for) Emmeline Vance die. His rep is as solid as it'll get.

Why did Harry go back one more time? Because Albus wanted him protected a few more weeks while the wedding arrangements were made? So Harry has time to save the Dursleys? What strategic value did that have?

As a sacrifice move, it was pointless and expensive, and the fact that they only lost two and an ear is basically miraculous, given the chaos of open battle.

Here's the too-easy version: Hedwig gets disillusioned and sent to deliver a note to Ron; send Tonks to the Dursleys looking like Piers Polkiss; have Harry take a Polyjuice of Piers and leave; then have Tonks leave as Petunia. Leave the area by portkey or side-along apparation at wherever the transit's next stop was. Rendezvous at the Burrow. Harry's trunk is left behind to maintain the illusion that he's still there. The Dursleys can be moved out whenever.

Done.
