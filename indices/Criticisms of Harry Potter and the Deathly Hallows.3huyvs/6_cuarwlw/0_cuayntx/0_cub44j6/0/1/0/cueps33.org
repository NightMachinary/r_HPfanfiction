It's a reference to a specific /special/ part of a popular Harry Potter fanfiction known as Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Relatively early in the story, Harry is asked by the Defense Professor to name different ways to kill his fellow students inside that classroom. Harry names several, including ripping the bones out of Hufflepuffs, sharpening them, and then stabbing others with them.

Obviously a bit convoluted, but it basically sets the scene for Harry to be a very dark person at times.
