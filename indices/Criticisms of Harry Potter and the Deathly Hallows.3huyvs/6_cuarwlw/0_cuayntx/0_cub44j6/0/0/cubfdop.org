As a writer, I would have set up a reason why returning to Privet drive was necessary. I would have had Moody, Tonks and Lupin show up at his door a week early of a sudden and have them shuffle Harry and the Dursleys out, creating a running battle where Harry is pursued on a broom. Vernon protests too long and gets murdered despite Petunia urging him to go along, then the surviving two Dursleys get disapparated to a safe place.

All sorts of hijinks could ensue as Harry tries to find a quiet place to get a breath and escape to safety, knowing that any spell or attempt at apparation would be detected.

Hedwig would have died saving him from a killing curse as in the movie- because that's the right way to do it. Hedwig's death was the symbol of Harry's departure from childhood, but she deserved a better death than being treated like an action figure accessory.

Ginny, Luna and Neville might have gone along- the younger girls having ditched their wands so as not to get caught. Help doesn't have to be spells- Dobby helped quite a bit with limited capabilities. For one thing, they really could have used a cook.

Voldemort's death would have been a mad rush of spell casting upon seeing Harry dead, with his protection turning the outcome into a Battle of Agincourt rout, seeing as all his loved ones were temporarily immune to death.

When the dust settled, Harry would be missing along with the cloak, suggesting that Harry had escaped death or returned the Hallow to him. The epilogue would have been Luna describing a creature hunt to the Weasley clan, but it reveals that she tracked him down in a cafe on Mykonos. No scar on his head, no glasses- just a guy living a quiet life.
