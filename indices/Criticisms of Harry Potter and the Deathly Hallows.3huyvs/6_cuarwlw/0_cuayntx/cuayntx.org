Well, I suppose the reason that the 7 Potters was a bad idea and was bound for ambush was because it was intended to be so. I mean, it was Snape's (and therefore Dumbledore's) idea--one intended to further cement Snape's place as one of Voldemort's key advisors.

Snape (and Dumbledore) sacrificed Moody, their greatest fighter, to further secure Snape's place in the Death Eaters.
