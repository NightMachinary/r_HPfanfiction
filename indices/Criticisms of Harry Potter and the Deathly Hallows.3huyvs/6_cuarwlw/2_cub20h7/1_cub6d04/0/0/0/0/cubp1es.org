you know, I didn't even think about that. It is logical that Harry would be on a motorcycle, because the Death Eaters would assume that because Harry is the best on a broom they would put him on a broom.

But still, how cool would it have been to have Harry fly circles around Death Eathers and pop them left right and center? You could even use a Wronski Feint somewhere just because.

I'm already writing a pretty long fanfic, I think I'll incorporate an areal battle somewhere that features this :D
