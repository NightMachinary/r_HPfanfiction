  It is logical that Harry would be on a motorcycle, because the Death Eaters would assume that because Harry is the best on a broom they would put him on a broom.

Good point. Basically, the approach of the "grown-ups" to the conflict was to avoid conflict as much as possible, saving their strength for one last battle. (To be fair, it worked, albeit through a deus ex machina.) The plan was consistent with that: the goal was to minimize risk to Harry, not to maximize the ratio of enemy attrition to friendly attrition.

  But still, how cool would it have been to have Harry fly circles around Death Eathers and pop them left right and center?

Very cool. However, that would have contradicted the ethos of the book, that the good guys aren't supposed to win through skill and cunning: that's Voldemort's "Slytherin" way. They're supposed to win because they are predestined to win if they martyr themselves correctly.
