Yes, but apparently some department is mentioned to be able to track portkeys in the seventh book, as said by Moody. Or in other words, J.K. Rowling wanted to write an aerial battle. Which was pretty cool with me, I think it was one of the high points of the book in terms of tension, even though there's a lot of better ways to get Harry out of Privet Drive. Also, apparition couldn't be tracked normally, EXCEPT when one of the people apparating had the trace. Harry no longer had the trace when Harry and friends went on their merry little journey.
