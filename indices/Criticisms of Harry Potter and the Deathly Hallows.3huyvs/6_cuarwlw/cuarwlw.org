It started poorly, it ended poorly, and the middle had several sections that were painfully uninteresting.

The start that sucks is the Battle of Seven Potters, better known as 'the tactical disaster that anyone who's been paying attention would be able to plan better'. It wouldn't be so bad, even funny from a 'they really thought that was smart?' way except that those plans ended up with so many bad outcomes.

Mad-Eye Moody died.

HEDWIG died... in a cage...

George was maimed.

Our intelligence as readers was insulted, and so the real injury is to the willful suspension of disbelief. Mind you, I was thereby prepared for them to fail spectacularly which would ramp up the tension, but it really did more harm than good.

The ending sucked, in that the method of Harry's victory hinged on some overly complicated and unreliable circumstances. Thematically, his victory happened in the forest, but then we got a replacement duel that was so cheesy it made me think of John Wayne movies: despite everything before it, the ending is a duel of leaders won in a single shot, whilst no one did shit but watch them posture and taunt, and then fire. Bad guy dies.

Between this is a bunch of muddling around that stressed our patience just as much as Ron's, to the point that I felt a little jealous that he was getting to step away from the monotony while I was still stuck reading about it.

That's... the beginning of my issues with the last book. I'm sure others can chime in with more, and I'd hate to hog the rant space.
