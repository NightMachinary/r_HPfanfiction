I remember not liking how the Hallows came out of nowhere (yes, the cloak was always around but not as a Hallow until book 7), but on rereads I'm not minding then as much. My teenage self was also pretty crushed when Ron kissed Hermione (/delusional/, I know) but that was a long time coming. It's still loads better written than any fanfiction in my opinion.
