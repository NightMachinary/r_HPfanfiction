Specific events and issues aside, I have two major issues with DH:

- Pacing/editing. My impression when reading the book was that Rowling wrote this sprawling thing, and then, some point, she realized that she really was running out of space, and rushed to wrap up the ending, creating very inconsistent pacing. My speculation is that she had the money and the popularity to ignore her editors (who would have advised her to cut some stuff from the first 2/3), and the books paid the price.
- Protagonists win through luck, not hard work and competence (except for Hermione's largely logistical contributions). Again, this is speculation, but I think that Rowling pulled a Calvinist version of an Ayn Rand (or, for more recent example, a LessWrong): there are moral themes and contrasts she wanted to set up, and she did so to the detriment of plot and characterization. [[/u/Taure]] post in the thread summarized it nicely: yes, "accidents", which make perfect sense if one postulates a Hand of Fate that will ensure the good guys win, if they keep their hands clean and not engage in icky activities like guerrilla warfare.

*Edit:* Clarification.
