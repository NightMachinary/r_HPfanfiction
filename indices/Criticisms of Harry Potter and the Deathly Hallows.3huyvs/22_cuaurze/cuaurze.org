Okay first of all, there is the Harry Potter prison break with results in death and disfigurement. Why didn't someone just owl Harry some polyjuice and a muggles hair and tell him to take the bus to X place. Then they decide to take a holiday at the Burrow, which ends well. And finally the story begins the horcrux hunt, wait I meant camping trip. In order to have some drama in this camping trip they're all really hungry, despite ya know being magical and being able to teleport to anywhere else to get some food. BTW Ron is being a major cunt, again. They break into the ministry instead of just kidnapping Umbridge outside of this stronghold. Bathilda Bagshot is a... snake? How did no one notice that? Ron ran away. Snape is taking instructions from a portrait. Harry suddenly deciding unforgivables are cool, except with dueling with Voldemort, cause ya know disarm him instead.
