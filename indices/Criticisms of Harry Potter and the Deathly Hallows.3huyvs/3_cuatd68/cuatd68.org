Three teens camping in the forest for most of the book was very boring. For me, the book didn't get remotely interesting until the trio made it back to Hogwarts near the end.

JKR has done an amazing job with her characters. What makes the world so rich is the entire ensemble of characters interacting together - and not just three characters off on their own doing stuff. The characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione, in the capacity that they were written, were not able to carry the DH story.
