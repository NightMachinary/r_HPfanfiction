I mostly just hated the wand loyalty lore. The other stuff people complain about... Not always great, but not the end of the world.

But wand lore was awkward, poorly conceived, poorly explained, and honestly the plot could likely have worked fine without incorporating it.

Also the epilogue was cheesy. I don't care about the pairings, the epilogue was just so on the nose, though.
