The concept of the horcruxes to me feels incomplete. Why seven? Why not 3 a magical number, safer, and tied more with his birth. Why horcruxes instead of something else? And why the hell were they so easy to get? And lets be honest here they were easy to get. Three school children got rid of the majority of them. Dumbledore only succombed to the curse on the ring because he was stupid. Harry and the gang had more trouble getting the locket than breaking into Gringotts. And to say that the cup wasnt cursed was stupid. And what about the amazing plan to kill dumbledore in 6th year?. They let death eaters in via a magical cabinet, hidden in a room full of hidden things, using Darkness powder and a hand of glory. They then create a barrier that is impossible to cross without a dark mark, fight off order members so they dont reach the impassible barrier. Then afterward, they run thru the castle, instead of making a porkey, or flying on the brooms that are right infront of them. Alrighty then. It wasnt the seventh book that everyone should be hating on. Its the sixth. But i digress. Your comment was focused on the concept of horcruxes. My issue with JKR's story is that the concept of horcruxes took over stopping Voldemort they were not the same thing. It was a glorfied treasure hunt for things that felt incomplete to me, while at the same time attempting to make you care about how Harry Hermione and Ron are still teenagers doing something that should have been done by more than just them. Never mind that every single story before the deathly hallows, has the gang saving themselves or surviving. That was the issue. Instead of having them fall into whatever twisted scheme there was, she attempted to force the adventure along .
