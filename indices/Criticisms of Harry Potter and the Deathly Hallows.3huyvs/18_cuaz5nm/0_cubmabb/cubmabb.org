To be honest, the existence of the horcruxes by itself is not that bad an idea.

The annoying part and the root of many problems is how the author /contrived/ the plot, by having Voldemort stupidly placing the horcruxes in pedestals for his enemies to find. She does explain that he does it in sheer arrogance, but it still remains terribly contrived. Yes, i know that I have said 'contrived' twice. Three times now.

Due to that, the plot focused too much on the horcrux quest, which was the reason a big part of the book was so boring.
