Personally, i felt the story started to fail during the sixth book. The concept of horcruxes is in my opinion a stupid concept. That leads to the whole Harry is a horcrux thing. The concept that murder splits the soul is idealistic. Are you tellkng me that no other peraon ever has done soul magic after murdering someone? And then we have the terrible plot speed. I counted the amount of pages between the ministry assualt and the malfoy manor thing. 300 pages of absolutely nothing. I wont mention the epilogue that looks like it was wrote in a day. I wont mention the obvious Deus ex Machina. I will mention the faxt that tons of characters are forgotten for over 500 pages other than "i wonder how they are" what about the character development? What about snape as headmaster? Why the hell is Albus' brother just introduced in the last book. That makes my blood boil.
