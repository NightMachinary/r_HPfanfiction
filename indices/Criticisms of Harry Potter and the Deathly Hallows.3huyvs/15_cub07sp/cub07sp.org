I think the biggest "hate" gets directed at the epilouge, my own displeasure with it included. The epilouge felt off and cheesy.

Then of course the hunt for the McGuffin(s)... sigh. The Horcruxes were, for my taste, a bad replacement for what could've been an existing civil war story. There were even some aspects of that in the book. The Resistance Radio, "Potter Watch" for example.

Also, one could only ignore the incredibly stupid setup for the hunt, if one wanted to enjoy the books. But you all have read enough Dumbledore bashing to know whats up.

Also, the battles were an insult to our intelligence. The extraction of Harry from Privet Drive was laughably stupid. Getting married with hundreds of guests (including high-value targets) in the middle of a civil war is stupid. The list goes on...

And the ending was also rather unsatisfying. The end of Harry's martyrium was actually well done (if you isolate that one scene). Having the hero go before his nemesis to die for the cause is a often used and, in this case, well done way of ending a story. The following duel however... But hey, it ended as it started.
