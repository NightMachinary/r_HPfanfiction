Well. I will admit that I am having trouble remembering them after all. I was not keeping a reading list back then, and my reading nowadays consists of almost no sixth- seventh year FF.

Only one story comes to mind right now. Just bear in mind that it is not a recommendation, but rather something that I read back then and thought it was decent. I am not sure what I'd make of it if I read it now.

linkffn(Tom and Harry by Old-Crow)

It covers seventh year, and if nothing else, the final confrontation is decent and hilarious in a good way. (Not slash btw, don't let the title fool you.)
