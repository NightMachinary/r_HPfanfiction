I am not going to refer to things like the disappointing final battle and epilogue, disliked plot devices, or the pairings that enraged fans around the world; instead, I will refer to a basic element of the book that made it worse than its predecessors.

Books 1-6 had a certain structure: events occur almost singularly within the story's 'base', which is Hogwarts. It gives people a sense of familiarity and they look forward to finding out what new plot will happen to their favorite place of the series.

On book 7, we depart from Hogwarts and we have them 'on the run'. The transition was not so... good, in my opinion. I was personally looking forward to this whole thing ending as soon as possible, rather than savor what was happening during this journey.

That said, I wouldn't claim that the seventh book /had/ to happen at Hogwarts. It would simply be a safe bet, i think. Focus on alternative places could work, but it with the author's choice that was not the case in my humble opinion.

Finally, I'd like to say that before discovering fanfiction (which was about two years after DH came out) I 'liked' the seventh book, kinda. It was still a bit 'meh' due to the above reasons, but thought it was okay. Upon reading fanfics that handled that scenario better though ( especially those that abolished horcrux hunts and focused on other facades of the war) I was forced to re-evaluate.
