I think part of all criticism were unreasonable expectations. On the whole I enjoyed the book, but there were parts I liked less than others.

- I liked the bits about the wands. Gave whole branch more depth.
- I liked for the most part the hallows. I think they were pretty interesting and creative. Only I wish they had been foreshadowed better in previous books
- I liked the whole camping around - it gave a good sense of seeming hopelessness about their situation.
- Harry's sacrifice and battle - I liked the whole thing!
- I disliked romantic choices and pairings
- I disliked the epilogue
- I disliked somewhat contrived narrative that we must either accept hand of Fate or just dumb luck.
