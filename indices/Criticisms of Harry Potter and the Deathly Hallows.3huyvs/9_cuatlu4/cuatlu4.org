The structure of the story was good, and the battle was well thought out (the books in reverse, thought I saw a post about it somewhere on [[/r/harrypotter]]). But I get the idea that in order to reach that well thought out ending, some things were overlooked (I still have 3 theories on how Harry survived in the end (blood protection, only one soul has to part or wand allegiance)) and the wandlore was, as someone else here said already, a pretty big Deus Ex Machina.

I also don't know why it was so important to only have Harry, Ron and Hermione hunting down the horcruxes. Why not take Bill and Fleur with them for example? They're loyal and both talented curse breakers. Also, the whole idea of leaving Ginny for her own safety was a bit weird. Many people saw how close they were towards the end of HBP and it wouldn't surprise me if Voldemort ordered Draco and Snape to report about Harry's life and relationships. I don't see Voldemort getting fooled by the break-up.
