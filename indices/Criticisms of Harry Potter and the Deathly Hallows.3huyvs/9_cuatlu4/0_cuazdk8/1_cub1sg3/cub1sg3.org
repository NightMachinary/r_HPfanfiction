Me too. There are loads of sensible-Harry fanfics, but rarely do you see a fanfic centered around the horcrux hunt.

About the trace: how hard can it be to remove it? I don't imagine it impossible, and a smart and crafty witch like Ginny would surely find out a way around it? I think the whole leaving Ginny behind thing was nothing more than a means to end the series with Harry, Ron and Hermione.
