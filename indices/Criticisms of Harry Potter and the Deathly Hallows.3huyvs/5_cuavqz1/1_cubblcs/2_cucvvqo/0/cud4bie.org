Oo, thanks for the comment, I'm glad I'm able to give a new perspective. Naturally I think my analysis is accurate, and since I think that, I would also recommend re-reading with this plot-arc in mind. Perhaps things might appear more in line? I could be wrong, but worst case scenario, you read seven pretty great books. :)
