This has given me a new perspective on the overarching story line which says that the issues is with how it was expressed in the final book, not that there wasn't one. I still suspect that there wasn't really a planned story arc across all seven books when she started out, but this is the first plausible /good/ example I've seen.

Not sure I agree with all of it, but that's a really interesting view - thanks!
