Egads, I don't know if I want to get into a whole plot discussion or not, (but apparently I do......) but in my understanding of the series, this conversation makes perfect sense. I don't mean to say you're wrong or I'm right, but if I'm able to share a few words that help you enjoy the final book, then awesome! The following is all my interpretation.

It's also not about Harry needing to win because he has the advantage of being the good guy main character. Harry kind of blunders his way through the whole series, where Dumbledore is the clear-cut mastermind. Harry is the main character, but the conflict is really between Voldemort and Dumbledore with Harry as a useful puppet.

Also, the way I understand magic, there's canon evidence that magic is tied to emotions ("did you ever make anything happen when you were angry or scared?", and how you need to "mean it" to do the Cruciatus Curse). It is not that people who have love are just somehow stronger magicians, it's more that love is one of many powerful emotions. So is anger, and so is fear, etc. So the most powerful wizard in the world would be doing himself a huge disservice by not valuing the power of each of those. But Voldemort can't help it - he does not understand love, and so he fails to predict the actions of those motivated by it: Snape deserting him, Lily choosing to die (the greatest weakness of all).

Lily's sacrifice started a snowball effect that eventually led to Voldemort dying. It was not just that he did not have love, but that he continually failed to realize it's importance within magic. At each encounter with Harry, Voldemort thought he overcame the previous mishap. He used Harry's blood, but Harry still got away because of their wand cores. Well, why was Harry's wand core the same? Because he had a piece of Voldemort's soul in his head. Why did he have a piece of Voldemort's soul in his head? Because Voldemort's soul was unstable and broke apart. Why was his soul unstable? Because he made several Horcruxes? Why? Because he was terrified of Death. Why did Lily's sacrifice work (as opposed to James's)? Because Voldemort had given her an option to live. Why did he give her an option to live? Because Snape had asked him to.

So it's not that some divine essence of love within Harry is magically stronger than the essence of evil inside Voldemort. It is more logical (if it was more divine, then Dumbledore would probably have more respect for Divination, but he doesn't think it's important. He only values the prophecy about Harry because he knows that /Voldemort/ values it. The prophecy, in and of itself, is not important) - there is a very direct line of how Voldemort's mistakes lead to his death, and those mistakes stem from his inability to love and his fear of death.

Dumbledore studies the magic between Harry and Voldemort and attempts to understand why something so outwardly straightforward as killing a child should have ended so disastrously. He discovers what I laid out above, that Voldemort failed because he did not understand Snape and Lily, or the magic that might evolve if he did not take the needed precautions to avoid it. So Dumbledore discovers the only way to get rid of Voldemort is to somehow manipulates the situation to use the magic that Voldemort does not understand - so these aspects of Voldemort's character will be his downfall.

Voldemort tries to do something similar to Dumbledore and Harry - using their ability to love against them. The same way people kidnap rich kids so their families will pay tons of money to get them back - exploiting their love. But Voldemort fails because he ultimately does not understand the extent people will go to fight for their loved ones. He does not understand that dying (his greatest fear) is /nothing/ to these people who are fighting to protect their families. He thought Harry's death would mean he would win, but he had not anticipated the likes of Neville, who was willing to keep fighting, because he cannot fathom their motivations.

Dumbledore /can/ fathom Voldemort's motivations - hadn't he dabbled in the dark arts in his youth? Hadn't he considered controlling muggles and non-humans to bend to the will of witches and wizards? But Dumbledore learned from his mistakes, he learned to value love and to no longer fear death. He understood magic so much more than Voldemort, because he understood all of it, not just some of it.

So when Harry shows up and begins to display all the qualities that Voldemort is lacking, Dumbledore watches closely. This boy could actually do it. This boy could actually break through the holes in Voldemort's understanding of magic. Dumbledore starts on a plan.

In King's Cross station, the chapter is written in such a way where one reader may believe it is real and another may believe it isn't. Everything Dumbledore says is something Harry could have worked out on his own. I personally think it is real, but regardless, Harry learns/realizes this plan, realizes exactly /why/ Dumbledore has always claimed that "love" is so powerful, and why Voldemort's weaknesses were so bad. So when Harry confronts Voldemort in the Great Hall, it is not a mistakes at all that Harry directly references the plot armour, it is intentional, because it is more than just plot armour. Harry does not survive in the forest just because he's the main character, but because the magic that began in the very first book had led up to that moment in a very direct way.

Now, I feel your opinion on the Elder Wand is completely justified. I personally love it, but there is no 7-book-long plot backtracking to support it. I personally think that Harry could have died in the Great Hall and it would not have screwed up the plot at all. Harry had to survive in the forest because that's what the seven books were leading to, countless hints and countless things that led up directly to that scene. But the Great Hall scene could have easily been changed without changing any of the previous books. However, it happens to be one of my favorite scenes in the series. I really enjoy the fact that despite all the of Dumbledore's planning, he messed up. And I find it hilarious that his mess-up actually resulted in Harry being able to survive, and that the only reason Harry even gained power of the Elder Wand was a simple struggle between Harry and his school-boy nemesis - and they didn't even use magic! And Harry did it to save his friends, so out of left field comes a small version of the whole series. Voldemort only took the Elder Wand to kill Harry - because he feared Death. Harry unknowingly came to be the wand's master because of his "saving people thing", or rather, his love for them. It reinforces how futile Voldemort's outlook on life is - how doomed a person with those values is - that maybe, just maybe, Dumbledore didn't need to plan anything, maybe, just maybe Dumbledore was wrong, and prophecies /do/ mean something, and maybe, just maybe love really is the greatest strength of all.

Anyway, thanks for reading, if you did. I know I ramble, but I love the ending of the series, and I feel that a lot of people don't. I just like the spread the love!
