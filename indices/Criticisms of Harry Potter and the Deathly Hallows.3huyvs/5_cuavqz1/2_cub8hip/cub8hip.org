  Voldemort should have just pulled out his yew wand and killed Harry with that

Sorry, if I'm misremembering, but didn't the yew wand break when Harry cast the spell at Voldemort when he was escaping Privet Drive?

Also I think saying that Harry didn't deserve to win is missing the point a bit. Harry defeated Voldemort because of the sacrifice his mother made for him. He was able to use the power of the sacrifice because Voldemort is evil as fuck and fractured his soul to the point where he can no longer comprehend it. I don't see how that's an undeserving victory just because it didn't come from purely internal sources.
