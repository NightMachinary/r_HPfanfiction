  Other people just empowered him to win that victory.

I think this is the point - that other people's actions imbued Harry with this strange bit of power that was precisely what was needed to defeat Voldemort. I don't think the book is trying to hide the fact that this happened. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the plot arc had started with this as the base idea and everything else had sprung from it, that's how central to the books I think this idea is.

edit: that other people's actions - along with his stances on love and death.
