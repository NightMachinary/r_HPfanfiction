  Sorry, if I'm misremembering, but didn't the yew wand break when Harry cast the spell at Voldemort when he was escaping Privet Drive?

  I don't see how that's an undeserving victory just because it didn't come from purely internal sources.

If the victory doesn't come from Harry but from other people, how is it Harry's victory?
