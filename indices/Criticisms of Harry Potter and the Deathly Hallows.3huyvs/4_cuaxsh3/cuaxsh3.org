The final book introduced three brand new concepts that were crucial in defeating Voldemort:

- Wand ownership
- The deathly hallows
- Harry being a horcrux.

That's just goddamn bullshit!! You do not introduce a Deus ex Machina 7 books in! That's just lazy writing and makes no sense. And you definitely do not introduce three of them in one book. The deathly hallows should have never been created and wand ownership isn't a thing, it directly contradicts every duel in the previous books were people disarmed each other all the time!

I can overlook Harry being a horcrux since

- Horcruxes have been established before.
- It was always hinted at that Harry and Voldemort shared a connection.

Also the epilogue was terrible, but that goes without saying.
