I guess I worded that wrong. I didn't mean that Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny came out of nowhere. I meant that their relationships just seemed a bit out of nowhere. We go from simple kisses between each pair, to suddenly in epilogue Harry and Ron confirmed as putting their baby batter inside Ginny and Hermione respectively. It's probably more the epilogues fault for that than anything else. I of course dislike the Ron/Hermione pairing, but I don't dislike the Ginny/Harry pairing, despite what others may think.
