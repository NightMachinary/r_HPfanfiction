Good point. I think it's because especially Harry had the idea that relationships and such should wait until after Voldemort was killed. He constantly tries to push his friends away (which gets quite annoying tbh). From the end of book 5 he knows it's him or Voldemort. That's not really helping him build a steady relationship.

In the end it's JKR's choice. She had the idea of writing an adventure book for teenagers, not a romance novel. So she put relationships and boy/girl stuff on the background most of the time. Her book, her choice.
