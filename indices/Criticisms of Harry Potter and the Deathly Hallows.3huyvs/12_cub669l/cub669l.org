The story spent several months on a dangerous camping trip. Harry magically had to die, but was somehow reborn. Pairings were rushed out of nowhere. Ron/Hermione should never have happened. Deathly Hallows were a great addition to the overall story, but seemingly just appeared out of nowhere, just seemed to be useless filler. "Friendship is magic" defeats the most evil dark lord of the later century. Epilogue had Ron being a dick to muggles. Draco didn't go to jail. Narcissa didn't go to jail.

Honestly, the more I read it, the more I disliked it. I was expecting an epic ending, or some kind of cleverness used to destroy Voldemort. Instead, I got this shit.
