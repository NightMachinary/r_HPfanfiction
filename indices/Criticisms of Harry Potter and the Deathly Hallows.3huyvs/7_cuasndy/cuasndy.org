- Harry being a Horcrux is weird considering that Voldemort couldn't even touch him before the resurrection ritual negated Lily's protection, yet somehow a piece of his soul survived being attached to Harry just fine for all those years.
- Harry naming his second son after someone who manipulated him throughout most of his youth.
- Hermione and Ron actually marrying and having children together (although lately I'm starting to feel grateful for that, as it has sparked lots of stories about better relationships, Harry-Hermione would probably have faced less of a backlash and I wouldn't have so many amazing dramione and snamione stories to read), I frankly can't think of a relationship more likely to fail. I'd have preferred her ending up alone, or even better, the epilogue not having been included at all.
- The epilogue, everyone ending up with their high school sweet hearts...
- They won the battle against death eaters (questionable, they ran after their leader died) and their leader, but the ministry was still clearly rounding up Muggleborns and such, what happened to that, were there followup battles, did they all just give up when Voldy died? If so, did they all get punished this time or did most of them just got off with a slap on the wrists (again)? It wasn't just a terrorist organization like in the first war, the entire country's infrastructure was complying, one battle, even one as conclusive as the one in the book would not have ended that.
- The ridiculously unlikely way the elder wand ended up belonging to Harry being planned by Dumbledore.
