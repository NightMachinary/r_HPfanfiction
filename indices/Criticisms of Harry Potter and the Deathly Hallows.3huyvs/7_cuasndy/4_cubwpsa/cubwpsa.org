You obviously only watched the movies.

Unlike the movie, the final battle in the book was an annihilation battle against Voldemort's army.

Voldemort, in his arrogance, walked straight into Hogwarts courtyard, where disapparation was not possible and thus a death trap. Hundreds of new fighters led by Slughorn, scores of centaurs, and many thestrals attacked his back at once. Because of Harry's voluntary sacrifice, none of Voldemort's spells was binding against Hogwarts defenders.

Unfortunately, none of that was mentioned in the movie.
