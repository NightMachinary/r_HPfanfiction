Don't tell me what I have or haven't read. I've read books 1-5 in Dutch and English, and book 6 and 7 in English.

I haven't read book 7 since it came out though, since I hated it a lot at the time. So some details might have merged with the movies.

And I knew about Voldemort's spells not harming the defenders, if you search my post history you'll see I've actually quoted the exact passage explaining it once a few months ago.

The main character I identified with in the series was paired with the main character I hated from book 1 on, even if there were no other issues, I'd still hate deathly hallows (and HBP).
