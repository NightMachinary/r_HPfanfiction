I pretty much agree with you, except for Harry's second son's name...I know some dislike it, but I always liked the fact that he named him after two people who played interesting roles in his life - for better or worse.

And I never got over Hermione being with Ron or Harry being with Ginny. I have to force myself to get through their scenes (especially the latter) every time I read the books. : /

And Ron being a cunt in the books...fuck, always a major annoyance to read about.

I don't know why, but somehow I always feel differently about the final two books than I do with the first 5 (which I adore). Somehow for me...the final two books always feel "different" - especially of course, the latter.
