Plenty of stories don't start the romance part until after the war (and the student-teacher relationship), but in those that don't she tends to play an active part in the war, I don't see them as teacher/student at that point, but as fellow soldiers.

And the age difference... I've fantasized about guys older than 40 while I was in high school.
