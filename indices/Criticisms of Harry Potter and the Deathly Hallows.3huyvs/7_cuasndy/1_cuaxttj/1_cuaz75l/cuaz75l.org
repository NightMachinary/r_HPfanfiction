I'll admit, Snape needs a lot of redeeming by the fanfic author, but at least he's intelligent. Also, the important thing to remember is that canon is pretty much what Harry thinks/sees, and Snape has only ever let him see one side, until that moment in the shack when he shows him a very specific selection of his memories which seem to be aimed at "Make Harry believe me, make him do what Dumbledore planned". If you then add that most of my favourite snamione stories are AU past the fifth book, there's even more room to redeem him.
