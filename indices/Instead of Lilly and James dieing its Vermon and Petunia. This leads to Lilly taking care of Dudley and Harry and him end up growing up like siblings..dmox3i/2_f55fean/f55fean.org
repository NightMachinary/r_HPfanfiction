Everyone in the comments who's said something about the spelling needs to chill at least a little bit? It's a fanfic prompt/request in a reddit thread... like, why do you care that much if people misspell names from a kids book on the internet?

Personally, I think you should maybe take into account things like dyslexia and English not being everyones first language and then maaaayyybeeeeee not be snarky with people on the internet who maybe aren't great at spelling? Just an idea!
