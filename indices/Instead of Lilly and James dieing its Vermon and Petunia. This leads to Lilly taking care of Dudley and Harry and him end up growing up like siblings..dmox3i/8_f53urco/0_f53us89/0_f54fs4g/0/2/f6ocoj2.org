RobSt is overrated. I don't know why they're so popular, their fanfics are full of bad cliches and character butchering and aren't particularly well written.

I could get past the middle names, Hermione sounding 6 when she's 2, and even the character bashing because I love Harry and Dudley as brothers fics and they're so rare... Then 11 year old Harry gives Hermione a promise ring and acts like he's her husband, and none of the adults are concerned, and I'm done. Seriously? If you don't want to write about an 11 year old then skip to 6th/7th year!

Also naming Hermione's parents “Dan and Emma” is lazy and stupid, but that's just a personal pet peeve.
