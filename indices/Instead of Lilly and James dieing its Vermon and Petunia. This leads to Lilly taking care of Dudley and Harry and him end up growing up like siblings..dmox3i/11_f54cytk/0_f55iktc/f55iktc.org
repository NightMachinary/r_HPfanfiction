I think it has the potential to be interesting. A muggle child in the magical world and all the conflicts that go with it - navigating school, James trying to figure out the muggle world and being aggressively supportive of things he barely understands because he knows it's important to his nephew, the relationship between the boys as Harry goes off to Hogwarts and Dudley goes to muggle secondary school. It doesn't have to be about saving the world to be good.
