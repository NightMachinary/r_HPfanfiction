I don't know why those two would die, but I guess in some circumstance where the Potters survived Voldermort or he never found out about the prophecy and the Dursleys died in some regular circumstance like a car crash then that could work. If they take him in as young as Harry was taken in then Dudley wouldn't grow up to be such a brat as his parents and Vernon's family were the ones who turnwd him rotten. He'd grow up in a magical household with Harry as his brother. With seeing how James and his friends act he'll turn out jovial and fun loving. He'd be all for pranks and would probably go around pulling pranks with his brother, Harry. Then they'd be scolded by Lilly who then fusses with James about how his bad habits are rubbing off on them. Since he has no magic he'd might get a little jealous down the line with being surrounded by wizards and witches but not having any power of his own. Not that the Potters would hold him being a muggle against him of course. They might even set up play dates with some child squib so he has someone to relate to with growing up with no magic in a magic community. He can't go to Hogwarts so they'll probably send him to a muggle school. He and Harry would send each other letters constantly with Harry mostly talking about how cool and mysterious Hogwarts is and probably complaining about Draco and Snape if Snape turns out to be a bully to Harry this time around that is. If that did happen then word would get to Lilly and she'd send a howler to the school demanding to know why Snape is being so unfair and immature to Harry and threatening to come down there or something similar that a scary, pissed off mom rants about to the school and their staff when their kid is treated bad.
