I need more Dudley and Harry are raised as brothers fics. I love them and they're so rare. Like why take one child out of an abusive home but leave the other? Even if Dudley wasn't being abused you know his parents have the potential to do it, and they're not exactly raising properly anyway.

I'm working on one now, but it's not really what you're looking for - James and Lily are still dead, Petunia and Vernon are still alive but they're never getting the boys back, Dudley is a wizard, and the boys are raised (with an aged-up Teddy and an OC little sister) by Remus, Sirius, and an aged-up Tonks.
