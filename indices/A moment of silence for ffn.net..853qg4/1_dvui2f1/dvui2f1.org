Regardless of the OP being correct, this has become more and more frequent lately. FFN used to go down once or twice a year, now it is twice a month or more often. If I were an author, I would make sure I had my stories mirrored off site.

Plus, given how largely uninvolved/uncaring the mods are there, it is not a bad idea.
