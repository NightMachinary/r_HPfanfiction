Let's do the maths:

Third year began in chapter 96. So, assuming that the fic continues at an even pace, that makes 48 chapters a year. That would make the complete, 7-year fic 339 chapters long, or 231 chapters remaining.

From one update in August and and the next in October, let's say that's one chapter every 2 months, or 6 chapters a year. By that measure, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin should be completed some time around 2057.
