No, they didn't. For one, had it been all that traumatic he wouldn't be keen on letting people know because really, contrary to what some fanfiction authors believe, shouting for the entire world to hear that “surely [you] must have had a sucky childhood because reasons” does not a great person make and thus is not something Harry would do. And for two, rather than being a one-square-meter iron maiden that the movies (and many a fanfic) make it out to be it was something like a four-square-meter littlest-room-ever; sure, it was crappy, and sure, it doesn't really count as a real room when they had a room to spare and didn't, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be.

PS. Also, it's “canon”, not “cannon”.
