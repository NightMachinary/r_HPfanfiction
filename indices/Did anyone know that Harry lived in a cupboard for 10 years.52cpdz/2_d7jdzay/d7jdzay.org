There was a post several months ago --- which I don't have any way of locating, so I can't give due credit, unfortunately --- that depending on the exact architecture, a cupboard under the stairs actually makes for a pretty cozy bedroom for a child, though having someone there all the way to 11 would be pushing it. So, maybe people knew, but wouldn't be particularly angered.

Alternatively, maybe Harry never told others because he knew that Hermione wouldn't be able to resist Doing Something About It, and he didn't want her to meddle.
