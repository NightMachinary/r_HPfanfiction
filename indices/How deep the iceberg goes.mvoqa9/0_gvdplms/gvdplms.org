I'm gonna go on a limb and just assume what the two fics you mentioned are about and share the deepest iceberg I know. There I was, an innocent low-teens kid, wandering the pre-smut-purge fan fiction net. Searching for a new Severus Snape fic. Well, I probably found hundreds but two still stand out in my memory, literally more than a decade later.

Severus Snape/Hagrid. As far as I remember, Severus was... living in Hagrid's hut? I think it was because Severus was battling an addiction of some sort? Perhaps he had cancer, who knows. What's more important is that Severus for sure wasn't older than 15 or so. I bailed the moment Hagrid's ginormous dick was first mentioned.

This next one left a bigger impression on me however. It was... Severus Snape/Hedwig. He was sincerely and deeply in love with the owl. It was a passionate and heart wrenching romantic love. Also, he wanted to fuck the owl. Alas, their love was forbidden and no one could find out about it! Luckily, my mind has managed to forget literally everything else.

There's probably more... niche fics out there, but good god it's a relief to get this off my chest. Poor 12(?) year old me.
