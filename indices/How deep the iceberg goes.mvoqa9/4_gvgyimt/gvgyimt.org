Missing Days by Charlotte Sometimes. What happened to Umbridge when she was carried off by centaurs. Spoiler alert: they humiliated, beat, and f***ed her. (Remember, Dumbledore didn't rescue her until a couple days later in canon.)

Oh wait, I can't link noncon. The only working link I have is on aff. There's an author of that name on FFN but without this story. (The stories there are nothing like this one, so I have no idea if it's even the same person.)
