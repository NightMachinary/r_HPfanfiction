You're referring to the main soul. The 'less-than-a-wraith' Voldemort. But at least /one/ of the Horcruxes seemed to be able to form their own bodies, but were only aware of themselves to the point of their creation. The backup of memories I was referring to were for the Horcruxes, not Voldemort's "dominant" soul.
