First, yes, you're right. I suppose what I meant when I said "come to life" was "form a new body".

The Diary was the first Horcrux, created while he was still in Hogwarts. The first war would have ended sometime in Voldemort's 50s-60s, if I'm not mistaken. It just seems to odd to me that the Diary would be his most advance, most useful Horcrux when he must have had a veritable horde more knowledge when he created the others.

It is possible he realized that the Diary's ability to form a new body was a /mistake/ and was a "default configuration" of a Horcrux of which he removed, via his more comprehensive knowledge of the process, when he created his later Horcruxes.
