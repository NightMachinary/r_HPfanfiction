Let me clear things up. Coming to life isn't what Horcruxes were /meant/ for (they just act as anchors for the original bit of soul).

/But/, of course, the soul-shard has its own consciousness and has the latent capability to possess people. Voldemort, being a horrible genius, thought to make this "glitch" into a "feature" by encouraging Diarymort to possess someone and so fulfill Voldemort's own will in reopening the Chamber of Secrets in his stead. This was the original plan, at least, the one Diarymort knew; but it seems that Voldemort's fear of death had grown stronger over time, such that his adult self kept the Diary at Malfoy's indefinitely, never actually delivering on his intention to order Lucius to plant it at Hogwarts.

As a result, by 1993, Diarymort had spent 50 goddamn years in the Diary with no one to talk to. So he started out fulfilling his original utility function, but as the year passed and he learned that his true self was (as far as Ginny knew) dead and gone, he decided that what the hell, why should he be a good boy and stay in his prison of a Diary if his original self was no longer around anyway? Instead, he figured out a way to fashion himself a new body, intent on taking up his vanished other's self mantle of being Lord Voldemort.

There's a bit of debate on whether Diarymort would have independantly sought out the main Voldemort and made him a body, and, supposing he didn't, would have happened if/when the original Voldemort-wraith came back to full strength on his own. (Would the two fight, reluctantly form an alliance, or would Diarymort submit to his master-soul?) But those are the basics.
