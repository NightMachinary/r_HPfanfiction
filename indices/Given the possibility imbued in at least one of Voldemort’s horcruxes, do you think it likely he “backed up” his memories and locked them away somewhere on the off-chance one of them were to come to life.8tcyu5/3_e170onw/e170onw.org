This has always been something that confused me, im not sure if it was a plot hole or what. But if diarymort succeeded in regaining his form, then there would have been a second voldemort running around. That couldnt have been what voldemort intended when creating the horcruxen, and doesnt seem to gel with how the rest of them work. The enemy voldemort from the series wasnt spawned from any horcrux, they are all accounted for and destroyed. He seems to be the same shade that got killed on halloween
