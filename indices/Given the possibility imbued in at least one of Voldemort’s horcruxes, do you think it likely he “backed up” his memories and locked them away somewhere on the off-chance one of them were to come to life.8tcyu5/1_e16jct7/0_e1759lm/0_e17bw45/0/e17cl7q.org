I think... we're still talking about two separate things. Let me be a tad more specific.

Given that Voldemort knew that at least one of his Horcruxes could gain a body of their own, do you think he would have left memories leading up to his death so that the Horcrux which gained a body (such as a Diary, had it been successful) would be able to "catch up", as it were?
