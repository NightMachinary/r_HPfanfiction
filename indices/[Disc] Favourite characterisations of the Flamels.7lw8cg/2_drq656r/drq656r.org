I liked Nicolas Flamel in linkffn(637123).

Spoilers for The Phoenix and the Serpent follow: [[/spoiler][Flamel as a squib is an awesome idea, because it totally subverts the expectation of him being this awesome wizard because he created the Philosopher's Stone while providing an excellent explanation for why he hasn't been stopping every dark wizard since the 1300s. I liked how he seemed to be modeled off a scientist from the Enlightenment period, always experimenting and not bothered by setbacks or failures. I thought his death was a little contrived, but it does clarify how vulnerable a Squib would be to magical creatures: drop your guard and you'll die to something (relatively) mundane, like a tree falling on you. Mirrors the reality of how humans evolved, where we can build weapons that can destroy cities but can still die to a tiger in the night or a tree falling on us.]]
