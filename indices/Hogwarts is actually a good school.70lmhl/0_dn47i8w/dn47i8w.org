I've got to say, I feel bad for the dorm masters. No wonder they're not involved, they're all teaching core classes from first years straight through graduation. That's a lot of grading.

Are there any stories where Hogwarts is a more plausible boarding school? With school matrons, weird mandatory extras, and all that?
