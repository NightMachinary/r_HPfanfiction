Good question; I could've sworn that I was on firm ground with this, but on double-checking, what we get is the following line from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  ‘At Beauxbatons,' said Fleur complacently, ‘we 'ad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then --'
#+end_quote

At that point, she gets interrupted, so we don't get to learn anything more, and it is far from given that French equivalent of OWLs isn't one year more advanced than the British OWLs.

There is another piece of indirect evidence: that Cedric was a 6th-year when he entered TWT, whereas Krum was already 18 during Quiddich cup and has thus almost certainly had more years of schooling. We don't know whether Fleur was older than Cedric, but the balance of probabilities that she probably was (since most students of age would have been in their 7th year of schooling). That a Hogwarts 6th-year was considered competitive with Beauxbatons's and Durmstrang's (probable) 7th-years is suggestive.

Still, the evidence is much weaker than I had thought, and in retrospect, I shouldn't have made that claim with the certainty I had. My apologies. The rest of my case holds up better, I think.
