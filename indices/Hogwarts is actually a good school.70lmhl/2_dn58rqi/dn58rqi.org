Its disciplinary and security issues aside, academically, Hogwarts already is a good, challenging school. Hogwarts curriculum covers in 5 years what Durmstrang and Beauxbatons cover in 6. Outside of DADA, teachers are at the top of their professions and are at least adequate pedagogues (even Snape), and even in DADA, students are, generally, managing to learn enough to do well on the OWLs.

Canon Harry, in particular, finds the curriculum plenty challenging: he is constantly complaining about how much work he'd been assigned and is often shown putting in a great deal of effort into learning new spells. Now, consider that Harry is actually a significantly above-average talent: Hogwarts is not an easy school for anyone.

Now, I can't speak for all "different schools" Harry attends in fanfic, but much of the time, the reason they tend to be shown as more "challenging" is that these fics tend to be about how much more badass "their" Harry is than his canon counterpart. (Heck, the most famous exemplar of the genre --- /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ by the Santi --- actually has "Nathan" Potter go through canon adventures in Hogwarts, with the author going out of his way to show the superiority of Durmstrang-attending "Harry" every time they meet. [1])

The reason they might come off as more "realistic" is that these fics are usually very serious and drop the whimsy and the satirical elements of the canon books.

[1] I'm not saying that it's a bad fic. I think it's a very good fic, and its vision of Durmstrang has become my headcanon for it; but that doesn't change how it treats Hogwarts.
