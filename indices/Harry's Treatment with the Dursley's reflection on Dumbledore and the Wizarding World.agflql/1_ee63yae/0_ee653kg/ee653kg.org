For the sake of not being one of "those people" on Reddit, I won't go into why the "well why aren't you doing XYZ" argument doesn't apply to me (rather, it does, and my wife and I have done and given more than about 99% of people, but it's a discussion about fanfic, and really not the point.)

And for many reasons, I disagree with the argument we can only care for so many. I'd counter that the more we care for, the more enriched and worthwhile our lives become.

Regardless of real-world stuff, my argument would be that right and wrong in this situation is not relative. Either Dumbledore has an obligation to all random orphans, or he has an obligation to none. Same with society. I'd argue there's an obligation to all by the whole society, and the lack of help, or even interest, is rather condemning.
