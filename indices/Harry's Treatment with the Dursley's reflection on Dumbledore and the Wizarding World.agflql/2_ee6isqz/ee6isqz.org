I believe that in the first book Hagrid mentions that the reason reason magical's hide is that they don't want to to be bothered by muggles asking for magical solutions to problems.

This might be something wizards tell children to avoid more complex topics, sort of like how children are supposedly delivered by storks, but it does display a culture of entitlement. It also fits with the wizard ideal of being self sufficient having mastered sufficient, the first task and the Triwizard Tournament as a whole are perfect examples of that belief.
