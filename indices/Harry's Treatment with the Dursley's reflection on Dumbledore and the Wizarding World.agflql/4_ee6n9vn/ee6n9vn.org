  the reasoning behind the hatred/dislike/disdain for Dumbledore is that Harry was treated poorly and he didn't do anything to stop it

It isn't just this. There's also the number of shenanigans that Albus gets up to in Harry's years at Hogwarts, all of which paint a very bad picture.

Then, there's Albus' treatment of Sirius. For someone who claims to preach love, second chances, redemption and all that rot, Albus does not give Sirius even a chance to explain himself in 1981 and testifies against him, after which he cuts all contact. That's either incredibly OOC for Albus, or something considerably uglier. If you were to consider that Sirius was supposed to be Harry's guardian in the event of James and Lily's deaths, it is very convenient that Sirius gets imprisoned with a very speedy sentencing.
