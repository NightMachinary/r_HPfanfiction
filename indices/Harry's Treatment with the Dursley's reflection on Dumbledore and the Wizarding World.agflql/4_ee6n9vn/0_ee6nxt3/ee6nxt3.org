The bigger failure regarding Sirius is 1994, where he does instruct two teenagers to break countless laws because he is unwilling to save the innocent himself.

Sirius mutterings in 81 can be seen as a confession and while that doesn't make it right, it is at least a believable excuse. Dumbledore doesn't have the same excuse in 94.
