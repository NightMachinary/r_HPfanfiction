  The original case against Sirius is very cut and dry as both Remus and Dumbledore still thought he was the secret keeper

There is a thing called closure, and for someone who claims emotions like love and remorse are powerful things every now and then, the fact that he did not speak even once to Sirius after the 1981 is incredibly suspicious.

He decides to "forgive" Snape of his various crimes after one conversation (just one!) where Snape says he'd been lusting after Lily, but decides not to speak with Sirius at all, a man who he'd been working and fighting with for three years. He throws away three years of camaraderie and seven years of a student-teacher relationship like nothing.
