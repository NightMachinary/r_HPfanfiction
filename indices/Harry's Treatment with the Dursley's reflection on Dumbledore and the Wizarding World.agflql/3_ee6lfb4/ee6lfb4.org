The thing is that Muggles number into the billions, while wizards are a rather small population. I don't know if there's ever a mentioned general number of wizards, but I've seen one fic that described wizarding politics as "small town politics" and I'd say that's a good representation.

In order for wizards to actually help out the Muggle world with its problems, sickness, poverty, disease, whatever, they'd have to dedicate basically the entire lives of a majority of their population to solely that. Wizards would turn into public servants simply due to their birth. They'd have to abandon their own society's goals and ambitions to spend their time in hospitals or making potions or whatnot.

Wizards have their own lives, goals, and things to do. Sure they have the potential to help lots of people, but so does everyone. It's not fair to expect everyone to dedicate their lives to other people just because they have the capacity.
