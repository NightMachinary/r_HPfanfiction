  Regardless of all that: if the reasoning behind the hatred/dislike/disdain for Dumbledore is that Harry was treated poorly and he didn't do anything to stop it, then why do we not blame the Wizarding world as a whole for not intervening in the world's problems?

That makes absolutely no sense. Dumbledore is directly responsible for Harry, he is basically kidnapping the kid and on his own perogative handing it to unvetted foster parents, without any government involvement.

No one is asking for Dumbledore to help protect random orphans from abuse all across England just because he could.

But yeah the wizarding world not providing magical help in situations where they easily could make a difference is a pretty bad looking situation.
