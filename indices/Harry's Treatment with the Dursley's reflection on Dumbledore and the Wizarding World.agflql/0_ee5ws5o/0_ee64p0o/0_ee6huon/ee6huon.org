Because:

A- He knew Harry and his parents personally.

B- He had a vested interest in Harry's life because of the prophecy

C- He was directly involved in Harry's situation, what with the war and having been the one to cast the Fidelius

So that is 3 reasons VERY OBVIOUS why Harry wasn't just some random orphan to him and your comparison doesn't work at all.

I don't think you gave this as much thought as you think you did, mate. This is not the moral connundrum that you are making it out to be.
