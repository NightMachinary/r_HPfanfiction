For all the times I criticise a load of Fanfic writers for having no idea how real relationships work, probably due to their entirely knowledge of the outside coming from other Fanfics, but occasionally I'll take enjoyment out of a poorly done romance fic, if it isn't anything I have to think about too hard and just exists as a simple wank fantasy that falls flat, the second you start to think about it.
