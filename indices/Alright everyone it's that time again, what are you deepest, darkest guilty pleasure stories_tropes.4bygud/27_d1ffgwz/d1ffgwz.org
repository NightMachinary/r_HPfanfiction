I'm a sucker for an interesting OC-centric story in Hogwarts. I love any next-gen story with action without tons of romance too, no matter how good it is. I'm also big on Slytherin Harry and a Draco redemption/trio joinup early on, as long is he isn't paired with any of them under any circumstances, and he isn't suddenly flawless.
