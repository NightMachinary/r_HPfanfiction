I will read the most horrible crossovers. I may start skimming and bail out before the end, but I will give them far more of my time than they deserve when they're riddled with errors and terrible characterization.

Can't help it. I love crossovers and there can be so few with the fandoms and characters I want. It really is possible to read all the good ones until all that's left is...everything else. With no other options, I will wade through 'everything else' to at least appreciate some creative ideas even if they're terribly executed.
