Romance. As in, 'there is no other point to this fic than to get these two characters together.' Not my jam outside of fanfic, and not usually in it, either, but once in a while, I'm just all, 'Yes, please convince me that these two totally incompatible characters are MFEO. Oh, and if you could make me cry from sap and narm and true loveyness at least once, that would be great.'
