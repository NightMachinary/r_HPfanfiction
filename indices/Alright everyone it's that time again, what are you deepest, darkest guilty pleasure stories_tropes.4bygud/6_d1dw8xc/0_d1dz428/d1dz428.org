I am absolutely okay with both of these and will take any recs for either if you have them. (Already read Debt of Time and that one that sounds like Twist/Turn of something or other.)

Hr/SB is my OTP (although exclusively time-travel/Sirius survives OotP and much ,much later in Hermione's lifetime.)
