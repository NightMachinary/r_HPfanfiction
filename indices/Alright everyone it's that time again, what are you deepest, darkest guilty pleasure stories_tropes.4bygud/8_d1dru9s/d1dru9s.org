I love 'killer couple' and 'killer quartet' stories, where one or two couples deal out major punishments to their enemies. Lots of sex and high body counts are added pluses. Examples include *Abraxas*, *Children's Crusade*, *Delenda Est*, *Hail Odysseus*, *Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy*, *Harry Potter and the Spygirl*, *My Slytherin Harry*, *Stages of Hope*, *Unspeakable Things*, linkffn(6989327;6473434;6160345;10959290;5511855;11580650;6892925;5270746;10645463).

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), also has element of that theme. [[/spoiler][During year 5, Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione went on covert ops against death eaters, and I tremendously enjoyed that part of the story. Mixed in their actions are several juicy sex scenes.]]
