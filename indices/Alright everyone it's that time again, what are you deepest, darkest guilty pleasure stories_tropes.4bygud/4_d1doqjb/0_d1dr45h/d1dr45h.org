There is a story from /forever/ ago (and still updated regularly) where the entire Order gets the Harry Potter books during fifth year Christmas holidays and reads them. There is a /very/ large focus on Harry's relationship with Sirius, lots of Dursley hating.

Interesting premise, but the characters are much too OOC for me honestly.
