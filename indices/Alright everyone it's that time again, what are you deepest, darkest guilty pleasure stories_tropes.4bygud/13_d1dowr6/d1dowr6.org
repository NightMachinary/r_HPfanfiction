I love a good OC. Like Sirius Black's daughter joins the trio or Harry discovers he has a sister or a Sirius Black / OC set in the Marauder Era. I also read a lot of next-gen so OCs in those are pretty acceptable.

I love stories where Sirius or Remus intervene and somehow get Harry away from the Dursleys at a young age and raise him. Or the Potters come back from the dead and raise him. Having Harry grow up in a loving family just makes me happy.

I like Hermione-is-secretly-a-pureblood. I blame [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11149377/1/The-Muddy-Princess][The Muddy Princess]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11153333/1/Presque-Toujours-Pur][Presque Toujours Pur]] for this. In general, pure-blood society stories can be a guilty pleasure.
