Know of any good Sirius/OC stories? The only one I've ever really read is the Balcony series linkffn(Tears on the Balcony) but I love me some Sirius Black (favourite character by far) so I'll accept any and all recommendations!

How about Sirius and or Remus "adopt" Harry? I haven't seen one of those in a while.
