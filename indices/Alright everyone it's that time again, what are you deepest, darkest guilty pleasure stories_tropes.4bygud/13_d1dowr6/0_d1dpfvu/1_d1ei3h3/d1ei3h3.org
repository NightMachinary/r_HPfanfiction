I can't recall any Sirius/OC's that stick out to me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1208387/1/Hunting-The-Traitor][Hunting the Traitor]] was a good Remus adopts Harry. It was written in 2003/2004, but I think it aged well.

I never got around to reading the sequels in the Innocent series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/MarauderLover7][MarauderLover7]], but the first one was excellent.
