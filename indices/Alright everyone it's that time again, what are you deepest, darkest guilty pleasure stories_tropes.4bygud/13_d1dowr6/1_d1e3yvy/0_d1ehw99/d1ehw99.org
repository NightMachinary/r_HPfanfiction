It's been a while since I've read them, but I remember enjoying the Cassy Black series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1778804/Vindicated-Soldiers][Vindicated Soldiers]]. I also enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3107848/1/I-Was-Born-a-Fool-and-I-ll-Die-a-Fool-for-You][I Was Born a Fool and I'll Die a Fool for You]] but it's incomplete and the author hasn't written anything since 2013 for that fic and 2014 in general so I've kind of given up on it being completed.
