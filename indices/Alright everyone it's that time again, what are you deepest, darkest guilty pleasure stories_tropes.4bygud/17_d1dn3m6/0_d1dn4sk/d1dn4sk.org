  When you have a problem, you call an expert. If those experts turn out to be linked to the problem, then you need to find someone you wouldn't ever think of. This Expert, changed everything and through this opened his eyes, opened them to the hidden world that he had always been living in. Sirius is now free, Dumbledore is worse than any snake and even Voldemort should fear Steam.
