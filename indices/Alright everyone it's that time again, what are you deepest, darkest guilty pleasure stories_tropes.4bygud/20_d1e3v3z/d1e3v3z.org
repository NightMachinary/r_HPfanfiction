Ministry-forced marriage to Snape, complete with clauses that force them to have sex on a regular basis. I don't necessarily care who the other half of the pairing is, though I'm fondest of Harry or Hermione, but Snape is a must.

They're not always good and most are basically the same story with few variations on the theme, but fuck if I don't eat them up with a spoon.
