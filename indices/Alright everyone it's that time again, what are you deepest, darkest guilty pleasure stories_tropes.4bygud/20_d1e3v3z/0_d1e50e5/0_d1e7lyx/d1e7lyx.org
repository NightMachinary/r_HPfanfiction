I am ridiculously fond of /Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels/ (HG/SS), which I think I've recced here before, but it just tickles my id like crazy and it's an epic, really immersive.

/Second Life/ (HG/SS), despite the marriage being a Dumbledore machination instead of a ministry thing, as this one really struck me as in-character and so well plotted alongside canon.

/With Eyes Wide Open/ (HH/SS), which is forced marriage by way of fulfilling a life debt. This one was kind of sweeter than the others. I find it to be a good comfort fic.

And /Cambiare Podentes/, which I know is a bit of a controversial rec because it seems like everyone already has Established Feelings about it, but it really hit all my "awkward forced sex" buttons to giddy degrees.
