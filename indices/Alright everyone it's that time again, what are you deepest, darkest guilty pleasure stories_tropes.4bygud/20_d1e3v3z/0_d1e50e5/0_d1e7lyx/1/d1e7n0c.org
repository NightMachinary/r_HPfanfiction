  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  A new prophecy comes to light, one that promises death for Harry Potter and enslavement for the wizarding world, unless Harry himself consents to being sexually enslaved--irrevocably and for life--to Severus Snape.
