Probably the "Harry inherits enough to literally control everything by going to gringotts, where he figures out Dumbledore has been manipulating him since birth and is paying hermione and the weasleys to befriend him and trick him into being light when harry is actually grey" I know the concept is shitty and over used. But for some reason I enjoy them.
