I like the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie]] fics, though they're all pretty much the same. Mostly I just read whatever new fic comes up and then forget about it. There was this one-shot fic about Harry and Daphne running away from Britain which was just great, not even as a guilty pleasure. I can't remember it for the life of me though.
