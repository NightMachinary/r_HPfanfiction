It is tricky, let me see if I can explain it right.

I THINK that Harry and Ron are gay in the story, and Gabrielle is a veela and at some point during the triwizard tournament one or the other accidentally got some of the others blood and somehow became bonded. And since Harry is gay and is attracted to men, Gabrielle became a man to suit him? Something like that. They are a very minor pairing in the story.
