I'm sure you've read linkffn(The Lie I've Lived). Personally I like it a lot, but I think it goes downhill near the back half.

linkffn(7402590) is a good one too, pretty AU but it's a fun read, unfortunately it's almost certainly abandoned, although the author recently updated a different story so maybe there is hope.
