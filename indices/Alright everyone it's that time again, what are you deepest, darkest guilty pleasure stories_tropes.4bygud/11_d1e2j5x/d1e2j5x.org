Harry and Fleur, fics. Especially when Harry really gets Fleur cause no one likes her cause of her beauty and she acts all bitchy so as not to crack. But this one boy with Emerald Eyes, cracks her icy facade cause he doesn't fall under her allure/whatever. Then he saves her sister and they fall in love forever and ever.

If people can rec more of these to me. I'd prefer well written but honestly am willing to sacrifice. Thanks guys and girls.
