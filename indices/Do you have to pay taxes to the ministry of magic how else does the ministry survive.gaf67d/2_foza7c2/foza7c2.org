I don't believe we know from canon how the Ministry gets its funding - however, it seems likely to be through taxes and/or fees.

We know they do fines on breaches of the Statute of Secrecy, which presumably makes up a chunk of the budget (eg - Arthur Weasley having to pay a 50 galleon fine in book 2). Other fines (eg, the dark magic ones) might also be ways of adding some money.

But yes - the Ministry does need to have an income to pay the salaries of its workers + finance all the other stuff that it does (Big events, Hogwarts, etc).
