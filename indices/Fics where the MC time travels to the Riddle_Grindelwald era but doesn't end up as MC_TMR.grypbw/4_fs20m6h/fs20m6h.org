I suggest using AO3's robust tagging system, to search for time travel fics, with whatever tag they use for WWII or Grindelwald and exclude any pairings with Riddle. I'm afraid I can't offer any specific suggestions, as I mostly focus on fanfics that depict alternate stories during Harry Potter's era.
