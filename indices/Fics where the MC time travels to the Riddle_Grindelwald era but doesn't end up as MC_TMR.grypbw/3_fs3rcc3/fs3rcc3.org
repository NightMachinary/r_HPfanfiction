I meant to add this with the others I listed, but I couldn't find the link at first. Found it now, so here it is...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][/Here And There/]] Ginny and Hermione travel back in time to WWII, around the time of the Grindelwald's Wizarding War or some time after it? They're paired with each other though. So while it meets your criteria, it might not be your cup of tea.

This one is also complete.
