Big Things in Small Packages

corvusdraconis, Dragon_and_the_Rose

Summary:

[HG/SS] AU/Crack: Severus Snape has to deliver the acceptance letter to the Granger home thanks to Minerva being sick with the cat flu. He has no idea how this one event will change his life forever. SSHG

My notes: Everything corvusdraconis does is major crack and absolutely delightful. So this story is probably not precisely what you are looking for. It is still delightful. I prefer reading this on AO3 but corvusdraconis has stuff on ff dot net that isn't on AO3, so if you do a deep read on them, check both.

And btw, much of their stuff is marked incomplete, but it is all functionally complete; they just reserve the right to add to it if they get inspired.
