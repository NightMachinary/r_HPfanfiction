Harry and Ron were discussing options for the training location, Hermione's contribution so far consisted of rereading /Hogwarts, A History/ in the hopes a suitable spot might be mentioned in the sacred (to her) text.

Ron suddenly piped up, "Maybe we should ask Fred and George? They know this castle better than anyone."

Harry nodded, "True, they even discovered the kitchens."

This caused Hermione to up look from her reading with a glare, "Honestly, it wasn't much of a discovery. The house elves have worked there forever. They slave away cooking for us. And cleaning. They've been cleaning this entire castle from top to bottom for generations. They scrubbed places the twins have never even thought to look."

Hermione continued, really getting into her SPEW rant, but the boys hardly noticed. A light bulb had gone off over their heads and they turned to each other as one, "The elves."
