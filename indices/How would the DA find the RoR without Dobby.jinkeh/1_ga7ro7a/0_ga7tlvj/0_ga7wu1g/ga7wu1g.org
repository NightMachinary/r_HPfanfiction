fair enough i dont really know why but if one character is just going to walk down a corridor back and forth just thinking i always picture Luna. Works with anyone you think might fit. Another idea is harry seeing some random names disappearing from the marauders map, like he just notices that a name isnt on it anymore when he saw it before and eventually realizes that name disappears when it gets to the 7th floor so he goes to look into it and finds the room.
