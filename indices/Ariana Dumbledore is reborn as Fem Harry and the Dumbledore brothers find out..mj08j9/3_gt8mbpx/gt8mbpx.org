The exact same plot, but Dumbledore doesn't know it's Ariana. The whole thing is a test to see if he's learned anything from the past. Ariana survives the killing curse at the Battle of Hogwarts not because of a horcrux or whatever, but because Death/Fate put her back to see if Dumbledore would pass his test.
