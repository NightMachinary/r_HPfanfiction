I have some notes (but a backlog of actual writing to do) about a slice-of-life fic where Snape has a sub for a week and the students start to realize that Snape running a tight ship actually results in /fewer/ accidents, and he enlists Flitwick to help with protection charms that make most of the accidents melt cauldrons instead of blow them up. The rough outline for this fic includes something like when the current students find out Dumbledore was considering scrapping Potions as a class entirely because Slughorn let too much slide and did stuff like leaving out open cauldrons of Amortentia and sent so many students to the infirmary that it used to be located in the dungeons... but then he hired Snape for the job because /reasons/, and Dumbledore's inclined to give Snape some slack for being such a sour git because no one is literally /dying/ in potions accidents anymore.

I once had a chemistry teacher that told us if the only thing we actually remember from his class was the lab safety procedures, then we will have gotten something very valuable. That's where I'm coming from with this concept.

But yeah, some /actual/ educational reforms sounds like a good idea ;)
