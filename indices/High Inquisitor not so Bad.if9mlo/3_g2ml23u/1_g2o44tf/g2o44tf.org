I see and like your idea. Maybe hire another part time potions teacher to give the theoretical lessons. Since Snape just writes the recipe. He might be a way better NEWT teacher but we don't get to see this. Maybe if they hire another teacher he could teach practical DADA as well if the theoretical teacher can also do theory on DADA? Idk maybe something to pursue
