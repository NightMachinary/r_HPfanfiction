So in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Umbrage isn't a terrible person...when we meet her. Based on how this fic goes, though, I fully expect things to go /terribly/, because this fic doesn't want us to have nice things for too long, but like...the awful anticipation of meeting a perfectly sane, mostly reasonable person and /knowing/ that something terrible is going to happen to change that has honestly been so well done that even though I don't usually prefer that kind of tension in stories I've found myself liking it.
