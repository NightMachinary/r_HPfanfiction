Hi - I don't think I've ever seen mention of Umbridge perhaps not being the worst person ever, so in lieu of me actually sharing a fic with you, here is a drabble I quickly scribbled (and did not proofread).

â€‹

Dolores Umbridge had no exactly no desire to teach at Hogwarts. She was perfectly content to continue her work at the Ministry of Magic; work she knew she was quite good at. There was a settled rhythm to her days - rise at 5:00, brew a strong cup of coffee (5 sugars), set off to work to get there a solid half hour before anyone else in the office, and get started on paperwork immediately. It was a comfort, this sort of work. Dealing with children and doubtlessly incompetent professors did not sound like a comfort. However, one did not turn down the Minister of Magic. Minister Fudge said she was the right pick for the job and while she did agree, it was with a heavy heart that she packed up her belongings from the Ministry.

From what she had been briefed on about the past few decades of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, there was a shocking lack of oversight in regards to the curriculum. Those poor children had been taught by vagabonds and riff raff and disgraced members of society. It seemed as though most viewed defense literature as unnecessary, and the ones who did treated it as a loose guideline to teach inappropriate magics that were well beyond the student's years!

No, no, that wouldn't do at all. Completely inappropriate and unheard of, how those young children were treated. It seemed to Dolores that the only way to go about this gross oversight would to start from the very basics. In fact, she had had an old school friend who had gone on to write a Defense textbook, if she recalled correctly... Slinkhard, perhaps, Will Slinkhard. She would send him an owl right away and get his viewpoint on how to go about helping these students. They would start on a basic curriculum until it was clear that everyone understood the foundation of defensive magic. She smiled to herself, pleased that she had come up with the obvious solution so simply. Her pace quickened, as she hurried off to pen a letter to Slinkhard. Perhaps she shouldn't be so worried about this new direction her life was taking - it was quickly seeming like this would be a wonderful year for herself and for Hogwarts.
