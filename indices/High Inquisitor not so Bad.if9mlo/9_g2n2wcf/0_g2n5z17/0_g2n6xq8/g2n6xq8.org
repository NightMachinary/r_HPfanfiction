Literally every other kid except Malfoy managed the exercise perfectly. Even Crabbe and Goyle didn't get hurt. Hagrid seemingly gave good enough instructions that when the kids followed them they were perfectly safe. His warnings were sufficient that none of the other kids were hurt. Only Malfoy intentionally disobeying the rules got injured and even then only lightly. I think Hagrid did pretty well.

Want to know the sad bit about the kid in my class? Might not have burned himself too badly but decided to do this while wearing plastic gloves (we were handling things that weren't great on your skin). Hot plastic melting into your skin makes an already bad problem worse.
