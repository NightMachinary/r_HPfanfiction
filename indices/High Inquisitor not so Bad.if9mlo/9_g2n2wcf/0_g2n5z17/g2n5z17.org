Your example is hilarious because yes, kids are morons, though doubting your teacher when he says "fire is hot" seems like a bit much even then. But Hagrid didn't even really do that. His warning was basically "hippogriffs are proud and might get grumpy if you're disrespectful". Like, ok, so, what does that even mean? Will they attack me? Will they turn away in a huff? Will they use an omnidirectional acid spray? What even constitutes being disrespectful? We have to bow, okay, cool, how low? How close do we have to be? Just a few words in the vein of "this is a large and potentially dangerous creature that can and will injure you if you don't follow my instructions" would have gone a long way to alleviating my concerns. In the movie they only had the one hippogriff, but iirc in the book it was like the entire herd. In the movie case, Hagrid should have been monitoring the kids interacting with the single specimen very closely and carefully, from close enough that he could immediately pull them out of danger if needed. This is a big dangerous creature. Don't just wave at the students like "have fun". Professor McGonagal started off her very first lecture with "Transfiguration is dangerous and messing about will not be tolerated". If a student ignores her instructions then that's on them, but teachers can design curriculum dealing with dangerous topics in ways to minimize the danger, or in ways to make sure students heed the warnings before they get hurt. Like chemistry teachers requiring you to wear labcoats, goggles, and close toed shoes. You can't stop someone sticking their hand in a flame, but you can make it harder for them to dump sulfuric acid in their eyes.
