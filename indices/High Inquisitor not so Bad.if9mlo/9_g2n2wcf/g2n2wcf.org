I disagree. There's only so much you can do. We had a great chemistry teacher and he was teaching us something and told us to never touch the Bunsen flame because we'd burn ourselves. A 15 year old kid wanted to see if we'd REALLY burn ourselves. Melted his own skin.

There's nothing you can do to prepare for that level of stupid. Almost like saying don't insult hippogryffs followed by a kid doing exactly that.
