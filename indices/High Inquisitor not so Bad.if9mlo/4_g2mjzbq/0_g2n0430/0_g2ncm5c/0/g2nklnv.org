To be fair not only do her predictions come true quite frequently (Lavander's Rabbit, Hermione quitting, even the prediction of Dumbledore's death comes to mind) but her students also manage surprisingly accurate predictions frequently (Ron predicting that Harry was in mortal danger -since he carried a hidden death eater around with him- and Buckbeak being saved later on the year are the examples that jump to the top of my head). So it is possible that there actually is a method for her madness.
