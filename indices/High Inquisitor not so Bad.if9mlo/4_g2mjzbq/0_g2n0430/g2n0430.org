I think its unfair to call Trewlaney a fraud. She can make prophecies... or at least two, over a 14 year period anyway, but it really seems like she's getting lost in the sauce and her classes suffer for it. Being good at making prophecies doesn't necessarily make you good at teaching. The problem is just how vague Divination is. I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] and I actually really like their approach to the subject which I feel is tastefully nuanced while still being mostly canon compatible. Mostly, Trewlaney needs to get over herself, grow some self confidence, and structure her curriculum better to provide for the students. As it stands she is a poor teacher, though depending on how the subject really works not a terrible one. Bashing is lame, but criticism isn't bashing in and of itself.
