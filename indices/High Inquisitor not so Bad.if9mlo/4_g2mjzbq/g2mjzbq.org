I remember the fic you mentioned. It was quite a surprise to see an Umbridge quite competent in her job (even if with History, the level is not that high)

I usually see Harry or Hermione who assess these situations (Snape's is a good potionner but a horrible teacher, Hagrid is kind but lack restraint, Trelawney is a fraud, etc.) and it's almost always followed by some bashing.
