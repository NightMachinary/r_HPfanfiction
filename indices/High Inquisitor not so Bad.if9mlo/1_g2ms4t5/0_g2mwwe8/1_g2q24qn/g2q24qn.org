The practical part of Harry's Divination OWL was crystal ball reading, tea-leaf reading, and palm-reading. Since the OWL would have been put together by the ministry and not Trelawney, we can assume that there was some competence involved, and that it's a good indication of what students should be able to do. I think this is a strong point in favor of Divination being as you describe it.

Divination being useless unless you're a seer is like saying that Transfiguration is useless unless you're a metamorphmagus.
