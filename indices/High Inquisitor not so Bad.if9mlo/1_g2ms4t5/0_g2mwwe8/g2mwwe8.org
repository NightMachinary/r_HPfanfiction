The idea of Divination being a useless course because either one is a Seer or one is not comes up pretty regularly in fic, but I really like the take that the class is more about what you describe -- magically gathering information, whether it's about the past, present, or future, with Seers being closely related but not the be-all end-all of the discipline.
