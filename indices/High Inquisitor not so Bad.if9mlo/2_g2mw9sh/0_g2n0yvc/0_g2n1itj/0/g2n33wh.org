I don't like Dumbledore bashing either, but I think it's the same general problem reiterated. Snape is good at potions so he should also be good at teaching about potions right? Dumbledore was a good teacher so he should be good at administrating a school, right? If we're being real, I think Dumbles big problem is that he's way overworked, and often seems to trust that people will be better than they actually are without actually trusting other people to do important things.

My big overhaul for the administration would be: Make Dumbledore step down as Headmaster. Make McGonagal Headmistress. Put someone else as Head of Gryffindor, maybe Dumbledore can do it in the interim. Sprout as Deputy Head. Keep Dumbledore on, and let him teach Transfiguration again, at least until they can hire someone new, then maybe let him do just NEWT level classes or start teaching an Alchemy course.

And, on a personal note, he should get someone to replace him as Chief Warlock. Now he still has a toe in with Hogwarts and on the international scene but his duties at Hogwarts are greatly reduced and geared towards something he might be a bit better at.

Dumbledore isn't a bad guy, but you don't have to be a bad guy to make bad choices, and it feels like he tried to do everything at once and couldn't quite hack it. He needs to take a step back and refocus his efforts, trust his subordinates to handle stuff, and not treat Hogwarts like its his to staff with the people he likes rather than the people who would be best for the job. Like I've actually heard a theory that he hired Lockhart specifically to try and prove he was a fraud. That's not an okay reason to hire someone to teach a class at your school.
