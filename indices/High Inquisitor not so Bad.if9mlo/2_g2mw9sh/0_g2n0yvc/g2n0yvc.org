That's kind of what I was imagining. Like, imagine this. They give Harry veritaseruem at the trial and it comes out that yes, he really was attacked by Dementors. Suddenly a huge block of the wizengamot is giving Fudge the side eye. They don't necessarily buy all the Voldemort stuff that Dumbles is laying down, but this is a separate thing. Can Fudge be trusted to administrate if he can't even keep track of Dementors? So now, Fudge isn't quite in the spot where he can swing putting a patsy in place to slam Dumbles, but the idea of an Inquisitor is still floated. There's been some 'concerns' raised over Dumbledore's management of Hogwarts, not just recently but over the past few years (cough troll cough basilisk cough werewolf professor almost ate some students cough). The Ministry is going to send someone in to find out what's what. But this time, it's going to be someone basically neutral. Maybe someone like Madame Marchbanks, older than dirt and not going to take any bs from Dumbles /or/ Fudge. So she's the one going through the school with a fine toothed comb, not to try and oust Dumble's favorites, but to critically examine teaching standards from an objective perspective. And she finds Hogwarts wanting in several regards.
