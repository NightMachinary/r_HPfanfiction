There's a Harry raised by Sirius fic where he's raised basically everywhere except Europe. They travel the world for most of the first part, they start in an American Town with some Native American fella that teaches Animagus-ey things, and Sirius falls for a Brazilian woman in Rio at some point. It was pretty fun, so if anyone else remembers what it was called and links it, I highly recommend it.
