DoS has the best natural progression of Harry taking control of the other kids over time. His natural charisma, intelligence, and initiative ability in both magic and social cues really shows how he grows into his role as a major player in the future. The other kids listens to him, /follows his lead./

I have /never/ read a fanfic that showed this kind of Harry so naturally. I didn't even notice it until others' POV scenes showed their perspective of Harry. Most of the time, it's always Harry powering through others, kicking ass and taking names in fanfics. It's very rare that Harry ever takes control of the house of snakes just through sheer charisma.
