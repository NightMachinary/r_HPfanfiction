The author of Den of Snakes said that it wasn't an intentional take off Prince of Slytherin, but that they had read the first book before writing so it could have been unconscious inspiration. They also said they were holding off on reading the next POS until they'd finished writing the next DOS.

I like them both but for very different reasons. They're not telling the same story even though you could summarize the plots identically. I'm not looking for realism in POS, I'm looking for the new ideas and new takes on old tropes. The scene with Lockhart's first day of class? My jaw dropped. I'd never seen anyone rewrite that canon scene to make sense before. POS Harry acts like an adult at age 11, yeah, and I wave my hand and keep reading because I didn't come here for realistic, age-appropriate children.

And in POS Lily's defense, she didn't send Harry away for the greater good, she sent him away for his own good. I agree she's unlikable, though. Canon Lily's characterization boiled down to 1) House of the brave 2) died for her kid. Versus the first thing we learn about POS Lily is that she's too much of a coward to face up to (i.e. try to correct) her parenting failures.

Den of Snakes, though. Second the recommendation. Amazing characterization. Kids acting like kids, and seeing them develop their "40yo noble talking politics" faces over time, actively studying it and practicing it on the other kids, makes it much more reasonable when we see them use it for real.

And DOS makes me /believe/ that Harry might turn away from Dumbledore and the Order without changing the canon characterizations very much or at all. Because yeah, one of JKR's biggest flaws is where she assumes a Slytherin Sorting makes 11yo's inherently evil. The bit in DOS where Harry sits between Draco Malfoy and Theo Nott and announces /we are not our fathers/ just hits me where it hurts.
