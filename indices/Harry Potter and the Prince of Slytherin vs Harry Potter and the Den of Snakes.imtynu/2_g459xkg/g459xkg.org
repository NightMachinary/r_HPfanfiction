I don't think PoS would be bad if it could get to the f*cking point already! We're at 1 million words and we've yet to reach the prologue, which (as I saw it) will be the point where things get interesting.

The usual criticisms don't apply, if I can suspend my disbelief for magic I can do it for the precocious political pipsqueaks, Lord Potters, etc. It takes some effort, but whatever, at least it's not "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches." Or any of the "Angry Harry" kind of fics where he steps on a soapbox and spends pontificating for hours without any of the people interrupting.

However thanks for recommending "Den of Snakes," I'll definitely check it out.
