Both are pretty awful ngl. I've read both and I know that PoS is supposed to be a trope inversion but it really doesn't actually subvert anything. It does the trope and then writes it with a faux explanation that makes you want to vomit in its convoluted and frankly obnoxious nature.

The author admits that most of the kids are written a bit older. But then goes and writes them like parodies of aristocrats that British people laugh at in Monty Python.

And Den of Snakes also has much of the same problems, with Harry getting a sort of inverted Slytherin social circle where everyone acts as a supporting friend and confidant. There's no conflict in any of these stories in terms of social settings other than the typical big bads or annoyances.

Somehow Hermione; the annoying Muggleborn that even Harry and Ron couldn't stand also weasels her way into both fics. And everyone calls Theodore fucking Nott, Theo.

Imagine for a moment that you've been raised all your life to believe that Muggleborns are usurpers of not only Magic but your culture. They come in, they attempt to change things to their muggle rational and get angry with any wizards that attempt to say they know better than someone that has only been in their society for half their life or less (in Hermione's case far less).

If I was Theodore Nott, or if anybody was Theodore Nott, they'd give Hermione a wide berth even if they were the nicest Slytherin of the bunch. Harry's Slytherin friends shouldn't be Teddy bears, they should be vicious at best, and amoral sociopaths at worst. He'd only be a tool to anyone of them. And while child politicians is a trope, having a friend for "clout" as the kids say nowadays isn't.

I'm going to be honest, the guarded and secretive Harry that is also just a crazy extrovert doesn't feel real and it is a lazy trope that needs to be done away with.
