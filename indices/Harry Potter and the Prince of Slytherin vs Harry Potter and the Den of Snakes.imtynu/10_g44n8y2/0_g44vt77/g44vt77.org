Interesting. I didn't think DOS Dumbledore was that far off from canon. The biggest divergence is that he broke the law when he knowingly sent an innocent man (Sirius) to prison. While that is a pivot from canon, it's not that big a stretch. Canon Dumbledore has a great deal of disrespect for the Ministry's laws (admittedly, with good reason for some of it). And he canonically sends Harry back to an abusive home because he believes the bigger picture of Petunia's blood protection is more important than the smaller picture of Harry's health.

Various fanfics explain it away - Harry really would have died away from Petunia, calling the Aurors to investigate the basilisk would have escalated the petrifier to commit murder, he didn't actually have the authority to get a fair trial for Sirius, and so on. That's fine and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's still not canon.
