Personally I find the idea of either of them tossing one of their children away just downright laughable, Lily was willing to sacrifice her live for Harry and James at 11-17 (aka the topmost of spoiled kid/teenager edginess and selfishness) befriended an abused kid from a pro-Voldemort family, a werewolf and an average classmate and stuck with them until his death, whatever else you want to say about him the guy was loyal and open-minded, the idea of him just kicking his son out because he might go bad or is not famous at age 1 always rubbed me the wrong way.
