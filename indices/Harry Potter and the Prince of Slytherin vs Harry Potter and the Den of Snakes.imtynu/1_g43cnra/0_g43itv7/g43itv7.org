That's not the reason. What's the point in comparing an AU-character to his Canon self?

The point here is that no rational, normal-intelligent person does that. I go as far as sending a squib away, if you write a character as adhering to pureblood standards. But for one, in WBWL stories, they typically are supposed to be on the /opposite/ side, and then coming up with ludicrous excuses of why they "didn't realise he wasn't a squib" or "forgot to check" just hands out IQs of 20 all around.

I once read a story where they /literally forgot he existed/. Just slipped their mind. No magic.

/No one does that/. They don't not work as incarnations of their Canon traits, they don't work as realistic human persons.
