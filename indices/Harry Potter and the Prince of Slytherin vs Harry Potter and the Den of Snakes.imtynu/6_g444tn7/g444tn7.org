Oh yeah, definitely. I've tried reading PoS at least three times, furthest I got was the end of book 2. Just not a very good story in my opinion. DoS, and the whole of S&S is just amazing. Obviously there are some faults, but it is by far one of the best fanfictions I've ever read! Nearly cried of despair when I saw the account was orphaned, then nearly cried of joy when I saw it had been picked up again.
