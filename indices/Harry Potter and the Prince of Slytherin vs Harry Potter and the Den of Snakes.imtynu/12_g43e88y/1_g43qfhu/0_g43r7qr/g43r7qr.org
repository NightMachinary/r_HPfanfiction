It's a treatise, so it can't be rated as a story.

If you do rate it as a story, it's sub-par writing in a technical sense, an author with no idea how to create a coherent plot, and absurd characterisations and world-building that change willy-nilly to make whatever point the author thought of just then.

Which is to say, there are many more talented authors, a lot of better written stories, and certainly stories that grate less for the sheer inherent obnoxiousness of "subverting tropes".
