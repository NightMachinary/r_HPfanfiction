It feels like the characters are consistent (I binged the first two books my first read) to me. The magic is well defined and does not change with the plot (like it could). The plot is drawn and covers a lot of things not related to the A plot but seeing the multitude of characters and knowing every characters motivations is a really fun thing to see.

His writing could use some work I agree.

It is also a treatise (had to look it up) but I don't think it suffers for it.
