Well, I on the other hand found Prince of Slytherin very engaging (the first two books, haven't read the third yet), and the Den of Snakes quite offputting in the later chapters.

Your criticisms of POS are certainly valid. But if you ignore the characters' supposed age, it is and engaging mystery with interesting plans and exciting twists. And honestly, while I like the Harry Potter universe, I often don't actually want to read a story about genuine middle schoolers, so that's not a problem for me (it would be if some characters acted 11 so they can be bashed, but that's not the case here).

Den of Snakes started pretty well, but started making me very uncomfortable in the later books when they started dealing with "pureblood culture" in a very uncritical way - with Harry, and especially Hermione, accepting every detail without questioning and objections. And the purpose of some of those traditions was clearly to preserve the power of the old families, lock out people (especially muggleborns) without connections, etc.
