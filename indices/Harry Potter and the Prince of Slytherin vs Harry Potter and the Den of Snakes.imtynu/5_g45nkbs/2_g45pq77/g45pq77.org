Mate. PoS has Harry dishing out his abuses to anyone and everything without even prompting. Who the fuck does that? If anyone has a shitty abusive childhood, they either air it out in an anonymous setting, or not say anything at all in public, unless said people were close friends or family.

Harry seems keep going on and on and on about his terrible childhood, that it lost its impact on the story overall. And the paragraphs... jeezus, the paragraphs are long and not at all read worthy. Half the time I'm skimming through it just to have it get to the point.
