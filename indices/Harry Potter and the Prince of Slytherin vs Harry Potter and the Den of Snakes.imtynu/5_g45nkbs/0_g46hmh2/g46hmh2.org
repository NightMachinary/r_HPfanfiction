DOS started out well on that front, with Harry going "well, my experience of Muggles is that they're awful people, but clearly Hermione and Justin have had different experiences." I liked how the tension between Hermione and her parents came from ignorance and how Hermione solved it by finding a way to "translate" magical subjects into Muggle terms.

But yeah, in the recent parts DOS has started drifting decidedly to racist apologism. I'm holding out hope that this is just an educational detour and that the series will have Harry continue to carve out a third (fourth?) side to the war.

In particular, my pet peeve is when authors try to claim that "mudblood" is a cultural slur, not a racist one. Look, your characters might only use the slur on those who don't behave white - I mean pureblood - but the slur itself literally refers to blood and literally calls Muggles "mud". If you're so enamored with your anti-immigrant racism, have your characters come up with a new slur to use on Muggleborns who /gasp/ keep some of their birth culture. /rant
