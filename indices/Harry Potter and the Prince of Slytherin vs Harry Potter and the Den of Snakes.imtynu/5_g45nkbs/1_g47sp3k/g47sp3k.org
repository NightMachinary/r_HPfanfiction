  Den of Snakes started pretty well, but started making me very uncomfortable in the later books

Which is precisely what makes it great writing, because writing is all about getting me to feel things, and also getting me out of my comfort zone.

This is what PoS doesn't do, and can never do, with its ridiculous crack-y trope use (or "suberversion"): Be serious, and be taken seriously, and make you a hella lot /uncomfortable/ when stuff hits too close to home. It's in those instances, it's also there e.g. when dealing with the Death Eater kids; when you realise there are Death Eaters, and there are students, and suddenly the Death Eaters are also parents, uncles, aunts, relatives and you have to reconcile the two.

It's not an easy feat to achieve, and the mark of an author of talent. It's one of the reasons I consider S&S on another level entirely and never really get the comparison; aside from sharing bits of (early) plot, the two stories (or one story and one treatise) couldn't be more different.
