linkffn(Black Luminary) Heavy AU, written from the perspective of Harry who is part of the Black family which is regarded as The Bad Guys by society. The antagonists of the story are mostly the Light Side (so they are not blood-purity motivated) but they have just as many skeletons in the closet as the Dark Side. Who are also not motivated by blood purity but firstly survival and secondly upholding of tradition.
