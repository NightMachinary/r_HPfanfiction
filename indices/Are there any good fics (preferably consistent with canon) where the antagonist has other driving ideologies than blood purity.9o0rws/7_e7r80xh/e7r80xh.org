I've read a few fics where the "Dark" side's primary motivation is to protect wizard kind from the disproportionately larger muggle population and/or provide a better solution than the increasingly porous Statute of Secrecy.

For example:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] - Grindelwald's war is a vast and elaborate smokescreen to cover up his main goal: to find an ancient Hebrew artifact that could enact a "Plagues of Egypt" style genocide on the muggles.

In fics where Dumbledore is the antagonist he sometimes has goals that are against blood purity. For example:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] - In this alternate universe Albus Dumbledore is a dictator over wizarding Britain. His regime persecutes "Old Bloods" (Pureblood families) while elevating Muggleborns. His justification is that the Old Bloods allegedly hold society back by rejecting the great progress that can be made by integrating magic with muggle technology.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888734/1/Jonquils-and-Lightning][Jonquils and Lightning]] - In an alternate universe Dumbledore uses his political influence to completely eradicate all traces of powerful magic (including Dark magic) with the idea that the world will be a safer place without such tools in the hands of wizards.
