"Someone please help." - direct quote from both the fic and me reading it. This needs a beta in the worst way.

The second word of the fic and the name of an extremely prominent character is misspelled. Harry is shouting for no reason, or at least we are told he is shouting even though both the words themselves and the punctuation make it seem much less expressive. Plus, the dialogue between Harry and Tom reads like a cartoon. There's no menace.

And that's just the first three paragraphs.

PS: How does one stand smugly? What is his posture like. Is he peacocking?
