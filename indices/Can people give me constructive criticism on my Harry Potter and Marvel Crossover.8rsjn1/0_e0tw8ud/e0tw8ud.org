This really needs a beta.

  "No," Harry shouted. "It's time to pay for everything Tom."
#+end_quote

I know you say he's shouting, but this reads more like he's just kind of... saying it.

#+begin_quote
  whispering what Harry knew was Parcelmouth
#+end_quote

/shivers/ First, Par*s*elmouth is /someone/ who can /speak/ Parseltongue.

#+begin_quote
  Harry panicked, launching a barrage of whatever spell he could think of.
#+end_quote

He's "launching" more than a single spell. A barrage, some might say. So he should be launching "whatever spell*s* he could think of".

#+begin_quote
  Tom's eyes widened in shock as he realised the man was truly James Potter.
#+end_quote

Except Tom Riddle should have absolutely no idea who James Potter is. The diary was created and imbued with memories from before James Potter was even born.

  "The book," Harry answered, indicating a book that lay on the floor near the red-headed girl. Loki aimed his sceptre's blade at the book, ignoring Tom's anguish cry as he impaled the book.
#+end_quote

Say 'book' again! Say 'book' again, I dare you - I /double-dare/ you motherfucka! Say 'book' one more goddamn time!

Honestly I suspect that there are more things to criticize, but I can't make it past the first half of the first chapter.

Your dialogue needs a /lot/ of work. It reads flat, like there's no meaning to anything being said. It's constantly taking me out of the story.

The transition between Midguard and the HPVerse is done without warning or separators, making things awfully confusing while skimming.

That's not to say that you shouldn't continue writing, or that you have a bad idea for a story. A beta is someone you can bounce ideas off of and have critique your writing /before/ it makes it to the public. A touch up here and there or a couple warnings would have made this a much better read.

Just one more thing:

#+begin_quote
  Harry said gratefully. "But who are you?" He asked, his emerald eye looking into the man's eyes
#+end_quote

Did I miss the part where Fawkes accidentally tore out one of Harry's eyes, instead?
