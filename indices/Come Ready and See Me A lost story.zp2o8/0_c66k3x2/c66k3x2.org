So through an unconventional (and horribly tedious and time-consuming) manner, I have managed to copy the fic from Wattpad. If you give me an email address and tell me what format you want it in, I'll send it right to you. I can do: rtf, pdf, mobi, and epub

Edit: Forgot to mention: because of the way I copied it and the quite frankly terrible way the chapters were split up on wattpad, there may be a few formatting mistakes - section breaks where there shouldn't be and none where there should be, things like that - but it shouldn't affect the reading. :)
