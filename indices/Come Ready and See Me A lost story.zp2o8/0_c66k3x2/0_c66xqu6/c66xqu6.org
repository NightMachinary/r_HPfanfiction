Yeah, so I went trying to figure out what happened to starrymoonmaiden, and it seems like she wiped herself clear off the internet. Her profiles on multiple websites have been deleted, as well as all copies of her stories. According to one website, this all happened on September 1, 2012, which makes sense to me. Now I am just trying to figure out if she ever had an email posted, or some website, or anything really that I could get to try and email her. Her work seems to be pretty popular so it confuses me why she did this. I take it you don't know her from anywhere?
