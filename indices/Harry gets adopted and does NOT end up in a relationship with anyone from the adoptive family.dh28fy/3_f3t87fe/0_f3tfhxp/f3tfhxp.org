Lupin is a useless pity party who was never there for Harry and then ran from his pregnant wife, breaking their marital vow three months into the marriage. Sirius did a lot more to help Harry during years 4 and 5 despite facing summary execution if he was caught.

And McGonagall was absolutely useless and not there for Harry either. If her reaction to children having words carved into their skin is "keep your head down", then she shouldn't be around them.

I wouldn't mind Harry/Wayne Hopkins or Terry Boot. But none of the popular slash pairings appeal to me because I find most male characters in the universe boring and the few who are interesting cannot be paired with each other or it would ruin the arcs (eg Edward Tonks and James Potter).

Hell no, although they might deserve tobe inflicted on each other. The only Snape pairing I'm interested in is Snape/Dementor, or maybe Snape/the Veil.
