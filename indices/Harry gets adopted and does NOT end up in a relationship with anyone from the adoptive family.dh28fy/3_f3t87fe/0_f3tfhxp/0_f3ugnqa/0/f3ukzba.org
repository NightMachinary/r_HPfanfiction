Why would Sirius need a redemption arc? The only thing which even remotely qualifies would be him telling Snape how to get past the willow, and that was only dickish towards Lupin and can honestly be resolved with a "I didn't know Snivellius was that mentally retarded that he'd go Werewolf spotting on a full moon".

I'm honestly curious about Padma/Nott. How is that even a thing? She has one scene, he is a background who believes in racial superiority and does nothing other than laugh at Hermione's parentage once. How can that ship be a thing?
