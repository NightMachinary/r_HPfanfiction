The same as all other ships...imagination? ðŸ¤” lol

But really, fanfiction is so popular because you can take canon and make it into something that you enjoy and give characters more depth and time for growth. Most of the children who became DE's did so due to familial duties. Even if they thought they were better than Muggles/Muggle-born Rowling didn't give any of them a chance to repent or make different decisions because if she had, the entire story would have turned out differently.

So yes, I like to imagine that Theo and a few of the other Slytherin's had someone they felt safe enough to turn to. Someone to offer them another option besides falling into the destructive path of racial/blood superiority. Honestly, this is why I have issues with a lot of the staff. They let the entirety of the school ostracize the Slytherin's enough so that they are isolated from their peers. They have no other adult to turn to other than Snape.

And almost the entire cast of HP could use a redemption arch. Everyone has made world changing, dumbarse decisions. Sirius included. And not just for the Lupin/Snape thing. He decided revenge would be better than taking care of his godson. And I don't particularly care for him seeing Harry with James colored filters on though I can imagine that we won't agree on the Sirius aspect. I don't hate him, but he definitely has enough faults to want to give him the opportunity to grow /up/. He didn't have the chance to in canon - due to his own mistakes - and I just don't like him all that much when he's half insane from Azkaban (and for abandoning Harry).
