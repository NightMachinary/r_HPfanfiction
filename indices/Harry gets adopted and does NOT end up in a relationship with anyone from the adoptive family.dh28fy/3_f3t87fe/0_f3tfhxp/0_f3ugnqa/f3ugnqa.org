Well alrighty then!😅😅

I agree with the first half of this comment. And honestly, the whole of the Lupin/Tonks relationship seemed a bit weird to me simply because - at least to me - the whole of them being together was just war circumstances. I personally don't think they would have been a thing if there hadn't been a war raging... I don't think Remus or Tonks wanted to have a kid, and the only reason they got married is because that's what was expected of them and Lupin more than likely wanted to do the "right" thing. Still flaky as shite though for bouncing out like that though. He's too lukewarm for me in canon so I try to give him character growth in my own stories.😗

Yeeeeah. It's probably not for you.😅 I hardcore ship Drarry (and Snupin). If it isn't endgame Drarry, or with Snupin as the main ship, I don't bite. I *do* ship other pairings. Even have a few het favorites - I'm obsessing over Theo Nott/Padma Patil and I love them so much!!! 😁😅

Again, we won't agree here but that's cool. I *get* why you don't like him. Lol. But I go for the redemption arcs for Snape, Lupin, Sirius, and Draco/Malfoy's. I don't like them completely out of character but well...better than canon.
