Correct me if I'm wrong, but Harry never gets adopted right? Amazing story, I've read it a few times and I love it, but damn I'm confused. Where is the whole 'adoption' from? Unless I'm thinking of a different story, the only adoption this story has is sweet little Natalie. She gets adopted by Sirius and Marlene. So, I ask, what are you referring to by him being adopted by the Tonks?
