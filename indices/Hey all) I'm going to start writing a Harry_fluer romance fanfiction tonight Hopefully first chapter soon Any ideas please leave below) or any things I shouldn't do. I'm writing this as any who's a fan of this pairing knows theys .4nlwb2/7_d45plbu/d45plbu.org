My list of do/donts for Harry/Fleur

*Don't over-complicate things

*Don't use the word "allure" at all. It's not canon.

*Don't change either of their ages. It ruins half the challenge and cheapens it. 14 + 17 year old is not the craziest or most unrealistic thing.

*Veela-bond shit and other gimmicks to get them together without any work. Just don't.

*Don't do the normal 'woe is me, I'm beautiful yet no man can see me for me' shit. Super lame.
