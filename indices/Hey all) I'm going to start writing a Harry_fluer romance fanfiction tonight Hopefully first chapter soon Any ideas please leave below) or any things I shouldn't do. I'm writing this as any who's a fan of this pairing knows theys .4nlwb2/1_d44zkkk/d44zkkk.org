Harry and Fleur is probably the hardest ship to write well. There are so many easy outs that the pairing has been saturated by soulbonds and straight up smut.

I am going to assume it's set during *GoF.* Here's my advice.

- Don't break the Trio up. The interplay between Fleur and Hermione is a treasure drove of drama, look at the scene in DH where Hermione dismisses Fleur as a bit of an airhead and Harry defends her by mentioning her selection as school champion. That's ready made story, use it!

- Don't break the Trio up. Yes i wrote it twice. Ron's struggle with jealousy and his susceptibility to Fleur's allure is rich with opportunity. You have a premise, a conflict and a conclusion just sitting there waiting for you to use it. Ron going from drooling to jealous to repairing his relationship with Harry is potential gold. Don't bash Ron, make him grow up!

- Harry has to earn Fleur's respect. Harry really is just a leetle boy at the start of GoF. How are you going to change that? Remember that Harry isn't and really shouldn't be an super powerful wizard. He is the underdog, that's where the drama with the fight with Voldemort lies. Harry's greatest strengths are elsewhere. Find a way for Fleur to discover them.

- Harry and Fleur have a lot in common. Harry is isolated by his fame, Fleur by her appearance. Use that sense of isolation. The journey from conflict to understanding works here. It brings them closer, they develop empathy for each other and makes the romance more believable.

- Don't take Harry shopping... just no. Fleur shouldn't be a tool for you to fix Harry. She has her own needs and wants, keep those in mind. Please don't go to France, please don't have Harry adopted, please don't have a marriage contract.

- Please don't feel the need to bring them perfectly together by the end of GoF. They are both young and inexperienced. The don't really know the steps of the dance. Not having them as boyfriend girlfriend at years end isn't a failure, it's grounded. Look at how long it took Harry to work out his feelings for Ginny in canon. Foreplay damn it!

- Most of the fics I've read never have any real setbacks in the relationship. They are hormonal teenagers under immense stress. They are volatile, their interactions should reflect that. Develop trust, break trust, hurt the other and finally reconciliation and growth.

  I'll probably add more to this later as I think of stuff. Good luck. Harry and Fleur forever!
