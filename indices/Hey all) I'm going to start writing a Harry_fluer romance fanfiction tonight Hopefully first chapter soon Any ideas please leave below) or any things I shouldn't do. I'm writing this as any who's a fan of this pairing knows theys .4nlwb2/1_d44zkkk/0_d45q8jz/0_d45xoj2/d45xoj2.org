I've seen people refer to it as Fleurry.

Apart from that, even though I love the the H/F pairing every time I see it discussed here I've just got leave what another user wrote on another thread a couple years ago:

#+begin_quote
  *Shippin'*

  *Harry/Ginny* - Girl falls in love with her prince charming. They marry and have kids. They name their kids after people they don't know very well, some of which have screwed them rather directly.

  *Harry/Hermione* - Girl falls in love with her best friend.

  *Harry/Hufflepuff* - Guy falls in love with the nice girl.

  *Harry/Ravenclaw* - Guy falls in love with brainy girl who isn't Hermione? Author likes Asian Amateur porn.

  *Harry/Slytherin* - Hatesex is glorious.

  These happen. These aren't hyper difficult. These are tropes which are all over our literary works, our culture, all over our every day life, in our relationships and others. We have a POINT OF CONNECTION to them.

  Now... then it gets a bit... Harrier. Bwahahaha.

  *Harry/Tonks* - Guy digs the police chick. They have kinky shapeshifting sex and fight crime. Author might like pegging.

  *Harry/Luna* - Guy falls in love with the insane girl

  *Harry/Sue* - Guy inherits magical powers from the four founders and has a massive penis that the prepz hate.

  The quality severely deteriorates. You have to jump through holes. Tonks may have a personality that's young, but Harry and her have to find a point of connection. Easy, he joins the Unspeakables for an unforgettable summer in being cleared to use the Killing Curse. Ugh. Luna is insane. How many of you know insane girls like Luna? Well, I have a friend who's a little bit of a schizophrenic, maybe she's like him? I have a bunch of Morning Glory seeds to chomp on, maybe I can replicate schizo in my head? Mary Sue? That one's a joke.

  Then...

  We have... the ships that are fucking really, really difficult.

  *Harry/Blaise's Mom* - Harry becomes the Don. He kills people. He enjoys cocaine with his afternoon tea.

  *Harry/fem!character* - You'd best explain how genderbending's going to work out, dude. etc etc.

  *And then.* /We have THE ship./

  *THE SHIP. THAT NEVER. SAILED.*

  */Harry/Fleur/*

  /A LEETLE BOY HAS TO IMPRESS A FRENCH SEX SYMBOL FROM A DIFFERENT RACE WHO HAPPENS TO SHARE A PLACE ON THE 0-10 SCALE WITH A VICTORIA SECRET'S ANGEL WHO HAPPENS TO BE THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HIM AND IS THE MOST COMPETENT STUDENT IN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL WITH THE POWER TO MAKE MEN FALL HEAD OVER HEELS BY EXISTING./

  *Good. Fucking. Luck.*

Like I said I enjoy the pairing but always get a laugh when I read the above comment.
