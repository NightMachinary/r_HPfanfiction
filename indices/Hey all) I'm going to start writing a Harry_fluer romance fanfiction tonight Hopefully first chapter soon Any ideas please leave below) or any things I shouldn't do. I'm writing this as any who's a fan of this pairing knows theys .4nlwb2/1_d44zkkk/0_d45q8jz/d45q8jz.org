If I could, I'd upvote this post more than once. I'm not much of a writer, but I'm pretty sure I've read every half-decent Harry/Fleur fic out there (as well as most of the bad ones), and I have to say, this is all excellent advice. While I don't necessarily mind most of the cliches you've told OP to avoid, I would certainly love to read a fic like the one you describe. VIVE LA...oh bother, does Harry/Fleur even have a ship name?
