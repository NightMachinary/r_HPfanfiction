Thank you for the advice! And yes I will not do a marriage contract or anything like that! I will however make a Harry a year older or fleur a year younger what's better? Also I will make Harry slightly more confident but that'll be more so about being a seeker. He'll still be nervous around girls etc..it will go up to 7th year in the process of trying to find away for fluer to stay at hogwarts til then and also for harry to actually be their for 7th year
