Don't make this a fix it fic. To echo a point made by [[/u/faeriniel]], adding Fleur is going to make a LOT of things easier. Why does Hermione need to look up the stunning spell when our bff Fleur can show us? Etc. Etc. Adding Fleur needs to come with a cost; harry is spending his time dating Fleur and not doing some of the things he did in cannon. What does he lose or miss out on? Maybe harry spends the summer in France after 4th year. Does his relationship with Sirius-never the most stable of pepple-suffer? Or does Sirius follow him to France to keep an eye on him? (thus opening up more areas for drama and plot).
