Does Veela!Draco count? If so, then buckle up, fuckers, I have a couple thousand fics. For drarry shippers(and dramione, harmione, and any other ship you want) check out my tumblr cest-la-via-fics, drop an Ask for fic recs and be answered within less than a week! My only ask is that anything be as specific as possible, anything vague and generic will be ignored or at least pushed to the very back of my priorities. I have work and writing and school, no time for going through my bookmarks for every fic that fits your 'just something with good writing' Ask. Tropes and tags you enjoy.

edit: i fixed my username, i use dashes
