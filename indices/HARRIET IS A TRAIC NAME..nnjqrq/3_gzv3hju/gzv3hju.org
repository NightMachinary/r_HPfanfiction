We don't know why he's named Harry in canon. We don't know Lily's parents' names, so maybe he was named after Lily's dad. Maybe he was named after Lily's mom, but the name Harriet was changed to Harry. If he'd been a girl, they could have just used Harriet without changing it. Basically chill out about the name Harriet. There are perfectly good justifications for it if someone likes it.
