Mostly because it's lazy af, and speaks of a general lack of creativity on the Author's part. Every "Harriet" fic I've ever read has been a canon rehash, likely for the same reason.

It's even worse when they feminize the second name as well, and turn her into Harriet Jane. It's a sign of an insanely uncreative fic and I'm not here for that.
