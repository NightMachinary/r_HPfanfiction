Eh, a quick Google suggests that while for some reason it really fell out of favour as a name in the US in the 1960s, in the UK it has been consistently more popular, if still not exactly common. According to ONS, neither Harriet or Harry were on the top 100 baby names in 1974, or 84 but both were for 94. Also, as someone else has said, why would you expect wizarding naming fashions to look anything like ours given how location/class/culture dependent it can be.
