Honestly my favourite has to be the one where he tries to portkey the dragon as far towards the forest as possible, but as hes a complete newbie, it ends up on top of the slytherin/judges stands. And hes like "well if they expect a single 14 year old to be able to handle a dragon, a booth of judges and a stand of students should take it down without problems right?"

Cue a few hundred dead, because No, a dragon is fucking dangerous.
