Linkao3(Harry Potter and the conspiracy of blood by cambangst) is a little slow paced in the beginning but it goes full throttle at like the 14th - 15th chapter. It has old Harry, Ron and Hermione dealing with a new villain.

Linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB) is full of action between Riddle, Dumbledore, Grindelwald and a fourth unknown enemy (who I will not be disclosing for fear of spoiling the fic). It has action scenes interspersed throughout the story.

Linkffn(Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin) for a guilty pleasure fic. No more spoilers needed, I think.

EDIT : Bot seems to be down
