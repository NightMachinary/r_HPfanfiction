Or, at least, that's how I imagine the rationale for it. Sorry, I can't handle it when he has an Animagus form that's "totally awesome" instead of "totally Harry." It makes me laugh. Sometimes, I'm surprised that no one's given him flame decals on the side of his fur coat.

Oh, sorry, I meant /rune tattoos/ in a flame design.
