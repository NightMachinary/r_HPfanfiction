I've never read a fanfic where Harry was a panther animagus. I guess we might be focusing on different sections of the HP fanfic multiverse? I usually avoid fics in which the writer tries to take the coolness/edginess factor up to 11.

The most common forms I've seen are a raven or various species of snake.

Just to name a few Harry animagus forms I've seen:

- Ghost ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]])
- Raven ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]])
- Bat ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]])
- Griffin ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]])
