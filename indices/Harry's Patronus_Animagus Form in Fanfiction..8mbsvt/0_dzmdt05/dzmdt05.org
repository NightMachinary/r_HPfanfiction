Let's see, turning into an animal is cool, and also it's a connection to Harry's parents, the Maraudersâ„¢. But this is a badass Harry (because aren't they all?), so he has to turn into something that's good for combat. Something to strike fear into your heart.

No, maybe something even more combat-focused? Something with a track record that will bode well for Harry winning the war.

Not quite, I'm thinking this Harry will be more of a stealth murdery type, so we want his Animagus to be more "things that go bump in the night".

Ah, fuck it. Panther it is.
