I don't remember the Burbage murder, can't comment. I don't remember any unlawful imprisonment committed by her, only Bellatrix. Obstruction of justice, I just don't see where that happened. She did posses illegal objects, but then, so did Harry, with the sword, and Serius, technically, with the locker and other dark artifacts in Grimmauld place. We don't know for certain if she was involved at the world cup, but I doubt it, as she doesn't really do anything herself the entire series. She also wasn't present at the graveyard.
