I suppose it depends on the interpretation and writing. Throughout the books Lucius Malfoy is mentioned as a Death Eater, but no one really suggests Narcissa is. JKR has confirmed that despite being equally as bigoted as Lucius, Narcissa never was a Death Eater. This was my impression from the book, also.

We know that Draco was inducted young and put up to his task as a punishment for Lucius' failings. I think Voldemort invites Narcissa to the dinner out of a twisted 'respect' to the hosts, to further drive fear into them. I would say she attends only to protect Draco, but the position of the Malfoys at this point meant that Voldemort called all the shots.

In this regard, Narcissa wasn't so much as an accomplice as under threat of death/held hostage herself.

Illegal artifacts, it sounded like Arthur Weasley considered these to belong to Lucius - perhaps an inheritance line thing. A more dubious innocence here.
