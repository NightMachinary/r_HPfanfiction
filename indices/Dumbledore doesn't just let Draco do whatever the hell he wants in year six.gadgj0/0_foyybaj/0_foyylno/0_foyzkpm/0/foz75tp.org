Does anyone believe that if Harry told Narcissa that Draco was dead that she would have still told Voldemort that Harry was dead? I don't think so.

At a minimum her one decent act there may have allowed for some leniency but that would truly depend on what crimes she committed.

Lucius did nothing to warrant any leniency and should have been executed for his crimes. Hell if the dementors kiss was considered valid for Barty Crouch Jr. and Sirius just for escaping from Azkaban than why wasn't it good for Lucius.

And quite frankly Draco should have been executed as well. At a minimum two attempted murders (Katie and Ron), conspiracy to commit murder (Dumbledore), and facilitating a murder (Dumbledore). Let alone what he did to earn his death mark and any other crimes he committed (including terrorism/treason for participating in an armed conflict against the legitimate government).

So the canon message at least if you're a Malfoy is you can assault, rape, murder, etc anyone and if a single member of your family does one single decent act you all get off with a slap on the wrist. So why should you ever stop doing what you want?
