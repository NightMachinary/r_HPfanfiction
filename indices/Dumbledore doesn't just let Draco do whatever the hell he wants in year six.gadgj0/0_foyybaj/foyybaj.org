Draco got away with everything. I don't care about his bullying, it was normal for rich doichebags. I don't think he changed later in his life. I mean he almost killed Ron and Katie, only Harry's quick thinking and luck saved them.

He let the murdering scum into Hogwarts, only Liquid Luck saved the students from certain death.

I don't want to know what atrocies he committed in 7th year where he got free reign. He throwed lethal curses at Harry and other like candy in RoR.
