You did read the previous books, right? If Dumbledore is sane and competent, unless he's hideously hemmed-in by circumstances he's 100% okay with risking the students if it furthers his plans.

- Someone super-dangerous is trying to steal this Stone? Better keep it in a school full of children that could end up as hostages and/or collateral damage.
- Deadly creature behind nothing more than a locked door that a firstie can open, complete with an announcement at start of term that points inquisitive students straight to it.
- Troll in the dungeon? Better send the kids out of the Great Hall where they can all be defended by the staff and to their common rooms, one of which is in the dungeons.
- Mirror that he himself admits is dangerous just left out in an unused classroom without even bothering with a locked door.

And all that's just in Book One...
