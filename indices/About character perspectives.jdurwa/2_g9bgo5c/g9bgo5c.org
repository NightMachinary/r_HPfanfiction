It helps to view the fic like a presentation or a speech. For everything and every scene you put into it, ask yourself, what is the purpose? What do I want to show the audience with that?

And if the answer is, I dunno, cut it out. People even go further, and demand any one scene has to fulfill at least two purposes. I try to adhere to that in my writing, but it doesn't always work out.

Hard-and-fast rules aren't the point anyway, though. The above is what you want to aim for, generally speaking, and then you make judgement calls on an individual basis.
