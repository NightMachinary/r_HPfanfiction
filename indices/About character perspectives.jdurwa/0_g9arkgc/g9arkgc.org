No, you don't. Ask every time, “is this action/dialogue/whatever necessary for plot/character development”?, and if the answer is negative either just skip it or summarize it with “meanwhile the quarrel with Dudley deteriorated into Snape cursing him into a small toad”.

Every fanfiction longer than one chapter (and often even those) could be in my opinion cut to half (at least). All of them are horribly long, sometimes grotesquely so. To mention just one example (and a good one, if cut substantially, it could be one of very good stories): “Breakfast In New York by Radaslab” linkffn(5141159) is lovely Harmony story, which in my opinion has enough plot for some five, perhaps seven chapters of the same length as it has. In reality, unfortunately, we have thirty one of them. There are whole chapters which are completely useless for the storyline (e.g., whole trip to Hogwarts and ZOO), and whole text is so repetitive (many scenes are described from the POV of the all-knowing external observer, then from POV of one of the actors, and then even sometimes one of the characters present describes the scene to some others) that even author is many times lost in what information were already given, and for example Harry as great surprise explains her he is a Roman-Catholic like her, and there is even a priest who will marry them, although he already told her five chapters ago.

Cut, cut, cut!
