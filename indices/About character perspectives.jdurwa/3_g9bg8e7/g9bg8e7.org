nope. Sometimes it's far more effective to cut to the result. There will generally have to be some reminiscence of the events, but you can write it in a few sentences rather than a blow by blow. If you are doing stuff from just one perspective and he wasn't in the room, then you won't need to have the details in an imperfect narrative, but there will have to be some sort of â€˜what happened?!' As the reader will expect to be informed somehow, and if you are too much of a thing about not telling them, they might assume it's a big key to the plot
