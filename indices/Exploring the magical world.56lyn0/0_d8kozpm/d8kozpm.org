[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - Nailfic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friends sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[http://tinyurl.com/znwo8zx][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. Rather heavily AU. The first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. And another dead fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still very good read. And of course it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][Arinthmacer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] - This fic is based on arithmancy being method of spell creation, which is rather stupid and doesn't fit with how magic works. The beginning is also rather canon rehashy. So why I recommend it? Initial arc focus strongly on exploring Hogwarts, there is a lot of "education" added, and the writing is technically competent. (Ongoing with regular updates).

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. We visit Mahoutoukoro and Durmstrang, hear a lot about one other school and generally have a lot of wordbuilding. Ongoing, with frequent, but currently irregular updates.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][Out of the Night]] - Very AU fic about Harry hiding in Knockturn Alley. Interesting take on wizarding culture and black magic. Sadly dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3000137][On the Wings of a Phoenix]] - Very AU, Voldemort did nothing wrong fic. But it has quite a lot of worldbuilding, even though most through primitive infodumps. It reads well though.
