I haven't got the link on hand but in Third Path to the Future he uses something called that a lot. But I don't think it works as it does in Negima, he uses it to shunt a portion of his magical power into enhancing his body and while it's happening his total pool is reduced by a percentage. It's a crossover with marvel (mainly xmen) and it's over a million words atm. For stuff that might matter to you reading it though, it's got magical cores,harry/multi and a pretty OP!Harry too. I personally find it quite a fun read, but I can imagine some of that turning people off.
