Definitely agree with you here. I read it a while ago and it was definitely not worth the trouble. I mean, yeah some very small parts of it were interesting, but that was less than a tenth of the story. The rest was long-winded filler, cliched, and just kinda ridiculous. I'm from the USA and wholeheartedly agree it was the author masturbating furiously to the thoughts of an american wizard and an ass load of 'Sues.
