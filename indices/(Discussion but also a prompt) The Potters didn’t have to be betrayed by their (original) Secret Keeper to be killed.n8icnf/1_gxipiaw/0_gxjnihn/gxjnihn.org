So when the original secret keeper dies the charm ends, but it doesn't reinstate the secret from where it was erased. It just becomes a regular piece of knowledge that can be told by any person who had become aware of the secret. Perhaps there is a separate part of the charm that keeps the location hidden to those that don't know where it is, and that doesn't break when the other does.
