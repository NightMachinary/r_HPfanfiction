  Perhaps there is a separate part of the charm that keeps the location hidden to those that don't know where it is, and that doesn't break when the other does.

That's canon. Death Eaters always showed up in front of Grimauld Place while Harry was there in DH but they couldn't see it, nor could they see the trio (or Lupin) when they appeared on the front step. It only became a problem when Hermione accidentally brought Yaxley over after the MoM infiltration.
