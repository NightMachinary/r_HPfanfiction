It's implied that not even Dumbledore knew about the switch. It was only Sirius, the Potters, Peter and Bathilda. So regardless, anyone could be a suspect. Also the fact that all those who knew the secret become secret keepers once the original secret keeper dies seems like a major flaw of the charm. I liked NoahPhantom's take on it in his Albus Potter series where the secret was basically erased from existence and was buried deeply in the soul of the secret keeper. Also the secret keeper had to give it willingly. Nothing would come out of their mouth if they tried to say it under torture or trickery.
