The concept of the word "Moldyshorts" coming into existence makes me want to murder someone. Voldemort is not a school bully, he is a murdering Dark Lord with a blindly loyal army at his side, whose name /most people don't even dare to speak/.

You're gonna have to try really hard if you want to convince me a couple of teenagers would say that. Even then it's just so dumb.
