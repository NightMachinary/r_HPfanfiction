I guess there is a misunderstanding, when i said ww vet i didnt really mean the nazis , i meant their opposition as i wouldnt want to make fun about someone who made their life hell to diminish their pain ... or something like that. uggh cant keep my mind straight today. and it was an example , doesnt mean i would've done it when a good part of vets were still alive either.
