Are you serious? Don't you know how Hitler was mocked by allied propaganda and soldiers during WW2?

Google "Mocking Hitler", and look for the WW2-era stuff.

The Weasleys were both Gryffindors for Generations, and proud "Blood Traitors" for Generations. The twins making fun of Voldemort makes perfect sense.
