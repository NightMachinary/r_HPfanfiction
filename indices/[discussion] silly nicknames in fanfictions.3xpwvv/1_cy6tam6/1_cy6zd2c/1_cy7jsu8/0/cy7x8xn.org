I guess I don't get why the mocking is seen in a positive light, as it stomps on the victims feelings, at least in HP as his name was feared in a /magical/ way with the taboo and making fun of that is just way different then mocking AH. For me. I didnt say it was out of character for the twins, just insensitive regardless.
