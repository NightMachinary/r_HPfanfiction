True.

I suppose at least both of those make a certain kind of sense if you have a Sirius who is, maturity wise, stuck in his late teens or early twenties due to Azkaban putting his development on pause or even regressing it.

Not that making sense and being a good read are always the same thing. Remus of course ought to groan and smack him every time he does it too.
