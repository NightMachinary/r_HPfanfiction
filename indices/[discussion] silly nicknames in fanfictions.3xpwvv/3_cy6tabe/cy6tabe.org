Dray and Har would bother me if I ever saw it in a fic because of the reason you mentioned. They already have super short names.

Hermione at least has a long enough name that I could justify nicknaming her to shorten it.

BUT...

Am I the only one who's nicknames for their friends rarely have anything to do with their actual name?

I use something like Elisabeth -> Bub as often as I do something like Christopher -> C.
