I can deal with silliness on occasions, mostly when the fic doesn't take itself seriously.

But way too often those things are used seriously, and that sometimes makes it ... well, kind of wrong. Like “Mione”, which I can tolerate in a comedy fic but that does not change the fact that it's basically Hagrid-speak that happened because a certain other character was trying to eat and talk at the same time and it's really easy to make “Her” inaudible when you are doing that.
