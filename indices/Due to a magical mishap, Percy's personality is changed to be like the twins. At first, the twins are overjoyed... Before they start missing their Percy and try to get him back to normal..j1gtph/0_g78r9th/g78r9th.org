It started with an ad... "Personality Pens! Trick a Muggle, and watch the changes happen once they write one word! 16 Sickles apiece." Ginny was the one who ordered it, and she replaced Percy's quill with it while he was in the middle of a report.

"What the?" He cried, looking at the pen in his hand. "Where's my- I don't have time to grab another one!" With an eye roll, he touched the pen to parchment, and began furiously scribbling. Ginny watched, as her older brother suddenly through down the pen. She ducked under the table, expecting him to blow up about having to use a Muggle device. However, he merely yelled, "Hey friends and family, come see this!"

He then pointed his wand at each family member in turn, a grin on his face. The room went dark, and then the family looked at each other. They all had words on their forehead in Percy's awful handwriting. Even Percy had one, spelling "Balloon". Mrs. Weasley began to whimper, and started rubbing her forehead.

"Come on, guys. We don't have time for questions! I have so many other ideas..." With that, Percy took the stairs two at a time, leaving the rest of his family to stare after him.

"I... gave him a silly pen, to change his personality... I think it took on whoever's he's the most opposite of." She gestured to the twins, who looked at each other. "I'm really s-"

"YES!" The twins cried. "This is brilliant." They each gave Ginny a huge and bounded up the stairs.
