Over the next three days, Percy's pranks knew no limits. He made Ginny's broom turn into bats while she was flying it, leaving her to tumble through the air, before turning the bats into a net. He made his father's shoes squeak like rubber ducks every time he took a step, causing him to have to leave the Ministry early. He also turned Ron's nose into a clown's, declaring it "fit to a T".

The twins were delighted with all of this, egging him on and celebrating the "newest member of the Weasley clan". On the fourth day, however, Percy finally crossed a line. He decided to prank the Prank Gods themselves. He turned the twins' freckles blue. They merely laughed and went to charm them off. However, the second George uttered the spell, each freckle began to glow, until both twins looked like walking light shows.

"How're we supposed to go into town looking like this? It's bad enough that we have these wretched words plastered on our heads." Fred said, alarmed.

"We were going to buy more card packs from that Muggle convenience store..." George bemoaned. "Now look at us, it'd be a witchhunt."

"I think it'd be a wizard-hunt, in this case." Percy supplied cheerfully.

"While we can appreciate a fine joke, we'd appreciate it if you stopped now. We need to get going."

"Mmm..." Percy pushed his glasses higher, before declaring, "nope!" He laughed and left the room.

"Something has to be done." George said. The rest of the Weasley family held a meeting, after telling Percy they'd seen Luna out for a walk. They hoped for her sanity that she wasn't... Then again, Luna would probably be delighted if he charmed a perpetual storm, or whatever it was that he had planned.

"I've torn the box apart! There's no instructions for how to fix it, none!" Ginny exclaimed. "I've owled the Prophet to find out who ran the ad, but..."

Her father pinched the bridge of his nose, just under where the words "Wires" was in messy handwriting on his forehead. "Maybe..." he started hesitantly. Just then, however, Percy ran in the room, slamming a box down on the table. The family froze as the plain box stood out like a sore thumb, monochrome except for the green print spelling "Personality Pen".

Everyone started talking at once, as Percy grew more and more red by the second. Then he burst out laughing, causing them all to cease and glance fearfully at him.
