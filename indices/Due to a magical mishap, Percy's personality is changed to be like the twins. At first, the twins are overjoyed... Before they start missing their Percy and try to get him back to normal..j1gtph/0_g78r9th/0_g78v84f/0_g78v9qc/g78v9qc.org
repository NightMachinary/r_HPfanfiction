"I... it was me!" He cried through fits of giggles, clutching his side.

"Uh... Perce? I ordered it, from an ad... I'm really so-" Ginny tried, but Percy held up both hands, his face screwed up with silent laughter.

"Okay. Okay. Okay. So... I placed the ad." Everyone stared at him in turn. "I placed the ad," he repeated, "because I figured one of you would order it."

"You... wanted to have your personality changed? And is it... fixed?" Ron questioned.

"No... I-" Percy sighed, before straightening up, suddenly becoming the usual Percy. "I made the ad, bought the pen from the Muggle convenience store, and packaged it differently. I just..." Percy looked almost sad now, and he slumped a little. "I just wanted you to see that I can have fun too."

"You... that was all... you, Perce?" George asked wonderingly.

"The bats, the shoes, Ronniekins' nose?" Fred pointed at himself. "These lights?"

Percy sighed. "Yes, I just thought-" He was interrupted by a giant hug from his brothers. Percy wiggled out of it and waved his wand, undoing the changes he had made to his family's appearances. "I'm sorry to you all. I'll just go back too... studying, I guess." He turned to leave, but was stopped by a hand on his shoulder.

Fred spun him around, and placed both of his hands on Percy's shoulder. "It doesn't have to be... one or the other. You can mess around and still focus on school." Fred said, as serious as anyone had heard him be.

"Yeah!" George piped in. "We might be goofballs, but we do have plans and practical uses. Once school starts up again, maybe you can help us, and we can help you!" The twins beamed at Percy, who's eyes looked rather watery. "I'd... yeah, that'd be..." He was spared the awkwardness by their mother bearing down upon them, swooping them up in a hug, crying.

"Oh, I'm so proud of you..." She kept on muttering while Ginny and Ron slowly crept away, and Mr. Weasley looked on with a slight smile.
