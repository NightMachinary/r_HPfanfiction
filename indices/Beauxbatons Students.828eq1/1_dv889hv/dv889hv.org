Why would they go to Diagon Alley? France is a huge country and I'm sure they have their own wizarding centers of culture and commerce. Paris, Lyon, Calais, Marseilles, Avingnon--so many different places to choose from and each with their own mini-culture within the greater French culture. The glass pyramid entrance to the Louvre could be a gateway into the trendiest wizarding shopping area in Paris. The catacombs underneath the city could be akin to Knockturn Alley.

Britain is not the epicenter of the wizarding world--get out there and explore!
