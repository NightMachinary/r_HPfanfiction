"Time is a Flat Circle of Life"

Kids go back in time, meddle in the lives of their parents to ensure they get together, so the kids can be born. This ensures they exist to come back in time and make it so their parents get together. Loop-de-loop.

Time is a flat circle, feeding into itself. The circle of life. Yada yada.

Maybe even drop the "Flat" part from the title, if it's too wordy. Idk. Your story sorta sounds like Back to the Future meets Parent Trap, so there might be ideas there, for names or plots.

Those were my quick thoughts. Good luck with the fic.
