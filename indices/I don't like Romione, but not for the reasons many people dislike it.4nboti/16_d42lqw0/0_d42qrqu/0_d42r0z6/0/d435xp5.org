While I agree that it's not representative of how Ron would be later in life, it's also the only information we have to go on. Most characters will be completely different after a decade of being out of school and the end of a brutal civil war that involves child soldiers, but there's no newer information (other than the epilogue, which is sparse, and Pottermore/interviews, which not everyone considers canon) that we as readers or fanfiction writers can use to update them.

That's not to say that OP is right, just that the counterargument "people will grow over time and won't necessarily be the same in a decade, and we don't know a lot of specifics about how they'll change" is a fully general argument that could apply to almost any pairing set around the epilogue time.
