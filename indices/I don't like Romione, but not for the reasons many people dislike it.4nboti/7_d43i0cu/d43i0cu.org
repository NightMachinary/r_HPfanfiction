I don't really have a problem with R/Hr anymore, but I think for a while I did because the terribleness of HBP and DH tarred it by association in my mind. As is, I firmly hold that JKR is a godawful romance writer, and she'd honestly write better if she didn't try to push canonical ships for her stories.

19 years later... why is everyone still hooked up with their first crushes? No, really, is Wizarding Europe so small and incestuous that everyone married a character already present in the series? Anyway, the increasingly poor writing quality, culminating in the 'smiles and rainbows but things are still terrible' epilogue, tends to rub off on the canon ships, which I think can be a strong factor in disliking them.
