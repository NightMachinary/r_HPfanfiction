Eh, iirc, the thing with Luna was from a web interview with Rowling, so it's value is... questionable at best. If she didn't publish it, why should it carry any more weight than someone's fanfic of the same? If she told us that Harry and Hermione cheated with one another after the epilogue, would that then be canon? She wouldn't (probably - anything for money, after all), but still, I think Death of the Author applies, particularly to the constant stream of pronouncements JKR has made in interviews and other places. Pronouncements that are, quite often, not at all supported by what she actually wrote, because I suspect that she rarely, if ever, re-reads her own work.

Honestly, her last two books are her writing style, just exaggerated. Her style worked better for short, episodic pieces full of whimsy, but by the time OotP came out, she was trying for a coherent canon that stretched between doorstopper-sized books. Add to that the fact that Rowling wasn't exactly Shakespeare at the best of times, and you end up with these weird, padded, often contradictory tomes. Not that HP was ever very consistent in its plot points, but that didn't matter as much earlier on, because they weren't trying to be Young Adult fiction at the time.

TL;DR "yes, I may have soured on canon a little, why do you ask?"
