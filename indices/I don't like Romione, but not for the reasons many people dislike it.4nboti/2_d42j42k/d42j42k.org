I can see Ron and Hermione struggling. The thing is, I've seen people flip how they are between the world in general and their family/loved ones. Rough kick ass construction foreman that's soft as butter with his kids.

I can see Harry and Hermione making a go of it if they felt that way towards one another. In canon, there might have been a few sparks but there wasn't a fire. Shame, really, I'd have prefered the plain smart girl getting the hero.
