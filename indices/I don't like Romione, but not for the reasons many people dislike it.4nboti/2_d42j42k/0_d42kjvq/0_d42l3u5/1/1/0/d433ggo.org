Is this in response to me saying he didn't think of her as a date for the yule ball, or that he didn't think of her as a girl until 6th year?

He was 14, she was 13. That's... not pedophilia if a 14 year old boy is attracted to a 13 year old girl. It's what's considered normal. Neville, at least, saw her as dating potential during that time. Harry barely thought of her for 5 books, let alone when thinking about girls to ask for the Yule Ball. Not even a twinge of jealousy when he saw that Neville had asked her out.
