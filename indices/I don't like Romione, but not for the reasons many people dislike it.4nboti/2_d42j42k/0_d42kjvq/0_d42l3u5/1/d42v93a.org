Or, rather, she sold $1 billion worth of books despite that ship. :P

That 'ship' didn't have any canon foundation other than Ginny's hopeless crush on the BWL for 5 books. It's only with the raging monster in Harry's chest that the ship had basis. And that was one of the worst moments of the series, not because of the ensuing relationship, because of how out of the blue it was. Harry had shown no inclination that he even noticed Ginny as a girl until that point. He didn't even THINK of her as a date for the Yule Ball.

I don't mind H/G, but JKR introduced the pairing in a terrible manner. It was one of the reasons I felt HBP was the weakest of the 7 books.
