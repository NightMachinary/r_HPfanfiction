I disagree with you on the whole "came out of nowhere" argument (for reasons I've already outlined in the past), but I think that regardless of who Harry ended up with, she would still have made $1 billion dollars. Except if Harry ends up with the Giant Squid, lol.

But maybe, that would be a significant plot twist to keep people hooked on the series. :P
