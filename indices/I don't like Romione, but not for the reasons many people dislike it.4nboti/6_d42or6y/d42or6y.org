Absolutely. I am certainly not the biggest Ron fan but I can sympathize with his situation. He would do much better with a more earthy and encouraging woman. Him falling for a woman that constantly frustrates him seems to me like it is pathological: punishing himself by, trying to prove to the world that he could handle someone like her.

Ron would be much happier with someone who strives for a simple life, not Hermione who would constantly seek out new challenges. It's not like she would suddenly drop that attitude after her education.
