I dont agree with everything you said, and have long supported that view. I have never thought Hermione/Ron were all that great a fit, and thought Hermione/Harry made a much better couple. To me, Ginny/Harry always felt forced as well.

I am going to get downvoted for this because I always am, but if I was JKR, and based upon the characters personalities and how they fit into the story, I always felt it should of been Harry/Hermione, Ron/Luna, and Ginny/Neville.
