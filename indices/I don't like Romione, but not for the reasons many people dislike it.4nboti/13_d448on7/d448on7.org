I agree with you, OP!

It's one of the (MANY!) reasons why I think they'd never work out in the long run!

Ron can't take being outshone in the series (come on he's constantly jealous of Harry - even when it's things Harry would love to give up to have his parents back (his money, his fame, his role as the chosen one etc.) or that endanger Harry's life (like the Triwizard-Tournament)) and he knI agree with you, OP!

It's one of the (MANY!) reasons why I think they'd never work out in the long run!

Ron can't take being outshone in the series (come on he's constantly jealous of Harry - even when it's things Harry would love to give up to have his parents back (his money, his fame, his role as the chosen one etc.) or that endanger Harry's life (like the Triwizard-Tournament)) and he knows (he's not stupid, just LAZY!) that he'll never be quidditch-captain or head-boy as long as his friends outshine him (I mean come on he only became a prefect because Dumbledore being Dumbledore didn't want to "burden" Harry with the role and because the other male Gryffindors aren't in the picture that much - neither academically, nor in sports and neither did they play a part in Harry's adventures (even if he only played a minor role in most of Harry's adventures...except for that chess-game in first year!)). The sad thing is: He's not willing (or able?) to put in the work to show the world that there's more to him than just an oaf (sorry, but I don't like him much) who's friends with the boy-who-lifed and who can shovel food into his mouth faster than most other people!...as far as I remember he always feels like he's the runt of the litter (Charly was quidditch-captain, Bill was head-boy, Percy is a prefect, the twins have their pranks to boast about and Ginny is a girl and Molly's darling (in a way I pity Ron as he was nothing special in a family that while poor produced some outstanding people!)), so I agree that he'd need a supportive girlfriend/wife (not someone who'd belittle him or just tell him to “grow a pair” when he's feeling down because of his own insecurities or who'd fight with him over every little thing!) with a similar background as him (that's another thing why I think they aren't compatible: Their backgrounds and believes -- Ron thinks it's ok to use magic to get a driving license, he also doesn't have a problem with “slavery” (as Hermione puts it) of houselfs, while Hermione hates it and sometimes even seems to think that wizards are kind of backwards and barbaric (and IMHO she's not wrong -- except maybe the houselfs...they like serving and a whole race having Stockholm-Syndrome? I don't think so!))

There's more reasons, but I'll leave it at that and I agree that Harry and Hermione might make a better pair (if he wises up a little so that he doesn't become whipped as I agree that Hermione is quite dominant/independent and I think she needs a similar partner, one that can stand up to her and will not be lead around by her like a puppy on a leash!)... ows (he's not stupid, just LAZY!) that he'll never be quidditch-captain or head-boy as long as his friends outshine him (I mean come on he only became a prefect because Dumbledore being Dumbledore didn't want to "burden" Harry with the role and because the other male Gryffindors aren't in the picture that much - neither academically, nor in sports and neither did they play a part in Harry's adventures (even if he only played a minor role in most of Harry's adventures...except for that chess-game in first year!))

Then there's the fact that he and Hermione (who he even mocks for being academically inclined in first year which nearly leads to her being injured or killed by the damned troll!) constantly fight and his believes are completely different from her's (she sees the wizard world as backwards and even barbaric (slavery!), while it's ok for him as he grew up knowing about houselfs!)
