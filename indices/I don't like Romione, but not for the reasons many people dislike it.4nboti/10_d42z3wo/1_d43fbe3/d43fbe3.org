From what I remember (I may be wrong), Harry only reacted badly to Hermione's nagging in 5th/6th year - in 5th year he was being subjected to mind attacks by Voldemort (and was pretty much reacting badly to everyone), and in 6th year, well - Occlumency lessons with Snape (forgive my spelling if it is wrong), Horcruxes, grief over Sirius's death, etc. - It was a very trying and stressful time period. I honestly don't think Harry saw Hermione as a figure of authority - she was bossy and overbearing sometimes, yes, but that was her way of caring for both Ron and Harry.
