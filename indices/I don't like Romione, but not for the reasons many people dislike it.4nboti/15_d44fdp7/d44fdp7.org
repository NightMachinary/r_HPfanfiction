Ron goes off to be an Auror. Hermione is more tending toward a research position, I imagine. Separate domains, so Hermione won't overshadow him. That would also reduce the friction between them -- Hermione won't be upset at Ron for not meeting her standards when her standards don't apply to his work.

That's if Ron reasonably wants to feel like he can contribute to conversations about his core skillset. If he specifically wants to be superior to his spouse at their core skillset, well, that's pretty pathetic, and he's probably better off not marrying.
