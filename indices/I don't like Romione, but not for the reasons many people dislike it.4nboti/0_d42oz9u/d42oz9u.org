I don't really like Ron and Hermione as a couple based off the Canon epilogue, but I do see Ron basically helping his mother pick up the pieces after Fred died. I think that's one reason he goes into business with George. I think that Ron eventually accepts a role that's more family based than fame based. That's really the only way I can see them working out- Hermione as the go getter in Magical Law Enforcement and Ron as the family man who's always there for his mother and brother.

I think that Ron has to do a lot of growing to get to that point, but I think that the last book is that turning point. Ron sees the true pain and suffering born of fame, and part of me thinks that he realizes that it's not about seeking external validation but in valuing himself.

Honestly, Ron is a big sidekick. He doesn't really come up with many ideas on his own, but he is fiercely loyal and will follow someone he cares about to the ends of the earth.

I think that a lot of people feel they need to bash Ron and treat him like a dumb frat boy, when really, he's more complicated than that.
