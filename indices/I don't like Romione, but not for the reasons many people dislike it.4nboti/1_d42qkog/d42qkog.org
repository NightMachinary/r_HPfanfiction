  Ron was a bit of an underachiever who wanted to be recognized for his skills instead of being overshadowed.

For most of the series, this holds true. But Ron has arguably the greatest character moment of any character in the series in DH.

  /"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . ."/

Lord Voldemort twists facts to serve his purpose, and as with the greatest of lies, they always have a hint of truth in them.

  /"Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?"/

Ron's insecurities were born out of him being unsure of having a place in the world, a place along side his more superficially talented friends. Those insecurities got the better of Ron in a moment of weakness; later Ron faces those insecurities and comes out on top. It is very, very significant that Ron literally takes the sword to the horcrux and stabs through it, the horcrux which is a physical manifestation of all of Ron Weasley's greatest fears.

  "After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, "she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone..."

After Ron destroys the horcrux, Harry tells Ron that both he and Hermione were miserable without him. It isn't the most glamorous acknowledgement or reassurance, but it is validation of Ron's place in the world, and it fits him perfectly.

  "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you."

  He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. *Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.*

Incalculable power, indeed. It is one of the most important themes of the books, that the perfectly ordinary can turn out to be much more. Lily Potter's perfectly ordinary love overcomes all the skill and power of Lord Voldemort. More than Harry, Ron is the character who exemplifies this quality. Ron doesn't have extraordinary talent or skill or ambition or dedication, he doesn't have Lily's blood protection or a prophecy or a super-significant wand. Yet he is very much an integral part of the trio; he is the heart to Hermione's brain and Harry's hands. His character arc isn't about beating a Dark Lord, isn't about changing society; it is about making mistakes, growing up and facing his fears.

Ron Weasley might be completely ordinary, but perhaps that makes him the most extraordinary of them all.

(But, before I went on a tangent, I think Ron has overcome his fear of being overshadowed. I am not strongly pro- or anti- Ron/Hermione. I do find Hermione more enjoyable with Ron than anyone else, but that is due to me finding Ron more enjoyable than anyone else. I just don't think 'fear of being overshadowed' fits post-DH Ron as a character.)
