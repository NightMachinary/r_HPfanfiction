Preach it. This is part of what makes the canon pairings so unbelievable for me, because it's yet another little thing that implies that the Wizarding World really is as small as previously described. Like... 30k magicals in the entirety of the UK small. Incestuously small. Too small for widespread governmental representation, fucking /small/. It's part of a consistent problem of scale in the books, really.
