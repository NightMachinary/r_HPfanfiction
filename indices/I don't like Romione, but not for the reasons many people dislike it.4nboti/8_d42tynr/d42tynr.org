It's a plausible read of the pair. One way I've seen it brought up and addressed in fanfic is to have each of them succeeding in different spheres. Hermione pursues political office or research or something, while Ron starts taking on a leadership role at WWW, diversifies the business, and becomes a successful entrepreneur. The potential for synergy is there too, with Ron finding satisfaction in funding Hermione's work and getting to enjoy the security and largess he never had as a kid.
