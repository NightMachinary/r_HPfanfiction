If you don't mind Methods of Rationality, it has an alternate/spin-off where the Statute of Secrecy breaks down and war ensues, linkffn(Following the Phoenix). But you really need to be familiar with MoR first, which... Some love it, some hate it. It's complex, funny, long, and complete, but Harry is a very different person (for a mixture of in-story reasons) and really rubs a lot of people the wrong way. (Most people agree that the antagonist is excellent, though.)
