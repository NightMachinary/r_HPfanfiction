Well, I usually recommend the expanded/alternate introduction, which is only four chapters. That's probably enough to judge whether you'll like the whole thing. linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

Pros:

- Complete
- Funny
- Thought-provoking
- Very few typos
- Intelligent protagonist and antagonist
- Mistakes have consequences
- Whenever you see people debate it, which keeps happening, you'll know your own opinion.

Cons:

- Harry is arrogant and condescending to people he doesn't respect (which is most people).
- Several passages are basically author tracts; your mileage may vary depending on whether you find the subject matter interesting.
- Pacing can sometimes be off, better suited to the original serial release than to a complete book.

  "I am not sure there has ever been a time in the whole history of this school when things have become so, so... I don't have a word for this, Harry, because things have never become like this before, and so no one has ever needed to invent a word for it."

  Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply complimented he felt, if he hadn't been snerkling too hard to speak.
