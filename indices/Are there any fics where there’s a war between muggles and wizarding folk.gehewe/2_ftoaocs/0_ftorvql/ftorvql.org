Thanks for the rec! Yeah I've heard how polarizing MoR is and that's what made me hesitant on reading it and I still have not read it. Somehow you mentioning the antagonist is great now has my curiosity piqued (I love a good villain) I'll definitely read it but I don't know when, my fanfic queue seems to be never ending lmaoo
