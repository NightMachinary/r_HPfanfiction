Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

The world is shocked when the wizarding world is forced to reveal itself. Then chaos ensues. NASA experiments with a Portkey Drive to Mars. The DeLorean corporation somehow gets a supply of time turners. Extremist Christians from the Bible Belt and Al-Qaida Islamists finally agree on something: Death to wizards! Oh, and Voldemort gets his hands on nuclear weapons after taking over North Korea. Not halfway in there are missiles being launched and cities being turned into smoldering craters all over the place.
