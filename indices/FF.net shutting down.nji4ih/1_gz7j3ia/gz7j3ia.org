I use Calibre and FanFicFare to download multiple stories at once, you just need to input the url.

I wouldn't worry about ffn shutting down in the near future, they just finished a server migration. Eventually it will go down, but I don't see that happening for another few years at least.

Oh the other hand, it never hurts to have your favorite fics downloaded, you never know if the author might decide to take them down.
