AO3 isn't all better. They both have their strong points. For example, FFN has private messages, the ability to distinguish Favorites from Follows, and predictable URLs (so you can jump to a different chapter, or to the reviews, by editing the URL). AO3's comments, on the other hand, work better for having an actual conversation, and they allow markup.

From what I understand, though, AO3 treats its community better. The deletion of Nightmares of Futures Past, with no consultation and ignoring all attempts by the author to contact them, probably wouldn't have happened on AO3.
