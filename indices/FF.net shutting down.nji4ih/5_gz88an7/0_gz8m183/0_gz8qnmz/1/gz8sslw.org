Ao3.... they've got better filters than ff dot net by a coutry mile and they somehow still suck even more donkey balls than ff dot net's. And even if they didn't, the great majority of the writers there simply don't care enough to label their stuff properly anyway.

Finding a decent story there, for me at least, practically requires you to wade into a sea of unnecessary angst, because every other story there seems to find great joy in illustrating how horrific life really would be in fantasy land, daddy issues, gender issues and incredibly huge amounts of slash first.

And like I said, practically no one there label's their stuff properly, so the filters do jack squat.
