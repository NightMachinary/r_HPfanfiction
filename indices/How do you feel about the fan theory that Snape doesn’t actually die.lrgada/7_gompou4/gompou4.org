I'm kind of baffled by this idea that canon is absolute. In my experience as a long-time reader, creative fannish minds can always find an alternate view of even the most seemingly unarguable canon events, especially in HP! There are canon-consistent ways Snape could have lived, especially with magic.

For example... I read a story, can't remember it now but I might be able to find it, in which Snape actually had taken a variation of Draught of Living Death. In the story, Draco eventually figured it out, and dug him up from his grave and revived him during eighth year, months after he had been buried (as I recall, he was angry about this as he hadn't wanted to survive - and I think he might have ended up dying later in the story anyway).
