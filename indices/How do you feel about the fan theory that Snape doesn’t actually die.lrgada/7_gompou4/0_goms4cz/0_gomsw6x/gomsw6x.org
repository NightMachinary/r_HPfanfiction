He didn't die, he just appeared to be dead. Draught of Living Death sends the taker into a death-like state of suspended animation, like being cryogenically frozen maybe. So all systems stop. No bleeding, the venom doesn't circulate, etc. He'd have to be healed after he was revived (with Wiggenweld potion, the antidote to DLD), but meanwhile he was alive but appeared dead in all ways.

ETA: just so it's clear, this was what happened (if I remember right) in the story I described in my original comment, a story I did not write. But it is true that for me one of the greatest pleasures of fanfictuon is reading all the different ways creative fans can interpret canon or make it come out the way they want it to - there are a million different Harrys and Snapes, alive or not, all existing at once, and I can choose the one I want at any moment.
