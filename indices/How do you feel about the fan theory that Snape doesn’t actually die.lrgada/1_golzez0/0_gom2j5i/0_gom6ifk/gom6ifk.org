I mean that it is clear from the text that he died, leaving no room for interpretation. If there was any ambiguity the author would have written that. Anyone who genuinely reads that and thinks that he is written as potentially still living needs some reading comprehension lessons.

You /could/ write in some additional plot if you were creating an AU where he lives, but that makes it fan fiction not fan theory.
