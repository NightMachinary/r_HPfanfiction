I think he died. In my mind he's a man that really has nothing to live for. I think he personally played both sides to save himself. He hoped to save Lilly's life to have either the hope she forgives him or to be with him. Harry is in his mind a combination of his failure to save Lilly and his torment by James Potter.(also the man he lost Lilly to) I don't see him planning a huge scheme especially with Dumbledore and Voldemorts planed death.
