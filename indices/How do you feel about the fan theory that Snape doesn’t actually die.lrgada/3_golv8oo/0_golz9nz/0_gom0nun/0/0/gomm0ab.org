He was only a spy because Dumbledore vouched for him during the Kankarof trial. From that point on he didn't seem happy or even nice to his students. From a public perspective he was the man who killed Dumbledore. Even to the order members he was a traitor. The only person who can confirm that Snape's memories are legit was killed by Snape a year before. It was proven in regular cannon that memories can be altered. Would Harry know if it was a legit memory?
