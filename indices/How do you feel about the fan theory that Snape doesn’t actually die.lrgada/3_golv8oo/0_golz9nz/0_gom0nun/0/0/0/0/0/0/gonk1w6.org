He controlled the narrative. Harry blindingly followed Dumbledores orders to the letter. Harry never asked what the suspected Horacruxs are. Harry was prone to get angry easy and then shurg things off. He was able Draco after nearly killing 2 of his friends. (Katie and Ron) he also let Draco slide after letting DEs in the castile. Snape could have taken a gamble that he could be seen as doing the right thing should Harry win. In the short term people would listen to harry again. Would anyone on his side question him or at least publicly state that the memories are fake?

Assuming he did fake his death why hide then? Kankoraf (spelling is wrong) didn't hide and lasted a long time with Death eaters free.
