Ok, listen up. He's horribly poisonned, a poison which took Mr. Weasley weeks to cure. He got bit in the neck, two huge holes from which blood came out like a fucking faucet. Harry spent more than 5 minutes between the moment he closed his eyes and the moment he left the shack, because of Voldemort's speech.

Discarding the speech, let's say at minimum it took 2 minutes, okay? Snape would need to somehow do in less than 3 minutes what took more than 300 hours of work from professional healers. Even if he had an antivenom, even if he had magical bandages, he'd be dead because he lost to much blood already. Even then, IF and that's a big if, IF he survived the blood loss he'd have to dodge, in his weakened state, both armies, until he somehow got away.

I'm gonna be real with you fam, he's dead as fuck.
