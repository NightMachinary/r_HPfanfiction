Quite plausible. After all, up on the Astronomy Tower Dumbledore offered to fake Draco's death (implied in British version, stated outright in the American version), so faking death is a canonical possibility.

And really, you think Snape wasn't prepared to be bitten by Voldemort's honking huge snake, when he'd often seen it used as a weapon.

As for "in canon he's definitely dead," pshaw. Three stressed teenagers saw him PASS OUT from blood loss and assumed he was dead.

...and then they ran off to do their thing and left him there. Nobody even checked his pulse or to see if he was still breathing. But then, none of them have even a smidge of first-aid training.

Now, to be fair, passed out from blood loss means he needs external help at this stage. Hello, house elves? He's still headmaster, after all, so the castle's elves should still be tied to him.
