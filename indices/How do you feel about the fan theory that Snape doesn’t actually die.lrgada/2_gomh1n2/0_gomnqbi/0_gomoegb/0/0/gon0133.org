So, he's passed out and bleeding so heavily from a neck wound that he was described by Harry as looking like he "had no blood left in him." The trio then hang around long enough to hear Voldemort's speech about gathering their dead and speaking directly to Harry before they decide to leave.

So he would have had to not bleed out during that speech, then somehow wake up from being passed out, treat his neck wound while being incredibly weak and then also take anti-venon.

Let's be real. He's dead. In 0 circumstances does he survive.
