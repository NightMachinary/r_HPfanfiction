Linkao3(3390668) has an arrogant Harry Potter, though he's not the protagonist (a time/dimension traveling Harry from the end of the war is). Linkffn(11191235) has an arrogant BWL raised by the Potters but is a Wrong BWL story, as Harry Potter (presumably the real BWL? Story still hasn't made that clear actually) is abandoned at the Dursleys.

If you're looking for a story where Harry is both the protagonist and arrogant like Malfoy in canon, I'm not sure that's possible. Malfoy in canon was a cardboard cutout of a villain and that character doesn't slide into the hero role very easily :\
