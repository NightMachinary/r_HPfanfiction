In linkffn(7613196) Voldemort is a politician instead of a terrorist. I don't know if I would say he isn't /evil/ or an asshole, but he isn't a murdering asshole at least. The point where canon diverges is where he kills Myrtle, actually, but regrets it.

It's also REALLY long and has great writing and characterization, IMO. Riddle (as he's known there) doesn't start physically showing up in the series until the second book, though there is a small appearance right at the epilogue of the first book.
