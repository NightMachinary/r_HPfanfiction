In Rogue's Bet, he was given the Defense Against the Dark Arts position when he first applied, and is still teaching by 1997 when the story begins. He's generally viewed as a good teacher, but his methods are comparable to Moody's; not afraid to dive into the nitty-gritty of dark magic. I think the worldbuilding of this fic is really interesting, including how Harry still got orphaned by dark wizards (not saying more because of mild spoilers).
