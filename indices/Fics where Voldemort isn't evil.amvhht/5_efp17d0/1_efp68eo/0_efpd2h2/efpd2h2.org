Before I read the fic I was confused by that pairing tag as well, but it makes sense in context. There is no smut, and the two relationships don't happen at the same time; in fact they are separated by many years. The plot is mostly focused on other things. Basically, Tom develops unrequited feelings for Harry during their years at Hogwarts, but they never get together. Years later Tom meets Lilly Evans and falls in love with her, though he has no idea of her relation to Harry.
