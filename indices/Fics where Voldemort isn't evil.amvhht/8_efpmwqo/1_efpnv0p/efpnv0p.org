Thanks for these recs. "The Well Groomed Mind" is one of my favorite fics because of the excellent world building, but I wish that the author had written it without such blatant Dumbledore bashing. Dumbledore would be a more compelling antagonist if he weren't so transparently evil that the Order members look like idiots for not noticing.
