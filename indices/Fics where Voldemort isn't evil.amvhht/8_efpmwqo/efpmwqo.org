[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-wicked-warthings-harry-potter-rwby.614516/reader][What Wicked Warthings]] has Tom be Chief Warlock as well as Harry's mentor. It's a HP/RWBY which only uses the setting details of RWBY, such as Grimm and trick wepoans, without the actual characters of RWBY. Summary: "Magic is a curious thing, capable of creating beings that are the embodiment of human emotion; the Boggarts who are Fear, the Dementors who are Despair...and the Grimm, shadowy creatures who feed on pandemonium and Turn those they kill. The Grindelwald Plan has spared us from annihilation, but this war will only end in one of two ways and I'm not one for dying." -Tom Marvolo Riddle

Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin by Zennith6) has Grindelwald be tho one who killed Harry's parents with Tom being the defense teacher and Harry's mentor.

Linkffn(On the Wings of a Phoenix by makoyi; The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) have Dumbledore be the true villian of the series with the Death Eaters being considered the good guys. I usually can't stand that premise but these fics are at least written well enough to make up for it.
