Harry rarely takes the position of Chief Warlock in fics. I know only two:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): As a result, he no longer takes part in frontline operations except some defensive actions early on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): He rules their fledgling colony with an iron fist, especially so after his faction squashes their enemies middle of the story.
