Linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin)

This is a post-war canon divergence story. Harry is asked to swear in the new democratically elected Wizengamot and preside over its first session where they would be electing the new Chief Warlock. The session devolves into shouting and screaming and fisticuffs before Harry steps in and gets them to stop. Augusta Longbottom immediately nominates Harry as the new Chief Warlock and everyone else agrees, with Kingsley convincing Harry to take the job.
