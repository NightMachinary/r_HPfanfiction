I think my biggest problem with Harry/Hermione is I ended up reading so many fics where it was just super feel good heroes are the best no flaws whatsoever with incompetent enemies but no they actually are super scary and bad.

Honestly it happened with pretty much every pairing where the bad stories outweighed the good to the point I started disliking the pairings except Harry/Katie due to the lack of fics with them in it.
