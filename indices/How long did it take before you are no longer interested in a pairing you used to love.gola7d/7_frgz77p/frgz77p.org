I used to love Hermione/Snape fics when I was in high school and college, but now that I am an adult and have children, I can't read them anymore. Too much an abuse of power and dubious consent. Same goes for any adult/teen relationship. The only time I'm ok with it now is if it's a 10 year later kind of thing and they meet again as adults.
