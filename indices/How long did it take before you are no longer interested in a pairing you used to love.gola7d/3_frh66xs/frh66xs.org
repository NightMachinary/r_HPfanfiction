There was a time where I really liked Harry/Daphne, but I got sick of them after some time because I have always read the same kind of romance.

I wont go into detail because most can probably think of at least 10 similarities every story with such a pairing share.\\
(Ice Queen Persona, Pureblood-Girl-Problems, marriage contracts, I-want-to-become-a-strong-and-independent-woman, falls in love with Harry on the first sight because he is /interesting/, etc.)\\
Its always kinda the same stuff. Rarely I am confronted with something new.
