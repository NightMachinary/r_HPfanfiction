I don't know how long it took because I didn't notice when it happened. It was a gradual thing... At first I binged on the pairing, but then it tapered off. At first it was "that summary doesn't sound interesting." Then I decided I "wanted to read something different." Then I just "didn't feel like" reading that pairing. Now I find I have no interest in the pairing at all, to the point that if it's a side pairing in a story I'm reading, I skip over any scenes they have together.

ETA: the pairing in question is Wolfstar.
