Remus/Tonks were my first OTP and really the OTP I have to credit for the start of what would be my fanfic obsession. I truthfully couldn't find any new things with them outside stories that tracked their relationship within canon. Which is understandable. It's a little harder to go outside the box with them, especially since they didn't get a lot of time as a couple in the books and/or movies. So that might've been a few months?

I used to also like the other canon pairings that showed up in the Remus/Tonks stories but also stopped reading when I realized I didn't like the canon pairings. That was probably around when Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out. I wasn't happy with the epilogue.

Nowadays, for the most part, the pair doesn't matter as much as the story. I'll give anything a try as long as it's not the canon pairings and the story is interesting.
