I'm not sure there are any pairings that I used to love that I won't still read. I think the only ones I no longer seek out are the canon pairings that initially started reading with. But I'm not nearly as focused on any one pairing anymore, I'm willing to read most things if it interests me. But I'm still more likely to want to read something that has one of the (many) pairings that I like instead of a pairing that I don't generally seek out. (Except for rare pairs, because those are often so incredibly different that they are fascinating in and of themselves and how an author can get them to work).
