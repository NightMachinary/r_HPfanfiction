I went through a lot of ships when I first started reading HP fanfiction, usually once I read most of the fics from a popular ship I moved on tired of it. Until I decided to check out Harry/Voldemort, it's my OTP for over 7 years now and I don't think it's ever going to change. I only lose interest in the fandom itself from time to time.
