For me the process is like this -- when I just enter fandom I either ship no pairings or one or two that I picked up from the canon myself. Then I discover all the various pairings other people thought up and start to ship/read many, many different ones. With time a handful of favorites emerges and they stay with me for as long as I stay in fandom, some even after that.

With Harry Potter I really disliked or was not at all infested in the majority of canon pairings ever since first reading the books and this fact didn't change. I really envy your â€˜no pairing' pairing though. Bcs after favorite pairings develop, it's becomes somewhat hard for me to get into a story that ruins/contradicts them, well you catch my drift here
