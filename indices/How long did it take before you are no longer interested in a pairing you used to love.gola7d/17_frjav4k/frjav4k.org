Harryxfleur was always my favourite but 90% of them are one if two plots. Either Harry saves her at the world cup, is immune to the allure and they fall in love to tge disapproval of all his friends because they believe she is taking advantage if him OR Bill was actually under the allure the entire time, they divorce and Harry saves the day with a Holiday in France.

That little ten percent with some original thought in between is amazing though
