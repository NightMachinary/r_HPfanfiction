I stopped reading specific pairings around the same time I stopped reading bashing fics. Too often they involve the same type of combative writing style in which the author is raging against either Canon or Fanon for its crimes against their preferred ship/character/plot point.

I'm not interested in reading a story where the author tries to convince me that Harry and Hermione should have been together in canon. I'm more than happy however to read a story where the author writes in a way that Harry and Hermione should be together within the fic.

A preference in writing style rather than a preference in pairings, but I found that looking for specific pairings turned up more results of the first kind than the second. Now i just look for interesting plots with quality writing and enjoy whatever paring or lack thereof is involved.
