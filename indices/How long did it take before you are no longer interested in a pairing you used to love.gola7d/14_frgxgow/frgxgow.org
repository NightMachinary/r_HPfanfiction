I used to really like Harry/Ginny stories. Honestly, the real reason that I stopped reading them is because it just became harder and harder to find new good stories. The point where I stopped reading Hinny was when I stumbled upon Harry Potter and Future's Past by Driftwood1965, which is Harmony. I was originally a bit unnerved by the whole thing, as I was not used to thinking of Harry and Hermione as a couple, seeing as I'd always imagined them as best friends, but by the time I finished with that story, I was very interested the ship. Another big part of my change of ships was re-watching Deathly Hallows and seeing the dance scene in the tent again. I was like, whoa. That's some chemistry.
