linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) made me really interested in the NTHP ship. But after countless fics that are simply just... clich√© ("oh you're the first guy who asked for my true form!" etc), I eventually tired of it. I still theoretically like the idea of the ship, but I no longer bother with looking for any fics with the ship.
