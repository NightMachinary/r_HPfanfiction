I'm boring and like the canon pairings and have pretty much for the last decade+, though I've gone months or years at a time without reading any fanfiction.

The type of stories I like has changed though, I now prefer fics that start a good bit after the war rather than at Hogwarts or immediately post war. I find pretty much all the Hogwarts era AUs have very cringey, unrealistic dialogue. And the immediately post war fics can be very repetitive. At this point I've read some very good ones, so reading the meh ones with basically the same plot is boring. I've also recently started getting a bit more into the Marauders ear fics after having avoided them for awhile.
