[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is very similar, although it's Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville against them all.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], it's actually Harry alone, until he freed Daphne Greengrass. On the other hand, he's not necessarily losing.

The lead up to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] is like that too. But in addition, Hermione had gained huge amount of power and became just as destructive as Voldemort. Their fights reduced most of Europe, including the Muggle part, to ashes.

4 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a Hermione from another dimension is asking for help in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]. The Trio and Ginny, now very powerful, enter the breach one more time.
