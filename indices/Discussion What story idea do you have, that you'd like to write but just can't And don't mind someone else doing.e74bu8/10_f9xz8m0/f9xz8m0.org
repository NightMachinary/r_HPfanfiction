There are a few things about AU worldbuilding I'd like to throw out there before suggesting the idea:

- Fuck lordships and all that shit
- Magic protects wizards and witches from dangerous situations that are not magic-related. (e.g. accidental magic letting Neville bounce when dropped
- Muggle means aren't a danger to wizards and witches, if they get shot, their magic will protego it, they'll apparate (even if they don't know how to) out of bombs etc. IT SHOULD BE REALLY HARD TO KILL A WIZARD OR WITCH WITH NON-MAGICAL MEANS EXCEPT IDK NUCLEAR WARFARE OR SOME SHIT

  - Therefore muggles not knowing about wizards and witches is essential, bc they can only really beat them if they all get together and throw all themselves at trying to kill or subdue wizards and witches.
  - This is what the ministry's main goal is, keeping the statute of secrecy, and keeping up with muggle tech + control muggle governments to ensure no danger can happen.

- Wizards and witches basic needs are easily met with magic if they are capable wizards and witches. They can build houses, grow food with a flick of a wand, get water, etc. If it's not a magical resource (e.g. dragonhide) they can easily use magic to get it.

  - Therefore, education is essential, hence Hogwarts.

    - Speaking of Hogwarts, I find it ridiculous that half the subjects are useless and that there are so many branches of magic or whatnot that should be taught but aren't. I think it would be nice if there were more branches to learn or if they also learnt something like Core Magical Theory, Magical Automation, Rituals, Runes, Wards, etc. It should be more than just Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology. Also fuck Divination or it should be something useful like how to find things using magical detections and senses.

- Wizards and Witches have gender equality. Since they have magic to do house chores and child rearing easily, they do not need patriarchal structures. They essentially had the Washing machine revolution from the get-go in magic.
- Wizards and Witches in legends are often also portrayed as sexual deviants, devil worshippers etc. While I wouldn't think they would be devil worshippers, I do think they would be much more progressive and open than muggles. Think about it, their history wasn't affected by religious puritans neither were they encumbered by religion, why do religion when you can do magic? We also know a lot of older cultures were also much more open sexually, and okay with nudity

  - I would say they're much more comfy with nudity even around the other gender and sexuality etc. They can use magic to overcome difficulties with homosexual reproduction too

- Muggleborns come from more conservative cultures and are weirded out in Hogwarts by the mixed gender dorms, shared showers, the lack of discomfort of pureblood fellow students with sex and relations

THE IDEA FOR FANFIC : A fanfic from Hermoine's perspective. She discovers she's a witch and she loves magic and reads up all about it. However, even though her parents are muggle liberals, she's shocked at a lot of things about wizard/witch culture and she wants to fit in but tries to overcome all the stuff she grew up with while learning all the beautiful stuff about magic she can.

This was written extremely hazily and roughly. There's so much more I wanna write out, but you get the idea.
