I've had a couple of these:

1. /The actual spell for making someone eat/vomit slugs is "Slugulus Eructo". So how did Ronald Weasely, a second year student, manage to cast it with an English incantation using a shoddy, broken wand?/

The final battle would involve Harry introducing Ronald Bilius Weasely to Voldemort as "my right *hand* man" thus fulfilling the letter of the prophecy if (not the spirit). Ronald would then proceed to literally eradicate Voldemort with his insane level of control over magic.

2. Have you noticed that you can be happy/excited and afraid at the same time (like asking out your crush on a date) but it's hard to be ANGRY and afraid at the same time because anger washes out the fear? So what would happen if you focused on your most angry thoughts and cast a patronus charm at a dementor?

3. Harry chooses Ancient Runes as a subject and discovers that instead of weird norse/aztec/egyptian runes, you can make perfectly good runes using the English alphabet, as long as you write in cursive. Hermione isn't amused when Harry's runework begins to outshine her.

4. A [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsf38NYzo5Q][point-defense system]] developed to counter the killing curse by flinging small physical objects at it. Now that I think about it, an actual Phalanx CIWS (miniaturized, massive featherweight charms, some way to operate in magical areas, portable power source) would be the perfect thing for that.
