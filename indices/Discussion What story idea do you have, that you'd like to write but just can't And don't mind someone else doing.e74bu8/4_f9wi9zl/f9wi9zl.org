sane Tom Riddle leads a radical political movement against Dumbledore, pushing for better Muggle-born integration while also trying to reinstate many of the old wizarding traditions that have fallen by the wayside. his argument is that Dumbledore's basically had control of magical Britain for thirty years (I plan for this to take place during the 1970s) and his reign has led to stagnation and outright suppression of magical progress, specifically with regards to older and darker magic that Dumbledore disapproves of. Tom also wants to rid the Ministry of its corruption.

basically if Voldemort from Sarcasm and Slytherin didn't make horcruxes and instead used his Slytherin characteristics for good.
