I've always thought it'd be cool if Minerva McGonagall had gone to school with Tom Riddle and was a secret Death Eater. Like she worked hard to become friends with the whole of Hogwarts staff, kept her head down for years and kept up the status quo, then as time went on she slowly began to subtly indoctrinate some students to their ways of thinking. I have several other ideas to go along with it but every time I've say down to write it it feels wrong. I'd be happy to let someone have this idea.
