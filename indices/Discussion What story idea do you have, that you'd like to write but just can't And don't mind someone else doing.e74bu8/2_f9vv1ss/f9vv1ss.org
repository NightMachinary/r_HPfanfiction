I had a couple. One is Harry Potter retold backwards. Not really my idea, just a prompt I found on DLP I think. But the focus of every book is reversed, so Deathly Hallows is book 1, Half Blood Prince is Book 2, etc. Been floating in my head for years.

Another is Lily Evans being taken as an apprentice to Tom Riddle in a AU where Hogwarts either doesn't exist or is inaccessible to Muggleborns, and Muggleborns are taken into apprenticeships by purebloods, with some being better than others. Eventually Tom goes full on rebellion and Lily has to decide if his methods are something she wants to be party to.
