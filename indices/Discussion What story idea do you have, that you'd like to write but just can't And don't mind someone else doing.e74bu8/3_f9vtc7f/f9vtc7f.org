What about if one of the twins (or both) or Neville went back in time to right before they start Hogwarts? I see a lot of time travel stories where one of the three golden trio or Sirius goes back but it's rare to find one of a different character going back. What if Remus went back or prof. Mcgonagall? I think having a more side character go back they would face different problems as they aren't one of the ones who dealt with most of the problems Harry faced.
