Is Durmstrang Russian or German/Austrian? I was never clear on that.

Japan-Korea-India, maybe. I doubt Japan and China would work together after WW2, even magically, with the way Japan invaded them. This leaving aside whatever cultural differences China might have in teaching its magic users.

Africa would probably be South Africa-Egypt-some-other-african-country. Ethiopia? Nigeria? Madagascar? I don't know. Wherever that African school is in the mountains.

For the far West, I'd go with North and South America combining in a US-Canada-Brazil group. I'm discounting Mexico because a fic I read gave me a new headcanon about Mexico being generally uninhabitable for magicals because of the Aztechs and their human sacrifice fuckery making a mess of the leylines in the area.

I doubt there would be a group from the Middle East, because I don't even want to know how Sharia law would affect magical society in places like Iraq and Iran. Maybe Israel-Turkey-Afghanistan? All of my international political/religious knowledge comes third-hand from Reddit, so I'm just making WAGs here.

Oceania might have one. Australia-Philippines-Indonesia.

EDIT: Of course, google says Egypt is under Sharia law too, and they're probably more likely to identify culturally more than geographically, so who the fuck knows with that entire region.
