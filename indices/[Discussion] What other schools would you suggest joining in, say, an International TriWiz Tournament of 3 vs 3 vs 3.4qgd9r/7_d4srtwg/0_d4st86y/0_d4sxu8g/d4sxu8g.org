I always thought it to originally be a school for people of Scania (the one place that had actually been called “Scandinavia” before 17th century), then once the trade routes became common also for the folk of Nordic regions, and later also Slavs, with Germans joining in after half of Germany had been given to the Soviet block.

Considering that we know Durmstrang Institute is Scandinavian and that the Scania region is mostly flat but does have some mountainous regions (making it rather easy to easily hide a mountainous bit), I think it a fair guess even though it is just a guess.
