  Africa would probably be South Africa-Egypt-some-other-african-country.

By region, you have sub-saharan Africa, West Africa, the Horn, and North Africa.

North Africa is more of the core Islamic World, so it would probably go together as one, and I'd nominate Cairo or Fes for schools. The Horn includes Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea; I'd nominate the province of Mogadishu for the location of the school. West Africa is big and historically pretty wealthy (there are tales of a king from West Africa, I forget the name of the empire, who took a trip to Egypt and brought so much gold to buy souvenirs that he caused a brief bout of hyperinflation). Sub-Saharan Africa is like the Kongo, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe -- I'd guess that Zimbabwe would host the school, though the Kongo is also a possibility.
