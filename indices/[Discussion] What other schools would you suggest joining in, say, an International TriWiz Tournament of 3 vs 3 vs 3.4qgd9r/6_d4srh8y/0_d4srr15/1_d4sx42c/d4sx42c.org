I think if you start with the assumption that not all young witches and wizards attend schools, it's a bit easier to accept that some places really might be devoid or nigh-devoid of schools and knowledge around those parts is simply passed from one wizard/witch to another.

That said, the only reason to make this assumption is that without it and with there only being so many magical schools the numbers don't really check up. So you can either assume that most younglings indeed are home-schooled and schools are for the elite (and/or the rich/influential/important families), or you can accept that Madame Rowling botched the numbers and make it AU with your own schools.

So the question is, do you want to go AU and want /ideas for schools/, or do you want to somehow fit it in with 9 schools even though that's almost all of them and there's no way they'd try to make it be 9 (but then again, yay for AU there too)?
