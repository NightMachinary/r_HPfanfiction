Rowlings eleven major schools aren't all idenitifed yet, and the coverage isn't evenly-distributed in the least. What we have collected from the wikia:

- Hogwarts - Scotland [English]
- Beauxbatons - southern France [French]
- Durmstrang - Sweden? Finland? (off the Baltic sea, regardless)
- Ilvermorny - Mount Greylock, western Mass, covering U.S. and Canada at least [English]
- Mahoutokoro - Iwo Jima?, Japan [Japanese]
- Castelobruxo - Brazilian Amazon [Portuguese?]
- Koldovstoretz - Russia [Russian]
- Uagadou - Uganda, though I could've sworn it was supposed to be Burkina Faso, where the city of Ouagadougou is the capital

The article on that last one starts with this most telling phrase: "Although Africa has a number of smaller wizarding schools..."

So we can skip worrying about the last, unnamed schools that supposedly cover education for all of Central and East Asia, despite the claim that Uagadou is the largest of the eleven schools.
