When were the participants chosen? What countries were powerful or notable at that time? Who was doing the choosing?

For instance, let's say the Tournament was established around 1275 in the Islamic world, and al Madrasat as Sihr Dimashq (the School of Magic of Damascus) did the choosing. They'd probably consider schools from Isfahan, Fes, Cairo, Mogadishu, and Byzantium. Possibly Harar in Ethiopia.

Further afield, they might consider India. India is big. Like you could fit the entire population of Europe in it and still have room for North America. And I don't know it well enough to say much intelligent about where you might find schools, but I can mention Sind, Vijayanagar, and Bengal as nations that existed around the right time.
