Perils of Innocence: linkffn(8429437)

Harry, Hermione and a few other future Hogwarts students grow up in the same institute. Harry's very much a good kid, and the description says it's "eventual Harry/Hermione" so no worries about slash-pairing.

The story was on hiatus for a while, but got an update back in April so I have hopes that it'll pick back up.
