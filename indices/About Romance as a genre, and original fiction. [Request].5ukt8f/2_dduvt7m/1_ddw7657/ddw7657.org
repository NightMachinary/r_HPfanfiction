Like..... as long as people like it and read it it's not unnecessary? I think super!Harry harem fics are unnecessary to ME but I respect that people read them, which makes them necessary to "fanfiction".

Also it's fanfiction. Literally diverging off canon??? Is what it is?????

Sorry your comment just really threw me off honestly. Why was this a necessary thing to say at all on this thread??? Just don't even open it if you think its not necessary?
