1) That's good for you, but I don't think you really know what good writing is.

2) You think, but you have no examples of such things, so once again, don't see what you're trying to say.

3) Examples?

4) You're straw-manning, I said that they change the characters without changing circumstance. They don't allow for any build-up, it's all instantaneous.

Why does it matter? Are you some kind of fanfiction connoisseur? Go read some original ficition.

Then you haven't read very much literature, and once again you provide anecdotal evidence. You clearly don't understand what good plot lines, character development, or writing is, if you read fanfiction based on a story that had neither of those things in itself.

How about you get a life, if you have time to read hundreds of thousands of fanfiction as you claim? Do you even work? Maybe if you went out into the real world, you would understand why none of these fics are organic.

I can comment whatever I want, wherever I want. You saying shit doesn't mean anything. I have a first amendment.

I could care less when you're going to bed.
