Where do I even start?

"General enjoyment and quality" - I just find it hilarious that you don't think those things exist in romance fics? I've read many romance based fanfictions that were better and more enjoyable (both subjective qualities, you see) than published original works that I've spent money on, so that whole argument is null right there.

I think Dramione and Drarry are actually two amazing examples of how authors use plot lines to create character development and create convincing characters? So again, not sure your point there.

I've actually read quite a few incredible Sirius/Hermione fanfics - all of which were cohesive (and creative, well done, and enjoyable, so...)

"Taking something and changing the circumstances" is by definition divergent of canon. Changing the circumstances in a way that leads to two characters falling in love is just as valid as anything else.

I'm starting to think you might never have read a romance genred fanfiction before - or any fanfic in general...

"Don't have a single creative bone" oh my god this is hilarious. I've read literally millions of words of fanfic, almost all with romance as at least a primary genre. Some of the fics I've read were without a doubt some of the best pieces of literature I've read in a long time. Good plot lines, good character development, great writing. All of that takes amazing creativity.

I don't know why I'm even arguing - I'm pretty convinced you're a troll or in the complete wrong place.

You don't like romance. Great. Literally NO NEED to comment on someones post about fics/literature that heavily features it.

Jesus. I'm going to bed. Good luck with.....whatever it is you're doing here.
