No, to your first statement. The point of writing fanfiction is general enjoyment and quality. There is no purpose in it if you don't write convincing characters, at that point it's a waste of time. Super!Harry Harem fics are exceedingly rare, I see way more Dramoine or Drarry fics than Super!Harry fics in general. I won't get into the can of worms of those disgusting and hilariously outlandish pairings. Character development seems to be thrown out of the window in favour of romance in fics a lot of the time. Think about it, when have you ever read a cohesive Sirius/Hermione fic?

Fanfiction is taking something and changing the circumstances. If you're going to change the characters into something unrecognizable, why not just create a fanfiction within the Harry Potter world with Original Characters? Oh right, the people that write these fics don't have a single creative bone in their body.

I can comment whatever I want, wherever I want to.
