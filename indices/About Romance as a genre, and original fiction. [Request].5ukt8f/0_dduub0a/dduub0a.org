This is a really unique request! I agree that "romance" fics are not what I am typically drawn to in regular fiction, but I love them in fanfic - go figure.

Anyway, I think if you are into something a little plottier but with a firm romance genre, I'd recommend "The Time Travelers Wife" by Audrey Niffenegger. The book was much better than the movie (isn't it always) so don't make the mistake of reading in the wrong order.

I also really love the author Rainbow Rowell and actually she used to write Drarry fanfiction (although she won't reveal what her psued was). I've loved everything she has written, but "Fangirl" (about a college student who is REALLY into writing fanfic) and "Attachments" were my favorite. And she wrote a m/m slash fic called "Carry On" that is the last book of the fake canon that goes along with Fangirl. It is hard to explain but read Fangirl first and it will make sense.

I haven't come across much adult fiction with slash romances that I have liked, but for a teen one, I really liked "Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda" by Becky Albertalli.

And lastly, considering you're a HP fan, I think you should definitely read Ready Player One. It is sci-fi/fantasy with a really compelling romance. Hope there's something in here you'll like!
