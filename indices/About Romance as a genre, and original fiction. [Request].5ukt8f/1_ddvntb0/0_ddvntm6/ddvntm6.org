  Yang knew better than to look for love in a bar. She was neither foolish nor naive. But when a chance encounter leads to a meeting with a mysterious dancer that has her heart racing, it can be hard to resist. For Jaune, the life he wanted was that of a hero, but such a life required training and the money to pay for it. What is a man to do, but make use of the few talents he has.

  In a world where your allies can be just as dangerous as your enemies, sometimes it can be difficult for a criminal mastermind to find a little stress relief. That blonde idiot, Jaune, was just unimportant enough, just malleable enough, to be a viable option. It was meant to be a one time thing, an easy lay. Emotions were never supposed to get involved.
