Hmmm, I don't have any original fiction romances to suggest, but if you don't mind another show I can give you two.

They are both RWBY fanfics, linkffn(11655241) Stress Relief is finished and linkffn(12146135) The Entertainer updates every week on Tuesday. The Author Coeur Al'Aran is in my opinion the best RWBY author and maybe my favorite fanfiction author in general. They actual understand the traditional beats of a story, and it shows, especially in the romances.
