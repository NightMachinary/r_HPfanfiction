"This isn't about Rose, isn't it?", Ron said, immediately cutting to the essentials once the waitress left. Draco had hoped years of working in the Ministry would've brought a little tact to the red hair, but in retrospect, he knows he didn't deserve any politeness reserved for friends.

"No, it's about Astoria. She's cursed", Draco began, steeling himself, no reason to delay and no hope to soften the blow. "I've contacted everyone I know, her family has been trying since before the last war, but all we gathered is nothing a Healer won't know after the first minute of diagnosing her. It's a blood curse, and she's dying"

Ron closed his eyes and muttered something Draco is sure he can't hear correctly. After silently staring at Draco for a while, Ron folded his hands and laid back in his seat. "I know I'm not qualified about this. Your best hope will be Bill, Hermione, and if raw magic power is required, perhaps Harry too", Ron listed the names Draco dreaded after realizing his powerlessness against the curse.

"Yet you come to me, hoping I could convince them to help you", Ron shook his head. "I know you're still afraid that they hold a grudge against you, but we're not just talking about you. Victoire, James, and Rosie had said Scorpius is a good lad. Albus always raves about him. Do you think we'll let Scorpius' mother die if we can do anything to prevent that?"

Ron took out a mirror and called Harry. After a brief conversation asking Harry to come to the restaurant, Ron continued "Bill is still overseas and probably won't be back until next week, while Hermione is busy preparing her speech for today. But after you talk with Harry, you won't doubt their decision when you talk to them".

Then, as Ron channel her mother's caring spirit, asking about Astoria's condition and start suggesting the usual remedies against the pain, Draco felt a huge stone lifted from his shoulder. This is the very Weasley he looked down years ago. Yet, soon he will be helped by two Weasley, a Weasley by marriage, and an honorary Weasley. These are the people who had done the impossible, and they will succeed, he know this.
