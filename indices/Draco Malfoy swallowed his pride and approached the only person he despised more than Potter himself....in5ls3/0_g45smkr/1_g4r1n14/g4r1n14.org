“You won't believe it Draco! I'm cured-the Mediwitch could find no trace of the curse!” Astoria gushed as she rushed into their living room, tears threatening to spring from her eyes.

Draco smiled warmly however there was definite discomfort within the expression and the discomfort turned into a flicker of pain as the main shifted minutely in his seat. It seemed Astoria hadn't caught onto his difficultly in sitting as she continued to spew out names of people she wanted to tell, just as well really...

It would probably dampen her mood a bit to find the supposed cure that the Greengrass family had been searching for was for the afflicted women's significant other to partake in gay sex with a blood traitor.

The thought of said /cure/ made Draco mentally wince once more.

A blood traitor who was hung like a horse.
