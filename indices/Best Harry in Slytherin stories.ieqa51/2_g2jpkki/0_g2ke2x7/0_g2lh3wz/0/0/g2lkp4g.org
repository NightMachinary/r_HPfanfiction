Three books of 350k words each for the first years? Canon OOtP, the longest canon book, was 200k. I suppose 350k would be fine if it was content, not bloat. I read roughly until middle of year two and I can recall several occasions where one day took over a chapter without anything really happening. Like the plot isn't bad, but artificially inflating the story just makes it feel bland.
