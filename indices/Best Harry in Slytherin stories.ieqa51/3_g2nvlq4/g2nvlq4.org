It's not Harry, but linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) does an excellent job of capturing Hermione's Slytherin side. She has a mission, and she'll use whatever tools, tell whatever lies, and make whatever sacrifices are necessary to bring it about.

The summary is a bit odd and I'm still not sure what it's trying to say, but my own summary would be that when Riddle dies, reality cracks and kills everyone nearby; Hogwarts' magic is deeply displeased by this, and sends Hermione back in time to prevent it, in the body of 10-year-old Cathal Rosier. Notably, she does her level best to avoid altering the original timeline, even to be helpful; she's there only to prevent the catastrophe.
