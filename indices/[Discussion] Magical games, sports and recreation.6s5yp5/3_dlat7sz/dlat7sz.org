Well if we round up everything from canon, you've got:

- Quidditch
- Duelling (All-England Competition)
- Broom racing
- Exploding Snap
- Gobstones
- Wizards' chess
- Collecting Chocolate Frog Cards(?)

On top of that, there's an argument to be made for some game or sport involving Hippogriffs (with all the "fancy" breeding), and possibly even Muggle-baiting when the Ministry was run under Death Eater control.
