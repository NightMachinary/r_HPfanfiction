In the story I'm fleshing out, there's mention of a traveling troupe of duelists that stop in major magical cities throughout the year.

These duelists are well known to be the very best at what they do, and have the ego, charisma, and flamboyancy that would give Gilderoy Lockhart self-esteem issues. They use spells no one has ever seen before. Spectacular to look upon, and every duelist has their own custom spell to finish off their opponent.

The crowds attending these events have their favorites, of course. They bring signs, buy hats and robes, and follow along closely with the rivalries that form between the competitors.

These events don't follow the rules one would find in a typical dueling championship tourney (like the one Flitwick won years ago), but their own special rules. Sure, bowing and saluting is customary, but there are a few duelists who cheat whenever that can, much to the chagrin of the audience.

Not much is known of these dueling prodigies, but speculation is rampant among those who know a thing or two about spellcraft. Some people are even convinced it's all an act. That these duels -- and even the spells themselves -- are fake. A staged performance with predetermined outcomes all for the sake of entertainment.

Of course, nobody listens to those cynics.
