I like to think Scottish wizards play a lot of golf with all sorts of magical course hazards and other novelties. Golf has been around for a long time (predating the Statute of Secrecy) and doesn't require much physical exertion, which wizards don't seem to be fans of.

I imagine Aurors might be into some form of magical skeet shooting.

Wizards probably have other card games besides Exploding Snap. Recall that Hagrid won Norbert's egg in a card game. I doubt Hagrid and Quirrelmort were playing Exploding Snap that evening. I'd be surprised if they didn't have some localized variant of poker. They probably use different decks than the modern standard though. Tarot games may be popular with wizards.

Since Western wizards have Chess and card games, it's probably safe to assume Eastern wizards play Go and Mahjong.
