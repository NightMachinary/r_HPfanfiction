Sure but that wouldn't mean shit. Half-bloods and muggleborns aren't gonna limit themselves to traditional wizarding british fare all the time, they're gonna buy takeout and whatever brand products they like from their local muggle deli. Muggle clothing (which every wizard who isn't a blood purist certainly owns) is unlikely to come from Mme Malkins either, wizards don't have the numbers for pret a porter. Most durables are likely gonna be muggle too. Autarky might well be possible for the wizarding world, but it sure as shit wouldn't be probable as the setting is described
