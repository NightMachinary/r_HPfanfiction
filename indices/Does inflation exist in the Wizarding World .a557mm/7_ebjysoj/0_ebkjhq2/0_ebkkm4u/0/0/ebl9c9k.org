Actually, if I'm remembering the books right, pretty much everyone wore robes. Yes, half-bloods and muggleborns are more likely to buy muggle goods but as they assimilate, even their shopping and eating habits will.

And you are forgetting there is a thing called Magic and that in epilogue, Ron spoke of bewitcing his driving instructer to pass the exam. I highly doubt most wizards would care for paying the full price for anything when a wave of their wand would lower the price easily, if not eliminate the price completely.

I think there would be a muggle stores in Wizarding side that buys the desired items by bewitching the muggles and sells them to wizards.

Besides, why would anyone chose to buy massproduced goods of low quality when they could buy custom made items? No, I think he even Harry aand Hermione would dress in robes.
