Wouldn't affect it too much because trade between two currencies would be limited from the start. I doubt wizards would depend heavily on Muggles for their food or clothing when multiplation of food is possible and magic would make them better and more efficient farmers.

A hudred or so elves could farm enough food for more than ten thousand people.

The most likely items wizards would buy from muggles are luxury items, not the essentials and with their aversion to technology and automated products, even the luxury imports would be pretty low.
