Depends, its up to the writer really. Are galleons just gold coins? In which case yes, yes there is as more gold is mined, buying off the muggles, the philosophers stone alone could create tones of money.

If there is more to a galleon than being a big gold coin then its more complicated. Are they enchanted and thus harder to replicate? Then it comes down to the institutions in the world, do the goblins or ministry mint the money? If its the goblins do they hate wizards and want to destabilise the economy? If the ministry mints the money does fudge trigger hyper inflation to fund the war against Voldemort?

Sorry for the shitty formatting, I'm on mobile.
