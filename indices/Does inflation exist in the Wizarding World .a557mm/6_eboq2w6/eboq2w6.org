I would say not, or at least not much.

The reason for this is that one of the thematics of the Harry potter setting is that the wizarding world is slow and rather resistant to change. It's steady. It's not really willing to change things up, so I would expect that a loaf of bread today costs about as much as it did 100 years ago.

The prices of individual goods may fluctuate... for example:

- The muggles cut down forest X, so Herb Y only grows in a few places. Most potion suppliers are growing it in a greenhouse now. Price goes up.
- Potion suppliers get pretty good at growing it (Specialized spells and potions to help it grow strong, as well as understanding WHAT the plant needs to thrive).... price goes down.\\
- Herb Y is struck by a blight that destroys many of the plants that have been growing. Only a few people who have been sourcing their own unicorn-trodden earth escape the blight. Price goes up.
- Potion suppliers figure out that Herb Y2 from africa is BASICALLY the same as Herb Y, but more potent, EXCEPT in healing potions. Price gets confusing. :P

or, for example... (something I tend to put in my stories)... While parchment (which is actually animal skin!) is totally the way to go for formal writing, some enterprising muggleborns started a stationary store and sell fancy PAPER like you'd buy in a muggle store. While they carry fancy papers with colored fibers and print on them, the bulk of their sales comes from good old fashioned lined and unlined paper, typically sold as note-taking paper and scrap paper. It's incredibly inexpensive compared to parchment or even paper made the traditional wizarding way, yet they still make bank off of it. (They're quick to express to muggleborn families they they'd probably be just as good going to the store for their paper, THOUGH they have enchanted the paper lightly to improve durability and make it easier for ink to be removed from the surface... but you would probably be more interested in our line of Nu-Quills for the Nu-Wizard, which help teach a young writer how to get used to all this nasty quill-and-ink business....)

So... individual stuff goes up, goes down, but generally speaking... I imagine that a young professor dumbledore was getting paid about as much as a young professor snape was, and about as much as a young Professor Longbottom will be paid. More or less.
