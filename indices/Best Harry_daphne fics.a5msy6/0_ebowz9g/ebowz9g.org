Most of these are going to be entirely relationship focused. So if that's not your cup of tea, you've been warned.

Linkffn(A Fateful Walk by Shygui) is pretty good.

Linkffn(Marry You by Dorothea Greengrass; From Southhampton To New York and Beyond; Trapped in a broom closet by Dorothea Greengrass) all three are good, imo. Not great or amazing, but good.

Linkffn(Black coffee, with sugar, by Jem Doe)
