Anything by Dorothea Greengrass is pretty good Haphne and regularly updated. Particularly recommend A Marriage of Convenience which is one of my favourite post Hogwarts fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12849376/1/A-Marriage-of-Convenience]]

And Unatoned is probably one of the best original (or deviating from the norm) iterations of Daphne, but nevertheless a thrilling story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned]]
