Alexandra Quick is pretty much original fiction, it uses Rowling's magic system and basic tenets of wizarding culture but is set in a completely original version of Wizarding America. Like HP, it's a coming of age story but ends up much grayer and slightly less apocalyptic and canon, the protagonist is /much/ less sympathetic and brash Americana abounds. There are five complete books and the sixth is in progress: highly recommended. The only links to canon characters are three mentions of Voldemort, but apparently we will see some canon characters in book 6.

You might like anything by Slide: her first series follows four Slytherins working in the background of the second war, her second series follows Scorpius and a couple friends as they find themselves trying to end an apocalyptic plotline. I suggest this because it's largely more apocalyptic and much grayer than the original series, and Slide can actually write romance quite well. Canon characters make an appearance, and this follows more of the apocalyptic plotline, but it's not very predictable and there are a lot of twists along the way.
