To be honest, this is still very vague and its hard to recommend something without knowing more. I don't know if my personal taste is going to be at all interesting to you and I (and probably many others) feel insecure making suggestions that people might react negatively to or that may include content/triggers others don't want to see.

There's hundreds of thousands of HP fanfics out there that explore a lot of different settings and characters. Yes, I feel like you are right that a lot do tend to be the same, particularly if you are trying to read things with HP as a character set during the same time as the original books. But there's a ton of side characters and different time periods to explore too, ex. after the books, Marauders era, Tom Riddle era.

As a piece of advice, the more you move toward fics that are centered on characters who don't have much existing story to them in the books, the more they tend to be like original fiction set in the HP universe. Many people don't seem to like that, but others are open to it because there's more room for creativity. There are even AU (alternative universe) stories that take the characters and put them in a completely different setting, ex. modern university/high school or muggle cities. If there's any particular character you really like, that might be interesting to see how people imagine them behaving outside canon.

I am going to go out on a limb and just recommend what is basically the only genre of fanfiction I read/write though it is SUPER niche and I understand if you aren't interested at all - Tom Riddle/OC stories. These tend to have a still villainous but more sane version of Voldemort and a "descent into madness" theme to them, but the plots/methods/reasons differ a lot across stories. If you like shows like Hannibal or Dexter you might like them. If you do like Hermione, there's also a ton of Tom Riddle/Hermione stories, though to be honest I found them to be predictable after a while because most revolve around time travel and the enemies-to-lovers trope.

One of the classic stories for the Tom Riddle/OC pairing is Witchcraft by a Picture, linkffn(5316529). I am trying to write one that looks at a time period I have never read a fic about before right now, after he graduated and worked at Borgin and Burke's. It's mostly romantic but also has a side plot of a first (obviously failed) attempt to rise to power legitimately. The Untold Years, linkffn(13549064).

As you can see, there's a whole lot of weirdly specific fanfiction out there :) I am sure people would be happy to rec their favorites if you have any characters, times, or types of stories you are really interested in. It's just kind of hard to think of anything to rec with such a general request, to be honest.
