Are you interested mainly in Harry-centric stories? If so, I'd recommend looking our for some AUs or next-gen stories if you're bored with Harry-at-Hogwarts stories - I'm not particularly interested in these (and I'm not a fan of the tropes you mentioned) so don't have many recommendations, but I do love No Voyage linkao3(23968243) for less plot-focused, more character-based look at Harry dealing with PTSD post-War, and for as long as you need us linkao3(16957743) for a short post-War AU with a beautiful (but heart-breaking!) plot twist.

I mostly read Marauders-era and House of Black fic, my top non-slash recs are Blackpool linkao3(14760663) and everything else by the same author, a beautiful story about Sirius and Regulus growing up, and Employee of the Month linkao3(14842689), Remus dealing with the aftermath of Hallowe'en 1981.

There are other stories about these characters in [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3/bookmarks][my bookmarks]], but let me know if you're interested in longer, ongoing stories and I'll look through my subscriptions!
