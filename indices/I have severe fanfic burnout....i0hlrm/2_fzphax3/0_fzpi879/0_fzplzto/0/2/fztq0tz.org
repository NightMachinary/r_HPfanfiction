How much have you read about Severus Snape?

linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) is canon-compliant and takes a detailed look at his entire life, with Harry's time at Hogwarts being only a brief portion of it (and Severus' point of view on Harry does raise some good points).

Severus/Lily is a bit problematic, but I've seen it done really well. linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has him meet Dumbledore in the afterlife and get a chance to fix all but one of his regrets; he's sent back to shortly after his breakup with Lily to try again. It does a really good job of getting inside his head and showing his strengths and weaknesses realistically. linkao3(Come Once Again and Love Me) does something like that, but with both Severus /and/ Lily being sent back from the points they died. Excellent prose quality, although I found it a bit more grim than Peace Not Promised.
