Up until a few weeks ago, I was pretty much solely reading on ffn. I don't know why that is, but I've recently come to realize how many good stories are on ao3. I mainly read on my phone so it's kind of hard for me to navigate ao3, but I've started checking out recommended fics from there rather than just skipping over them for the ffn fics.
