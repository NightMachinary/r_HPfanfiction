Ok, that's good to know you are open to new stuff! I don't spend much time on this sub but I do feel like the general HP fanfic community is really centered on the kind of stories you mentioned you have already read, and have heard negative things about people not wanting to read certain characters or OCs which is why I was hesitant to recommend something out there.

I don't usually read Dramonie but I stumbled on this one a few weeks ago and loved it. It's post-Hogwarts and the premise is interesting. The Library of Alexandria, linkao3(14539968).

I also just started reading this one, so not sure I can really recommend it yet, but it seems like a very intriguing idea. Might be interesting as a character study if you like bad guys. Ouroboros, linkao3(24476011).

At least in my observation, Archive of our Own tends to have more niche fics than FFN. I switched to writing and reading on it for that reason. I feel like FFN was filled has more low-quality fics, but that might just be because it has been around longer so has more fics in general or because it is easier to be more specific searches on AO3. I also find a lot of fics via tumblr, just by following other people that write fanfic or searching the HP tags.
