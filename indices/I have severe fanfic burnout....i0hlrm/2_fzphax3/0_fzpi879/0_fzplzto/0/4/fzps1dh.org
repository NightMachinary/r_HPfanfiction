For the longest time, I only read Dramione. It got to the point where I felt like I'd read everything and nothing new would be worth it/any good.

If you're up for branching out, I would recommend going on fanfiction.net and sorting by favorites on a search. I'd narrow things down by rating (I find M fics to be the most well written, generally) and word count (20k+ and 40k+ are my go-tos) but not paring. Read the most beloved works from a variety of tropes/pairings and see what you like.

In a similar vein to the comment above, I'll suggest a few I personally love that are different from your usual:

The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie - Hermione time travel fic

Boyfriend by Molly Raesly - James/Lily cuteness

A Second Look by RiverWriter - post-Hogwarts Dramione, featuring well written child characters
