Thanks for the in depth reply! Looking back on my original post, I can see how it could seem vague to other people. I have an idea in my head of what I mean, but it's not always the easiest to relay what's in your head into writing.

To try to be a little bit more specific:

I have ever really only read harry centered stories that take place during his school years. This is what I started with, and by the time I discovered reddit (or even made a ffn account lol) I'd already read so much of that type of story that I really didn't know how to branch out.

Because of this, I am feeling burnt out on fanfiction and am looking for something new (in relation to my fic history). Reddit has been a great help in introducing me to more pairings (daphne/harry, fem harry/OC, harry/several other minor characters) and tropes (time travel, lord of azkaban, lord harry, betrothal contracts, etc...), but there is not often much of a deviation from "widely accepted fanon" in the recommendations on this sub. At this point I am feeling pigeonholed into certain tropes and I want to extend my knowledge of the World of Harry Potter.

I'll definitely check out what you recommended.

TL:DR: I've only really read harry centric schooldays stories, which I am burnt out on. I want to read more variation, but don't know how to start branching out.

Edit: it's hard for me to be more specific when I don't even know what I am looking for.
