When I get tired of just Harry, I switch to crossovers. Well, that and Spacebattles, Sufficient Velocity, Alternate History sites.

Since you like PJO, I'm assuming you've read - Harry Potter, Squatter By: Enterprise1701-d? If not, get on that it's excellent! linkffn(13274956)

A few of my favorite crossovers where you don't need to know much about the other fandom, and that are also Harry centric : Isis's Bane By: althor42 A little SG1/hp crossover with finished sequels linkffn(4564625)

I don't know anything about Warhammer but -Through the Veil Strangely by littlewhitecat is so good you don't need to. linkffn(10150152)

And finally for something entirely different, a romance between Hermione and the God of Lies, because why not? Unexpectedly Bound by keelhaulrose linkffn(10853842)
