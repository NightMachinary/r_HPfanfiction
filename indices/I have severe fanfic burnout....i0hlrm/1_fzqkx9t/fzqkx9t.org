I feel you on this. I've escaped a few times and then I get sucked back in when I run out of other things to read.

You might try linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff). I just read it and really enjoyed it. It still take place at Hogwarts, but Harry is not super prominent. You might also try linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive) which is hilarious, but hasn't gotten to Hogwarts yet.

Another option is to read cross overs in fandoms you don't actually support. This might sound silly, but I fell in love with Full Metal Alchemist crossovers without watching the anime (I did watch it eventually and really enjoyed it). The idea of a guy obsessed with science discovering that magic is real and being forced to teach alchemy at Hogwarts killed me. If you read crossovers set in the HP universe then sometimes you can just treat them as an OC. My favorite HPxFMA is linkffn(The Colours of the World). HP MOD in the Marvel universe can be pretty fun as well.
