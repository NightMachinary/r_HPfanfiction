Hhhhhh-

If you're okay with creepypasta crossovers, moderate but skippable gore, horror, references to and outright murder, and slash(saw that you don't usually like MC slash but I'm putting the one fic that has it here because it's a subplot and the entire fic is 83 chapters long, than

linkffn(Brother in Arms by SteamGeek01)

linkffn(Harry by Proxy by The Smilimg Crow)

linkffn(Harry Jack)

linkffn(Potinem Domino)

(I'll post the rest in a reply because the bot doesn't like to respond to both ffn and ao3 links)

And if you're okay with angst, self-harm(sorta plot important but not too bad or descriptive) and minor but not outright slash,

linkffn(Saving Sirius by Imaginationcelebration)

It's a litte wolfstar and it's very sad but it's good.
