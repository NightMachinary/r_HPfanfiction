To make this more interesting, I tried for fics I don't think I've seen recced here before:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/237489][A Long Farewell to All My Greatness]] linkao3(237489) - I love teacher!Remus, and this fic fits in so well I half-believe it's canon. Gen.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2063883/1/The-Shape-of-His-Hands][The Shape of His Hands]] linkffn(2063883) - absolutely nails the confusion of being a teenager, and the resolution is achingly lovely. Mostly gen, with background Remus/Sirius.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5705950][the rise and temporary fall of lily evans]] linkao3(5705950) - I can't fully explain why, but I love the mix of sadness and hope in this fic. Gen, with past Lily/James.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]] linkao3(16957743) - I don't want to spoil it, so all I'll say is that this fic made me cry.

And, since you did okay reccing our own fics, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14392005][pity the living]] linkao3(14392005) is my favorite of my HP fics.
