  Sometimes, Lily Evans forgets how to breathe. She'll see a messy mop of black hair on a tall, lean frame, or a little boy with green eyes yelling as he sprints down the street, and her lungs will constrict. Have her boys come back to her? She knows, better than anyone else, that they have not. They will not.Her boys have been gone for years now.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.
