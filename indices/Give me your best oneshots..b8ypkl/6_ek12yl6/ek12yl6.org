linkffn(A Bath For Baby by The Rebellious Observer) is good, but extremely disturbing because it deals with Harry's abuse as a very young child.

linkffn(A Hero by Celebony) is also very good, also about Harry's abuse but through Dudley's eyes.

linkffn(A Small Thing by Scattered Logic) is very sweet, and gives the Trio an interesting sort of depth and kindness of a type that they didn't seem to have much of in the books.

linkffn(Caveat Inimici by S.Rebeiro) is a really excellent look at Hermione's ruthlessness and the codependency the trio would have after all they went through together. May not be for Ginny fans, because she happens to be her target here, though it's not a bash fic.

linkffn(Cousin Harry bynicnac9128) is a great look at Dudley post-canon dealing with how his cousin was treated growing up. Involves an OC pretty heavily (his girlfriend).

linkffn(Dog Tags Are Not Always Physical by A.j) is a really interesting Hermione character study.

linkffn(Gossip Queens by opalish) is a hilarious piece about Harry and Neville hanging out as adults.

linkffn(7905329) is a crack piece set during 2nd year about Harry, Snape, and the logistics of the whole class needing to be escorted /everywhere/ together...

linkffn(7864670) is a horror piece about killing mandrakes that look, act, and mature just like people.

linkffn(9943175) is a crack piece about the Fat Lady's origins.

linkffn(3400932) is another great Hermione character study.

I have more, if you want them! I've been in the fandom a looooooong time.
