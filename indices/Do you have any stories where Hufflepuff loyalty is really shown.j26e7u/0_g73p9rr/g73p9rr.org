“Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly“ is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][the whole sereies]] of next-gen Dudley Dursley's daughter (but that's just her background, the series has its own very original story line, it is not just that Dudley's daughter is a witch), who is a Hufflepuf and the author made a lot of effort to show different houses to be truly different. Highly recommended!
