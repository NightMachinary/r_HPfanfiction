Not a fic, but I always imagine during 6th year Harry and Dumbledore had a lot of tea time chats before looking at memories and they grew quite close. I know it's not substantiated by anything in canon but I like the idea of Harry really getting to know Albus Dumbledore as a person. And it makes the impact of Dumbledore's death and Harry's reaction to it more realistic.
