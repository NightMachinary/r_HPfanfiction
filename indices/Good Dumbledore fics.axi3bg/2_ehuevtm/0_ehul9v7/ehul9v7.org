Thank you for your suggestions. I have started on the accidental horcrux already and it's a very interesting read. The warlock's apprentice seems exactly what I'm looking for and the the merging sounds intriguing. The rest of them look interesting too. I'll give them a try as soon as I'm done with ones I am reading.
