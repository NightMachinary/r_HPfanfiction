linkffn(The Mind Arts) has Dumbledore as a hands-off mentor to Harry. He enables him to move beyond the standard curriculum and advises him when he thinks he's over his head or missing something, but for the most part he leaves Harry to his own devices. It's how I imagine Dumbledore was mentored or would have wished to have been.
