[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] and its sequels have one of the best Dumbledores I've ever read. I think the second one in the series has him go all out at one point, but its been a while so I can't be totally sure. Disclaimer though: The main character is a massive prick who doesn't ever really grow as a character.
