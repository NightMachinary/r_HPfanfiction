I'm pretty sick of manipulative!dumbledore too myself. So many writers seem to focus on his negatives and not enough of his positives, instead of the Dumbledore that sits and broods in his office all day contemplating the best way to fuck with Harry's life without any rhyme or reason. Why don't we see more of the Dumbledore who likes ten-pin bowling and warm socks? Where is the whimsical and silly Dumbledore who said "Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!" during the opening speech in PS? And please don't say that's just an act to fool people into believing he's a doddering, old, senile fool. Well... What if he really is? The man is over 100 years old! Even wizards get old and old people are universal everywhere, and noone, absolutely noone is a master manipulator past the age of 80, I don't care who you are.
