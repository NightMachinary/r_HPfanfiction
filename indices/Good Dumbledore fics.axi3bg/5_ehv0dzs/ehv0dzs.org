Back in the day I read and fell in love with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1458772/1/Here-Be-Monsters-I-Wizard-s-Lament][Here Be Monsters I: Wizard's Lament]] linkffn(1458772) and its two sequels (the last story unfortunately unfinished, I believe because the author wasn't fond of writing AUs and was in the middle of the third fic when HBP came out). It's quite...saccharine, looking back now, and therefore the main characters (Harry, Dumbledore, and Remus) are fairly OOC with their amount of emotional openness, but I still really love the author's style and it's nice getting to see some moments we might have gotten if their canon versions hadn't been so closed-up and private. Also by the same author is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1471928/1/Daddy-s-Favorite][Daddy's Favorite]] linkffn(1471928) - I know you said you're not a big fan of one-shots, but this is seventeen of them, inter-related to form a bigger story, and takes a look at Harry and Dumbledore's relationship from different characters' perspectives.

I always hesitate to rec fics I haven't read yet, but I have two open in my tabs right now I've been waiting to start that look like they fill your criteria and could be promising, both seem to be Harry's years at Hogwarts from Dumbledore's PoV:
