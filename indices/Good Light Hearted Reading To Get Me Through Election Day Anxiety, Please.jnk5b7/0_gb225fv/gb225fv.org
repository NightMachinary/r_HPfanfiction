[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/][Harry is a dragon and that's OK]] - basically a slice of life, with some British humour and everyone being a competent and reasonable person. And Harry being a dragon.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/][What's her name in Hufflepuff]] - an SI with a fair dose of humour. Really close to the spirit of the orignial series in worldbuilding and shenanigans that occur, and a fair few rather interesting characterizations.

And don't fret! If you support Trump - eh, he might just pull this off. If you don't - well, it won't really get worse either way, will it?
