  "Step aside, you silly girl!" said Voldemort, brandishing his wand angrily.

  "Okay," Lily said, and she moved to let Voldemort pass. He stepped forward and, a flash of green light later, baby Harry's crying fell silent. Lily fell to the floor, her legs buckling underneath her as she realised what she had done.

  Voldemort laughed, a high-pitched cackle that sent shivers down Lily's spine.

  --------------

  A month later, it was over. Dumbledore was dead, along with most of the Order, and the Ministry had fallen. Voldemort was victorious, an immortal overlord. No one knew how he had made himself immortal; no one ever would. He would rule for thousands of years.

  Out of all the Order, only Lily was left.

  "Hello, Lily," said Severus Snape, sidling up to her greasily. "I arranged to have your husband and son killed, so I could have you to myself. Doesn't that show how noble and brave I am? I'm motivated by love, you see."

  Lily blinked slowly, before turning her dead gaze to Snape's hooked nose and sallow, pale face.

  "Avada Kedavra," she said, and Snape fell to the floor, dead.

  Then she turned her wand on herself, and all was dark.
