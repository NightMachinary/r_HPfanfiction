  ...and then came the light.

  Lily opened her eyes, surprised to find herself in the same dark room. Snape's body was lying a feet few from her, the stench already nauseating.

  POP.

  The familiar sound of Apparation filled the room. Lord Voldemort appeared from nothingness. He glided to Snape's body and leaned over to inspect the foul man.

  "As I suspected," Voldemort whispered. He turned his red eyes to Lily. "You have lived."

  "You couldn't have possibly suspected that," Lily said.

  "I did not know with full certainty that the events would transpire as they did. I had always wondered the depth of Snape's commitment to you. Now, I know. His love protected you even as he died at your hands," Voldemort said as he approached her.

  "That..."

  Lily's mouth gaped as her mind raced through the multitude of reasons she was still alive.

  "...makes no sense."

  Voldemort nodded. "Indeed."

  "Come with me..." He extended a pale appendage that looked more like a claw than a hand. "...if you want to live."

  She hesitantly grasped his cold hand. His arms encircled her body. Lily stood on her tip-toes until her lips grazed his scaly ear. She could feel him shudder against her. Lily whispered something in his ear.

  "What was that?" Voldemort asked, not hearing what she said.

  "I said." Lily licked her lips in anticipation. "Surprise, motherfucker."

  They exploded in a burst of light, the bomb trapping them both. Voldemort shrieked in agony, but Lily said not a word. The Horcuxes had been destroyed. The trap had been set.

  As the fire turned her skin black, Lily smiled.
