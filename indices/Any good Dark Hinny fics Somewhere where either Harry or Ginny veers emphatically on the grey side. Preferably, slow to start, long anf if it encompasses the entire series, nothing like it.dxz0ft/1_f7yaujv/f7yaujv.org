I can probably say many of the works of Brennus border on dark H/G, but YMMV with some of them. Possibly the best example for you would be something like linkffn(Gothic by Brennus). I suppose you might also count linkffn(The Changeling) as dark as well, though less dark magic and more grim/somber/sad as a retelling of canon from Slytherin Ginny's perspective.
