Wastelands of Time is probably one of the bigger AU fics I know that haven't already been mentioned (AU to the point that it's basically only Harry Potter because of the names of the characters and the things they shout while casting spells at each other). It's pretty good, if a little odd at times. It is still Harry fighting Voldemort, yes, but the setting, plot, and concept behind it is so completely different that I think it fits that criterion. :)
