Supercharged AU on crack sounds like a job for [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]]...

Starfox5 has a bunch of great stories set in a wizarding world with a few differences, they use the same worldbuilding across all the works. For example we see the civil war in Quebec mentioned in the background in several fics. A few of the stories are set in the "defeat Voldemort" setting, all with very big differences to canon, and several others are in the "we defeated Voldemort, what now" setting.

The latest one, Linkffn(The Granger Principle), is set almost a decade later in the early 2000s. It's even more AU than the other ones, with all the familiar characters but with some big differences.

There's several other stories with very different themes. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) is a heist fic about burglars versus death eaters, Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) is a war fic, Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) is post war politics, Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is guerilla warfare, Linkffn(Returned, Reformed and Really Trying) is Grindelwald crack, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl who walked on water) is.... weird, Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is a spy romance, Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) is Indiana Jones / Tomb Raider style archeology adventure, and there's more.
