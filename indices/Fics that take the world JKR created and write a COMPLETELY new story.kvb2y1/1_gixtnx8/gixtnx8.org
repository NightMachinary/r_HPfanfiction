Is the ao3 linkbot working? If not Ill edit this post.

If your willing to read something very dark linkao3(Manacled) is very good. It's essentially The Handmaid's Tale but with Harry Potter people? They lose the war effectively. Voldemort is barely in it but it's still just terrifying. It's really very dark and heavy but if that's something you'd enjoy then this is really very good. It's the most AU thing I've read that still has all the same magic of Potter.

I'm reading linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) at the minute and this has a whole different plot to the books. Harry is sent back in time to the 70s but doesn't do the "Find the Parents" thing. He ends up living with Aberforth in the Hogs Head and running an underground vigilante ring during the war? I've no idea how it'll end but it's not following any HP plot I've ever read before and I've read a lot. There's pirates and criminal gangs and smugglers and vampires and all sorts it's great! A lot of OCs.

And (because it's me) I'm going to recommend linkao3(Of A Linear Circle by Flamethrower) because they take Harry Potter and throw out Harry Potter and then take their time fixing all the inconsistencies and adding in waay more lore and politics and secret societies and titles and war mages and laws and lands and family trees and lineages than anyone could possibly need in a story and it's flipping brilliant and I love it ðŸ˜Š
