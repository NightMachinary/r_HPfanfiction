They didn't even use piezoelectric igniters on many if any back then. Their pilot light was a different fuel source flame. Completely mechanical utilizing pressure to push out the napalm or other fuel source across ignition source. But the throwers didnt last as log as they did in films. I think they had like... thirty seconds of fuel?
