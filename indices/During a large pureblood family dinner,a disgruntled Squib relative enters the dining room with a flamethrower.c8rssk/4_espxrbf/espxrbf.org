I'm not sure if this is canon or absorbed fanon, but aren't all wizarding areas similar to Hogwarts, in that electronics malfunction? Like, if you try to bring any kind of electronic device into any kind of magical area, like Diagon Alley, or an old pure-blood family home, it will cease functioning?

This would only be an issue if the flamethrower has a lot of electrical components, which I'm actually not sure whether or not a flame thrower has to have electrical components?
