I searched but i think I kept trying too many specific keywords like 'bird of prey' and permit. That and ios safari has been weird on google results lately. I'll see underlines but the text is the same color as the bg.

Oh, and i think i discounted the author when i did see the result because I thought it was a serious story, not comedic.
