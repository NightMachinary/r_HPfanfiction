Sounds like something I'd like to read. Honestly, did Harry ever have a positive interaction with a muggle in his childhood? The Dursleys were awful to him, and everyone seems to buy into their bullshit about Harry. The kid went around in cast-offs at least two sizes too big for him and his cousin bullied him relentlessly yet none of his schoolteachers showed any concern for his welfare.
