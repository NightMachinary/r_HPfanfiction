I personally think it should actually make him want to separate /completely/ the words (eg. stealing the muggleborn children from their parents for their own protection; removing any right muggles may have on the magical world to the point that if a wizard invaded the muggle's house, kill his family, tortures the sod and then the muggle swears at him the wizard will be within his rights to have the DMLE send the muggle to Azkaban without any form of trial or even showing proof beyond his word; and creating towns away from any kind of muggle settlement).
