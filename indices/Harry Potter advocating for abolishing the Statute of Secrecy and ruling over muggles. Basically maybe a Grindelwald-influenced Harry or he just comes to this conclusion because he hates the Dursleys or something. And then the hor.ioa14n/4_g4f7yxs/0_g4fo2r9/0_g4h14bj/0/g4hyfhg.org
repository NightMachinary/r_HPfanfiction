1. Agreed. Even if we stick solely to what's shown in canon, that's some really useful stuff that could benefit humanity as a whole. Fuck: Skelegrow /alone/ would be amazing!
2. Even ignoring the rights issues you lay out, I feel I have to point out that any form of law (in this case the Statute of Secrecy) that includes "Mind control/mind wipe the unsuspecting populace" as one of the core tenants, is probably flawed in its premise.
3. Wow. Did not think that like, every government everywhere is a total farce. Yeah, that's a good one.
4. Satellites, thermal imaging, sonar, there's a lot of tech that would help reveal wizards. It wouldn't even be that hard to do a planned exposure. A handful of carefully selected wizards come out and show off a few of the simpler things that they can do, and you reveal the wider wizarding world over a period of a few years.

Also, on the topic of technology: Hogwarts is, by my estimate, about to see a massive decrease in people attending their school/people staying at their school. See, the thing is... Hogwarts has no WiFi or cell reception. Yeah, try getting a twelve year old to give up the internet and cell phones after like, 2010 in order to learn magic.
