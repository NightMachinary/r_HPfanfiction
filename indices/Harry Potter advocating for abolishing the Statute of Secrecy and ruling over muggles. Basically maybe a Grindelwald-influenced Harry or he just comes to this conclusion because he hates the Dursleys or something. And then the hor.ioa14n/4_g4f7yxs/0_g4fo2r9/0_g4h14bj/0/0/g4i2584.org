Yup.

The SoS's role in the magical world reminds me of the role slavery plays in the history of the United States- Something utterly morally bankrupt, done for the profit of a small powerful minority and excused by prejudice and fear, which will inevitably fail, but is so central to the system and such a contentious issue that it cannot fail without immense conflict and bloodshed, and which has reprecussions which will doubtless haunt the world for centuries even after its gone.

Gradual reveal is probably the best approach in theory, from the perspective of preventing total war, though an instant reveal is better from the point of view of stopping the mass violation of Muggles. But any attempt would likely be sabotaged by Dark Wizards on the magical side and religious fundamentalists who still think magic is demonic on the non-magical side.

I wonder if some of the smarter wizarding leaders, like Dumbledore or Moody or Kingsley, are kept awake at night thinking about the inevitable day the Statue fails. Knowing that their whole world is basically sitting on a massive time bomb, but there's no way they can disarm it without setting it off- the most they can do is choose when and how it goes off.
