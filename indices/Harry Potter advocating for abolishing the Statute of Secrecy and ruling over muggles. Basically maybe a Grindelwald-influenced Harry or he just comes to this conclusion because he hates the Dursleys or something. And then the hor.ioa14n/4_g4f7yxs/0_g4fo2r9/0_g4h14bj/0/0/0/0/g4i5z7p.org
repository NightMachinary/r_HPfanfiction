I think Dumbledore and Kingsley would probably think of it at least- Dumbledore is very experienced, no doubt debated these issues during Grindlewald's day, and is open to the Muggle world and to seeing value in things most wizards don't. But he'd also have too much baggage related to Grindlewald to contemplate the idea of undoing the SoS I think- he'd see it as going down the same path, even if it was done in a different way and for different reasons. And Kingsely, though smart enough about Muggles to flawlessly fit into the Prime Minister's staff, and certainly someone who recognizes that Muggles have value as people, can't really do much on his own.

Also, if you take Cursed Child as canon, its implied that Voldemort, while having no concern whatsoever for the lives of Muggles, knew enough at least to regard them as a threat- because his regime paid off the British government to cover up his followers' crimes, rather than trying to openly rule the Muggles. Makes sense really, because Riddle spent his summers as a kid in WWII London, and probably has a better idea than most wizards of what Muggle weapons can do.
