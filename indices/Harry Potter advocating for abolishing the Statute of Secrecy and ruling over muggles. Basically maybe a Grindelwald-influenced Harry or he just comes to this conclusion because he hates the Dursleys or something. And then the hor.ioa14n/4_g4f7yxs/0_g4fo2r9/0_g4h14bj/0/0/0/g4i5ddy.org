Yeah, wizards are only "better" in that they don't have muggle slaves. Nah, they have an entire slave /race/ for that instead!

Well, the wizards could work with the local governments (and some specialists that are sworn into the Secret) to bring the Wizarding World up to speed a bit behind the scenes regarding laws, rights, recent muggle developments, etc while the muggles are eased into things.

Any attempt /at all/ would be sabotaged by someone, so you just try to account for it and roll with the punches. Not really a better option if you're doing the reveal.

I don't think they would. Even the "smart" wizards are kind of... arrogant, concerning muggles, and I can honestly see them either thinking A) they would never be discovered, or B) that even if they are it's just /muggles,/ what are they really going to do?
