A few:

1. Magic could save a great many innocent lives (cures for diseases, increased production of resources, etc).
2. The Statute of Secrecy is enforced by a draconian set of laws which are upheld by mass mind control of non-magicals and forced segregation. This denies non-magicals their rights to freedom of choice, freedom of information, and self-determination, while encouraging magicals to view them as lesser.
3. Therefore, the Statute of Secrecy requires magical society to be increasingly authoritarian, while treating non-magicals as subordinates, who cannot be trusted. It also denies non-magicals the right to make informed choices about matters that will affect their safety (something in which their leaders are complicit), essentially rendering democracy and self-government a sham in every single nation on Earth.
4. It is probably inevitable that the Statute of Secrecy will fail as population rises and science and technology develops- and while there's really no good way to end it (a lot of people will react very badly to the revelation of a secret magical society that has been manipulating their minds with the knowledge of their leaders for centuries), arguably a controlled, planned exposure of the magical world is preferable to an uncontrolled one (say, a Death Eater attack in which the first exposure to wizards is one that inclines people to see wizards as terrifying monsters).
