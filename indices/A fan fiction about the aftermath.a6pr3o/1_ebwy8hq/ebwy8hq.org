[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my personal favorite. The story began a few months after the Battle, with Harry deciding to take down the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. There would be no 'all was well' in a Magical Britain ruled by the Dark Trio.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers of Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is my favorite canon-compliant postwar fic. It takes place in 2009 and depicts Harry and Ginny's family/work life from their Muggle neighbor's POV.
