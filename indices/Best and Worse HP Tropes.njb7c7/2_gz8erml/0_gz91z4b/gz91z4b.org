Have you read the Ever Upward series? It sounds like you'd like it. Harry runs away from the Durseley's. Although it's a raised by the Basilisk fic, Snape is the human Harry gets closest to and Harry eventually names Snape his guardian.

linkao3(ever upward by stranglerfig) The bot has a tendency to link the third fic in the series rather than the first, so make sure you start with the right one if you want to read it,
