Best: Harry gets adopted, Harry runs away, just Harry gets away from the Dursley's period. My favorite adoption is snape, because I love the learning to love each other angle and Harry having no one else to turn to but his worst enemy but they become family.

If I want a good cry I can just turn to building doors or blessings in disguise by JAWorley. Building doors seems to have been dropped before the relationship really starts, but I love the line

 "I know the Headmaster didn't buy me clothes because he cares about me. He only did it because the Justice said he had to." He turned suddenly and Snape was taken back to see wetness in Harry's eyes, though the tears hadn't fallen yet. "Maybe you could quit reminding me that I'm only here because people are forced to take care of me, not because they want me."

Worst: wrong boy who lived. Especially when he still winds up at the Dursley's with his family still alive.

The lord heir stuff can be interesting, but can also be annoying as all hell.

Stat sheets like video games. Oh yes, his animagus and metamorphmagus skills are blocked by 75% each, and he is compelled to love only people with red hair, and his core needs to be unlocked and goblins have to do all of it.

A will stating that Peter was their secret keeper and should be locked up. Peter was one of their best friends and they trusted him enough to make him their secret keeper. If voldemort found them the assumption would probably have been that voldemort killed him and broke through the wards.

I don't mind a little Weasley bashing but that they are all criminal masterminds screwing Harry over is usually an interest killer.
