  Harem. Often related to the above mentioned point. Head of 6 houses, gets so have 6 wives. Big Brain time.

While I dislike Harem in general, I particulary hate this justification. It's not like Harry couldn't make several children with one wife, or just have one of them inherit several "Houses" since it's exactly what he did.

Then again I also dislike the Lordship! trope, and both of theses tropes are generally just an excuse for Super Harry to have a power tripe with his Harem so it's not like it truly matters.
