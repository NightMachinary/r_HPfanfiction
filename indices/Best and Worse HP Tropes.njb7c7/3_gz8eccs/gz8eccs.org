Best: I love stories where Harry becomes the Master of Death & it means something more than just 'he accepts he has to die.' Dammit, JK came up with an awesome idea & then just threw it in the garbage. I fucking hated that so much.

Worst: Any story where the author gushes over Draco instead of portraying him as the vile, bigoted, arrogant, spoiled, cowardly, whiny little monster that he is. 'Dramione' particularly makes me want to vomit.
