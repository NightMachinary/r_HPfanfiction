  All Slytherins are misunderstood, noble souls bullied by Gryffindors

Lifehack: if you're reading a Slytherin Harry fic and you want to know if it's going to have this trope, Snape's speech will tell you. For some reason every single ‘Slytherins are the real victims' author feels the need to have Snape make a speech to the first years which goes “Rule 1: no fighting outside the common room, we present a united front. People hate Slytherins enough as it is so we have to look strong. Rule 2: don't get caught. Professors will come down especially hard on Slytherins, they look for any excuse to take points. Rule 3: go everywhere in twos, the other houses hate us and will take any opportunity to curse you in the corridors and the professors won't stop it. Make me proud, my snakes.”

So yeah if you read that then it's a good sign to exit.
