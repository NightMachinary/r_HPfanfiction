Tropes I'm so over:

1) Lordships / nobility - I don't care whether it's Harry getting one lordship or multiple lordships, I nope out of anything where this plays a major role and kids go around addressing each other as “Heir So-and-So” and acting like child-sized adults.

2) Wrong Boy-Who-Lived, especially when James, Lily, and/or Sirius are neglectful, abusive, and/or abandon Harry in favor of their other kid.

3) Dumbledore and the Weasleys are stealing from Harry, blocking his magic and dozens of special abilities, and are using compulsion, loyalty, and love charms and potions to keep him in line. (And, of course, Harry discovers all these blocked abilities/curses on him by taking a blood test at Gringotts, and the goblins are happy to remove them all.)

4) All Slytherins are misunderstood, noble souls bullied by evil Gryffindors for trying to defend the superior pureblood culture against ignorant mudbloods

Tropes I like: 1) Time travel 2) Sirius as a good, competent godfather and parent figure for Harry
