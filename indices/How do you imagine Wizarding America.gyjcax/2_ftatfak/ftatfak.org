It is as ridiculous as her ideas about magical world in Europe, which is product of her heritage: combination of French arrogance and English ignorance. Half of Europe (from non-Romance Swiss to Russia, from Greece to Norway; assuming that all Romance European attend Beauxbattons) attends the only school somewhere in the north of Sweden/Norway, while relatively small Great Britain (which is like fifth of that; perhaps Ireland included, but it is never clearly stated) has its own school. And so on.
