The statue of secrecy was created before America was founded, so it would be cool if magical America was more divided. I don't see wizards paying much attention to what's happening on the muggle side, so it would be cool if there were no purebloods families that went to America and all the European American witches and wizards are descendants from muggleborns born in America.

The Native American would have no system in place to round up all the white and black muggleborns since they just look for magicals in their own tribes. The new muggleborn would have to form a society on their own trough trial an error.
