Currently in the Fic i'm writing where Harry and Luna travel around the Magical US the magical world on the East Coast, think the original thirteen colonies is pretty much the same as Europe, with all the racism and shit that entails, once you get past into the Great Plains you run into sparsely populated home schooled wizarding cultures, with no real school to call their own like Illvermorny, instead you have farming families that are basically like the weasleys, hedge witches, Native Nomadic tribes and African American groups as well, this is also where the Amish are since I'm going to make the Amish a magical community because it's fucking hilarious.

Once you get into the Desert you end up with the colonies of the Magical US that are a mix of both, with homesteaders who don't really have a school that they go to and instead focus on home schooled magic, tribes doing their own thing and of course Magical towns that are basically like Cowboys and shit.

Certain states like Texas and California are alot more modern than say Arizona or New Mexico would be, Alaska has no magicals at all since most of them migrated to Canada after Russia took Alaska and Hawaii has mainly Asian and Native magical groups. Nevada, Idaho and Utah have a thriving Mormon Magical community which is basically it's own independent thing from Magical America.

so the Magical United States would consist of the Original Thirteen Colonies and all the states until you hit the Mississippi river. everything past that is either independent native tribes, sparcly populated colonies by the MUSA, Thriving States like Texas and California, and an independent Mormon Magical country which would be Deseret, and would basically include Modern Idaho, Parts of Magical California, Nevada and Utah as well as a good chunk of Arizona.

Slavery for minorities wasn't a thing in the Magical US since Magic exists but they weren't against enslaving magical creatures so that's still a thing.

In the Magical US you'd have state funded schools that would act as primary schools for all magical kids in the country, including the people from the colonies in the great planes and native tribes if they choose to send them (most don't), you also have a hogwarts sized major school in Massachusetts called Illvermorny, but it's not the only one in the United States theirs a good sized academy in California somewhere and theirs also one in Texas. the Mormons have their own one in Utah that's based underneath the Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City.
