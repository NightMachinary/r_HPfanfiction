You only really need one school, about the size of a normal highschool.

Apparently the US only has about 5Ã— the population of Britain (which is really weird but it's about 330million Vs 66 million) and Hogwarts is very small, managing with only one teacher per subject, go for 5 per subject and it's easily done.

Wizards make up a tiny portion of the global population, which probably explains the statute of secrecy.
