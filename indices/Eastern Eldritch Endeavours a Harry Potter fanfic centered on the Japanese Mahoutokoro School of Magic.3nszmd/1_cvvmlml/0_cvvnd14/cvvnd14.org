Firstly, thank you for submitting this comment. Regarding the English Spells and the Japanese language use, it feels like I'm in between a rock and a hard place: if I try and localize the spell chants, then it feels like readers will be completely lost and might think I'm rewriting spells. Another thing, although I'm not too sure, but I saw a few scenes of the movies in Japanese on YouTube, and the spell incantations were the same barring a change in accent, so that may have been a large part of my rationale behind keeping the spells the same.

With Rin, could you maybe specify how 'Rin-nee-chan' lost you? When I wrote that line, I wanted to have Sora call his older sister by name, yet still adhere to the convention of addressing his sister properly. Translated, it would be along the lines of 'Big Sister Rin'.

Regarding the description of characters' appearances more than personality or backstory, I was mainly trying to avoid making mistakes I had made in the past, where I would just outright state character personalities with their introduction. Looking back, it felt a lot like a case of telling as opposed to showing. I had the same problem with appearances (and still do today although to a lesser extent), so I mainly wanted to concentrate on making the characters distinguishable and bring their personality out through their interactions. With the lack of backstory, I wanted to try and find a place to comfortably weave it in, and it didn't seem like there were many opportunities for that as of yet. I will go back and see if I can improve things in those areas, but they're a few major aspects I struggle with when it comes to writing.

Finally, with Mon-chan, when I wrote her, I was thinking of a magical girl (especially with the wand) crossed with a maid. Personally, I just wanted to go with something basic regarding anime trends, and the creation of the physical characteristics was fairly random otherwise. I didn't specifically have Chibi-moon in mind at the time (Only saw the Sailor Moon Abridged up to the fight with Queen Beryl), but after looking now, I can see the resemblance

I will take a look at the chapters already online and see if I can revise them based on what you've brought to light. I'm not exactly sure when I will be able to post the revisions, though, but I will try to get them up as soon as possible
