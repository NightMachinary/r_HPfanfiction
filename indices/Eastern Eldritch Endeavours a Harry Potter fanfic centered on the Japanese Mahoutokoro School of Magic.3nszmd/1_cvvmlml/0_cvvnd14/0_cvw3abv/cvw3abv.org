Wow, thanks for the long response - you certainly are a writer ;)

Maybe it's better just to work forward and keep telling your story before working back and fixing little things. I'll have to read it over again anyway, it was late at night and I was just curiously clicking around [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. It was a treat to find something different than the usual Dramione and Harem fics, and you should definitely keep writing!

It's a tough task to accomplish, taking Harry Potter and setting it in Japan. You have to capture HP lovers as your readers, without using anything familiar to them, and make them care about your characters and setting. Whereas all the tropes and likes/dislikes of HP fanfiction are already established and well known. The Japanese twist is based on your own knowledge of Japan and its culture, which could be wildly different from your readers'. With HP, there's a set text of 7 books to understand it, and we all have those. Japan, there's no one text of knowledge and understanding. Maybe you've lived there, maybe you do a lot of reading and research, or maybe you just really love anime and that's where all the magic is anyway.

And I totally understand trying to fit information in yet still having it seem natural, without turning the reader off. Perhaps I forget that you're having to do something other HP Fanfic writers don't have to, by making all new characters. I wish I had better suggestions and not just criticism - that isn't really fair, is it? - I guess it's all in practice and research.

I hope that makes sense. And yes, I have tried to cross Sailor Moon with Harry Potter. Come on, it has to happen some day ;)
