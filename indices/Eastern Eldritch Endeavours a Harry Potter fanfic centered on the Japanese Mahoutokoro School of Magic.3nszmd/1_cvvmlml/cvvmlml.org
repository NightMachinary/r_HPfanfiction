Interesting idea, but I'm cringing at the awkward use of Japanese along with very English spells. You lost me at "Rin-nee-chan". The extensive description of everyone's eyes and hairstyles, moreso than personality and story, also hurts. You had such a big description of the character (Mon?) in chapter 4, I thought it was going to be Sailor Chibi-Moon.
