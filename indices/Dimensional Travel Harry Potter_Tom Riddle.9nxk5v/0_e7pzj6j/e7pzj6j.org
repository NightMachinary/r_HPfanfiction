I've never read that story. However, I know of one that runs along similar lines.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888734/1/Jonquils-and-Lightning][Jonquils and Lightning]] - Following the advice of a prophecy, Tom Riddle travels to an alternate universe looking for a Potter who will help him defeat his foes. He finds Harry who, after surviving Voldemort's defeat, had taken up residence in a peaceful world where Voldemort never existed.
