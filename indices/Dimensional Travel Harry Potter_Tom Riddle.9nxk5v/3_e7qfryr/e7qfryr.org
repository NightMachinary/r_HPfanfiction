It's not slash or dimension travel, but this is the only story I can think of where Harry and Tom are on speaking terms and they go to a masquerade ball together.

It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] linkffn(3766574).

It's a pretty good read, though it's unfinished at 1.2m words and hasn't been updated in 4 years. Y I K E S.
