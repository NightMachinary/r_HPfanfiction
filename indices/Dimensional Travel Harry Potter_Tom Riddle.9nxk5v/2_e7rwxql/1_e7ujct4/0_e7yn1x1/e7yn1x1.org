now im curious: what was the name of the fic you were looking for

​

my favorite depiction of their messed up relationship is linkffn(Verdict of Vagaries). Very long and complete as well, and very little sugar coating

​

anything by obsidian pen is gold

​

ive read a ridiculous amount of tomarry and harrymort, so I do have more reccs if there's particular tropes you're into. Voldemort vs tom, etc.
