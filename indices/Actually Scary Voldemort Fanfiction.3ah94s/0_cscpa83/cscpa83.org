linkao3(The Very Secret Diary)

A masterful piece of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][Fridge Horror]] with a simple premise: it's a transcription of the series of conversations Ginny had with Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.

It's the creepiest / scariest Riddle I've ever read, and it's not particularly close.
