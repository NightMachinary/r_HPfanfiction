When you say "uses their intelligence" do you mean have an abnormally high intelligence?

My recommendation is "Fair Trade" by BajaB. Its probably not what you're looking for, but it is what I think Voldy with a statistically high intelligence would actually do. Note: Highly intelligent Voldy doesn't truly appear until the end of the fic. Linkffn(Fair Trade by BajaB).

From your earlier comment "This version of Voldemort is smart. And that makes him terrifying, because he can exploit magic, deceive people, refrain from gloating"

Do only highly-intelligent people succeed at exploiting systems (like magic), deceiving people and have self control? Regular intelligence allows for that just fine.

(spoiler) And HPMOR-Voldy does gloat and gives Harry time to use his trump card transfiguration. Whether or not Voldy is super-intelligent he is very average in feeling the need to prove himself and show himself to be smarter.

Really intelligent people rarely became serial killers like Voldy, and on average IQ around 99 ([[https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder/serial-murder-1#five]]). They are scary and successful because not due to intelligence but "...instead, it is obsession, meticulous planning and a cold-blooded, often psychopathic personality" ([[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/5-myths-about-serial-killers-and-why-they-persist-excerpt/]]). That's not to say that Voldy's IQ isn't higher, but that's not why he's scary (in my opinion) and just because he been successful doesn't mean he is a genius.

On a related point, HPMOR attempts to present Voldy as super-intelligent, but I don't think he is shown to be. The author outright tells the reader that Voldy is crazy-smart or sets up convoluted plots for him to explain away. This serves as a literary foil to highlight Harry's crazy-smartness.

"Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had gone to see this play. Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and Lawliet when he grew up. Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and pointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face there had been no good reason for him to tell Light his name...Father had finished by saying that plays like this were always unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what someone actually as smart as Light would actually do, the playwright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of just writing plays about it."

In my opinion HPMOR's author falls into the same trap. And that's not much of a surprise because that is just the nature of story telling. My personal opinion (emphasis on personal) is that HPMOR is written in a way that readers are encouraged to think that "this is a smart-person-story, if I agree with it and understand it that means I am smart too". In a sense, the story grooms the reader to defend it, because the reader's identity as smart becomes dependent on the story being smart.

I think the author also dumbs down the opposition to elevate the protagonist/antagonist's position. An example from HPMOR ch. 81: "Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of 'I wonder how he did that.' This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many are wealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other ways. Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of business and politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed." How does the author know that "almost none are thinking...'I wonder how he did that'." What survey or statistic is he using? Or can he read their minds? The Wizengamot is supposed to represent the general populace, and the author calls their 'shrewdness' (read:intelligence) circumscribed. In other words, he thinks that unlike himself, average people only occasionally think intelligently and in limited situations (i.e. business). That is using an unsupported assumption and an ad hominem attack on anyone considered less intelligent (most people) to prop up the protagonist's/narrator's own intelligence. I say narrator because in my view the author often crosses the Mary-Sue line when he has the narrator, antagonist or protagonist say something with a Rational! component to it.

The HPMOR-Voldy is clever, but in my opinion he's not overly intelligent.

I'm not sure what a super-intelligent Voldy would do, because I a myself am not super-intelligent myself (see quote about Tragedy of Light), but performing magic that will split my soul?/essence? with unknown consequences to the mind, hiding in the school run by your nemesis and taking the time to teach the person prophesied to destroy you is not super-intelligent in my estimation. Instead, I think it is someone with average or slightly above average intelligence with a compulsion to prove one's superiority and enact complex plots (because those never go wrong) and a statistical likelihood of a mental disorder.
