Linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)

She's not really feminine, is smart, assertive, independent I think. I don't think she's a bitch, but she is kinda bratty. Idk it's been a while since I've read it. She's supposed to be gay, but I don't think it ever gets to the point where she actually dates or fucks anyone.
