I am not done reading yet, but I am enjoying this very very very much! So here, have an upvote and my thanks and gratitude :)

Sassy, sarcastic "go fuck yourself" Potter (no matter if male or female) is always fun to read :)

Also: The femslash is not a requirement (hell, in this case - fem!Harry, I don't have as much a problem with HP/DM, a pairing I despise under normal circumstances (Harry just isn't a poofter for me, can't make that mental leap - despite being for gay rights, gay marriage, adoption rights for gays (don't know if that is good for the kids, but on the other hand: Better to grow up with great gay/lesbian parents than growing up without any parents at all!) etc...but I prefer watching/reading about lesbians instead of homosexual men, sorry))
