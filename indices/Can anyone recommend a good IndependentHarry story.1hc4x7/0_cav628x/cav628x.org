There are a lot of "old school" stories of this sort, as this was one of the most popular directions for fanfiction back in the long wait between books 5 and 6. I'll name a few chestnuts, linking to authors' pages, that match most of your desiderata:

- [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][Full Pensieve's]] Years of Rebellion. I believe that this is the story that started the Independent!Harry genre more than a decade ago.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern][jbern's]] work, particularly Bungle in the Jungle (and sequel), as well as his first story, To Fight the Coming Darkness.

- [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais's]] work, notably White Knight, Grey Queen and This Means War.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/708471/lorddwar][Lorddwar's]] Harry Potter and the Summer of Change.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/560192/Fayr-Warning][Fayr Warning's]] Reign of Power

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/614073/LordDragon73][Lorddragon73's]] Harry Potter and the Dance of the Warrior.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/530162/sib-ff][sib's]] The Awakening Power.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0's]] Rogue.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza's]] The Denarian Renegade (and its many sequels).
