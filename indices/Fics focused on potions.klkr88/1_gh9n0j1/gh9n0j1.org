Try RuneMaster by Tigerman. In this story Harry is a prodigy in Runes. He discovers that he can use his talents in Runes to distill the magical "essence" of various ingredients. Leaving him with concentrated, purified ingredients which he can then use in potions that he brews much quicker, with greater quality than the best a potion master could achieve. He gets Neville involved in using these techniques to grow the best quality plants to be used in potions.

So while runes are the primary component of this story potions is a pretty solid 2nd in importance. Well at least IMO
