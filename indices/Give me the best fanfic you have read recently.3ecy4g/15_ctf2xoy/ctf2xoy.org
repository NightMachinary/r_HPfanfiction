linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). I re-read it recently, and it's insanely good. Great, great dramatic writing by the author - she really makes you /feel/ what the characters feel, and that's what I LOVE about the writing in this fic. It does have some angsty stuff, but it never becomes bathos or Narmy at any point.

Oh, and the Alexandra Quick series is unbelievably good. If you can get past the first book.
