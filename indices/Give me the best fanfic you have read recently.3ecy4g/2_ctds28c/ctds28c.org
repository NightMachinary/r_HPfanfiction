I finished rereading linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) a few days ago, and two weeks before that it was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lives by thesanti). If you're looking for new HP fanfics, on the other hand, the only thing I've really liked recently is linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat).
