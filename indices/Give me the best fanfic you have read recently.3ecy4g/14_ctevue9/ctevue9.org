- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] - I was amazed by this and read it in one weekend.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/70/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]] - Unfinished and very dark but it captivated me. I try to avoid unfinished stories but I wanted to skim the first chapter whether I should put it on my future reading list, and ended up reading the entire thing (so far).
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] - A very sweet fic with a few dark moments in it that I am planning on re-reading, which I don't generally do with fanfiction
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9392428/1/Metamorphose][Metamorphose]] - Harry-turned-femharry with Lucius Malfoy, for what seemed like a really weird fic it became really nice and it actually made me cry at the ending.

Oops, seems like the bot was a bit quicker than my edit, sorry for that.
