My favorite recently is a next gen series, starting with linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation). The author is on the last book, the seventh book of the series. There is so much to read because of that--all six years! The one drawback is I think the first book is way too slow and plodding; however, it gets much better later on.
