I just finished reading linkffn(7429542) a few minutes ago. I normally don't read Drarry but I really liked how this was pulled off. Introduced some interesting ideas (which I'm a sucker for), and while the beginning of the story clearly states what one of the big events is, it doesn't really ruin it. I really recommend it.
