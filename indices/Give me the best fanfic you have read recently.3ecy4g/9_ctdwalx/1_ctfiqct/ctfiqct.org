Rent a Hero was alright. I didn't particularly like it, but one thing that I really loved about it was the whole thing with him reconciling with the Dursleys and Dudley's kid being magical. I think that type of thing is really moving and there was one other I read that did that where Harry was married to Daphne (who came off as a bit nuts to Dudley's family because she's this hilarious nasty pureblood type).
