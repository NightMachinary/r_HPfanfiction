Oh, speaking of Harry/Daphne, I also like the series that starts with Second Chances. The Legacy is good too, but to me it's been dragging a bit lately.

For other or no pairings, I just remembered The Green Girl, Sympathetic Properties, and Renegade. And, to top it all off, there's the Dangerverse . Geez, given how much I love to read, it's a miracle that I've accomplished anything.
