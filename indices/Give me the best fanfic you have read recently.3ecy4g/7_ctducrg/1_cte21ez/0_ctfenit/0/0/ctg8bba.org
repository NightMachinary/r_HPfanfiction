I mean I'm rather familiar with the language, but I don't know it. I picked things up here and there and I can recognize enough stuff that I've been able to watch an episode of an anime without looking and mostly get an idea of what's going on. I don't mind random bits of japanese even, but there's certain key words I see being thrown around in chapter 1 that are the ones that don't really impress much (basically words like kawaii and kakoii being used along with english as opposed to entire phrases). It also doesn't help that the oyabun is apparently named Musashi Miyamoto of all things and I still don't quite get why he was in England. It just comes off a bit awkward or maybe I'm just holding things to high standards still after reading PotDK
