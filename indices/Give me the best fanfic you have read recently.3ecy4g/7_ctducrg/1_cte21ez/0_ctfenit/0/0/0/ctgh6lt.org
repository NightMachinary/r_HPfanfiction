I'm not sure what PotDK is. Prince of the Dark Kingdom? If it is, then it might just be the different styles holding you up. Both authors do (in my opinion) a good amount of world-building, but their actual writing styles are just...different? I don't how else to describe it. The only thing I didn't like about 893 is more of a criticism of fanon in general, where people act as if Hermione never interacted with anyone within 10 years of her age as opposed to not having many (or any) friends.
