I think your comment ended up on the wrong post, haha. I actually do plan to read Blindness, at some point, but I'm drowning in good fics right now so it might be a while. I think I tried MOR at one point, but the first chapter or so came across like The Big Bang Theory - too concerned with getting people to recognize how smart it is at times.
