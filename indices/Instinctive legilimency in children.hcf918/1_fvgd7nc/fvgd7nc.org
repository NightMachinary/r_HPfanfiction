I've seen this done in a fic before. Disability fics are of great interest to me, so I apologise for the long and rambly psot.

My opinion is that it's the sort of thing people without disability come up with 'because it sounds cool' but is actually quite offensive. It falls very much into the myth that having a disability gives you some sort of superpower to compensate. It doesn't.

In some cases, it makes it more likely that you learn or develop a skill. For example, I'm a very good lipreader despite never being formally taught, but it's exhausting and often inaccurate. I also have enough hearing to be able to do this. Interestingly, I was probably though not certainly hoh from birth but nobody picked up on it until I was 6. In any case, my parents thought there was something off about me - maybe autism. It did turn out that I had autism too, though...

Similarly, deaf people are typically more responsive to stimulus peripheral but not central vision than hearing people, but it's most pronounced in those with experience with British Sign Language a visual language. As opposed to simply because they're deaf.

Regarding blindness:

" So what about the sighted viewers? What did they take away from watching the series? The fact that this guy is a superhero sums it up: you can't be independent unless you have some kind of exceptional powers. This also encourages the myth that blind people have super senses (which is false -- we simply rely on them more as we don't have vision). "

The problem is, if you put a character with a disablity into a fic but then immediately - or shortly into the story - give them a super hero then it comes across as just using the disability as a sympathy bid.

Still, let's suppose it's done with consideration.

You have a baby born deaf, they have no concept of sound and likely miss the crucial period for learning spoken language as a 'first' language without intervention. They're not going to naturally learn legitimacy because they're too young to understand that others are different to them.

So, then they grow older and slowly, with great difficulty struggle learn to legitimise. You have two major issues:

- Many people perceive their thoughts in a language. Certainly, it seemed that Harry had access to Snape's memory as a fixed event, rather than as a perception. In that case, can you legitimise a thought in another language?

- If you are legitimising current thoughts as thoughts - do you perceive what the speaker says, or what they wanted to say? If someone is actively thinking about what someone else says, do you understand what they say or what their opinion/interpretation of that was?

So, perhaps you need someone who gradually lost their hearing after they learnt to speak but young enough that they learn legitimacy naturally. (Adults tend to need to be taught lipreading.) Potentially, in this case, the person never fully realised they went deaf until after they'd lost all their hearing - it seemed to them that other people were mumblers or so on.

The most common hearing loss is a slope with high frequencies the most deaf and low the least. So, they can still here some sounds quite well but carry the common misconception that deafness means you can't hear at all.

In this case, you probably end up with a period where they couldn't legitimise and slowly became more accurate. The result would be gaps in their language which may or may not go unnoticed. *Maybe some people thing something is 'off' but can't quite put their finger on it.* Plus, the character has a weird level and focus of eye contact. (Much like me concentrating on lips, lol.)

Much like lipreading, they use it to fill in gaps in what they can hear except that maybe it only works when they're looking directly at them, especially if it's a 1 to 1 conversation. Group conversations could be tricky because the speaker keeps looking at different people, so this person tries to keep to the best spot to manage eye contact with as many people as possible, except it can be quite dizzying because every so often those people go off on a tangential thought and suddenly you're led into potions class last Tuesday.

Maybe the person has a struggle trying to filter out the thoughts of a person, as sometimes they respond to what the person thought and not said, plus trying not to be too offended by the inside thoughts of many.
