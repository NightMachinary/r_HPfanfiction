You make a really good point about the sort of daredevil-like tropes that seem to pop up in fiction with disabled characters. I understand that the myth of ‘super senses' are often a major issue with the portrayed of disabled characters, so thanks for pointing that out.

I was more posting this as a prompt because I have read fanfic that attempts to do this, and becomes instantly cliche. I think I read something where Harry went blind and then somehow acquired the ability to sense the ‘magical signature' of objects. Essentially, it completely erased the impact being blind would have had on him/his character arc and was, as you pointed out, a sympathy bid.

I also read something where Tom Riddle compensates for his difficulty understanding emotionally-driven actions by using legilimency, which made more objective sense and fit his character. I was wondering if someone had insight into how something similar would play out with a deaf/blind character.

Your response was sort of exactly what I was looking for, as in, how would something like this actually play out? Under what circumstances might this occur? What impacts/implications would it have? Etc. So thanks! Appreciate the long, thorough response.
