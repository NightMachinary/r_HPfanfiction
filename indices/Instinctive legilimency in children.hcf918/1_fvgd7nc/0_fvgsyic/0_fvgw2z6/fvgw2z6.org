I'm glad you found it helpful, I quite enjoy having to think around ideas.

The fic with Tom Riddle sounds very interesting. Do you have a link?

I agree that it's very hard to find fic that manages to cover disability without it becoming cliche. There's a few good ones but they tend to be hard to find, especially for blindness or deafness.
