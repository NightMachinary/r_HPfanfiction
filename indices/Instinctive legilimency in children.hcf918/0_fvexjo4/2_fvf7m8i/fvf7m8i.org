Unless there is an AU element to the story, like having this instinctive form of legilimency be capable of interacting with the "soul" of an object, which is often used to explain how a transfigured object is not just that object, but is always called "transfigured". So by doing this, the child would be able to percieve objects and people around them as clusters of thought - objects as very simple, very basic "I am a chair" or "I am a table", plants as stronger, slightly more complex versions of the same, animals as more complex, moving clusters, and finally sapient creatures as blindingly complicated, extremely complex arrays of thought that are constantly moving and changing.

There would be a lot of things one can do with this.

- because the child has no reference point, their legilimency does not originate from their eyes, but rather their brain, meaning they would likely be able to "see" all around.

- Because of how they percieve objects, there would be nothing transparent (save air and water, which arguably is the same "thing" all across the planet/its lake/river.

- They might be able to percieve magic, too, but I would develop this ability over time rather than just put it in the story for shits and giggles.

- They might have to learn that legilimizing people, even passively without consent is wrong, and learn to "percieve" everything /but/ sapients, instead seeing them by the hole they leave in their perception.

- They might even have this as a code of morals themselves

- Legilimency of people takes practice and is a harrowing process, so I wouldn't give them the ability to mind read just willy nilly. In the beginning, they can only see that someone is /there/, but their mind is too complex and has too many unknown, moving parts to actually invade.

- They might be able to percieve other legilimencers, too - their mind seems to be less contained, spiking outwards.

- They would not be able to read - at first. It might only be a matter of perspective: instead of seeing the ink and the paper, what if they saw the ink on the paper?
