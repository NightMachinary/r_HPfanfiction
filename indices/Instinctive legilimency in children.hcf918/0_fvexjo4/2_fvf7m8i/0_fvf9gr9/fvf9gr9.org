Right, so it would take many many nonsensical changes to make sense, which is a bit of a catch-22.

Little confused through. Are you implying that objects have souls in the canonical HP world or that they would have souls in an AU designed to support this concept? Because souls in the canonical HP world are limited to the sentient (and even more limited than that). For example, ghosts who have memories and are sentient do no possess souls. Neither do paintings. No souls in objects, though I would agree that there is a "fundamental nature" when it comes to transfigured objects, however permanent the transfiguration may be.

The original prompt is a cool showerthought but it falls apart from even a little bit of consideration. That's okay but it is a bit indicative of the plague of low-quality prompts Taure posted about recently.
