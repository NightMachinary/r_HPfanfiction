You'd need an actual good battle rapper to write this, because kindergarten disses are way more painful to read than regular insults, particularly when there's a difference between straight disses and actually well-crafted punchlines and wordplays.

Unfortunately, I think the cross-over in the Venn Diagram of "actually good battle rappers" and "Harry Potter fan fiction writers" might be kind of small.
