The fanfiction bot really needs to get fixed...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading is by White Squirrel]]: It's a story that uses the plot of 'characters find the Harry Potter books and read them', but actually has the revelations cause big changes in the present-day plot.

Unfortunately, it only covers book 1 (though that's enough to get Umbridge deposed and Voldemort's survival revealed), though another author started a sequel, A Sensational Story, which I'm too lazy to look up at the moment.
