What happens to Barty Crouch Jr?

IMO, he's a far far better candidate in taking this role. Even if Draco Malfoy is out for revenge, it would take him at least two or three decades to build up enough strength. Unless this Draco grows up under significant hardship and becomes totally different than in canon, he will not be going very far. Ambition without courage and hard work is nothing but a pipe dream.
