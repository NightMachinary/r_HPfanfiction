Dumbledore taking tough actions against Death Eaters would certainly prompt some of them to seek out Voldemort, and Snape could in fact lead them.

Once Voldemort is found and secured in a weak homunculus body, Snape will poison every Death Eater under him and stun the weak Voldemort behind his back.

Then Dumbledore will ruthlessly interrogate Voldemort about his every secret, obliviate him back to his infancy, petrify him, and lock him away behind ward stronger than Nurmengard. Snape will go on to earn Merlin Order of the First Class.

As for Death Eater descendants and relatives trying to take revenge, it's going to happen too after canon. Or are you of the opinion that sadistic genocidal mass murderers should not be punished because you fear revenge from their relatives?
