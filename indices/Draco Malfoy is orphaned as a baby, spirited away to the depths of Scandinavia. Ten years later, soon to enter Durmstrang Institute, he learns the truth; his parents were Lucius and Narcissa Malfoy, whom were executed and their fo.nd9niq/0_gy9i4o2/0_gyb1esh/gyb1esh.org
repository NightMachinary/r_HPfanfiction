Mm...would Draco learn that, though? Given the Imperius is real and dangerous, along with who-knows-how-many-other brainwashing charms and potions, would he be more likely to believe that his birth parents were guilty perpetrators or innocent victims? Would it be possible to prove it either way?\\

On the seizure of wealth, on one hand the victims of the Death Eaters and Voldemort do deserve to be compensated, and that would add up to a lot of money indeed, but on the other hand many of these Death Eaters did have young children (implying either they weren't imperiused, or that Voldemort had a /really/ twisted mind) who don't deserve to be left with nothing, and total asset forfeiture/attainder is kind of a perverse incentive to ensure as many Death Eaters and "Death Eaters" are convicted and executed as possible.
