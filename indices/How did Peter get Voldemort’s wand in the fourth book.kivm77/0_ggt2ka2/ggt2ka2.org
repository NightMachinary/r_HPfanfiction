I think it makes sense that Pettigrew joined Voldemort on his trip to Godric's Hollow (at least for Voldemort to be sure he is not bluffing), so he might be actually the very first ho came to the scene of crime and picked up the wand. Sirius, Hagrid, and Snape (is this the correct order?) came only after him. Then he hide it somewhere, and picked it up only after the end of PoA.
