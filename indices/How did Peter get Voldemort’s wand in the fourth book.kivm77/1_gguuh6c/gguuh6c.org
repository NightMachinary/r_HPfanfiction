When you solve that question, I have another one to give you: where was Peter hiding that wand for all those years until Voldemort's return?

JKR handwaved these plot points, which makes it harder to come up with a very good answer to them. She gave this answer in a web chat, but it brings up its own set of questions:

  Wormtail, desperate to curry favour, salvaged it from the place it had fallen and carried it to him. I admit that would have been a bit of a feat for a rat, but they are highly intelligent creatures!

I think someone experienced like Dumbledore or an auror like Moody would've checked, so it's unlikely the wand was there in Godric's Hollow the whole time.
