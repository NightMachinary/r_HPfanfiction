Of course it doesn't make sense. The entire "blood" thing is nonsense to begin with... it's nothing but an excuse to put on airs and claim you're superior to other people. I always thought that was the entire point of it.

The term "blood traitor" comes in when self-declared purebloods, who do consider Muggle marriages reprehensible, describe families or individuals whom they feel SHOULD share that reprehension, but don't. Hence, the Malfoys call the Weasleys "blood traitors" rather than "purebloods" because without the attitude they don't really "count."

I'm not 100% sure, but I think that whenever the terms "pureblood" or "blood traitor" appear in canon, they're used either by people like the Malfoys, Blacks or Death Eaters, or in reference to how they see things. Like, I don't think any Weasleys ever call themselved "purebloods." Ron calls himself a "blood traitor" at one point, but he basically says it as a point of pride and in reference to what the Death Eater thinks of him... kind of like how Hermione might ironically called herself "Mudblood" when summing up what the Malfoys think of her.
