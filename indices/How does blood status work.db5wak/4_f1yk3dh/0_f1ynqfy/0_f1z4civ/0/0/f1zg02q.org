I stand by my previous statement. Most of these seem to be either in response to, or referring to, the Voldemort/Malfoyesque ideals, not as an official classification status. When Ron says Ginny is a Pureblood, he's saying it because he can't make sense of why the Pureblood-obsessed Heir of Slytherin would target her; Sirius is talking about the vaues of his family, who were total bigots; Lupin is using the word "Pureblood" to explain to Harry why James would not have called himself "Half-Blood Prince." For the rest of the example, it seems to be either a Slytherin who says it, or it's said as protection against and/or defense against someone with those values. It's hardly ever used seriously by people who aren't blood bigots.

"Blood status" is a concept that's complete bull, and it's an attitude that I definitely see the narrative disagreeing with. Trying to make sense of it is pretty much a hopeless task... but not because JKR didn't think it through. It's just because it's rooted in bigotry and elitism, and those things, by nature, DON'T make logical sense.
