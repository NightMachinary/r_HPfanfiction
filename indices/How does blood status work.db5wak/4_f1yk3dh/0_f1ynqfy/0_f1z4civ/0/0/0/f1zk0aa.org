OK, let us agree to disagree. Of course, blood status is a BS in terms that lineage doesn't make anybody more capable, wiser, etc. Two of my wife's grandparents were the Auschwitz survivors (and our kids would still fall under the NÃ¼rnberg laws), so I can fully agree with that. However, it is not nonsense meaning it doesn't have rational construct behind it. Nazis had pretty well defined what does it mean to be an Untermensch, and I suppose that Tom Riddle & co. had pretty well defined what does it mean to be pureblood. Except JKR has never explained it to us well.
