See [[https://paste.gnome.org/pmrhdglj2]] (search of the word “pureblood” in all JKR books and The Cursed Child). I see for example Ron in CoS mentioning that Ginny was pureblood. Or Sirius in OotP calling himself and Weasleys (particularly Molly and Arthur) purebloods. Lupin in HBP calls James pureblood. Etc. etc.
