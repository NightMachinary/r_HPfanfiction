[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][According to Pottermore canon,]] blood status beyond Muggle/Magical has nothing to do with biology, but with political alignment. The average wizard doesn't ask or care about other people's blood status, and the only ones who make a big deal about it are a certain minority of purebloods.

  "To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent (â€˜I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact."

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][And according to JKR,]] all muggleborns are descended from squibs and other wizards. So technically, they count as halfbloods since they have magical ancestry from at least one side of the family. It's only because of political/social reasons that they're called "muggleborns" and treated like poop.

  *J.K. Rowling:* Muggle-borns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The gene re-surfaces in some unexpected places.
