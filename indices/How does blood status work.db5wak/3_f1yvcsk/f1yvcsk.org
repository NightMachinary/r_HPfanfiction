My own preference is to have the pure-bloods themselves disagree over what being pure-blood means. I feel like this adds both complexity and realism.

  “We discussed this before,” Pansy said impatiently. “Lily Potter was a Muggleborn. That makes Vicky a half-blood. Maybe she was attacked because she's in Slytherin... you know, cleaning house and all that.” She glanced quickly at Victoria. “Not that I'm saying that's right, of course.”

  But Daphne shook her head. “That's not how it works, though. One marriage doesn't just get rid of all your family history. She's still a Potter.”

  It was an old argument.

  Having spent over a year in Slytherin, Victoria was no stranger to discussions about blood. It was just something that wizards tended to mention when they first met someone, like where they came from or what their parents did. It had always seemed perfectly harmless, and even though her mother was a Muggleborn, no one had ever treated her differently for it.

  Something had changed since the attack on Justin, however. Blood was no longer simply a matter of bragging rights---it was the difference between whether or not you were a target. Yet as she listened to Pansy and Daphne bicker, Victoria was reminded that even among pure-bloods, no one could really agree on who counted as part of the club. For some, like Daphne, it was all about your family name: the Potters were an old wizarding family, so anyone who bore their name was a pure-blood. For others, like Pansy, even a small amount of Muggle blood could ruin an otherwise impeccable lineage.

  Draco was conspicuously silent.

  “What do you think, Draco?” Victoria said, interrupting Pansy's increasingly complex hypothetical in which she had married a Muggle and all her children were squibs. “Am I half or pure?”

  “Can I ask you something?” Victoria said.

  “By all means.”

  She told Dumbledore all about the conversation with Pansy, Daphne and Draco regarding the purity of her blood; about her fears that the other pure-bloods would laugh at her, if she claimed to be one of them; and her concern that sooner or later she would have to provide Draco with an answer. Dumbledore listened to her story attentively, his eyes only leaving her own to glance down at his plate between bites.

  “So what do you think, Professor? Am I a half-blood, or a pure-blood?”

  If he thought her question was a silly one, he didn't show it. “Before I answer---and I will answer---it is educational, I think, to consider what purpose these distinctions serve. As I have understood it, you are not suggesting that your magical talent would be greater if you were a so-called pure-blood .”

  “No,” Victoria said, not having even considered that idea.

  Dumbledore steepled his fingers. “Nor are you suggesting that your moral character depends on your blood.”

  She shook her head.

  “And so, if it does not tell us anything about your magic or your character, what is it that your blood is supposed to indicate?”

  Victoria frowned, searching for the right words, but Dumbledore answered the question for her.

  “It is your social status,” he said. “In truth, the concept of purity of blood is inextricably linked to the idea of social class. With that in mind, I would invite you to consider which is more important: a person's character and deeds, or the family they are born to.”

  He paused to take a bite of chicken.

  “When you put it like that, it seems kinda obvious,” Victoria said. In fact, it was so easy to follow the logic of his words that it took her a moment to realise that none of what he had said actually solved her problem.

  Dumbledore smiled. “It is not my place to tell you what to believe, only to equip you with the knowledge to form your own views. But so much for the principle of the matter---I promised you a straight answer to your question.”

  She leaned forward eagerly.

  “Regretfully, we must learn to navigate a society where supposed purity of blood matters to many people,” Dumbledore said. “If you will forgive me, this requires something of a history lesson. You see, soon after the Statute of Secrecy was passed, separation from Muggles came to be regarded as a point of /wizarding pride/, a concept which has only increased in popularity since Grindelwald's defeat. The division of worlds has affected all areas of life, but familial connections to Muggles have long been viewed as especially suspect---indeed, in many wizarding nations, it is still illegal for a wizard to marry a Muggle.”

  “Because they might tell the Muggles about wizards?” Victoria asked.

  “That was the original reasoning,” Dumbledore said. “However, the culture of separation quickly took on a life of its own, and wizarding pride has come to be valued in its own right. It is by this circuitous route that we come to the concept of purity. As you know, the British Ministry has never made intermarriage illegal---”

  “France too, right?”

  “---nor has France, nor several other European nations. But not everyone believed in such a liberal approach. In the early eighteenth century, a new elite rose to power, largely replacing the old wizarding nobility whose authority had derived from the Muggle king. The families composing that elite are now considered /traditionalists/, but in those days they were quite radical.”

  “You're talking about Brandon Swann, aren't you?” Victoria said, “the founder of the Ministry? We learnt about him in History.”

  “He was their leader, but he did not act alone. Indeed, your own ancestor, one Ralston Potter, was a key supporter of the Swanns,” Dumbledore said. “In their zeal for wizarding independence, the traditionalists swore a pact never to marry a Muggle, holding themselves to a stricter standard than the law required. And thus the pure-blood ideology was born, an idea which had previously existed as no more than a small movement on the fringe of wizarding society. In the years following the Statute of Secrecy, to remain pure-blooded was to advertise your family's commitment to wizarding pride, and thereby gain the favour of those in power.”

  “So... I'm a half-blood, then?” Victoria said, surprised at the depth of her disappointment. It would have been nice to fit in with the other girls. “My dad married a Muggleborn, and that's a connection to the Muggle world, isn't it?”

  Dumbledore raised a bushy eyebrow. “It is not quite so simple. Think about what I have said... who was it that first promoted the idea of blood purity?”

  “The traditionalists,” she said, the wheels turning in her head, connecting what he had said to Daphne's views. “You're saying that for the traditionalists, your family comes first. Like, maybe a family breaks the pact now and then... but they're still part of the group who made the pact in the first place.”

  “Precisely. Over the years, the traditionalist families have stuck together, even as they lost their monopoly on power. In many ways they resemble the old aristocracy which they replaced, though they never adopted the Muggle titles of nobility which their enemies had borne. It is this aristocratic aspect which is the cause of the disagreement between Miss Parkinson and Miss Greengrass.”

  “Pansy's just thinking about blood,” Victoria said, “but Daphne's right, isn't she? If the Potters were one of the families who made the pact, then we're older than the /idea/ of purity.”

  “That is the /traditionalist/ view,” Dumbledore said. He paused to pour himself a glass of white wine, taking several sips before he continued. “There is, however, a more modern viewpoint, one which attained popularity among the traditionalist youth in the years following Grindelwald's fall. It was an uncompromising ideology, in some ways more liberal, in others more conservative. That view espoused a greater separation from the Muggle world than even the traditionalists had envisaged... no one would be able to cross the divide, not even Muggleborns. Under this radical view, those of wizarding blood who embraced the new ways would be welcomed with open arms, the equal of any pure-blood, no matter their family name; but those who associated with Muggles, even indirectly, would be considered tainted by association.”

  “That sounds more like Draco,” Victoria said.

  “In part,” Dumbledore said, his expression pensive. “I suspect that Master Malfoy has been exposed to a number of ideologies, and has attempted to piece them together in a way that makes sense in his particular familial context.”

  It didn't escape Victoria that he still hadn't answered her question. “So... the answer is... Daphne and Draco are both right? Is that what you're saying?”

  “Forgive an old man's ramblings,” Dumbledore said with a chuckle. “My answer is this: were you to choose to participate in so-called pure-blood society, you would likely be welcomed by traditionalists and radicals alike. However, as you have already intimated, your treatment thereafter would largely depend on your ability to conform to their understanding of how witches and wizards should behave.”
