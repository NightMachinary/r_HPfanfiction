This is my personal headcanon. This is strictly term-wise, I consider the entire ordeal scientifically bs.

A Muggleborn is someone born from 2 Muggles. A Pureblood has no Muggles within 2 generations of ancestry. Everyone else is a halfblood. So Harry's children are Purebloods if he procreates with a Pureblood or some halfbloods. Meanwhile, Severus, who is also a halfblood, cannot create Pureblood children since his father is a Muggle.

This means that 2 Muggleborns birth halfbloods. If this halfblood procreates with another halfblood with Muggleborn parents, their child is a first generation Pureblood.

EDIT: This made me curious about the obvious German analogy for Jewish heritage. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test]] , they used similar, but not identical definitions (the German rules are more complicated) -- they both concern themselves with 2 generations of ancestry. This is probably what my headcanon was ultimately based on (by proxy in some fic).
