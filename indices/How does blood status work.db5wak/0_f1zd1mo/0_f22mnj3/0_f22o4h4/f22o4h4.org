You guys are launching into some complicated head-canons instead of actually listening to Rowling's words about the world she imagined. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pure-blood#cite_note-harry-3]]

I realize that Deathly Hallows' muggleborn oppression doesn't match with that, but what Rowling says in the linked text matches with how muggle-born and half-bloods are treated in the previous books. Muggleborn with derision and half-bloods tolerated, if they don't cause trouble. Remember that not every pureblood was a Death Eater. Many, most even, were just mildly judgemental of muggleborn.
