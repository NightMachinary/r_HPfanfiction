According to Rowling herself, pure-blood society accepted people as "pure-blood" when they could claim that both parents and all four grandparents were magical. Therefore Harry's children are pure-bloods by this standard, as all four of their grandparents were magical.

The Malfoy family are an example of a pure-blood lineage who occasionally married half-bloods, as the children of this union would be considered pure-bloods if all four grandparents were magical.
