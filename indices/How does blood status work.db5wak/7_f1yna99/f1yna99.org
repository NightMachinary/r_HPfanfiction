This is one many questions which JKR apparently never developed through. Fanon opinions range from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred][Thoroughbred horse]]-like (i.e., only two purebloods could birth another pureblood, end of the story; most wizards are therefore half-bloods, and there are some muggleborns) to something like “you have to have N generations wizards in your family to be considered pureblood”, where N starts from 1, but most often it is 4.
