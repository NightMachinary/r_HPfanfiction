  If Hermione hadn't been saved by Harry (and Ron but as he's the cause of the problem... meh),

Woah now. Ron delivered the knockout blow. call it a draw at worst.

  And if Harry had been there in Tom's time, would he have saved Myrtle in one way or another?

I don't think so. The victims in Harry's time got incredibly lucky. Puddles, cameras, armor, mirrors, it's all too convenient. Myrtle got killed in the girl's bathroom. A place Harry wouldn't dare go in there without reason, a reason such as an abandoned one with a ghost with incredibly useful and relevant information.
