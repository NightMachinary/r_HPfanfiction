Now I want to see this. A Hermione who became a ghost because she could not stand the thought of not getting to learn what Hogwarts taught.

- Ghost Hermione attending all of the classes.\\
- Ghost Hermione following the Bloody Baron around bugging him for his history.\\
- Ghost Hermione haunting the library.\\
- Ghost Hermione looking out for Luna.
