I'm getting confused by my fics so maybe someone can help me out, but I remember a fic that has this in it. I think it's a WIP, and basically Harry (I think?) finds a way by using the elixir from the Resurrection Stone (after Flamel's wife gave it to him to use). But there is only enough to save one of them. I don't want to spoil too much but if anyone could find this I'd appreciate the assist.
