That's right. Thank you so much. Oh and how disappointing, it's not a WIP. It's that great story that really took a turn at the end and seemed to be setting up a great story but jbern never picked it back up.

Has anyone ever tried to pick this up in jbern's stead? Or just made sequels based off of this storyline anyways? I would love to read a good continuation of this story.
