Do you mind if it's a very minor part of the fic? I almost don't want to rec this fic because 99% of the fic has nothing to do with this, but linkffn(debt of time by shayalonnie) has this.

I also want to mention linkffn(the art of self-fashioning). Harry (who is not the BWL) has parents with brain damage, and he's going to heal their brains through transfiguration. A very . . . odd fic, because of Harry's unusual characterization. It's not there yet, but has been updating weekly for a very long time now, so the author will get there eventually.
