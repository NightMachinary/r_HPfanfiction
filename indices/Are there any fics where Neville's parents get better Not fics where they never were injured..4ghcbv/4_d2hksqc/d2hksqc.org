I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4188012/1/Sharingan-Harry-Book-One-A-New-Bloodline][Sharingan Harry]], a 4 part series so far (forth book is incomplete and hasn't been updated and doesn't look like it's going to be any time soon sadly, which is a shame since the enemies Harry faces are only finally getting interesting- magicals mostly being no challenge for ninja training), where in harry has the Sharingan eyes from Naruto- and it's a fairly decent crossover in my opinion though I'm sure most will disagree with that, Harry casually notices and mentions the cause of the Longbottom's states to Neville- in such a disregarding and somewhat insulting manor that Neville tries to attack him for it- but it turns out to be true- and they're soon cured.
