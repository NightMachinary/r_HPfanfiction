Aside from Northumbrian's work, which has already been mentioned, I'll add little0bird's series. What she does well is make us really care about these characters but as normal everyday people, not as soldiers in a war. I also think her earlier stuff (that is, the stories that took place closest to the end of the war) did a good job of creating organic drama based on character development over your typical good vs evil story. For example, I think she is the only writer I've come across that made Ginny's strong desire for independence (which is a very canon-Ginny characteristic) into a dramatic story about her relationship with Harry and herself.
