Ten years ago, just after /Deathly Hallows/ came out, I wrote this fanfic, /[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/latis_mesler/2017_.html][2017]]/, in which the Harry from book one travels forward in time to the epilogue era. I remember at the time I was thinking that Harry-time-travels-to-the-next-generation stories would soon become commonplace and I was counting myself very cutting edge to be one of the first, maybe /the/ first, to write a fic in that genre.

I've just reread the thing for the first time in years and I think it stands up reasonably well from a writing perspective. It was canon-compliant at the time (with Harry receiving a Memory Charm at the end so he doesn't remember traveling to the future), but that's since been shot to hell by /The Cursed Child/. Most notably, the plot doesn't work unless Albus Potter is in Gryffindor. Also, I made some predictions, most of which have turned out to be amusingly inaccurate, about what the Muggle world would be like by 2017. Enjoy!
