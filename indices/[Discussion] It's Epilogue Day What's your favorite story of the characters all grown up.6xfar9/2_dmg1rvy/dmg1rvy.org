I'd like to add the "It's Tea Time" series by frombluetored. Has some of the funniest and wittiest humor I've seen in a while, and I love the depiction of Harry and Ginny's relationship.

Though not canon compliant, YelloWitchGrl's "The Space Between," which is also excellent. The plot includes some really dark subject matter however.
