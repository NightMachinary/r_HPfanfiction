- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian stories]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on; some pre-war stories are good as well, but he shines most in the post-war ones).
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Stories by Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter)

These two I consider classics in the canon post-war stories.
