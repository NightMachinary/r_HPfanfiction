I like the idea that some of the ancient British and Irish universities (I picked Oxford, St Andrews, Edinburgh and Dublin) have magical colleges/departments which were hidden from muggle students post-Statute, but allow magical students to mix with the muggle world if they wish. In my hc there are also some magic-only universities, but these are generally a lot more specialised and somewhere that you'd go to if you wanted to study Healing, for example.

In the spirit of the OWL and NEWT naming conventions, I've gone with BAT (Basic Advanced Tutelage; equivalent of a Bachelors), ASP (Additional Strenuous Pedagogy; Masters), and EEL (Extraneous Edification for Laudation; PhD).
