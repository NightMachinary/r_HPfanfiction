I personally don't think that the Magical World has any formal Higher Education. If the NEWT are enough for jobs like Healer or Auror, I don't see what career could necessite a Higher Level Diploma to even apply. All the careers seem to train the new employees after hiring.

I also prefer the concept of Apprenticeship, where someone may go to live under a more experiment wizard to learn under him. It's because this system has a base a canon (with Dumbledore who studied Alchemy under the Flamels for a while), and because it "feels" more magical than some "Magical University".

But while I'm not a big fan of the idea, it's still an idea that can be interesting if well treated, though there are very few fics that talk about it.
