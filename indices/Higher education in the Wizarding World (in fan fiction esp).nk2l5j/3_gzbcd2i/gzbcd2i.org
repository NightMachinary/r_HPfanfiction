The thing is, apprenticeship is way more logical for all sorts of reasons; it feels more magical, it is somewhat old-fashioned like the magical world is, it's more suitable for the very small and specialised magical community, it's more practical in many ways than university education today, and it's more prevalent in technical fields IRL than you'd expect. E.g. medical housemanship, pupillage in law, and articleship in accounting.

TLDR it's a little difficult to write a HP University world that makes sense. Because the opposite is much more sensible.
