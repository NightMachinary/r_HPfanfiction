In one of my fics, Lily Luna reads “Wizarding Education Around the World.” It details the 11 major Wizarding schools (UK, France, Norway, Russia, USA, Brazil, Uganda, Japan, China, India and Australia.) I also added magical schools in Jerusalem and Baghdad for people of all ages, combining wizardry with religious teachings. I also included academies of magic in Rome (defensive magic) Athens (magizoology) and Alexandria (spell creation.) These societies seemed too ancient to not have their own magical institutions.
