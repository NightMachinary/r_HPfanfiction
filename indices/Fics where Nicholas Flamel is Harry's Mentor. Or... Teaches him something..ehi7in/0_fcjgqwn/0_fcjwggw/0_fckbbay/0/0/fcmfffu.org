If you havent read it yet Im going to do it and see if I can finish it. Ill report back with my findings

Edit: Haven't finished it yet but the first chapter is really good. Harry seems more studious, quiet, and observing of people. That's all I'll say.

Edit 2: Completely done now. I think this might be one of my favorite stories. Harry is basically super interested in adventuring the world. Lots of rune stuff. It ended a little abruptly but I would 100% recommend it to anyone. 9/10. Would be 10/10 if it were longer.
