I've not finished it yet, but I feel like 9/10 is being generous. It feels fairly tropey, with a moderately sueish HP and some questionable plot choices, namely the forced [[#s][spoiler]], and the pacing is kinda weird.

All that said, it /is/ an enjoyable fic. Solid dialogue, fun characters, mostly reasonable explanations for why Wizarding Britain seems to be collectively braindead and reasonable attempts to fix it. I give it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. I'd rank it higher except the pacing makes it hard for me to really get into the fic.
