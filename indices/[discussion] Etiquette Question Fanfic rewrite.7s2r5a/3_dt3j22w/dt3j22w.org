I think this is a great way to learn to write. Obviously, with something like fan fiction, we put our work out there hoping people won't rip it to shreds, so I think it's good that you asked for the writer's permission. But this is more or less what I've done in writing workshops with published pieces. Not a line-by-line edit, but taking apart a piece of fiction that works well in order to see /why/ it works well. Looking closely at work that you respect is a great learning strategy, particularly if you don't know where to start actually writing. If someone asked me to do this with my work, I would be honored. I would consider it a mark of how good they think my work is, that they want to learn from it. I hope the author gives you permission, and I would love to see the Tumblr about your experience if she does. :)
