That seems very very rude and inappropriate to steal someone else's work and then just start changing it for yourself? Are you going to ask them if you can do that? If they say no, will you still do it? If you are intimidated about writing a story yourself, then don't write it at all, but leave someone else's work alone either way! Or just write your own story anyway and see how it turns out.
