I understand that it might come off that way, which is why I wanted to inquire with the community. The goal was not to "steal" the author's work (as I indicated to the author via message, we are more than happy to not post the completed work on the internet) but to practice working together on a piece of writing with which we are both familiar.

As I posted above, I just messaged the author to ask for permission. If the author says no, we will not continue to edit the piece (and certainly won't post about it on the Internet). Obviously we want to be respectful. I interpret what we're doing as paying homage to a master of the genre by examining their work, its strengths and flaws, to learn ourselves how to create a work. But if the author responds asking us to refrain from editing their piece, we will of course not edit it further.

Even if the author says yes, we don't intend to publish the entire piece. We would simply post excerpts of the material on which we are working on Tumblr, which would make the original work identifiable. That is my primary motive for asking -- I can't imagine finding a random website picking apart my work!
