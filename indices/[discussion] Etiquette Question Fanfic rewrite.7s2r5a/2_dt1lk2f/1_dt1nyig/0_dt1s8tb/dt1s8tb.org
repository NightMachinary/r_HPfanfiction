Yea, that's not wrong, but I think my case is particularly egregious because I'm not just borrowing characters and scenarios, I'm rewriting lines. My primary concern is that the author will be like, "well, I didn't ask you to beta me, this is super rude," which is totally fair. Candidly my early edits of this piece are kind of harsh and I totally don't want to be a jerk
