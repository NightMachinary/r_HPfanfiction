Ha! Great question. She traveled back with Harry. Thankfully, the backstory is explained fairly quickly in the first scene in about 300 words. In summary, it's 2007 and the war has basically been won by Voldemort (I would have loved to have more backstory about this part). Traveling back is a last ditch effort by Harry and Daphne to change things.
