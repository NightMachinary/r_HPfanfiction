I think just go with it. What you're suggesting all sounds fine, but a bit of advice: Readers of fanfiction prefer canon characters, even if they're OOC. So you might want to use a blank slate side character for your OC (like Dean, or Blaze, etc.) or just make it Harry. You don't have to try too hard to match personalities either since this is the kind of thing that would really mess someone up.

(I personally would love reading about a Ghost Rider Harry!)
