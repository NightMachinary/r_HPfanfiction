every fucking Slytherin fic that features one of these:

- Ron instantly becomes a snarling arsehole to Harry after sorting, regardless of previous interaction with the two where they're friendly

- Hermione still shows up in the bathroom and is like, the one friend of Harry's that isn't from Slytherin

- everyone despises Harry over one incident

- ice queen Daphne eventually becomes Harry's gf

- hardass muggleborn Tracey, who is the alternative to Daphne

- some bullshit about house solidarity and problems stay within the house from Snape or a prefect
