Grey/Dark Slytherin Fem!Harry Stories are on of my favourite's But when these things get added, it just pissed me off.

*Befriends Hermione or any other muggleborns, to show that she isn't racist.

*Befriends the Weasley twins because pranks are funny!

*Becomes a prankster because she has ''maurader's blood'' in her veins.

*Gets enraged because a random Slytherin yells mudblood
