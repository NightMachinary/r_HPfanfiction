Actually, I don't like it when people put down a precise height for Harry, because it breaks my sod a little bit and I can't really explain why. In my mind he's average height for an adult male and Ron is a shockingly tall ginger monstrosity who would be on a basketball team if he was a muggle. This might not be true, but it's just how I picture them and I like them that way.
