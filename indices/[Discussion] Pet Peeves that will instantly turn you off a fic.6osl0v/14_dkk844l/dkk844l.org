It irritates me when Harry is described as a midget. Even worse is when he's shorter than his father.

It is shown twice that he's as tall as his father. Once during Snape's memory in OOTP (within an inch of James), and another in the forest in DH when Harry (at 17) is described exactly the same height as his father (at 21).

And the thing is that James was depicted as tall at least 3 times. Twice by Harry (in the mirror scene and when he comes out of Voldemort's wand), and even by Voldemort himself (in the 1981 flashback thing).

Look, I'm fine with making Harry small as a child (because he was), but small as an adult? I can't stand that.

And I'm not saying that he should be some 7 foot giant, but /please/ at /least/ make him average in height.

Sorry, I had to get that out of my system.
