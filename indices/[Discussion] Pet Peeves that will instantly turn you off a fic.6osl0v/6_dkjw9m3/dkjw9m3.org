Basically anything thaf makes me think "why doesnt everyone just do that?"

For example, when a character swears on their life/magic that something is true. If a character could do that, how can anyone ever lie? Just ask them to "swear on their life and magic" and you're set. No one can ever really lie to anyone about anything remotely serious.

DP&SW's use of the fidelius was almost like that at one point, until the author nerfed it heavily.

This is also an issue I have with canon itself at time to be fair, which is why i love it when fics explain why certain seemingly overpowered magics aren't actually world-breaking. One if my favorite headcanons is Occulmency beating Veritasium (which explains the need for courts and detectives ans why they can't just give everyone Veritasium).
