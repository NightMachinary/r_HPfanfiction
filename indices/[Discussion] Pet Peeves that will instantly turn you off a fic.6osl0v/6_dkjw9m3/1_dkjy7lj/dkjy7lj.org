agreed on first and third points, Wizards having the ability to swear on their magic on the spot to prove truth takes any subterfuge and mystery away from any compelling storyline, and really is a bastardized version of an unbreakable vow from canon. Fidelius I think is ruined by the ability to be your own secret keeper. (honestly not sure if this is canon or not)
