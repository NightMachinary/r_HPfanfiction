I have multiple pet peeves, and it sometimes depends on my mood as to what will turn me off a fic first. But the first one the popped to mind tonight? Hermione being called Mia / Mya / etc. Just nope.

Dumbledore bashing...depends on my mood.

Weasley bashing...depends on my mood.

Harry being raised by goblins or a Potter house elf or by Potter ancestors via portraits...depends on my mood.

Harem fics...those are usually a no. Very rare for me to even try one.
