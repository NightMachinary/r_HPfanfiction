Overuse of the word "actual/actually". It's a meaningless word that authors think adds weight to a sentence but is used as a lazy crutch instead of finding meaningful descriptive words. Its as annoying as "literally" was a few years ago. Young authors often get the use and meaning incorrect.

Also, calling eyes "orbs". His avada kedavra green orbs. Cringeworthy.
