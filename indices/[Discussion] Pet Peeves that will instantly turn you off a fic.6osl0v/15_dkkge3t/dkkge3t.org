1. Lord. Okay, we see that he is a lord or something. And then what? What I dislike on this trope is just, there is fundamentally no difference between him being a noble or not. I would rather see a monarchy wizarding world where the queen of britain or the wizarding own leader being the one who holds power instead of democracy if we're talking about nobility at all.

2. Harem. The problem I have with harem is that the girls will just become a token character. Besides demeaning to the original one, harem character who functions as yes-man disgusts me.

3. Bashing.
