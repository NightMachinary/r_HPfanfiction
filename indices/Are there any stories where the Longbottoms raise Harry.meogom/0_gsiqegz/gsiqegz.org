I have one planned out, but haven't started. From my discord server:

To Speak Without Words - Healer!Harry, AU Childhood UNPUBLISHED, Planning Stages

The morning of November 2, 1981, Alice dispatched her mother-in-law to bring back her godson at all costs, leveraging the full power and influence of the Longbottom name. Later that same day, a vicious attack and prolonged torture by rogue Death Eaters left Frank and Alice completely physically disabled; their minds are intact, just unable to communicate. Harry and Neville, raised together by the Dowager Longbottom and two invalids only able to communicate through legilimency, must struggle with resentment, jealousy, expectations, and what it means to belong.
