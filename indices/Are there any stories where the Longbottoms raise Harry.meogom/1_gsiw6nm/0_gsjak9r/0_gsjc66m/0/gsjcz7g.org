Oh, definitely. I rather like the idea of a godmother in fanfic, but Alice is to my mind a bad choice unless you're really wanting to do something with Neville, what with her being hospitalized and unresponsive.

Any number of possibilities are better if you want to play up the Godmother angle.

I wasn't aware that Rowling said he hadn't had one. That's kind of odd to me, but hey, that's what fanfic is for. :)
