I'm aware that she took them down and why I just don't agree with her reasoning, people know before posting Fanfiction that it's downloaded and saved and shared. I understand being upset about someone trying to sell it on amazon as mentioned below but pulling it down doesn't punish the person who did that, just the many others who wanted to read the stores. All that said, I still would like to find a copy.
