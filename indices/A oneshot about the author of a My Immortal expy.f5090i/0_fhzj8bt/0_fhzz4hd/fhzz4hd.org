A copy, parody or stand-in. The protagonist of this fanfic was meant to resemble authors of Mary Sue fics, like Tara Gilesbie, author of My Immortal. The fic this character writes is very similar to My Immortal too - a fic where an overpowered Mary-Sue OC makes friends with major characters and dates one of them.
