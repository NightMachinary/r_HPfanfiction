I agree that Ron was, without a doubt the most realistically human character in the series. He gets abused by writers of Fan Fiction because he's perfectly placed for it. He's perfectly placed to the Comedy relief, his bad habits from canon are easily amplified to supply a goof for the story, and he's close enough to Harry for betrayal to hurt him badly.

It's all too easy. I know, I've done it a lot.

But it also got me thinking. What if we changed not one aspect of his character, but gave him the motivation to be not the head sidekick, but the goddamned hero of the story?

Besides, I'd never given Ron the big damned powerup in a story... well, not seriously anyway.

Remember the Prewett cousin they don't talk about from the first book? He lives in the states in a sleepy little town called Blue Valley... and has a son named Wally.
