Dude. I just literally just started republishing my old Ron Weasley and the Philosopher stone like 2 weeks ago. Today I published chap3.

Ron travels back in time to first year. But not one of those ol' "Uber powerful saves everyone smoothly".... more like tries to keep timeline unchanged and return to his time without shit blowing all around him.

Canon compliant if you overlook the time traveling... and obviously heavy Ron/Hermione references... but I would say that this is a Ron story, not a Ron/Hermione story.
