I did a bunch of research on alchemy (as in the actual field of alchemy that was practiced by actual people for hundreds of years before ‘Science' really became a thing), and discovered some fascinating things.

First and foremost, the directions for making a Philosopher's Stone were, in fact, detailed in several places. Step-by-step instructions existed for it, but the key part to this whole thing is in the name - /Philosopher./ Alchemy is way more ‘new-age, spiritual, greater-understanding-of-the-universe, mind-altering substances' than it was ‘lets mix potions and transfiguration together'.

The conclusion I came to with my research for how this could apply to the HPverse was that the instructions for the Philosopher's Stone are out there, but you basically have to attain a state of enlightenment to actually succeed in creating one.

The instructions are out there, but not everyone is in the right place, mentally and spiritually, to succeed at using them.

The higher purpose of alchemy was “to banish the darkness of ignorance and to attain enlightenment through knowledge.”

This is a quote from a book I found on it -

#+begin_quote
  “Alchemy was a sacred science, blending mystical religion and philosophy with medicine and chemistry. The alchemists believed in the alchemy of matter as well as the alchemy of spirit: If an alchemist was not spiritually pure, he would never achieve success in his experiments.”

  “To discover the Philosopher's Stone was therefore an outward sign of inner enlightenment, the two aspects were inextricable. The alchemists' aim was to attain personal harmony which mirrored the ultimate harmony of the universe. Moreover, they sought not only the transmutation of metals but the moral and spiritual transformation of humankind.”

Excerpt From: Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, Dennis William Hauck & Christian Bernard. “Alchemy.”

I think its worth noting that there are a number of well renowned alchemists who claimed to have successfully created a philosopher's stone, and provided enough evidence that they got people to believe them.

Something I also found fascinating, though not necessarily relavent, is that Issac Newton (The apple-to-the-head gravity, father of natural sciences, and creator of Calculus guy) considered himself an Alchemist first and foremost. He dedicated years to his attempts to create a Philosopher's Stone.
