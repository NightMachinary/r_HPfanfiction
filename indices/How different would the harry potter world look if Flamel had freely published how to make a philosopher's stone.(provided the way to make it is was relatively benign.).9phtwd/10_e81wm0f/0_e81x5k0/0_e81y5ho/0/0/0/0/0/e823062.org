I feel like i ask the question when I made this thread, I am not interested in timelines were Flame tells the world how to make Philosophers stones only for it to go nowhere.

I am more interested in timelines were the world takes the knowledge and say learns to make and mass produce panacea, how would it effect the magical world?
