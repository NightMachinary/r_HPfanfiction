Well, we're talking of two different things here, totally different. Alcohol, you can make in abundance with regular general-purpose stuff you can buy dirty cheap - not to mention foraging for things. For example, I make wines and meads, using sugar and honey and yeast from a local supermarket, and picking fruit that grows in hedgerows. Fermentation is so simple it occurs in nature. For example, mead is just honey+water+yeast+time. Distilling hard liquor from anything you make is just a case of heating it up to the right temperature and catching the vapour in a flask. Not really that hard at all.

So even with prohibition, there's no way to stop people getting hold of or making alcohol.

Likewise, making explosives at home is very easy - and illegal. For example, I could make gunpowder at home and it would take me a matter of an hour or two. Buy saltpetre, sulphur flowers, and charcoal, mix them in a 75:10:15 ratio, /et voila/, schei√üpulver. High explosives' ingredients aren't all that much more difficult to get hold of, though of course things like nitroglycerin are rather more dangerous to make.

Making Philosophers' Stone is vastly different, though. If it's anywhere near its real-world counterpart in complexity and how hard its ingredients are to find, all one would need would be to ban distribution or production of the rarer of those components: even if those bans can be circumvented, production of stuff of a high enough quality to use in making PS would likely be prohibitively expensive, and thus practically impossible.

Yes, international accord could be a problem. However, we're talking about something that's more dangerous than nuclear weapons, given the impact it could have on the world, /and/ the fact that it could be made by anyone who had access to the ingredients (unline nukes, which also need precision engineering and manufacturing processes). This means that there most likely /would/ be an international treaty banning its production, sale, and use. Something with that big an impact could even carry the death penalty for infractions.

We have to consider this, though: in PS, it's said that Flamel was the /only known maker/ of it. /Not that only he knows how to do it/. He may have published his translation of /The Book of Abraham the Jew/ - or a ready-to-work-from, fully-parsed recipe - for all we know. Canon doesn't say. Assuming for a moment that he did, and yet nobody else tried to make it - not even Voldemort, who counted potionmaking as one of his many talents - it follows that it's an /incredibly/ long and laborious process that can't be replicated very easily or reliably at all. Also, remember that at the end of PS, Flamel destroyed his stone to prevent Voldemort from getting at it... and he didn't make another, not even secretly. We know that he died some time before HBP. This means that, even to the one person who can make it, it's clearly an incredibly difficult or costly (or both) process to undertake.

Conversely, we /could/ take it as being comparable to the development of any technology or recipe. Usually, when something like this is developed or discovered, even clean-room reimplementations are available in a short enough time. Think about Coke, or CPU instruction sets, or a myriad other still-"secret" recipes and processes. Once it's been done, it /can be/ done, and people eventually start doing it themselves. This didn't happen with the Philosophers' Stone, even /centuries/ after Flamel went public with it but didn't share the recipe. This means even the knowledge of it isn't replicable by /anybody else/. Bear in mind that /The Book of Abraham the Jew/, which is a real-world work that can be found easily enough online, is probably similarly easy to find in the Wizarding World (for all we know, Hogwarts may have a copy in the restricted section of the library), because if /Magick Moste Evile/ and /Secrets of the Darkest Art/ are something that is (or has historically been) in a school library, why woudn't that?

Now, on top of all that, you're proposing additions to the process/recipe (or to that of the Elixir of Life) which make it into this perfect silver bullet, which will grant permanent immortality. This is many orders of magnitude above "mere" Philosophers' Stone - along the lines of a meal that will permanently remove your need to eat. Practically, this means that the process is likely to be comparably more complex, and thus would be /even more/ unlikely to be replicable in a home lab using homemade ingredients (should key ingredients be outlawed).

So it just wouldn't happen.
