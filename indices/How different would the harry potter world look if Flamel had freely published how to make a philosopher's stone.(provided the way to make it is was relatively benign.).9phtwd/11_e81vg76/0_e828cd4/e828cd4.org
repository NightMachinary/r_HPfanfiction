Honestly I just downvoted you because not only are you not backing up your stuff with facts, you're kind of an ass about it.

And again, your position isn't well-supported. Pureblood supremacism is MUCH less of a thing in canon, much less any talk of "pedigree." Only in books 6 and 7 were things as draconian as that.

As for goblins... shrug. Goblins wars are mostly hearsay in canon. But wizards have the magic, wizards have the wands. If PS gold is the same as "real" gold, there isn't much the goblins can do about it. Makes much more sense that something else would end up being used as currency.
