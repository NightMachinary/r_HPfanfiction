But Voldemort was able to create a potion that gave him that ugly body, so potions can create whole human bodies right? (obviously only very powerful ones). That's what I meant when I said the Stone could restore Voldemort - by taking the Elixir it was supposed to create a body for him. Voldemort says this explicitly.
