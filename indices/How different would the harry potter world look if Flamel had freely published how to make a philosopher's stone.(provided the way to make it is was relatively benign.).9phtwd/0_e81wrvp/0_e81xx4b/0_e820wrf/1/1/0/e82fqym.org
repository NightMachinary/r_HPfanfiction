Yeah, but that's my point- the Stone doesn't create "wholesale human bodies," it creates the Elixir of Life.

The safest assumption is that Voldemort is able to channel the energy of the Elixir towards his own purposes- drinking it wouldn't make Quirrel immortal, it would either let Voldemort completely take over and restore his body, or he'd be able to channel the energy into a new body, or some other thing.

I realize that's a little vague, but it doesn't really make sense otherwise.
