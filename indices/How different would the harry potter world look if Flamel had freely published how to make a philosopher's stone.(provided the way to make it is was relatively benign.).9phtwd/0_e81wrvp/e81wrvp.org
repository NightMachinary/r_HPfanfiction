If it's early on than it's before the Ministry of Magic, or the Statute of Secrecy. We can pretty safely assume those things will come to be in any case. Gold will obviously no longer be currency, so something else will be instead. A few centuries of immortals means a higher population than canon, though probably not to a significant degree. We can assume there will have been some advancements in magic that didn't exist in canon. Basically we're just looking at the HP world except tack on the tropes for an immortal species except only given a few centuries to mature.

The whole story as we know it can't exist. Even in Tom Riddle existed his fear of death would never drive him the same way as canon. If he still tried to wage war for personal power he'd be stricken down by the gifted and experienced that came before.
