Ahh see here is why mine is different, Dumbledore has the elder wand. Maybe Nick couldn't destroy it?

I figured Dumbledore made a fake after Hagrid gives the real one to him. Gives him time to make a convincing fake, since Dumbledore may not have ever seen the stone.

Just because Nick is immortal doesn't mean he is all powerful, just perhaps all knowledgeable. Better to keep the stone out of Tom's hands and just keep spare elixir for himself than risk the stone falling into his hands and become a horcrux.
