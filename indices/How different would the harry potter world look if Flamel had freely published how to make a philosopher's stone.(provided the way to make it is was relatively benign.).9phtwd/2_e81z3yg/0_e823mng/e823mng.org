My headcanon has always been that Flamel wasn't stupid enough to give Dumbledore the real stone. He made a very convincing fake, maybe something that had the power of lead to gold but not elixir of life to be extra convincing, and then gave it to Dumbledore so he could set the trap and convince everyone the stone had been destroyed for good.
