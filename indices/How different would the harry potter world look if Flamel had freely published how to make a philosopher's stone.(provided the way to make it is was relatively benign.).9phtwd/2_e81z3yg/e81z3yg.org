I always imagined that how to make a philosopher's stone is open knowledge. Take... Colonel Sanders' chicken with secret herbs and spices.

Anyone on the world can make fried chicken, it's up to you to find out exactly how to make the perfect KFC chicken.

Flamel was never dead in my mind, he could always make a new stone, his "death" and the destruction of the stone felt more like a "Hey Brian, go ahead and destroy the stone so he can't use it. Once he is dead I'll just make a new one, I have enough elixir of life in my fridge for a century or so. So just tell everyone I'm dead, I'll come back once he is gone."

Anyway back to my fried chicken metaphor, anyone could make chicken that could prevent death, perhaps even give them a few years, but the inferior chicken not being cooked correctly would eventually kill you itself with its imperfections.

Also, unlike friend chicken I also imagine the stone creation process being quite difficult. As well as volatile at many stages, people have been trying. They just make an inert stone at best, and blow up more likely than not.

Those who sort of succeed eventually turn into gold I imagine, as the stone's abilities are not distilled properly.

Perhaps this is where the Hand of Midas came from?

Essentially I think it would be the same, with perhaps a few Wizards pushing 500 but still looking around mid 50's perhaps with gold eyes from the gold in their bodies.
