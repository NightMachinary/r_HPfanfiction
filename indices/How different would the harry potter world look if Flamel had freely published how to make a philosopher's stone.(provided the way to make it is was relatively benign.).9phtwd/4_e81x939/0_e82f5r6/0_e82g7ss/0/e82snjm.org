Yes.

But no, I wouldn't do it because I don't really have a need for Aspirin, I haven't ever used it. But if I was dying (which we all are) and there was a medicine for my condition (the Elixir of Life) and I was at least somewhat above averagely talented in the disciplines required to make it, then yes I would definitely try. And I am fairly certain that I wouldn't be the only one, and that I could work together with others to make success more likely. And maybe not all people who try will be successful, but possibly quite a few. Flamel was the only one who made a Philosophers Stone (that we know of, if I made one all on my own I wouldn't go around telling people about it...), but was he perhaps also the only one or one of only a few who even tried in the last millennium? Considering that the Trio didn't even know who Flamel was (how is that possible? I'm a muggle and I knew about him at that age), perhaps people in general just don't know or care much about the Stone and the Elixir and thus don't even consider finding out the "recipe".
