If this happened, I guess some sanctions would be put into place so that gold would not lose its value OR gold wouldn't be the world's standard of determining wealth anymore. But I'm not really interested in this aspect of the Philosopher's Stone.

Due to the near-immortality, I guess that at first, most, if not all, of the witches and wizards of the 1500s would brew the Elixir of Life for themselves and their families and enjoy the benefits of long life depending on what they're interested in (ex. researchers would continue to research, farmers continue to farm, politicians continue politicking etc.) But eventually there would be some that would get tired of living and choose to stop taking it.

I imagine that there would be a group of magicals who would take it into their heads to rule over the planet. This can be very bad if they were Hitler like and started experimenting on Muggles. A resistance would rise to fight them but the leaders of the Resistance wouldn't be able to agree if when they win, would all knowledge of the Philosopher's stone be erased from human history or not? And so we come to the current situation of the Harry Potter world. A centuries old war between the immortals who have been oppressing muggles and the pro-muggle immortals. Maybe Voldemort would belong to the faction that wants to topple the current rulers in order to replace them while Dumbledore would belong to the faction that wants to erase all knowledge about the Stone.
