For me the most important aspect of a story is its quality, I can read anything if the author manages to sell the plot. In general I would say I prefer stories /without/ Harry, or at least that's what my favourites list seems to suggest. I certainly started reading Harry Potter fanfiction with the intent of not reading about Harry Potter, we have seven books of him after all and I was more interested in what other people were thinking and doing as Harry went about defeating Voldemort.

Personally I think stories written from Harry's perspective are often of a lower quality than those written from another character's perspective. Most authors change Harry drastically to fit their own picture of a hero (or what /they/ wanted Harry to be), Harry is suddenly significantly more powerful, more popular, more intelligent and ultimately more boring. Harry in canon is surprisingly snarky (a character trait often ignored) and although people can be critical of his 'saving-people thing' I personally find it endearing, I certainly don't want to read about a Harry that is more often than not-angsty, overpowered and pessimistic.
