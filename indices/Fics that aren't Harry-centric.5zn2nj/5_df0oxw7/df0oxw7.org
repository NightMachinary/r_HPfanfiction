I'm going to go ahead and assert that Hogwarts-era canon!Harry isn't a very interesting protagonist, unless the very setting is very deliberately and obviously built around him --- as canon is, starting with Trelawney's Prophecy and Volemort's choice of him over Neville. He is a bit of a cypher when it comes to motivation, and what heroism he displays --- which shouldn't be understated --- is very small-picture: he might give his all to going after injustice and evil that he can address immediately, but for anything that requires a long-term effort without a clear endpoint, he is rather reactive.

Note that this doesn't make him a bad person, just not an interesting protagonist: a Laertes, not a Hamlet. It's telling that the most popular Harry-centric fics do at least one of the following:

1. Rewrite his personality and talents from scratch.
2. Give him a huge unearned power-up, special ability, or special training usually leading to 1.
3. Wait until he is an adult and then send him back in time, where he can be written as a policeman.

Examples available upon request (and time permitting).

Other characters from that generation (Hermione, Weasley Twins, Luna?, Ron?) have a bit more drive and more complex and distinct personalities, so, I usually go for either non-Harry lead or where Harry is only one of several equally important protagonists.
