I barely read stories with Harry as a main character. Nothing against him, but there are 7 years of canon with him. Because of that I think I see him as a young boy, like a companion I grew up with. Same with Hermione and Ron.

Then again, I rarely read stories in the canon time unless it's an unexplored side story.
