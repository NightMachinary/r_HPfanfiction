I'm late to the party here, but I think that the best fanfiction is non-Harry-centric.

Think of the great examples of 'fanfiction' in literature (The Aeneid, Wicked, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Sphereland etc.): they are almost /invariably/ written from the perspective of someone outside the main five-man band.

Minor characters and villains have more story left to tell, and can add a new perspective. I dislike time travel, but Draco-centric stories are much more interesting than Harry-centric ones -- Malfoy knows less, has more to gain and provides a radically different perspective.

Similarly: would linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair) have been as poignant if it featured Harry photographing Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville etc? No of course not: it's stronger for telling the stories of minor characters and how they were hurt in their own way. The 'climax' works by surprising the reader with familiarity -- Draco Malfoy was a victim of the war too.

As a rec, linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) does all the above and is (imo) one of the best fics in the fandom for it.
