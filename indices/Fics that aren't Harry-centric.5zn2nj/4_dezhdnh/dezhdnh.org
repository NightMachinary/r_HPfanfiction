I'm all for alternate protagonists, but I get annoyed with some of them for talking smack about Harry and the others. It's fine that other people's lives don't revolve around the trio, but I don't need for them to be denigrated to understand why we're focusing on someone else.

EDIT: recommend that you flair this as a Discussion so folks don't assume it's a fic search.
