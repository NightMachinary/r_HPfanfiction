I love fics that don't revolve around Harry and Hermione. I feel like they're over-represented to the point that they're now a parody of themselves. They're also incredibly unsympathetic protagonists, whether in canon or fanon.

It's also fun to see people's deeper analysis on underrepresented characters, like say, Susan Bones or Ginny Weasley.
