The first ones that pop into my mind are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]] where Harry has wings like the fanfic you just read.

Another would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning][The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]] where the dehumanizing changes you're looking for actually come from his own self-transfiguration.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] Harry's trademark scar is described as horribly disfiguring and later on there is a change in appearance related to his eyes.

Those fics are some of my favorites and they are all quite long so if you pick them up, it'll last you a bit. However, /With Strength of Steel Wings/ and /Blindness/ are both Harmony fics. I think they are worth the read even if you don't like the pairing. Sorry I have no clue how to use the bot so you'll have to go to each story for the summaries.

ig I got the bot to work but didn't realize it, the links are in the deleted comments? I don't know.
