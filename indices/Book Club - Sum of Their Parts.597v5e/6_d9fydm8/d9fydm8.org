I'm another huge fan of this fic, and I've recommended it many times here.

Many have already mentioned the abrupt ending, and I agree with them. This fic is definitely in need of a sequel. I pm'ed the author about that, and he said he had a few ideas, but nothing guaranteed.

Another thing I have reservation about is the 'Black madness interferes with Occulumency" thing. It feels kind forced and like a plot device to make Harry's life more difficult.

Otherwise, I really love the tone of the story and how Trio interacted.
