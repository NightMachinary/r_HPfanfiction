This isn't the best fic out there, but I don't really know of any actually good ones that have Harry go down the evil/Dark route.

The real problems I have with this fic are:

1. The magical theory on dark magic stuff is kinda boring.

2. Everything talking about Black Madness as a whole. Yes, Bellatrix was certifiable after Azkaban (and was probably unhinged beforehand from that Pensieve memory), and Sirius was a little unhinged in PoA (due to recently being in Azkaban) and in OoTP due to being trapped in a house (kinda like a prison cell, but a bit nicer) that embodies all his bad memories.

3. The whole "Gryffindorish Dark Lord" thing is kinda... eh at best?

4. The Occlumency is... not good in my opinion.

5. Dark Lord being an actual title instead of some self-absorbed bullshit that Voldemort and the Death Eaters came up with.

6. The writing is fairly stilted, and dialogue doesn't flow the best, though that might just be the author's chosen style.

7. Hagrid's simple acceptance of Harry's route to dark wizardism I didn't find plausible at all. Hagrid is a very moral/moralistic person, and I don't believe he would accept Harry's methods no matter how laudable the goal.

The Things I rather Enjoyed:

I. I liked how this wasn't actually about a Dark Lord Harry, but about how Harry became/decided to become a 'Dark Lord' (which for me wasn't until the end, when he decided to [[/spoiler][take up people's offers of support]]. I find this to be something rather overlooked. Usually it's just a rushed thing, but this goes into the transition of "the system isn't working" to fully-fledged dark wizard through via vigilante.

II. It showed how good people can stand on different sides of an issue. Harry, Ron and Hermione vs Kingsley and McGonagall for instance.

III. People post war who have changed in serious ways. The big ones being Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George, with Ginny and Luna in the background of it.

IV. Harry choosing to focus his magic on curses and dark magic, something in canon that he is very skilled with (considering his skill at Defense against the Dark Arts). I also enjoy the depiction of Fiendfyre as his spell of choice, even though it isn't always practical.

V. Walburga Black's portrait being a horcrux was a fun idea.

VI. The depiction of the beginning of a conspiracy is something I rather enjoyed, since I enjoy conspiracy theories, spy v spy, cloak and dagger themes.

Things I wished this fic did instead of what it did do:

- I wish that instead of having that time skip in the last chapter, it had ended.

- I wish people didn't figure out what Harry was planning on doing. Far too many (Bill, the Ministry, his first set of followers, etc.) realized he was trying to turn himself into a 'Dark Lord.' If his reveal was more out of the blue, I think it would have been more powerful.

- In regards to the above, I think it also would have worked better if Harry had tried to work with/through the system for the changes he desired, instead of just sitting back in his (understandable) post-War apathy and then getting mad when the things he hoped for didn't come to be. I think this also would have made the emotional impact more meaningful.

- A sequel focusing on Harry actually being a 'Dark Lord' with followers instead of just a mostly solo vigilante.

All in all, while I wouldn't rate this as a great fic or maybe not even a good fic, I would rate it as entertaining without being utter shit.
