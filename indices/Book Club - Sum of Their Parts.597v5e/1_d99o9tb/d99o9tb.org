I liked the slight melancholy in the story - the confrontations and battles seem almost inevitable, looming on the horizon as the trio slowly progresses on their chosen path. "Dark Lord" being a title, or rather, a name for a certain category of dark wizards, is a good idea in my book - something like that seems very logical, given the examples of Grindelwald and Voldemort. There are dark wizards, and there are dark wizards who have an army of followers and are challenging entire nations. The latter do deserve a name of their own.

I also do not think Hagrid would mind Harry's course of action. As was pointed out, he knows all about prejudice. And the Order wasn't that pacifist either, as Remus showed berating Harry for not killing people in battle.

I also do not think adult wizards putting much stock on the house someone was in is weird - kids are chosen by a magical artifact reading their minds. It's only natural for wizards to consider that significant, and then see the traits of a wizard that reinforce a clichee rather than the traits that contradict them.
