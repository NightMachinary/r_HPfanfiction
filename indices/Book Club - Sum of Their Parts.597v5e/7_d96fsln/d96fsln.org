I actually read this one a while back when it was still incomplete/updating.

The tl;dr version:

A fresh idea and storyline with competent writing is ultimately hampered by a premature ending.

The long version:

This is one of the better takes on a Dark Harry/trio that I've seen. Their reasons for it were understandable, even reasonable, which makes their slide down the slippery slope all the more insidious. The main premise isn't one that I've seen done well -- Harry doing bad things for good reasons.

The writing is decent and clearly written -- I didn't do any backtracking to try to understand what was being said. There are a couple minor grammatical issues here and there, but nothing that made me want to stop reading. Just typos, IIRC. What's really fantastic about the writing is that everyone feels in-character, which is quite the feat.

But that ending is, hands down, the biggest problem that I have with this story. The epilogue reads like a summary of an outline that was stapled onto the last chapter ... or the idea for a sequel.

Very disappointed by that. The story would have been better served by not having an epilogue at all.
