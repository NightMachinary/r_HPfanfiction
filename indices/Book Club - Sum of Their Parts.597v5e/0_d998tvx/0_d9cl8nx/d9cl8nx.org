The soul brand, gah. I forgot about it. It reinforced the notion of a Dark Lord being a formally recognized position. A Dark Lord has the title, followers and he brands them.

And the whole thing with the oath - I guess Harry ruling in the end was meant to suggest that Hermione has descended into darkness with Harry, given that the oath didn't stop him for doing things Hermione would have considered bad? Or something.

This fic just fails on so many more levels than it doesn't.
