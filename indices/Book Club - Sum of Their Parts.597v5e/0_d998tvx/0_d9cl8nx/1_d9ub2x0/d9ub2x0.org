I'm not sure why you're focusing on just Hermione here. Ron was part of this as well. I enjoyed this not because it's /oooo look at us, we're evil Dark Lords now!!/ but because it deepened the connection between the three as friends. Like I wrote below, how many well written FFs are out there that focus on their friendship and not add a romance?

Harry certainly didn't "rule" either - I'm not sure where you're getting this wrong or if you read the story wrong. The oath was to protect them and making a majority vote - "if you don't like something I'm doing, because you think it's amoral, let me know". It's a failsafe.

Maybe the story isn't the best thing out there, but it's one of the damn best things out there *in a while*. :/
