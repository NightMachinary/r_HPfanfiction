Although I didn't like the epilogue either, I honest to God loved this story because of the soul magic brand between Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Mainly because this story didn't force a romance between the characters, but tried to explain the bond between the three of them - sums of each other's parts haha - and that their experiences and past tied them too tightly to be apart... even if Ron and Hermione had different ideologies to Harry and George.

I liked how it showed the descent into Dark Lorddom because there is a lack of that in HP fanfiction. Yes, Harry"s apathy for change is problematic but I also understand how the author explained away Kingsley's status quo red tape and how that was just as damaging. So maybe it was more of a way to explain the lack of change in current policies?

I didn't like Bill's attitude at all given Fleur is a half-human character like Flitwick or Gwamp and he didn't see anything wrong with her potentially becoming a second class citizen. BUT I disagree with what another poster said about Hagrid. He may have loose lips and think Dumbledore is a great man, but he understands prejudice too and knows what humanity is capable of.
