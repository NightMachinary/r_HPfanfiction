Don't usually comment in Book Club threads but I'm a big fan of this fic (mostly). It's already been mentioned but I really enjoy how Harry's steps towards the dark side are gradual and understandable. Too many !darkharry fics have Harry taking a leap towards the dark side and it's not believable.

My biggest problem with this is the same as everyone else, the ending sucks (imo). It feels like the author has the story going really well and it reaches its peak, then all of a sudden it's over. My guess is that the author had real life stuff come up but didn't want to abandon the fic so he/she wrote that time jump to cap off the story. In a way this is good in that they didn't leave us with an abandoned fic. But it also left me wanting more.
