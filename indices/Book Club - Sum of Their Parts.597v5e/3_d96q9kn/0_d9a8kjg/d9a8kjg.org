  Also, Dark Lord being an officially recognized title instead of a Voldemort-specific honorific.

Yup that's one of those "Fanon" things that I find really annoying. Maybe it's something that people borrow from Star Wars lore (like a Sith)? It always seemed obvious to me that Voldemort is having his minions call him Dark Lord in order to stroke his grandiose ego, not that the title is actually a thing... some fics even go so far as to have a "Light Lord" who has to oppose "The Dark"^{tm.}

IMHO linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood]]) has a brilliant moment of subverting this cliche: There's an actual ministry approved Dark Lord election during that fic: "In my day, Dark Lords just happened. None of this fancy electing." (Spoiler: [[/spoiler][Voldemort actually doesn't win the election, but he narrowly beats out Fudge for being the next Dork Lord]]... but that's neither here nor there)
