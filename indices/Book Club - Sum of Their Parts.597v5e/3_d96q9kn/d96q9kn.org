I don't have time for a longer post right now, I'll come back later, but for now I'll say this: the author had a good idea for a story, but wrote all the wrong scenes. The story that this should have been is contained in the time skip at the end. There's a 100k words missing between the final showdown and the last scene. Essentially, the impression this leaves would be better without that epilogue, because it makes you realize what a huge wasted opportunity this fic is. And even if the epilogue wasn't there, the story still leaves a lot to be desired.

Edit: so, a few more points.

First, the prose didn't do it for me. The author repeatedly told me that the world is war-weary and bleak and up for fixing, but I wasn't shown it. Rants about bigots in the Ministry aren't enough. Also, it's such a tired trope at this point. No institution is a hive mind.

Some characters came off as unnecessarily sanctimonious when Harry told them he was becoming a Dark Lord, as if those two words automatically mean you're a bad person. Also, Dark Lord being an officially recognized title instead of a Voldemort-specific honorific.

Adherence to House loyalties and stereotypes. When I saw "Gryffindor-Slytherin Dark Lord" I almost punched the screen.

The big moments, when they happened, had no weight behind the punch. This ties into the prose issue, which simply didn't sell those moments to me.

Some cool ideas were run into the ground. The whole Dark Lord thing. The Black madness was a fun way to explain the Occlumency issue, but it only worked the first time, when Dorea's portrait said it. Every time it was repeated, "I'm not extra psychotic, but I have the recklessness," it lost its charm.

All of the above combined led to a fic with some promise and potentially great ideas becoming just boring. This is how you /don't/ write a Dark!Harry fic.
