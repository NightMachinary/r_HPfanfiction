- There is insufficient evidence from what is observed in canon for that. Everything can easily be explained by hallucinations and ghosts, and the ghosts have never spoken of that which comes after, or even given any detail to how they remained.

- Besides, even if there is an eternal afterlife, it is not as good as eternal earthly existence if there are things one can do in the latter that one cannot do in the former, like have children. (For that matter, the afterlife /I/ believe in IRL amounts to a backup server God maintains for our minds until we figure out how to do immortality to ourselves.)

- The ritual of Bone, Flesh, and Blood indicates that it is possible to at least construct functional homunculi for earthbound spirits, and bind them to them to function as usual.

- Even without the aid of magic, we could clone humans if we really wanted to.

- With the aid of magic, we can use Muggle cloning methods to clone the bodies of the just-deceased, or just borrow and combine DNA from their relatives (e.g. basically do in vitro, but bind the spirit to it), and bind each spirit to a new fully-functional body.

- Going forwards, people will simply preserve some of their cells in multiply-redundant banks, and whenever they experience body death, they'll just show up in spirit-form to the nearest kiosk (which will be constructed all over the world, and enchanted to make them easy for disembodied spirits to reach and use), and order up a new body.
