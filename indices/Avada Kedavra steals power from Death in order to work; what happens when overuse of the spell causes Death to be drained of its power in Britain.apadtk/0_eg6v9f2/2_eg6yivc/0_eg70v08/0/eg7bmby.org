Harry's soul literally went to limbo and came back.

That's a gargantuan assumption. It's not as good as existing on Earth because you think there are things you can't do there that you can do here. Says who? Not to mention even if that's true, it's equally possible that you're missing out on infinitely more if you stayed here.

That's been done for someone with a horcrux, but we've got no evidence that it's possible for a ghost. Even if it is, you're still stuck on earth instead of being in the afterlife.
