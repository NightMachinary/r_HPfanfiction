That interaction did helpfully inform him of what happened. There's Voldemort's mangled soul shard, he's staying here and it sucks to be him, you're going back.

I'm not trying to prove this in a court of law or write a peer reviewed article. If you truly think that it was a hallucination or something, go ahead. Doesn't change the fact that, IIRC, it was very clearly written that he did indeed go to Limbo.

If you'd prefer that, fair enough. But keeping that going means forcing everyone else to experience the same fate. Literally removing everybody's ability to die. Also I think that you're risking more than you know. It's possible you'd be stuck in some intangible existence indefinitely, or that there's some other awful consequence of having billions-trillions+ of souls build up in one place. Who knows.

I think there's still a significant difference. Voldemort's soul was bound to the physical plane, where these souls are being blocked from moving on. Without a horcrux to hold them "in place", maybe they'd go unstable and disperse. Maybe Dementors will go on an absolute frenzy at the slightest whiff of an unbound and free roaming soul.
