- There is no evidence of that - nothing Dumbledore says is information that Harry did not already have, or was readily apparent from such. Nothing differentiates that from a standard dream or hallucination.

- In the absence of evidence either way, I prefer to stay here. I am confident even IRL that we can construct a heaven on earth, and in HP-verse, with magic... even more so! Besides, if I am wrong, then we can only have a finite span in this universe anyway - 10^{10^{120}} years, at most, before entropy completely wins, by the most optimistic estimates. At that point, everything dies or is already dead, and we're in your scenario. Since it's unending, a delay of even 10^{10^{120}} years is trivial. Thus, it is logical to strive to make the most of this world as per my words, if only to hedge our bets. (Since AK must be cast regularly to stave off death in this scenario, once there is insufficient energy left in the universe to cast it (because even if the power comes from death, the mind casting it needs energy to think it and stuff), death will return at that time).

- Since the Horcrux works by tying the soul to a physical object, so that it cannot move on, it is reasonable that since the premise is that these souls can't move on, similar principles apply.
