"And so, based on this improbable discovery, we developed a kind of magic device to constantly fire Death-draining magic at an easily repairable target. By placing them all around the world, as long as we use up this 'Death's' energy whenever it shows up, the entire world population is essentially immortal! Perhaps reduced to spectres in some cases, but immortal! And not only that, but we've just developed the ability to bridge the gap between worlds and bring back the long departed, so you can be reunited with your grandparents and long-dead ancestors!"

"But what happens if someone turns into another Dark Lord and there's no way to kill them? Or someone brings the dark lords of ages past back to life? Or, unlife?"

"FOOLISH WIZARDS! SEVENTY-SEVEN OF US DARK LORDS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO FORM THE EVIL LEAGUE OF DARKNESS! And you can bet we'll be using the Imperius and other mind-control magicks."

"Halt, evildoers! For we are eighty-four of the greatest heroic magicians in history, and we will foil your evil schemes!"

And thus the Earth became a place of forever war, as the living dead battled, good vs evil, for eternity.\\
It wasn't so bad, though, most people could deal by burying themselves somewhere with a magically everlasting pantry of snacks and an internet connection.
