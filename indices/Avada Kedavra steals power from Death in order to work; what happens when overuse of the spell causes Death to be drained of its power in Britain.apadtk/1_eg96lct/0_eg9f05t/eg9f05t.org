Tangential, but I came up with an idea for a Grim Reaper themed superhero...maybe they could be called Gentle Repose.\\
They'd actually be all pacifistic and nice and gentle and egalitarian and compassionate and et-cetera, with lines like "It is outside my domain to do harm. I merely provide relief and succor to the wounded and weary." and "Rich or poor, good or evil, it matters not. I offer my hand equally to all."\\
And one time before that I came up with an empowered-by-Anubis superhero who basically went "My job is to ensure the dead rest in peace, and the only thing separating the living and the dead is time, so I'm going to help people so that when they die they rest in peace." and Anubis is all like "What, you thought that was a loophole? Go right ahead."

Also-also, I thought of a campaign setting for D&D/Pathfinder/etc, inspired by Majesty 2; basically when your heroes die in that game, you can recall them to life from a graveyard or from a gate to hell, and enemy spawners on the map keep resurrecting foes until you destroy them.\\
I came up with a cosmological concept where you have the mortal world, which is normal and high-fantasy-ish, and the otherworld, which is places like heaven and hell and quite a bit more loose with the rules of mortality (plus a spirit world, a chaos realm of concepts, etc). And that basically even if someone were killed in the mortal realm, their spirit would just be returned to the otherworld and they could make their way back to the mortal world to try again.\\
The question, though, why bother to live in the mortal world when you have to deal with things like hunger and illness and aging, the answer is basically 'freedom', because big nasty monsters and tyrants and such in the mortal world are much easier to kill (and thus, banish back to the otherworld). So when a part of the otherworld is controlled by a mighty demon or long-lasting dynasty or something, the little guys like goblins and humans go to the mortal world instead (repeatedly) to try their luck at raising an army or a kingdom or whatever.

As for your actual question...I was thinking the lack of Death would be limited to parts of Britain, specifically those areas where Avada Kedavra and basilisks and other normally-instant-death things roam? It would probably affect all life in those affected areas, though, or more specifically all life with souls, so that's probably humans, magical creatures, most pets, maybe even some plants and insects depending on how a soul works or whatever. Probably not bacteria or individual cells unless you want to write a story about ghostly amoebas made up of uncountable amounts of microorganisms covering the place in thick ghostly ectoplasmic mist.\\
And yes, a problem with no Death is that people can't accidentally die under torture, so you can be as cruel as you want. And lots of people will probably experience agonising starvation until they turn into emaciated mummies.\\
(Also also, can you imagine if Death turned off throughout the entire universe because it was overused in one spot on one planet? That would confuse and terrify the heck out of aliens for sure...like the Thanos snap, except instead of half of everything suddenly disintegrating, everything stops dying.)
