Definitely liking the concept! Apart from your original prompt, I think it would be really cool to see the origin of this curse in detail. It's invention and so forth. Maybe it was originated with the other unforgivables? Seeing how it was first created and originally used. A ritual... a dance with death that first conjured the power of the killing curse. Maybe there's a story of ancient wizards who used it for good. Destroying beasts like leviathan, basilisks and so forth. Bring it around to corruption and users of dark magic... leading to its forgotten origin and how it became banned as an unforgivable curse in the first place. Create and build your own characters. maybe tie it in with pure-blood lines of the peverells... to hogwarts and ilvermorny founders ever. Seeing as in the tale of the three brothers... they literally meet death and perhaps the one with the elder wand not only received a wand of immense power but also create the darkest of curses. Although peverells were living in the 1200s... so perhaps the curses were first create far before in more ancient times... Only the story will tell. Origin stories leave lots of room for creating your own story and i believe with accurate research and an excellent writer... it could be something beyond brilliant. I'm mostly just spit balling here, but I think the overall idea is fascinating.
