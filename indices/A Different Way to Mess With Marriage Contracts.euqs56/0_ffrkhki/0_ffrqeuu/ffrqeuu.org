There's a reason I'm not a fan of the standard Marriage Contract fic. If you want to get Harry together with some girl that's not close to him in canon, then Step One is "give them a reason to interact". Plenty of fics do this in much less rapey ways, like being partnered for a class project, and let the relationship develop organically. Using forced marriage (whether by contract or by law) is taking things out of order and inherently makes the relationship feel much more artificial.
