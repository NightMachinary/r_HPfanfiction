While this is just an assumption, I think the reason Marriage contracts became as prominent as they are today might be due to someone, somewhere, issuing a fic challenge, sprouting a lot of decent fics (after all, it had never been done before, so the fics at the time can't really count as "tropey") within the restrictions. This inspires others to write it, and so on, and we end up like today.
