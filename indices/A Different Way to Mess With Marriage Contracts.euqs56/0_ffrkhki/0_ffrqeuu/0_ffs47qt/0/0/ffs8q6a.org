I have little interest in Marriage Law fics (which Marriage contract fics are basically a subcategory of). I read one, figured it was okay, and then didn't really have much interest in reading further ones.

But clearly a large group of people enjoy them. While my post was mainly targetting ship shaming, and not the Marriage Law trope, I can definitely see where you're coming from. It is a rather disturbing premise if you think about it for a bit.

However, with this said, why go out of one's way to say how horrible something is, using outright hostile language, rather than just leaving people who care about it to their own? Flaming is not a good part of this community. I consider it far worse than whatever "odd" tastes some people may have.
