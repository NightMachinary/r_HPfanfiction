  Why go out of the way and say how horrible something is
#+end_quote

Because people might not realise how horrible something is. If you want a more cheery example, look at soul bonds. Undying love, feeling the emotions of the other side, non verbal communication... Sounds good on paper, would be a dystopian nightmare if you really think about it.

  Hostile language

Mate, that ain't hostile language. The only people who have a right to take insult are the ones who practise or defend such customs, customs which are rightfully outlawed where I live. Saying that an illegal practice should be stopped is not hostile.
