  Arranged marriages, especially via contact and/or under threat of death, are a blight which should be purged

I'm fine with not having them where I live, but "arranged" doesn't always mean "forced," you know. It can just mean that the parents took the initiative to investigate the dating market and set two people up, rather than the individuals doing it themselves.

On the one hand, there may be valuable lessons learned by taking the initiative, which this would miss; on the other hand, parents have more maturity and experience of what makes a marriage work, and might therefore choose more wisely. I don't think it's appropriate to just outright call the whole concept a "blight".

Attempting to compel children to marry for economic or political advantage, that's a different kettle of fish.
