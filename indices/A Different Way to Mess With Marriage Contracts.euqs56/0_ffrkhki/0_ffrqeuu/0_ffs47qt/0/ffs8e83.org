Arranged marriages, especially via contact and/or under threat of death, are a blight which should be purged, not something that should be romanticised in fiction.

They are popular because authors can't be bothered to write a decent get-together when even "we got drunk and woke up naked together" would be more romantic or because they realise that the pairing would be impossible without a rape-y pretense, and a rape law or contract can be blamed on someone else while normal rape sticks to the offender.
