One thing they almost never explain in "Harry is in a marriage contract with Pureblood Princess Greengrass" is: What despicable scumbag agreed to the contract, and why the fuck didn't it get completed until Harry? How could James marry Lily, but Harry suddenly has to marry 1-4 purebloods?

Honestly, there are much less rapey plot devices to get two people who dislike each other together than "fuck or die".
