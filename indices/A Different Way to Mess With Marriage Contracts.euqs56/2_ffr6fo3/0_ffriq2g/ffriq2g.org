That fic's on my Favorites list on ffnet.

Anyway, my concept is that the contract is inescapable but not so perfectly well-written. The hubristic inbred Purebloods who wrote it made a lot of assumptions, and thus left loopholes that could be exploited if both parties wanted - they simply couldn't imagine that their two scions would be willing to so shame their families. Maybe one might be less than enthusiastic, but the contract would give the other the power to force the issue as necessary. Too bad for them.

Alternatively, Muggle technology might be the workaround. "An heir must be produced within five years or the marriage shall be annulled. Neither participant may be infertile, nor may either use any spells, potions, poisons, enchanted items, or other magic to prevent pregnancy." Okay, then they'll use a condom for five years of mandated no-strings-attached sex. The wording of the infidelity clause doesn't account for IVF or artificial insemination, allowing both to start families with their chosen lovers without technically violating the contract.

The whole point is "stupid/arrogant/bigoted Purebloods left loopholes in the contract because they couldn't imagine both parties rejecting it and/or because they underestimated how creative people can be when pissed off and desperate".
