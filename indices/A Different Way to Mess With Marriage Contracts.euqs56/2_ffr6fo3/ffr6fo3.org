Usually, the contract demands for offspring within a few years. And infidelity is punished by death, as is any other kind of "exploit".

I've thought about subverting that canon concept a few times, but usually they are pretty watertight because the authors want to ensure that the outcome is "fuck (frequently) or die".

The only real subversion you can do without ending up with a dystopian/horror fic is void the contract through a technicality (eg if the demand is "a virgin daughter of House X", you make sure she has sex with someone else) or block the person from entering a contract marriage by marrying someone else BEFORE the contract is applied/activated. Or by arranging an "accident".

Or you can write an arc similar to Andromeda's where one party runs away, basically elopes and thereby denounces their family or is cast out.

I think that there even was a fic where the trio hired some kind of assassin/mercenary who ended up purging half of the purebloods until they called the whole thing off because they thought it to be some kind of curse.
