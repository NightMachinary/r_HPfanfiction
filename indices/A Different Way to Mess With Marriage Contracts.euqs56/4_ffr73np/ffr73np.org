Ok it's not MLC and it totally does become a romance for my ship, but your request reminded me of [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=824&i=1][A Snape is for Life, Not Just for Christmas]]

As Hermione explains to him in chapter 1:

  “And everyone would be really horrified, and just think of the fun we can have with that. If someone is really annoying you, you could signal to me and I would come to your rescue. The faintest sign of affection between us and most people would be running for cover. And you could do the same for me.”

If you're not opposed to this ship, I think I have also read some that were more like what you've asked for, way back at the original 2003 MLC challenge at WIKTT. But it's been so long I'll have to dig them up. Hoping to get back to you tomorrow on that ;)
