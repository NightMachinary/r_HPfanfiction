Boy howdy Kamerad, are /you/ in for a journey. You're in a community that likes pairing Harry with his parents' murderer, to the point where there are writers who make that their entire spiel. Like, they call themselves "tomarry" writers (who even comes up with these fucking things) and everything. Then there's the various Snape pairings, most, like you said, with children, the discussion surrounding one of which (in this subreddit, my seventh sense for disgusting fics is well developed, so I don't click them) has actually, physically made me vomit once, and of course the generally liked Malfoy pairing. You know, Malfoy, the lad who constantly calls other people the wizard N-word, who led a band of terrorists into a school full of children, who willingly joined the dark lord, who used the enslavement curse on the nicest woman in all of canon, who tried to curse, poison and eventually couldn't find the resolve to cast the murder spell on Dumbledore.

This community is massively problematic, that's for sure. There are sentiments at work here which I'm very much afraid to unspool, things have been written and put into words which equal the seven plagues of egypt in literary form, there are seriously emotionally deluded people present here ("hate can easily turn into love", I've heard a lot, used to justify some of the vomit-inducing pairings), and the community's general obsession with "romance" (as much as you can call this 'written by an alien possessed by a demon' type shit romance) is seriously disturbing to myself as an AroAce person.
