There are only two things I will object to in a ship:

1) It makes no sense. This can be fixed through use of character development or alternative versions of the character(s) involved to make them compatible.

2) It's unethical or otherwise massively problematic. Incest, adult/child, young children, teacher/student, superior/subordinate, abuse, coercion, rape victims coming to love their rapist, etc.

For #1 I'd just suggest that the author put a bit more work into making their ship plausible. For #2, while there's nothing wrong about innocent fantasy or roleplay (not gonna kink-shame), there's something to be said for not promoting unhealthy or unethical relationships (I'm looking at YOU, Stephanie Meyer and E.L. James...).
