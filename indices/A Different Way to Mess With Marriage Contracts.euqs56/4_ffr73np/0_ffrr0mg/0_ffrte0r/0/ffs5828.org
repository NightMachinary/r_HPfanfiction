You make Tomarry sound as some kind of cult (name-wise it's simply just a typical shipname -- fused names of the participants in quesetion). While I really don't care for the pairing, and would rather stay far away from it, I prefer to not judge people for what they like. Ship shaming is easily the worst part of this community, and mostly just drives people away, whether their particular ship preferences are judged or not.

You don't have to enjoy it, I for sure don't. But don't insult people's preferences. Nothing good will come from it.

FWIW, while I don't have an unconditional objection against SSHG (I can see it happen in certain circumstances), the vast majority of SSHG fics are teacher/student (or nearly so) fics, which I find disturbing. But I'm not going to shipshame anyone for liking it -- it's just not something I have any interest for.
