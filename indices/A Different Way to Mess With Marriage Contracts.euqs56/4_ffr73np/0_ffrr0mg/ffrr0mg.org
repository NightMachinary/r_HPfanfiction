I have a massive objection to almost all Snape/Hermione fics, since they tend to take place while she's still at Hogwarts. Sexual/romantic relationships between a teacher and their student are /seriously not okay/. Even if said student isn't still a minor (which adds a whole other layer of "oh fuck no"), they are profoundly unequal in power.

Fics where Hermione is an adult and no longer under Snape's authority/tutelage deal with that issue, though it would still require one or both to be hugely OOC to work.
