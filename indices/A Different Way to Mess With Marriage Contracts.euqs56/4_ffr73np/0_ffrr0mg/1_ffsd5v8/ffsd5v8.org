That's fair. I'll give up the search for the MLC I was trying to find.

Power play / dubcon is one of the most common kinks on the planet. I like how we can explore what makes Snape vulnerable by using that contrast with a much younger student. But, tbh some of the better fics of this pairing are long after the war is over, and Hermione is a little wiser, and he can't give her detention anymore, so she gets her chance to boss him around for once ;)
