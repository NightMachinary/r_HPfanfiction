There's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7833937/chapters/17883658][Rise Above]], where Draco discovers his hidden reserves of kindness after he no longer has Potter to focus on. His bigoted behaviour is actually because of expectations on him, here, and even that is reduced. Becomes a realistic enough Draco/Luna in the scenes that actually take part in Britain. It's a Harry leaves fic.
