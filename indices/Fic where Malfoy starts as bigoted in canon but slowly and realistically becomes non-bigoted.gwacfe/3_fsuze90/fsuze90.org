The fic starts off second year, and the change starts off with something as simple as him still believing non-purebloods are inferior, but him not wanting anyone to die regardless. His friendship with Harry forces him into situations where he has to interact with his so-called inferiors, and he learns to care and even love them. The interactions between Hagrid and Draco are especially heart-warming. The soulmate thing may alienate some people, I started reading the fic with a lot of prejudice too, but it handles it well. Soulmate doesn't equal instant friendship or romance. Two characters with relatively large roles in the story are soulmates but not romantic partners, and both of them are in happy relationships with other people. Voldemort's soulmate is a pretty cool reveal, and it shows that the soul marks thing only means there is potential for a great relationship, nothing more.
