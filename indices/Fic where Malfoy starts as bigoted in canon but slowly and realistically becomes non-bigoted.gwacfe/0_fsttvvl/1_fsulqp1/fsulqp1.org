Sirius escapes from Azkaban a few years early with accidental magic, and not having any leads on Peter, he instead checks on Harry, finds him unhappy, and offers him another home. Which triggers a large manhunt in response to the "kidnapping", accelerating or derailing many canon events, but above all, Harry gets a few years of actual childhood with a flawed-but-caring parental figure.

Draco's redemption starts as a small sub-plot, but snowballs in the later books once they start at Hogwarts and he's shocked at being Sorted into Gryffindor (and his father is also shocked, but his mother is not).
