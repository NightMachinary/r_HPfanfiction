True, but the root cause of his change is kind of disturbing. Since he has an older brother, his father decides to hedge bets and use behavioral conditioning to groom Draco for Gryffindor, in case Harry goes there and turns out to be someone important. Without Draco's knowledge. He just knows that his parents are treating him differently, which is confusing, and he seems to be given different rules from his brother, and he likes getting more hugs and touches from his mother, but he's not properly fitting in with his friends anymore, and not acting like a proper Slytherin should, which distresses him... And that's not even going into his mother's counter-plans.
