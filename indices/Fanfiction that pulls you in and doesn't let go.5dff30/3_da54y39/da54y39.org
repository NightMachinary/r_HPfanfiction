It's not finished, and it is probably the proto-type of the Peggy Sue Harry Potter fics, and by extent, the source for a great deal of the Super!Harry tropes (though notably to a generally reserved extent) but /Nightmares of Future Past/ is surprisingly gripping when one considers its age--pre-dating /Deathly Hallows/ itself. Also, over 400,000 words.

Do you like Luna? This story is her POV of /Order of the Phoenix./ I loved it, but it depends on how much you like Luna. Might be less than 70,000 but this is still a relatively long fic.

/Stages of Hope/ is a superb dimension-travel story. I dare not give anything away.
