Yeah I like a lot about it, I like how it shows the blood purists views without trying to whitewash them. My only gripe with it is it sometimes feel like the authors too afraid kill off developed characters or let the resistance stumble at all. It's one of the few fics I've gotten invested in that a couple time's I've been like "oh shit oh shit something bads gonna happen to the resistance" and then they just make it out alive.
