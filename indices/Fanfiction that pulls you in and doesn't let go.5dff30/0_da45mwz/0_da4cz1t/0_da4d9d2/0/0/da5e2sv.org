It's not that I'm afraid to kill off characters or have the Resistance suffer a setback. When I plot a battle, I don't go Doyle and say: "the Resistance needs a setback", I go Watson and ask myself: "what are the factions involved in this battle? What are their plans, their means, their goals?"

So far, having the Resistance suffering a serious setback (at least in the field - politically, they suffered such reverses several times, right from the start) simply wouldn't have made sense since they had had all the advantages. They've had time to plan carefully and prepare, usually pick at least the location, most often the time for a battle as well, and generally had initiative and surprise on their side. And they have mostly faced small Death Eater groups or the Ministry. And most importantly, Voldemort hasn't been able to find them or prepare for them.

That won't last, though.
