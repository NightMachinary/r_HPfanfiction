I honestly wished for a Trio pairing in this fic, but I'm OK with author's current choice.

I kind like the Voldemort in this story, and [[/spoiler][how he blew up Kingsley's force with a muggle bomb and planted the blame on the Resistance]]. I also like the way how the Ministry got slapped silly by both sides.
