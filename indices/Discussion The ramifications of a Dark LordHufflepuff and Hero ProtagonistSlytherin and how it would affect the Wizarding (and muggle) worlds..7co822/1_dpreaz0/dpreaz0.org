I think you have an interesting concept here, although the protagonist is really OP. Personally, the blowing up of wands and the immunity to Unforgiveables is too over-the-top. Having his magic be volatile is one thing, having it blow out a wand makes it too OP. Being able to fight off the Imperious curse is logical, but being immune to the Cruciatus and the Killing curse is just too much, in my opinion. In order to make your protagonist more believable, readers must be able to relate to him. In terms of the effect on the Wizarding World, it'd definitely be a game changer. John is essentially the inverse of Voldemort in a lot of ways. Idk. I feel like it has a lot of potential but needs refinement.
