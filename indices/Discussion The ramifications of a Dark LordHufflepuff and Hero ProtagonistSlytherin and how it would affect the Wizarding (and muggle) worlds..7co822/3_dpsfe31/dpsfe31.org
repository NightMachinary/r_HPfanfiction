As Inquisitor said, there's no need for such overpoweredness. Really, being so overpowered is generally only good when there are frequent enemies that are near similar levels. And that often means that enemies are just going to get stronger as your character encounters them. It's bad to have a fairly high level enemy still be leagues below your character in terms of power. In fact, it's often better to have a large amount of characters at fairly similar power levels, such as in Worm with the more famous heroes or villains, or in Naruto, such as during the war, many of the major participants were pretty damn powerful. Otherwise, relatively god-tier power should be used as a finale, to defeat the big bad, which is basically what happens in Worm, Naruto, and even PMMM.
