Genuinely great Haphne:\\
linkffn(contractual invalidation) - EDIT: apparently this also isn't 100k, but I'm leaving it here anyways linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the importance of intent) - not 100k, but has a post-credit sequel and is one of the best Haphne fics out there\\
linkffn(Honor thy blood)

These aren't necessarily amazing fics and probably a lot more cliched, but long and still enjoyable guilty-pleasure esque Haphne\\
