You may want to look at The Fires of Magic by Raolin. Its 150K words and while there is no pairing yet it was looking like it might be a Harry/Daphne/Tracy/fem!Blaise pairing (or a pick one of the above). Story is a good read with quite a lot of funny scenes. Downside is it hasn't been updated in a while (Dec 2018) though the last time the author updated one of his other stories was April 2020. He can be found on both ffn and hpfanficarchive.
