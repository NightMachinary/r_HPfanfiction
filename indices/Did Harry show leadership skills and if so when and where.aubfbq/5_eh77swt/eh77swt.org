Just shared this in on another post but it applies here as well. It all boils down to this quote near the end of OOTP.

“It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.”

He has, at his core, the values from the beginning but comes into his own in embracing it at the end of GOF, standing up to face Voldemort in the graveyard. Dumbledore's actions regarding Harry as well as his youth effectively stunted his ability to develop some of the skills (being assertive, delegating tasks, etc.) you cite during his first four years but they start coming out with the DA in OOTP.

As far as rallying people together the final battle at Hogwarts is the perfect embodiment of this. Voldemort trotted out his body to humiliate and destroy the morale of the resistance. It only served as a rallying point to those who had been influenced and inspired by Harry during his time at school.

Harry is reluctant but in the end he is a far better leader than Voldemort.
