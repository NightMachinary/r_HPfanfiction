One of my favorite moments for Harry is in OotP when they're surrounded by death eaters, and I think it shows pretty well how he takes the lead. In the DoM, everyone ends up physically behind him when the death eaters show themselves. When death eaters try to grab Ginny, he steps in front of her and redirects the attention of the death eaters. He comes up with a plan of escaping and communicates it to the others while holding a distracting conversation with Lucius. He gives the signal for their escape. Neville and Hermione clearly look to him for leadership while they're trying to stay ahead of the death eaters.
