check out linkfnn(Circular Reasoning), extreme AU with an semicrrazy PTSD suffering 28 year old harry in a postapoltic London who ends up being sent back in time to when he's 13, this story is so grimdark it makes game of thrones look like the telly tubbies, contains lots of graphic torture, murder also avoids many common plot points, and their is covert/spec ops for the minsitry who are competent assassins/torturers, unlike other similar stories (nightmares of futures past and wastelands of time) harry actually does "evil things" to "innocents"
