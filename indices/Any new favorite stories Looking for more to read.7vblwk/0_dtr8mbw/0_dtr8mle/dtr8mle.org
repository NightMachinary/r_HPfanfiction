  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
