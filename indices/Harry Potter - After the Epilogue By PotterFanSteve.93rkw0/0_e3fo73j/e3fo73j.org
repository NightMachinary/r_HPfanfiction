Respectfully,

You have this tagged as discussion, yet what precisely did you want to discuss? Its length?

Also, I believe the Dangerverse exceeds this in length, with 1.9 million in the main series, but over 500,000 words in omakes, spinoffs, and AU whatifs. True it isn't just in one single FFN story entry, but it is one story.
