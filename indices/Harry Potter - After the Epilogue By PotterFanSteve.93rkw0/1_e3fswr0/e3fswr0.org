It may be the longest single story but as to its quality? Ehhhh.

Furthermore the longest series that I'm aware of is the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave at 3 million words. As if the sheer length isn't enough it is also well written and the plot moves at a reasonable pace. I continue to rec this fic even though it is Slash and I don't read Slash, which speaks volumes to its quality.
