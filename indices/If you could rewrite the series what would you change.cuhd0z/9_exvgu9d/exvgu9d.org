First thing that comes to mind is this video by uniquenameosaurus: [[https://youtu.be/qqwc7Kgon1k]]

I'd make the killing curse really, really difficult to cast, and when you do cast the spell, it tires you out so much you're essentially incapacitated. With the exception of Voldemort, the only person in history who can cast it multiple times in a row.

Therefore, fights become more creative and Voldemort is at least somewhat more threatening.
