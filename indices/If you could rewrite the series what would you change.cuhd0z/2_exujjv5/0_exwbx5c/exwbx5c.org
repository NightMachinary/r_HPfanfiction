Killing off Luna just makes me sad, especially to save a bully.

I like 2.

I agree. Ron does do some underhanded things, but Hermione responds in kind, often worse.

I like more Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.

McGonagall is useless, so I can get behind that.

Bill especially. Curse breakers sound competent.

Yes! That's a point missed by serious fanfic writers. Harry is a kid.
