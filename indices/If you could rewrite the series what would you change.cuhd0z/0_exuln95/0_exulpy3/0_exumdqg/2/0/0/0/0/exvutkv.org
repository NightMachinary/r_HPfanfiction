Of course that makes significantly more sense, considering Oliver was Quidditch obsessed and good enough to play professionally (in addition to being captain by the time Harry came along). But it also means that if Charlie is three years older than Percy (and Percy's classmate Oliver), Oliver/Charlie were teammates and Gryffindor "not winning since the legendary Charlie Weasley" is a ridiculous statement.

I wish JKR had gone with a seven-year gap between Charlie/Percy. Then the Quidditch math would work, and it would also shed some light on Percy's personality as the oldest of the second group of kids, whose only older siblings were much older.
