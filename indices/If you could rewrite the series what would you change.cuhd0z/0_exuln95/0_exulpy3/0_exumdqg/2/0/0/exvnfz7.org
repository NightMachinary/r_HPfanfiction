The Charlie thing in particular will forever make my head hurt. I think Rowling originally even said there were only two years between Charlie/Percy, and a fan had to point out that Charlie would have been Seeker Harry's first year if that had been true. As it stands now, Oliver Wood was somehow made captain his first year on the team, because he didn't win until his seventh year and Gryffindor won when it had Charlie during Oliver's first through fourth years.
