I meant in the other direction. Ron born in 1980, the twins in 1978, Percy in 1976, Charlie in 1969, and Bill in 1967. That puts Bill starting school at the end of the Maruader era, which is interesting in and of itself.

A lot of the fandom thought that that was how things were before JKR clarified Charlie's age in an interview-- we assumed that because Oliver had never sniffed a Quidditch championship and Gryffindor was in the middle of a long drought, there must be a massive age gap between Charlie and Percy/Oliver.
