I think Lucius was stated to be 43 in like CoS yet in DH we see him welcoming Snape to Slytherin with a prefects badge on his chest. That would put him between 43-45 in DH.

Bella is said to be born in 1950, which is 10 yrs before Snape, Sirius, etc. are born and 3 yrs before they get to Hogwarts, but in GOF Sirius says Snape was hanging around the Lestranges. "They're a married couple" he says. Now that puts Andromeda, Narcissa, and Tonks' ages in limbo.

In PS, someone says Gryffindor hadn't won since Charlie Weasley left and Slytherin had won what 7 straight? Bill was born in 1970. Percy 1974/75. That puts Charlie around '72 aka 8 years before Harry, which means Charlie should've left Hogwarts the year before Harry got there.

Flint was like a seventh year in COS, but is still there in PoA.
