Book 1:

- Make Nevile part of the core group.
- Drastic Changes to Quidditch: Training for first years that are interested, backup players (especially seekers), Standardized team brooms (Traditionally donated by parents and former house alumni). Ron joins the reserves as a Keeper/Catcher.

- James would not have played Quidditch.
- Fix every currently existing character's ages.
- Each of the core four are given a thing they are good at from the start. Hermione is good at research (this is different than being good at studying or teaching), Nevile is a natural with plants (a trait he would share with his mother), Harry is good at flying, Ron is good at Transfigurations.

Harry spends the remainder of the summer with them and we get some insight into wizarding culture. Ron and Hermione are invited over for both Harry and Neville's birthdays. Harry learns that Alice was his godmother, and Lily was Neville's. The two would have been raised as brothers, if not for the Lastranges.
- The intelligence of the paintings at Hogwarts is proven to be superior to other paintings. Other paintings capture the thoughts and feelings at the time they're made and don't know anything outside of what the subject knew at the time. They can react to things happening in front of them but they forget about it in ten minutes (really good paintings can remember things for days). Hogwarts paintings can learn new things, hence why they speak modern English.

Harry visits him before leaving (with a cow he got from Hagrid) and learns that the purpose Chamber of Secrets was to leave a tutor for Slytherin's descendants and many of them have found the Chamber over the last thousand years. The Basilisk promises to teach Harry is he comes back.
- Each of the core four are given a thing they have to work at to be good at but they really enjoy. Hermione's is dueling, Nevile's is Transfigurations (Ron helps him with it), Harry's is knitting (he takes it up when Ginny abandons it do to her Diary induced depression), Ron's is teaching.

- Each of the core four teaches a side character a valuable skill.
- Firenze still replaces Trelawny but as a favor to Dumbledore not because he was kicked out for saving Harry.
- The Basilisk helps the core four plan lessons for the DA. Harry talks to the Basilisk about using its venom to cure Neville's parents.
