I wouldn't really change much of the plot, since I doubt I could do much better. I also happen to like Canon(there are still a couple things that annoy me).

Mostly I would just add a little more foreshadowing for future plot points, like the Hallows or the significance of wand allegiances.

Id also specify a couple things that were mentioned in the books, but were apparently not clear enough, like Time Turners being able to change the past, or the purpose of Occlumency being to magically protect the mind instead of just protecting against Legilimency. And most importantly that Snape never cared for Harry.

Remove things that didn't make sense with later introduced Plot points, like Dumbledore flying to the ministry instead of using apparition. And use terms that weren't even invented until later books like Squib.

Another thing would be to to get numbers a little bit better sorted out, like passing mentions of a few additional dorms, students and teacher. And try to keep check on how old certain characters are at certain moments.

One bigger change I would make is having Harry and Ron show a more talent at magic and use it more often, since Deathly Hallows shows them as very competent compared to other wizards when, they only looked a little above average before with Harry even seeming to struggle quite a bit in sixth year.

Id like to say that I would change the romance in the books, but I actually like that there wasn't a very big focus of it, and dont really mind the pairings.

And by far the biggest change I would make is to the Epilogue, where I change the name of Albus Severus to Albus Rubeus or something like that. Also remove the mention of the Malfoys because it didn't make any sense that Draco(and his father) didn't end up in prison after the war.
