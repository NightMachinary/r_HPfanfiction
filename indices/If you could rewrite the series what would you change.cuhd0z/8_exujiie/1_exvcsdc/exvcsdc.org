I can understand how Draco maybe didnt being a minor who was to a degree minipulated because had the threat of his family getting killed if he didnt comply and he still didn't tell Bellatrix about Harry. So leniency might be shown maybe a short period in containment or probation instead of something more serious. At this point Sirius being actually innocent has been spread which would call for super strict and harsh punishments to be side eyed more especially I assume for younger people.

Lucius and Narcissa would have been i think dealt with more hashly but the last war they got away with claiming it was the imperius this time it could be a similar excuse or claiming they were held hostage or something. Apart from the incident at the departmemt of mysteries the Malfoy parental units had limited things to do. Lucius was honestly pretty useless if you look at his track record over the series so maybe that was why.
