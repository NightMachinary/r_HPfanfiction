Draco was old enough to be tried as an adult, and committed offences (at least three attempted murders, conspiracy to murder, aiding and abetting murder) that mandate full-dress adult trials /even if he'd been caught and tried immediately/ on his committing them somewhere after he'd turned 16.

Neither of Malfoy father or son are able to avail themselves of the defense of duress, since it's absolutely not available for charges of murder and is generally not (ie exceptions are possible, but highly unlikely) available for members of criminal gangs. All of the 'they held my wife/son/parents hostage' stuff is for their parole hearings after they've done fifteen to twenty years inside.

And Draco gets as much sympathy with the 'it was the way he was brought up' rubbish as any common thief who grew up on an estate does. The fact that the family that raised him to be a criminal had more money than your typical criminal family counts /against/ them.
