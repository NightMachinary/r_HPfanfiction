Draco was a Death Eater and literally tortured people, enslaved Rosmerta for a year, attempted multiple murders which almost killed multiple people, and was at the very least accessory to the murder of Dumbledore. Being 16 shouldn't protect him from any of that.

And Lucius was literally in Azkaban for being a Death Eater before he broke out of prison in Half-Blood-Prince it makes absolutely no sense why people would allow him to stay out of prison after the war.
