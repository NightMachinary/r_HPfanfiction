I would make Harry more realistic. He had just suffered 10 years of abuse. He would be too thin to eat properly, due to not eating regularly for a while. He probably would've remembered Draco from Madame Malkin's and wanted to be his friend because he was the first person to not bully or abuse Harry. I doubt he would've been so self assertive due to being made to feel worthless his entire life. So, all in all, I would give Rowling a psychology book. And a maths one.

I would also make it so Tom riddle survives year 2. That would be interesting to have a sixteen year old boy (immortality, remember) show up in 6th year.

Harry would be in Slytherin. Aka, the sorting hat wouldn't be so much of a /pussy/
