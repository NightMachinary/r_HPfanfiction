1.  Yep!
2.  I like him being like a young Tom Riddle, except with varying strengths.
3.  Yep!
4.  Yep, especially BCJ. Dude went from just after his NEWTs to being under the imperius to confunding the goblet of fire.
5.  Yep!
6.  I'm neutral.
7.  Arthur and Hagrid seem more likely, but Rowling would have the biggest metaphorical balls to have killed ~~Emma Watson~~ Hermione. (I know the book versions and the movie are different, but imagine the backlash she would have faced.)
8.  Yep! She was kinda disappointing in the books, but I put that down to Rowling making fun of the French.
9.  At least giving him the choice. Honestly, if I was Harry I would say no to the position, especially if Ron and Hermione get the spots.
10. Yep! Maybe once he gets to be 7?
11. Yep! I like her character. Once she's over her crush especially.
12. Ehh... I'm neutral.
13. Not an absolute yes, but pretty good.
14. Yep x1000!
15. Yep. Perhaps no cupboard under the stairs?
16. Yep!
