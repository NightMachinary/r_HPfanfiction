  The problem with Voldemort is that so much of the war was off screen while the kids were camping that it didn't really set in that, he'd won

Eh, it didn't? That whole chapter with Lupin pretty much made it clear that Voldemort had won and Harry was the only reason anyone kept fighting.

That's not the problem. At least not for me. The problem was a lot of stuff broke suspension of disbelief. Like I can't think of one reason why Snape wasn't killed before the last 4-5 chapters other than plot. Yeah, he's an occlumens, but how doesn't cunning Voldemort notice Snape isn't really the best spy /for him/?
