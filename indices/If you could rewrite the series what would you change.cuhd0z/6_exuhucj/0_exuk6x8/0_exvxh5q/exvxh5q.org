The problem with Voldemort is that so much of the war was off screen while the kids were camping that it didn't really set in that, he'd won. The Order was underground. The Ministry was officially stooges run by Death Eaters hauling in mudbloods at a whim. Hogwarts is also run by Death Eaters indoctrinating the next generation.

If not for Harry being Fate's bitch, Voldemort may have had a long and depressing reign.
