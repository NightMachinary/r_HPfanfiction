Voldemort was honestly pretty dissapointing especially since it seemed like the younger version of him would be a much more intimidating intelligent villain. His plans just felt very meh after he came back. But in his defence getting permanent snake face limits your options.

Hermione really needed an arc she had one in the first book understanding being a good student is less important and valuable than doing the right thing even if it means being disobedient but after that she doesnt really get one. Since she struggles with empathy and is accidentally insensitive alot Id love it if her becoming friends with Ron and Harry were a longer arc that starts with the troll incident. But they dont become automatic bffs since they dont yet have much in common. Also would give a chance for other students to help in Harry and Ron's schemes so you get to know them better too.

Andromeda killing Bella would be great especially if she got introduced before and you got to know her decently well before she has the confrontation.
