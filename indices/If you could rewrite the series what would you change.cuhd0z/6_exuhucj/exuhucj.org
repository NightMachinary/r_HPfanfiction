1.  I'd make everyone a little more gray and a lot more competent, especially the villains. Realistically, only Harry should've made it out of the DOM.

2.  I'd make Harry a charm's prodigy

3.  Bella and Voldemort would be a lot less cartoonish

4.  BCJ and one of Amelia Bones/BCS would live a little longer and do more stuff

5.  Moody, Voldemort, and Bella would live up to their hype

6.  Harry and Cho date in his 3rd/4th yr, but would end the same way in his fifth

7.  I'd kill two of Hagrid, Hermione, and Arthur

8.  Fleur would be some fantastic healer or enchanter

9.  Prefect Harry

10. Dumbledore doesn't completely cut Harry off for a decade

11. Make Harry and Ginny friends

12. Fleur and Harry endgame

13. Andromeda kills Bella. Tonks stays home.

14. Have someone, /anyone/ tell Hermione that she's wrong. Xeno, Rita, and Ginny were /so/ close to it.

15. Petunia and Harry would have a heart to heart

16. No damn Albus Severus
