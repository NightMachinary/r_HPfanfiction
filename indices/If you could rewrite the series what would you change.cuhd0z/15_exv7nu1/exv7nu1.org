More or less what was written here, but really make Dursleys more believable. The abuse doesn't have to be more harsh (keep it PG-13, if you want), but Dursleys by JKR are just a weird parody on humans through the eyes of abused child. Yes, I know, the books are written through Harry's eyes, but I would really love some more humanization of Dursleys. There are many good reasons why Petunia may be suspicious of magic (I love “Magic destroys everything it touches.” in linkffn(Lion Unity by Fruitality)), and it would be lovely if they could have one real talk about it. I know about this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhS9Z13Gyac][deleted scene]] from the DH1 movie, but I would rather hope for some more extended talk (over the breakfast?).
