  Kreacher doesn't play a role in Sirius' death (with the overtones of "it was his own fault, who cares how tragic his life was") and Sirius' death is not an ambiguous falls-through-drapery thing. I understand needing to kill all the father figures. I don't understand adding insult to injury.

I remember being very confused when I read it, was kinda disappointed by how it was written (though I'm still torn about whether or not JK Rowling made it sudden and confusing on purpose so that we and Harry would have a harder time accepting that he actually did die). However, what comes after that, when Harry tries to find ways to communicate with Sirius is one of my favorite parts of the entire series. Just heartbreaking.
