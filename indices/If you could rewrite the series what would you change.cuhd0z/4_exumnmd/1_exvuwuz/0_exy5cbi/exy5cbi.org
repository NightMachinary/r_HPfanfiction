I understand the symbolism of the story as it is, but it doesn't work for me.

I think that a story that centers around the power of love is cheapened when one sort of love is semi-explicitly held up as the most important. The love of a friend, a romantic partner, a sibling, a father is somehow less than the love of a mother? That's icky to me. It's simultaneously an unkind message to send to someone who doesn't have a mother (or a loving mother) and an unkind message to send to mothers, since all the pressure is now on them. I always HATED JKR's comment that James' sacrifice meant less than Lily's because he hadn't thought about it. WTF? Guy is in the middle of a war, has defied the chief bad guy three times, and has never thought about whether he'd throw himself in front of Voldemort to save Lily and Harry?

I also don't like the idea that maternal love trumps all the education and training in the world. Bellatrix had no trouble taking out Sirius and Tonks, both of whom were actively focused on subduing dark magic while Molly was (nobly enough) focused on raising her family. Molly's love for her family, and the power of that love, was perfectly clear without disparaging the other kinds of work people can put into making a positive impact on the world as useless in comparison.
