Give Molly Weasley a more supporting role. She isn't a front line combatant- she may have been trained for it during the first war, but by the time of the books she's nearly two decades out of practice.

Instead of having her kill Bellatrix, give that role to somebody else and make Molly's a more emotionally supportive role. Perhaps she reassures Ron when he breaks down after being powerless to protect the woman he loves from Bellatrix. Let her have one on one interactions with Harry that flesh out the mother-son dynamic. Where she excels is maintaining the hearth and home so her family (and the Order) always have somewhere to return to.

There's plenty of other badass women who are competent and skilled frontline fighters, but it doesn't make sense for Molly to be one of them.
