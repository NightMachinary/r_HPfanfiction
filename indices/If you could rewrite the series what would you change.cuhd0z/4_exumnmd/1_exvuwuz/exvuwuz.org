I think Molly was the perfect person to take out Bella

The dumpy housewife taking on the feared Dark witch and kicking her arse

To me, it's very symbolic of the power of a mothers love. Molly was obviously very powerful but it was the loss of one child and the immediate threat of losing others that really got her going

One of the main themes in HP (to me) is maternal love. We have Lily (obviously) who died for Harry, Molly and her protective and nuturing persona and even Narcissa who made an Unbreakable Oath and lied to Voldemort

On the other hand, we've got Eileen Snape who exposes her son to neglect and violence, Petunia Dursley who ruins her son through overindulgence, Merope Gaunt who literally gave up (although she was so abused herself) and then we have Bellatrix who would have sacrificed her son to feed her obsession with the Dark Lord.

To me, Molly taking out Bella is a nice way of tying this idea together.
