Epilogue is replaced with something much closer to the final chapter timeline wise, maybe the first day of Hogwarts after the fall of Voldemort. It's bittersweet for Harry because he won't be going back, but he's proud that he has helped rebuild it and is in the process of finding some peace after the war. All isn't well, but all is progressing in the right direction and there's plenty of hope. (Or for the love of everything holy, at least no Albus Severus. There's a name that proves that all was NOT well, because Harry never coped with his stolen childhood.)

Ginny's personality shows up more often in the earlier books, and as a result Harry spends a little bit of time being her friend before the dragon shows up in his chest. As the books stand now, Cho/Harry had a more natural progression over multiple books than Ginny/Harry.

Kreacher doesn't play a role in Sirius' death (with the overtones of "it was his own fault, who cares how tragic his life was") and Sirius' death is not an ambiguous falls-through-drapery thing. I understand needing to kill all the father figures. I don't understand adding insult to injury.

Tonks kills Bellatrix. Or Neville does it. Or Augusta. Or Andromeda. Or almost anyone other than Molly.
