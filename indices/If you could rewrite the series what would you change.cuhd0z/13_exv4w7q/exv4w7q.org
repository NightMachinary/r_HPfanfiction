Change the reason for why Time-Turners weren't a thing anymore. As it's written ALL Time-Turners are destroyed when Harry and the other fight against the death eaters in the department of mysteries. I totally understand how difficult it was to find a legitimate reason though, not sure what solution I would use, and the Time-Turners definitely needed to go. Way too powerful and way too strange that they would never be used.
