To be fair time turners dont even need to be destroyed. The rules of time turners are its a small period of time and its in a loop. So if you go back to say stop the ressurection of Voldemort while Voldemort is standing in front of you know you fail. If you didn't fail in the past he wouldn't be standing in front of you in the present. So maybe people do have the option and people are just failing to do what they wanted.
