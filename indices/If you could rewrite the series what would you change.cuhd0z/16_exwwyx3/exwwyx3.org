So basically, for the purpose of this exercise, I'm taking JKR's role as the author of the books.

I've actually been thinking about this. Of course, MY Harry Potter probably wouldn't have been one-tenth as imaginative and wouldn't have got one-tenth as much fame and recognition... but let's say that I had the series, I had the broad-strokes setting, plot and characters, and that I was free to do whatever I wanted with them. Wellll....

- Less blatant "Muggles are inferior and if you don't have magic you're scum!" attitude. The wizarding world can be bigots, that's fine, but at least have SOME people there who start questioning whether it's actually ethical to mind-wipe Muggles at the drop of a hat. Don't wait until the seventh book to have someone mention that maybe Muggles are people too. REALLY don't wait until the spin-off to have a Muggle who's actually kind of positively portrayed.

- Either reduce the Dursleys' role, or develop them more. Usually in these types of story, the "nasty relatives who raise the hero" vanish from the narrative after the hero's discovered his real heritage. The Dursleys have really played out their role after the first book, and since they steadfastly refuse any development (maybe except Dudley) they feel increasingly out of place. Just have Harry leave them after he goes to Hogwarts; have him stay with Hagrid or something, and leave the Dursleys from the narrative. And then they can appear again in the sixth book or something, when Harry's sixteen and can face that part of his past.

- More girls. Seriously. The HP books are a total boys' club. Yes, I know, people will always point out how many awesome female characters there are in the books, but apart from Hermione they're all secondary characters who MAYBE get large roles in one or two books. Give the other girls more to do, break out of the stereotypical "men do the important things" here and reduce the "not like other girls" role of Hermione. Give Ginny and Luna more to do, and not just off-screen. Develop Lavender and Parvati instead of just having them as (inferior) "girly" contrast to Hermione. Maybe even swap a few genders; make one of the Weasley twins female and hang the entire "Ginny's the only daughter" thing.

- Develop the four Houses more. As the books tell it, Gryffindor is the only house that's any good at all. Slytherin is evil, Hufflepuff is a bunch of losers, and Ravenclaw is so anonymous they might as well not have been in the books at all. It might actually have helped to break up the main trio, but Ron in Hufflepuff and Hermione in Ravenclaw. And then just make it more acceptable to visit other house common rooms and such. Harry, Ron and Hermione could still hang out all the time, they'd just have three common rooms to do it in instead of just the one. As for Slytherin, you can use Slughorn as a perfect catalyst to introduce some sympathetic Slytherins. I don't know, have a Slytherin girl in Ginny's year or something. Gryffindor can still be the "main" house since that's Harry's house (and Neville would be an important supporting player in Gryffindor), but this way the other houses get a little more agency and nuance.

- Get out of Harry's head more. He's the main character, but he doesn't have to be the center of EVERY scene. Have more chapters where he isn't present, and we actually get to see the lives of other people in the world. In particular, both Ron and Hermione should get at LEAST one chapter per book each.

- On that note, more development for Ron and Hermione. I've mentioned before how their character development kind of halts mid-series when the entire "Ron is never right and Hernione is never wrong" thing really takes off. Have Ron actually get to to succeed without immediately undermining him, have Hermione actually be wrong without immediately making excuses for her or twist it so that she was REALLY right anyway.

- Give Hermione's family some attention. I know, JKR made a choice not to include them much because Ron's family was more interesting AND more plot-relevant, but I think at least one chapter with Hermione in the Muggle world would be nice. Give her parents a little more attention... and you know what? Go with the original plan of giving her a younger sister who's a Muggle. If Hermione stays in touch with her sister, who maybe occasionally goes to find out things in the Muggle world and sends letters to Hermione, that would even make a nice contrast to Harry's relationship with Dudley. If the "Hermione mindwipes her family" thing still happens, it'll hit a LOT harder if the reader KNOWS that family, the sister who wrote all those funny letters and was a big help in Book Three; all of a sudden she doesn't know who she is and has been sent to Australia. This again would tie into the questions of ethical treatment of Muggles.

- In fact, give one book to Ron and Hermione where they, not Harry, save the day. I know, Harry's the main character, but part of the POINT is that Harry is a contrast to Voldemort... where Voldemort only trusts himself, Harry accepts friendship. It sort of underminds the point if Harry has to defeat Voldemort alone ANYWAY. How about, say, Harry actually vanishes in the Triwizard Tournament, and then Ron and Hermione have to find and rescue him? Put their skills a little more on display, give them a few chapters where they have to manage without Harry, and step up to the task.

- Foreshadow the Horcruxes and Hallows a little more... particularly the Hallows, so that they don't come completely out of left field in the last book. Have Ron tell The Tale of the Three Brothers or something in the first book, and maybe they figure out a minor plot point thanks to it... THEN, several books later, introduce the concept of the actual Hallows, and Harry can remember "the story Ron had told him years ago" or something.

- ETA: Oh, and I almost forgot: NO prophecy and NO time-travel. The Time-Turners were a bad idea to begin with, and while the HP prophecy isn't the WORST example of a prophecy I've heard, prophecies in general are just terrible. So, no prophecy. Instead, Voldemort goes after Lily and James because he wants to unite the Deathly Hallows and has found out about the Invisibility Cloak. As in canon, he agrees to spare Lily because Snape pleads for her life... as in canon he breaks the promise when she annoys him, unwittingly agreeing to trade harry's life for hers, and gets vanquished in the same way. OOTP is not about Voldemort trying to learn the Prophecy, but trying to get the Invisibility Cloak off Harry..
