Remove some completely overpowered items like liquid luck or time turners.

Include Flamel and Alchemy a bit more.

More scenes with a badass helping Dumbledore. The Ministry battle in OOTP is pretty much the only time we really see him fight, I want more.

Less plot holes.

More competent adults and villains.
