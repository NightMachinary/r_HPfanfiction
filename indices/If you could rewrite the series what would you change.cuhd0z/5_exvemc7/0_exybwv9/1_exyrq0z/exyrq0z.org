Just making them rare doesn't solve the issue, as soon as they somehow get involved they are immediately plotkillers. I'd rework them to be less powerful, like time turners completely unable to change the past (HPMoR did somewhat balanced time turners) and liquid luck only giving a moderate advantage, maybe it gives the user temporary seer abilities that manifest in a higher chance to make good decisions.
