Liquid luck, time turners, polyjuice, truth serum, mind reading. Far, far too powerful, and as a result ridiculously underused because they're plot-killers.

Portkeys are also overly powerful. To get rid of enemies you simply throw them a portkey to an active volcano.

The sum of Dumbledore's actions and inactions make him either outright evil or utterly incompetent.

Harry is a non-entity in the early books. Spineless and reactive, he has no will of his own. He names his son after the 2 persons he had the most problems with. And after being harassed and persecuted by a corrupt Ministry he then starts taking orders from them in a job recommended by a Death Eater.

Ron and Hermione are too dissimilar to be a believable couple. They are polar opposites and the only thing they have in common is Harry as a friend.

Ginny. She's hardly in the story at all until she's suddenly Harry's girlfriend.
