  Liquid luck, time turners, polyjuice, truth serum, mind reading. Portkeys are also overly powerful. To get rid of enemies you simply throw them a portkey to an active volcano

I think if the fandom ceases to overestimate what an average wizard can do, these things stop being "too powerful." The average wizard can't adequately perform a shield charm or a patronus. They certainly can't do any of this.

Liquid luck is toxic and from the description given very much acts like an addictive drug. Time turners were all destroyed and there seemed to be a small number in existence to begin with. Polyjuice has to be continuously drunk and the only difference between it and wand human transfiguration is the voice change. Truth serum can be beaten with occlumency and isn't even used in court because of that fact. Legilimency isn't widely known.

  Spineless and reactive, he has no will of his own.

Interesting because he typically did what he wanted.

  Ginny. She's hardly in the story at all until she's suddenly Harry's girlfriend

She was around more in OOTP than she was in HBP.
