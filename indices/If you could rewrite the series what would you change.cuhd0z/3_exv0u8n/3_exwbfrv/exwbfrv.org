Even if I disagree with you, I enjoy your posts on this subreddit.

All of this, plus going into the corruption at the ministry. Fudge is very heavily implied to have been bribed. Summary execution seems to be a thing. Umbridge being planted as a teacher when she has another role. Prisoners being denied due process.

I'd probably change Hermione's character to be a bit better with people. Ron should be better at magic as well. Malfoy as well. If doing a redemption arc for him, then he should definitely be shown to have some sort of compassion in the series, rather than being a happy member of the ~~Hitler Youth~~ Death Eaters: Hogwarts Chapter.

Perhaps some more functional adults. Snape shouldn't actively sabotage children if keeping him good.
