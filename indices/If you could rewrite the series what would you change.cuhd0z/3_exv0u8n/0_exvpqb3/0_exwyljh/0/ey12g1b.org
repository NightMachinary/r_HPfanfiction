I think you miss the forest for the trees. The point of the paragraph isn't "Harry figures out Occlumency", it's that Voldemort can't touch Harry because he doesn't comprehend grief --- that's a recurring theme of the last few books. That conclusion would imply that Harry still couldn't keep, say, Snape out with that technique.

To individual points now. The first part says what Dumbledore wanted him to learn was to "learn to shut his mind /to Voldemort/". 'Learning control' could easily refer his specific connection to Voldemort. I admit those first two sentences could be interpreted in the general sense, but I more naturally read it in the specific. It's both explicit and ambiguous. :)

Regarding Occlumency itself, I think the evidence is clear that Occlumency is about suppression, not just control. In addition to JKR's comments above, Snape frequently tells Harry to 'clear his mind'. Occlumency in combat is never discussed in canon.
