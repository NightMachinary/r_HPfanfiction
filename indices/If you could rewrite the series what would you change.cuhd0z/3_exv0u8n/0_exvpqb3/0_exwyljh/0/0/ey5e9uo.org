  I think you miss the forest for the trees. The point of the paragraph isn't "Harry figures out Occlumency", it's that Voldemort can't touch Harry because he doesn't comprehend grief --- that's a recurring theme of the last few books. That conclusion would imply that Harry still couldn't keep, say, Snape out with that technique.
#+end_quote

I disagree. The fundamental problem with your interpretation is that it renders the majority of the paragraph nonsensical. If Voldemort was merely being repelled by Harry's love/grief, as occurred in OotP when Harry thought of Sirius, then:

1. Harry hasn't learnt anything. The protective effect is a coincidence of his current feelings.

2. Control is irrelevant. The protective effect is a result of feeling what he is feeling, and control plays no role in that.

And yet the paragraph takes pains to say that Harry /has/ learnt something (specifically, how to keep Voldemort from his mind as Snape tried to teach him to) and that control plays a role in that. Control is referenced twice: in the general ("he had learnt control") and in the specific (he felt the pain but was apart from it).

My reading gives meaning to the /whole/ paragraph on it natural and literal interpretation. Your interpretation takes one sentence from the paragraph, says that's the sentence that matters, and ignores the rest.

  Regarding Occlumency itself, I think the evidence is clear that Occlumency is about suppression, not just control. In addition to JKR's comments above, Snape frequently tells Harry to 'clear his mind'.

You are remembering the fanon caricature of Snape's lessons, not the actual lessons. Snape expands on the nature of occlumency to a reasonable degree, and we know that control is the major aspect of it.

#+begin_quote
  ‘The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.'
#+end_quote

An occlumens does not shut down all thought and emotions, but rather specifically controls their mind to avoid thinking of that which they wish to hide.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Clear your mind, Potter,' said Snape's cold voice. ‘Let go of all emotion ...'

  But Harry's anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs ...

  ‘You're not doing it, Potter ... you will need more discipline than this ... focus, now ...'

  ...

  ‘Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!' said Snape savagely. ‘Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easily -- weak people, in other words -- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!'

  ‘I am not weak,' said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment.

  ‘Then prove it! Master yourself!' spat Snape. ‘Control your anger, discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens!'
#+end_quote

Snape's practice is not just about clearing your mind, it is also about detaching your thoughts from your emotions. It is the art of mental self-discipline and objectivity, of which clearing your mind is just one aspect.

  Occlumency in combat is never discussed in canon.
#+end_quote

It is; Snape in HBP states that unless you are occluding against a legilimens, the legilimens will be able to block your spells easily.

  ‘Incarc---' Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.

  ‘Fight back!' Harry screamed at him. ‘Fight back, you cowardly --'

  ‘Coward, did you call me, Potter?' shouted Snape. ‘Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?'

  ‘Stupe---'

  ‘Blocked again, and again, and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!' sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more.
