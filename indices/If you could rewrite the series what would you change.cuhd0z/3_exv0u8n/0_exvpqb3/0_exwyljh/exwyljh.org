I don't think it's that ambiguous.

*Firstly*, because it explicitly tells us that Harry has learnt control, "the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape". And of course, we know that occlumency works via control, and we know that occlumency was the thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape.

So I think this explicit statement would override any incongruity between what Harry is doing and what we previously knew about occlumency. The passage says he's learnt it, so he has, and any discrepancy just means he's practising it in a different way to that we previously knew.

However, *secondly*, I don't think there's any contradiction with what we previously knew about occlumency. We frequently see Snape and Dumbledore display emotion, even during combat. The compartmentalisation of occlumency clearly isn't about not /feeling/ emotions, but rather not allowing your emotions to rule you. So Harry feeling grief but being apart from it is precisely in line with what we know about occlumency. This is reinforced by the numbness Harry feels when digging the grave.

Yes, the passage elaborates on an additional, Voldemort-specific factor in comparing the grief to the possession incident in OotP. But that does not contradict or undermine the fact that we are told that Harry has a) learnt control and b) is apart from his emotions. Those are the key elements of occlumency mastery as explained by Snape and /not/ Voldemort-specific.
