*Make Harry better at magic*

Sustain and progress the arc started for Harry in PoA (Patronus lessons) which in canon just kinda petered out. Basically: a more consistently magically powerful Harry.

1. The obvious next step in this arc is the Triwizard, only you have Harry actually do well in the tasks by mastering useful magic rather than flying/eating a plant (third task did that well enough).

2. In OotP, do the DA similarly but stress that Harry is learning new things to keep ahead of the DA rather than just teaching them his old tricks. And then, in HBP, don't undermine the things Harry taught by minimising their importance (e.g. in OotP it was impressive that older years came to Harry for instruction; in HBP the introduction of non-verbal magic implies they were just humouring Harry).

3. In HBP, make Harry take to non-verbal magic naturally rather than mentioning him struggling with it every other chapter. It's based on strength of mind, something Harry demonstrated in resisting the Imperius. Similarly, show Harry in HBP being more proactive in preparing for the war: depict him learning the spells we see him use in DH (which we never saw him learn), and have him keep the DA going.

4. In DH, make a bigger deal out of Harry mastering occlumency, as in the current form most readers don't even realise it happened.

The purpose of this arc is not to make Harry beat Voldemort via beating him in a fair fight (that should remain beyond Harry's abilities). Rather the purpose is to make Harry a more serious threat to Death Eaters, and to enable the reader to respect Harry more as a proactive, competent character with agency.

*Rationalise the worldbuilding*

By "rationalise" I don't mean pull an MOR. I mean make things more internally consistent and explore magical society in more detail.

E.g.

1. Pick a population number and depict it consistently.

2. Depict the wizarding economy in more detail (i.e. what ordinary wizards do to earn a living, other than working for the Ministry). Show the differences in what is considered scarce/valuable from the Muggle world.

3. Build up the Ministry. Most particularly, identify reasons why Voldemort isn't able to just take over the Ministry immediately (e.g. with Imperius spam) and think about how Voldemort is going to get around them. In canon, Voldemort seems to go from sitting around not doing much to taking the Ministry in a very short amount of time. The question arises: why didn't he do it earlier? The obvious answer is Dumbledore was alive to stop him, but it's not clear what exactly Dumbledore was doing to stop him (just as it's not clear what Voldemort was doing to try).

4. Put thought into how Voldemort is viewed internationally, and to what extent he operates in other countries. Either depict international elements in the conflict, or come up with good reasons why the international wizarding community isn't getting involved.

*Make the conflict more multi-polar*

JKR built up a nice four corner opposition in Harry, Fudge/The Ministry, Voldemort and Dumbledore. But this is under-explored. Harry's various disagreements with Dumbledore are never really fleshed out (Order policy of killing vs. Harry's desire not to kill, for example). Similarly, the conflict with the Ministry was set up but goes nowhere. After OotP, the Ministry kinda just falls away - it's a trophy to be won, not an institution that does things.

*Relationships*

Have the tone of the books evolve with the characters rather than keeping it children's fiction throughout. It doesn't have to reach full tits-and-blowjobs level of YA fiction detail, but it /is/ a coming of age story. The absence of sex is glaring.

So show the teenage characters actually being a bit more like teenagers and have Harry date multiple people.
