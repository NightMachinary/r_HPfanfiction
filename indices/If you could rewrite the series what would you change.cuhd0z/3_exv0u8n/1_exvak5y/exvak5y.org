Ok so starting with relationships. I don't think sex is absolutely necessary but sexual interest coming up could be a thing. Dating multiple people I have mixed feelings on. The age I think he'd be most interested in that sort of thing is after Voldemort is back and hes depressed about people dying. Not sure if dating like a normal teen could happen. But I would say it would make sense to show that others are dating around while he isnt.

And most treat it pretty casually. Dating as a teen feels intense but people are aware thats not like they are getting married any time soon. In my experience while a intense romance may be what you wany treating it that way and being super intense about it is awkward uncomfortable and people will side eye you. Dating in general also feels way more awkward. Because you are new at it and you are young

You want to be with your partner because you are close but you arent ready for any huge commitments because you are still a kid.

I definetly agree about the ministry. Voldemort taking over the ministry made little sense his influence wasnt as strong as it had been before. And once upon a time Tom Riddle had been very suave and minipulative enough to easily weasel his way into confidence and power. But you dont see that from him.when he comes back. Ministry take over makes more sense if he came back earlier or had access to his supporters earlier. And has more impact if you know how it works so you can see what he did and that can have an impact.

But for that to happen in a way that makes sense more of the plot has to deal with undetstanding the ministry and not just the school experience. Personally i think the best way to put this in could be by having Pettigrew caught in book 3 and having Sirius go through a extended trial. Then findingna different way for Voldemort to organize the triwizard tournament.

As for things like international politics id love to see it explored but to justify going out of the way to do that I think it might make sense if Voldemort took over a larger area or ruled for a longer period of time maybe even add in one or 2 more books.

It would end up being very different but I'd be very happy to read this alternate take
