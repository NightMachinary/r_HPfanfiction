1. Flesh out the characters in the other houses.

2. Alter the first four books so as to have slightly less cartoonish characterizations of people.

(Case and point, the Dursleys. In the first few books it describes how Harry is starved by them on multiple occasions, and how Harry once had to dodge a swing to his head from a soapy frying pan. There is nothing inherently wrong with portraying them as doing these things since they are meant to be a few steps shy of evil, but there is a significant lack of reasoning and overreaction on their part in the first few books.)

1.  Expand the magical population. Add more people to each year at Hogwarts, reference a larger population out of the school, talk about the various elements of wizarding society being a fully developed culture outside of just having a school, sports, a shopping district, and a government.

2.  Have Harry learn more. When He realizes Voldemort is after him, have Harry take the threat a little more seriously and invest in his knowledge of how to defend himself and others. He shows the apptitude for this in Goblet of fire, where apparently a maze full of obstacles is apparently a better motivator than an insane dark lord after your blood.

3.  Have Hogwarts teach more subjects. Expand the range of electives, considering Dumbledore's work with Flamel maybe include Alchemy, also add electives on Enchanting, Spell theory, Law, etc.

4.  Have witches and wizards come of age later than muggles unstead of sooner, consudering how much longer they live. Have them come of age at nineteen instead of seventeen. Make Hogwarts last nine years instead of seven, giving more time for a second set of electives after the OWL's allowing for more complicated topics to be introduced, such as political studies or somthing similar.

5.  Increase the magical world's emphasis on purely academic pursuits. Make mention of historians and philosohers and other such purely scholarly fields of work to go along with potioneers and experimental spell crafters.

6.  Make mention of a larger economy, having larger businesses and companies to go along with all the small family/single owned shops and pubs.

7.  Make Ginny more present in the story, aside from her involvement in book two, she isn't really present until book five, and then she doesn't actually do anything till book six. Make her presence begin to come into play during book four, be expanded on and fully realized during book five and then have a much more firm foundation for their relationship in book six.

8.  Make the war last longer, to go along with having people come of age at nineteen instead of seventeen, have the war last longer. Have Harry Ron and Hermione be more involved during the hunt, dodging snatchers and the like, and then have the seventh book end with them retaking Hogwarts and securing it against Voldemort's forces as the end of book seven, leading into guerrilla warfare launching from Hogwarts in book eight, with Harry and Co. becoming fully fledged warriors fighting for what they belive in.

9.  Increase the guilt of the previous generation. Voldemort is a problem of the Maruader generation at the latest, the fact that the society allowed themselves to be so beaten down as to be almost destroyed, and then passed that chaos onto their children, that would realistically be major source of guilt.

10. On the matter of deaths.

Percy makes his first joke and dies right after, Fred and George go on to build a solemn legacy in his name, including a line of high quality (standardised thickness) cauldrons.

Remus, redeeming himself fully from having abandoned Tonks during the war, sacrifices himself to save Tonks life. Tonks lives and becomes a part of Harry's life as the two support each other in raising Teddy and remembering the last Marauder.

1. The epilouge. Increase the amount of stuff written after the war but before the time jump, maybe setting up the events to come. And then increase the length of the epilouge to be the entire morning September 1st starting with Harry waking up and ending with the train leaving, allowing more time for introspection and reflection.
