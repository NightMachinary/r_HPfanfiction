Well, I can think of a few changes off of the bat...

- Change pretty much everything about how Dumbledore is handled in the last three books. The dude kept far too many secrets for anyone's good, and his insane gambit that played out throughout DH was ridiculous and it's honestly a miracle that the war was won at all

- Less homogeneous Slytherin house. Seriously, /every single Slytherin/ is a blood purist? Honestly, it's no wonder that fanon likes to cling to Daphne, Tracey, Blaise, and Theo, since they're so undeveloped in canon that it's easy to use them as good or neutral Slytherins.

- Not every antagonist is a blood purist. Seriously, was there any reason to make Umbridge a blood purist beyond the fact that she's evil? She could have been an antagonist in her own right even if her ideals didn't happen to coincide with Voldemort's

- Flesh out the idea of Harry and Hermione having a sibling-like dynamic. Seriously, if they think of each other like brother and sister, then I'd like to see some of the gentle teasing that tends to come with those sorts of relationships.

- Just scrap all of the endgame pairings. So no Ron/Hermione, No Remus/Tonks, and no Bill/Fleur. Harry/Ginny is the only somewhat reasonable endgame pairing, and even it's not great and it would probably be better if they were paired with other people.

- Flesh out the antagonists and give them better motivations. For that matter, get rid of all of the implications that Tom Riddle was "born evil", which is kind of disturbing concept to have in a book that so heavily emphasizes forgiveness. Give him better reasons for supporting blood purity that him having daddy issues.
