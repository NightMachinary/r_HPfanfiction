Personally my headcanon for Voldemort is horcruxes scrambled his brain. Sure he didnt know he wasn't pureblood for sure thought he was half blood at best. But that meant that he had to suffer for the blood purity stuff too. So he'd dislike the purebloods for being hostile just like he disliked the muggles. His obsession with immortality makes a bit more sense considering he made his first horcrux during ww2 when London was being firebombed and he knew that he would have to go back in the summer to London and risk dying in the orphanage he hated since his request to stay im hogwarts was denied. Not that bigotry is the most rational thing but in this case id say it wasnt exactly advantageous for him to pride blood purity before knowing his ancestor was Salazar especially since he'd already come to the conclusion at least one parent wasn't magical. And i do expect Voldemort to believe in a worldview thats convenient to him. Anti muggle is but blood purity is not.

I dont mind Dumbledore keeping secrets but there were way too many ways for his plan to fail and it didnt have to be like thay.

And ya in the movies they get along better but in the books? They are so awkward when they are alone together. They act like friends who only hang out because they are part of the same group when they spend extended periods of time together without Ron or others there. But they are suposed to be best friends its really weird.

And im of the mind set if you aren't going to put effort into doing a romance dont do a romance. And most of these werent fleshed out enough to justify their existence beyond like most stories like this have romance. So ya id be happier if it had no confirmed ships
