I agree with you about Voldemort and immortality. I'm writing a fem!Riddle fic, and I made the blitz a major factor in her choice to pursue immortality (with a healthy dose of PTSD on the side)

I'm also giving trying to give her better reasons for making her support blood purity while still avoiding the "Voldemort is trying to save the world" trope that I've seen a few fics use.
