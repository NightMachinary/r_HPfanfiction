There is a theory i know of that suggests that understanding of magic is increased by being able to play with it and being able to do accidental magic and being uncouraged to have" accidents" which muggleborns and those who live around muggles dont have the luxury of doing. Because of this magic is taught in a limited way that stifles innovation which is halting the progess of the wizarding world. Rather than find a way to reach out to muggleborns at a earlier age blood purists instead want to kick them out of the magical world all together blaming the muggleborns rather than trying to reform a inadequate system because of pre existing biases they have of outsiders.
