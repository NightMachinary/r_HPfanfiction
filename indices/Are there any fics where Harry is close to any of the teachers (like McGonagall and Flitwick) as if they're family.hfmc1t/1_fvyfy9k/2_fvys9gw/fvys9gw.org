There's a really short one I cannot remember the name of rn where Dumbles and co find out about the Dursley's being shitheads and raise Harry at Hogwarts. He befriends a few slytherins and is generally the 'Son of Hogwarts' and it's told in a really 'simplistic bedtime story/story finale third person monologue' sort of style.
