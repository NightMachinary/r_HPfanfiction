Honestly I think this one was blown way over the top. The “kids” we saw were all around fifteen or older, I certainly don't remember any first or second year at the party, in an age where they were more likely to actually /want/ his council in how to get there dream position in life and to start networking. I think he have less chance of being a pedophile than Snape (not saying he was, just that it is more probable considering that he went and joined Voldemort's merry band of bigoted psychos).
