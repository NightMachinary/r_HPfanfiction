He didn't teach Riddle anything actually. Riddle knew how to make Horcruxes and only needed a second opinion. And while suspicious, Slughorn never could confirm that Riddle was making Horcruxes. As far as the information from the story goes, Dumbledore was more interested in hearing Riddle say the number than whatever Slughorn said.

Also I didn't realize that Slughorn gets so much hate but my best guess is that it's related to the fact that we see him through Harry's perspective (which is somewhat influenced by Dumbledore's warning at the end of chapter 4). Harry is neutral at best towards him, and annoyed by his vanity at the worst.

But overall he doesn't seem like a bad human.
