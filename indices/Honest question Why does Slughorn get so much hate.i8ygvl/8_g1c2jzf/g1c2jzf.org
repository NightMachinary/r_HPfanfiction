I don't really get it, except that the books had this undertone of slytherin, its values and anything related to it is evil (politics, managing people, ambition, success, non conformity)

I think his way of doing things could improve social mobility for the entire society, which is otherwise very limited, and the image of slytherin, by reducing isolation and promoting meritocracy.

And if we talk about morals: Slughorn collects students to enable them to fulfil their potential so he can brag about it and build his network, Dumbledore collects students for his private anti terrorist army with over 50%chance of death.
