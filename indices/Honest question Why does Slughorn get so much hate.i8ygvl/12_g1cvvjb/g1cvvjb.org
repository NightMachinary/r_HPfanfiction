The main reason I don't like Slughorn is because he tried to cover up the fact that Tom Riddle asked about Horcruxes because he didn't want to hurt his reputation. Remember Fudge for the last two books? Just making the situation worse.

Honestly, the whole "Questioning Slughorn" arc barely had any use besides making Slughorn look bad. Them knowing or not knowing how many horcruxes there were was a moot point anyway, as Harry had that VoldeVision(patent pending) near the end that literally reviewed each Horcrux.
