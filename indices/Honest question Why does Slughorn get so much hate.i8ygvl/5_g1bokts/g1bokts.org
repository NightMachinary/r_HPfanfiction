Seems like plain bashing in these cases. He is perceived as a egoistical coward since he refuses to help Harry and Dumbledore with knowledge only he has and just basks in the recognition of his former students.

To be fair, in the books it is not explained how useful his networking skills can be for a wizard fresh out of Hogwart, but since it's mostly from Harry's point of view, it can be excused I think.
