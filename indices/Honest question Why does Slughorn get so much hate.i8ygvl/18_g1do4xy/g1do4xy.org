He is a coward. That and we see him from Harry's perspective of a relatively sheltered child. Yes he had rough childhood but he wasn't taught how society works all he knows is what he learned from the Dursley's interactions and what he sees of the children at hogwarts. So what he knows is that wielding connections or wealth to get what you want is wrong. Prime examples being the Malfoys. His world view is influenced by this so when he sees slughorn and learns how he deals with people he immediately paints him in a bad light. That and the part where he makes comments that sound prejudiced without realizing it probably didn't help.
