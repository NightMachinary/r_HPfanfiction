He always seemed slimy to me. He was what I consider the perfect Slytherin who isn't actually evil, or a dick. It's just I never really liked him. I mean sure, networking isn't bad. It just feels, well, slimy when your doing it with teens, and kids. I don't really care too much about the Horcrux thing. Sure he messed up, but accidents happen, and flaws exist. I think it was a dick move, but shit happens.
