I haven't seen much Slughorn hate. I mostly see him held up as an example of a good Slytherin, when people are looking for examples besides Andromeda and Regulus.

I did see a discussion, where one writer asked, “Who should I ship him with in my story?” and the response was generally “Ew!” That's probably plain old fat-shaming. If he were thin and handsome, people would be shipping him with everyone.
