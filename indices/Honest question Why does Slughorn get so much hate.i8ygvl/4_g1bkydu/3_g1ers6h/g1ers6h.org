I don't doubt the principle of your point regarding pairings, but I wouldn't call it fat shaming. I don't think I've ever heard anyone make fun of or "shame" Slughorn for being fat.

On a micro-scale, if an author doesn't write slash, we won't bash them for being homophobic. It's not their taste and there are plenty of slash fics in the wild, besides. On a macro-scale, if no fanfic authors were into writing slash, we wouldn't say that community was homophobic. Just none of the people writing the material are gay or, at the very least, don't like writing about gay pairings.

It just turns out that the (apparent) majority of fanfic writers don't want to write smut/romance fics with fat characters. That doesn't mean Slughorn is being fat shamed, just that no one who's into that kind of thing has written about it, yet.
