I totally agree! My school still organises a school alumni meet-up every four years (about 1k-2k people show up) for a weekend festival. We all go to concerts, theatre productions of the current pupils and such. Basically it's an event for networking and meeting people you used to go to school with. I mean, yeah, it was a boarding school, so the vibe is different to normal day schools but I really enjoy going to events like that. Even if I have to travel 300km to get there.

What Slughorn was doing was creating contacts for already skilled kids. And maybe he was selecting legacies too, and that is maybe a little wrong but still, his intentions were good.
