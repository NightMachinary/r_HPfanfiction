My Ancient Greek course was regularly invited to my teachers' homes for a lunch or dinner with the entire group. We'd cook Greek food and speak about politics, philosophy, we'd joke around. Eventually, our two teachers became our friends and we travelled with them to Greece for a ten day trip to see ruins and such. My best friends today, at uni, are still those kids I had Greek with. And I still email with my teachers. Sure it was favouritism to a degree, but I totally get Slughorn for doing what he did.
