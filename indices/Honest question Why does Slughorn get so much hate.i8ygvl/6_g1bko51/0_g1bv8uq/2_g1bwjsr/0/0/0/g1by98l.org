Mcgonagall gave harry a fucking expensive broom and let him on the quidditch team

though honestly Maybe mcgonagall did it as a gift to her former student James letting his son soar in the sky

mcgonagall did seem super broken up about lilly and James's death considering James was gifted at transfiguration and quiditch I imagine he must have been someone macgonagal might have spent alot of time with even more so when he became headboy
