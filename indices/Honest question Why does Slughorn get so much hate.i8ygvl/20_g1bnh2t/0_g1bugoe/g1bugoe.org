He was pretty beaten up about Lily, so he has morals. And the way Harry got him to eventually give him the memories was by outright telling him that they'd help him kill Voldemort, so he's not exactly a coward. I think it's a result of those morals that he seems so cowardly - he knows he fucked up by telling Tom about Horcruxes, so he hates looking at himself in the mirror.
