To be fair with the guy he would only actually know Voldemort wasn't dead around 95/96, before it there would only be at most some rumors. My guess is that he was in denial that Voldemort had actually made Horcruxies, and if he had used another method of obtaining immortality telling about Horcruxies would be potentially counterproductive as it would make Dumbledore certain he knew the method and stop researching other possibilities.
