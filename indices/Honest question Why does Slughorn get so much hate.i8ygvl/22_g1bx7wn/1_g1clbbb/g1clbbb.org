I get this, but at the same time it bothers me because Lupin does something similar and it's totally glossed over. Beyond the information of V trying to make 7, Dumbledore has already figured everything out by the time V comes back. Prior to that, Slughorn had no way of knowing V actually made Horcruxes. Especially when we consider that V took years to really become a problem. He was asked the question in like '45 and most of what we know about the war happened in the 70's so over 20 years later. I suspect Slughorn had put the conversation out of his mind until Dumbledore brought it up pre HBP. At that point yes he should have told the truth, but again Lupin does something similar and gets no hate for it.

When I refer to Lupin I'm talking about how he refused to tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an animagus even after Sirius had snuck into the castle twice. Everyone is concerned about how he's managing it and he doesn't tell Dumbledore because he's ashamed of breaking Dumbledore's trust when he was a kid. It worked out fine because Sirius was innocent, but Lupin had no way of knowing. Sirius could have killed a bunch of students if he was so inclined. Slughorn on the other hand gets roasted for not repeating a hypothetical conversation he had over 20 years previously.
