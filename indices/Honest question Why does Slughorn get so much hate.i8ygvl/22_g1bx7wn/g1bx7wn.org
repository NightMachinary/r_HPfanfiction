He knew Wizard Hitler was immortal, and broadly how. If he'd told Dumbledore back in the 70s, then Dumbledore could have had /decades/ to hunt down Horcruxes rather than a desperate scramble in the 90s. Telling Tom Riddle a bit about Horcruxes (though he seems to have actually learned how to make them from a library book) when he thought it was just academic curiosity is forgiveable, but how many innocent people died due to the war dragging on (and resuming in '95) because nobody on Team Good knew how to make Voldemort properly mortal?
