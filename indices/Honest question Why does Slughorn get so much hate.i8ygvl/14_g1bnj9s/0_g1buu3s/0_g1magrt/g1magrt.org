The thing is, Slughorn horn knew. Up until Tom asked about Horcruxes Slughorn could be forgiven for being caught up in the charming persona Tom had crafted, as everyone else was caught up in it too. When Tom asked about the Horcrux that narrative was gone. No one just has a casual passing interest in a Horcrux. When Tom asked about 7 in particular, Slughorns reaction is very telling. Saying its bad enough to plan on murdering even one person.

Slughorn, for all his faults, is very intelligent. At that moment he knew that Tom was going to make murder people. Whether he stuck with 7 or not, Tom was open to murder.

Tom of course played him, offered him the out. "This is all hypothetical of course." Bullshit, and Slughorn knew it. But he had a choice, tell someone, take action, watch Tom like Dumbledore did, /or/ accept the lie and go back to influence peddling, enjoy his crystallized pineapple and favors.

With generosity towards Slughorn you could say that the had nothing to gain and everything to lose by bringing this knowledge forward. What would the Aurors do on the gut feeling of a professor that a popular student was going to kill people? Likely nothing. What would they do to the adult professor that a student felt comfortable enough discussing the Dark Arts with to ask about Horcruxes? Slughorn could have potentially been tossed into Azkaban with nothing to show for it. Then when Tom dropped off the face of the earth he probably felt relief. When Voldemort showed up their was no proof that it was Tom. Once again Slughorn is intelligent, so I'm sure he had serious suspicions. But it was easier and less risky to not say anything. Tom may have changed his mind about Horcruxes, and the authorities obviously knew he was willing to kill. What could Slughorn offer? Then Voldemort vanished and didn't return. Proof that Slughorn was innocent. Until he came back.

This is where being generous towards Slughorn ends. Give him 5th year to be in denial about it, but by the time of the Ministry Battle he knew for sure. He should have given the memory to Dumbledore as soon as Dumbledore asked. It wasn't like Albus was going to advertise Slughorns culpability or throw him in Azkaban. He wasn't even going to stop him from teaching or collecting students. He was safe at Hogwarts and he had knowledge that was vitally important to ending Voldemort. He just didn't want people to /think badly of him/.
