This still takes the blame from him. Slughorn cares more for his special picks than he does for morality. His relationship with Tom Riddle proved as long as it's quid pro quo there is no line he wouldn't cross. How many innocents died while Slughorn remained living his good life stealing from muggles? This also is like the many who play "devil's advocate." The devil doesn't need help, he's got this. Being a bystander to crime and remaining silent is condoning that crime. I have zero empathy for Slughorn.
