Considering his horror over Voldemort actually doing it my guess is that he genuinely thought it was an academic question -this and dementors are the only two magic we know that confirmedly deal with souls, If I knew for sure that there is such a thing I would also be very curious about what exactly it is, what affects it in any way and what it really /does/, kind of like learning about the atomic bomb while learning nuclear chemistry, we know the basic principles (though no one is crazy enough to make a practical guide -same way Slughorn didn't say the specifics of how to create one) it helps us better understand how atomic fission and fusion works and we can even make a guess of how we could potentially make one in our basements, don't mean anyone would be crazy enough to actually try.
