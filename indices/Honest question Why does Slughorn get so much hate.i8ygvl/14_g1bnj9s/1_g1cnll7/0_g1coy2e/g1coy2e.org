If that were true he wouldn't have held the secret and feared Riddle would kill him over it. Riddle had a theory, Slughorn confirmed it. Riddle graduated and pursued that theory. Before Riddle could complete more than one or two horcruxes this could have been over. Slughorn could have told the headmaster, I think it was Dippet? Could have turned to Dumbledore as the only one that wasn't friendly with Riddle. No, instead he chose to stand by in comfort while thousands were murdered. Great he didn't tell Riddle to do it, but he certainly didn't do anything to stop it.
