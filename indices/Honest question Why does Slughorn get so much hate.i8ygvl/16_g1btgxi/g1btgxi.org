Slughorn is a perfect example for "If rich old white man likes you for his arbitrary reasons, and you are nice to him, then you will have it much easier in life."

And the problem with that is generally, that it concentrates power (rather than distributing it). Just to give one in-canon example: to the first meeting in the train compartment, he invites those, whose relatives are already successful.

In short: he gives opportunities to his favorites, opportunities that are arbitrarily unavailable to most.

And then there is the fact that he's a low-key racist, too:

  “Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good.”

I think not liking someone that actively leads to people dying because doesn't want to look bad, someone low-key bigoted, someone who makes his own arbitrary decisions about who should succeed and who shouldn't -- that is kind of natural.
