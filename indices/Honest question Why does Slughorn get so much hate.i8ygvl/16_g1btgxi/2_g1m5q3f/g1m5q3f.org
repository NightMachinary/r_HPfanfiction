I think this is important. Its tied to the reason that people hate Umbridge so much too. We don't generally interact with serial killing terrorists in our lives, but we do interact with bureaucrats that exert power over others just because they can, and we do interact with bosses, hiring managers, college board members, and yes professors, that can hold an undue amount of control over our futures and exert that control based on their own arbitrary preferences. Slughorn is nepotism personified.
