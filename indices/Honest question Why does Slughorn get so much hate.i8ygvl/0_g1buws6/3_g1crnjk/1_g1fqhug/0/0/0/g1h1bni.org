I'm not saying that Slughorn should be hung as a traitor, but what he did came very close to the definition of treason (at least the British one). Because you have to admit, Slughorn had to know who Voldemort was (the reason for the faked memory), and that, by 1995/6, he must have concluded that Voldemort had made some. Which made his knowledge crucial intelligence. And withholding that certainly fits the following bit of English law (from the 16th century, still in effect today and certainly within the SoS time frame)

  adhering to the sovereign's enemies, giving them aid and comfort

Giving the Sovereign's enemies (the Ministry/Minister in the case of the magical world) aid by withholding war winning information certainly fits what Slughorn did. And that's legally treason (although there's a long list of people more in need of sentencing than Slughorn).
