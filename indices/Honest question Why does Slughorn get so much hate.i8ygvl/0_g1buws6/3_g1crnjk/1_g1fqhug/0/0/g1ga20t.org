2 days ago, you tried to tell me that Sirius should have been hailed a hero if he had murdered a man in broad daylight in front of muggles even though he is the prime suspect in the Death of the Potters (as Voldemort lieutenant and spy), even though with Peter dead, there would be no one else alive to corrobore his story. And now you want to put Slughorn in front of a jury for treason because he never told anyone about an information he suspected (not knew, suspected). We clearly do not have the same vision of canon.

First, Riddle being Voldemort may be an open secret, but it's a secret nonetheless. There are no official, legal link between the 2 of them, so you can't accuse someone of treason because he didn't mention a conversation he had with Tom Riddle when asked about Voldemort, not to mention nobody probably never asked him any question about Voldemort.

Second, Slughorn didn't "know" that Voldemort made Horcruxes. He may have suspected it (especially after his conversation with him), but Voldemort may have chosen another way toward immortality, or even not be immortal at all (most of the population thought he was really dead until his return in GoF). Even Dumbledore didn't confirm that Voldemort made Horcruxes until Harry showed him the destroyed diary in CoS. Magical world or not, you don't have to go to the authorities for any assumptions you made, and authorities can't accuse you of anything because you didn't go to them with these assumptions.

Third, Tom Riddle asking Slughorn about the possibility of 7 Horcruxes does not mean he made 7. Voldemort "pushed the boundaries of magic" with his multiples Horcruxes, before him, Slughorn opinion (which concorde with the one of the scholars) was "Doing one Horcruxe is already bad, but doing several is crazy, the wizard would die".

Slughorn was a coward, but none of the things he did was technically illegal. If you start accusing him of treason just because of this one action, you would probably end up with more wizards inside Azkaban than outside.
