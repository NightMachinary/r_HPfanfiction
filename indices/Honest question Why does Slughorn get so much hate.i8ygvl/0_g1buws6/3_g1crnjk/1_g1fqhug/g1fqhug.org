I don't think I would go as far as calling what Slughorn did "treason". Technically, the only thing he did was answer the hypothetical questions asked by a brillant student (questions of doubtful nature but Riddle had a believable story). Riddle already knew about Horcruxes and how to do them when he first approached him (pretty sure he had already done at least the diary, potentially the ring too), and the whole conversation can be summed up by "Doing one Horcruxe is bad, it hurt the soul, doing several would be so terrible I refuse to even think about it".

Slughorn is a coward because he left his guilt stop him from giving Dumbledore very important information, but I still wouldn't call it treason, far from it.
