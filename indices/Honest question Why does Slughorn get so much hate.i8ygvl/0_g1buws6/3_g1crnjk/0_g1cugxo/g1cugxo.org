He didn't know who Riddle truly was, he didn't know he was evil and would really use that Knowledge. He only saw a brillant student, eager to learn. It is not bad to teach and learn about evil things. It's how you protect yourself from that in the first place, and from who would use it.

Slughorn unforgivable flaw, IMO is that he put his reputation above everything else and didn't share what he knew. I get he was ashamed and felt guilty, but he was a coward here. When the most he risked was his standing. Not even his life.
