  slughirn is hated because Rowling wrote him to be our token 'good' Slytherin. To prove the point taht not all Slytherins are evil. However, rather than making him more good, she just made him less evil.

I think that interpretation is plausible, but I don't think that's really what Rowling is going for, tbh. Slughorn is very much shown as a "not good" person from the start. The guy is found hiding in the home of Muggles and refuses to help out at Hogwarts' until Dumbledore "bribes" him with Harry.

He's a coward, he's ambitious, obsequious, material, etc. He's not "evil," but he's never really portrayed as a good person.
