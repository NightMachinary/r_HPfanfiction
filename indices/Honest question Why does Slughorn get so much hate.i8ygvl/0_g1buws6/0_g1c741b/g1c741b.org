Slughorn would have become a successful venture capitalist in real world. What he had been doing is basically what those professors at Ivy League universities are doing. Of course, there is a key difference here, in that Slughorn was applying this method to secondary school children/teenagers, while our professors are promoting promising graduate level students well into their 20s.

Unfortunately, there were no universities or post secondary educational institutions in Wizarding Britain.
