He's just like many other characters in the books - deeply flawed in realistic ways. Unfortunately for him, the flaws he has are ones that the sort of people who inhabit places like reddit see as far less forgivable than the flaws of characters like Ron and Hermione.

He's avaricious, he collects influence like its money, and he enjoys using that influence to benefit people he has chosen. One of his greatest pleasures in life is seeing someone succeed and being able to say "I made that happen". He's the very definition of "its who you know that matters".

He didn't report Tom Riddle's interest in horcruxes because he was blinded by what he saw - a potentially crowning glory in his career. A muggle born (or so it seemed) who was hugely magically talented, fantastically intelligent, charismatic, good looking, truly cunning, deeply ambitious. Slughorn will have seen that and decided that Tom was destined for great things, high position in the Ministry, and that Slughorn would be the one to get him there. Slughorn was looking 30 or 40 years into the future and seeing Minister Riddle being sworn into office with Horace Slughorn in the front row of the audience.
