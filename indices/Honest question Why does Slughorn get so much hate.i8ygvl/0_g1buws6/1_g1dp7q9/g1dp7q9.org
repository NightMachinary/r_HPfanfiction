I don't care about his networking or even that he told Riddle about the Horcruxes (even if it was not the really smart). Networking is often important so with him it's better to get into his good grace if it can help later. It's not a big sacrifice. Telling Tom with how Tom was isn't a big mistake either. It lacks foresight but their relation seemed to have been cultivated by Tom for quite some time.

No the big problem is that he's a coward and to afraid to own his mistakes. If he had told earlier about the Horcruxes maybe someone could have done something. And if not well too bad but I understand the mistrust in the Ministry (because of infiltrated Death Eaters or their overall incompetence) but lying to Dumbledore? Just because of the shame? Is it so much more important that all the bodies piling? I wouldn't judge him by what he did before but what he didn't later.

But despite this I like the character. He's not the worse. Stupid and self-centered on this point but not too horrible. Dumbledore may be too much about the bigger picture but Slughorn clearly isn't enough. He's the embodiment of the sentence that more or less says that "evil flourishes when good men to nothing". In the end he's more of an ostrich than a walrus.
