Yeah, as I said he's a deeply, realistically flawed character. If you went to many university professors and told them that their favourite student had become a mass murdering terrorist who had deeply infiltrated the government with his followers, and they realised that the student had once upon a time revealed to them some secret plan about their rise to power that they hadn't understood until now...I imagine many of them might do the cowardly thing as well.
