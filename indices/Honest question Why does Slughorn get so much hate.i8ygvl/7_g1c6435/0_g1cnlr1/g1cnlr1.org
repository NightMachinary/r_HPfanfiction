The only other thing I can think of was Slughorn's comment about Harry's mom. He said something about how he was quite surprised that a Muggleborn like her could be so talented, and that he though she was a pure blood at first.

But yeah, I agree that Slughorn gets way more hate than he deserves. Yes, he was an asshole for not reporting to Dumbledore years later when it seems obvious that Voldemort probably made 7 Horcruxes. Especially during the time period where Voldemort was vanquished.

But he's not that bad of a character, and bashing him is a bit much
