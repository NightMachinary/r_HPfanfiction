What exactly /did/ he teach Tom, though? He just confirmed to him some vague, very basic notions about Horcruxes that Tom already would have read in any place that mentioned the term. Maybe the book scene is more large and I just forget (in which case please correct me), but from what I recall, he never gives Tom any detailed account about Horcruxes or how to make them.

From his perspective, it was only a student that looks like Merlin 2.0 and which comes from an outcast and alien background compared to other wizards ask questions about an obscure and banned branch of magic. As a teacher, he was probably thrilled to see such a deep level of knowledge in someone so young.

Maybe I forgot a major, major scene, but if not, imo people make a way bigger deal about Slughorn's involvement in this. Sure, the major dick move was keeping silent once it became clear to him that Tom had pretty practical interests in the subject.

i don't really get the hate for the networking thing either. He may have been more prone to pick Purebloods, but the guy shows through the series that he values talent more than social standing in his Slug Club members.
