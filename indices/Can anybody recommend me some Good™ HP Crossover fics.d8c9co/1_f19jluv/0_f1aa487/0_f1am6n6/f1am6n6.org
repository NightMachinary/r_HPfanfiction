Oh man, you should definitely check out Firefly / Serenity. There's a reason the internet often touts it as one of the most despicable cancellations in TV history. It was way ahead of its time in terms of a slow-build, character driven sci-fi drama with excellent world-building, but Fox decided to air the episodes out of order, change the air time, then cancelled the show due to low viewership. It has a huge nerd following despite being almost 20 years old and with only a single season + movie.

Also check out Cowboy Bebop if Firefly tickles your fancy.
