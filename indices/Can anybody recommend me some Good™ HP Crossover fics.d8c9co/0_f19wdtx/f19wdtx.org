Still in progress, and none of that lame "in progress" but really abandoned, just slow updates.

Linkffn(shadow of angmar) Steelbadger really knows what they're talking about in regards to LotR lore. Another bonus, in my opinion, is that Harry isn't shoehorned into the fellowship, but is instead placed in the middle third age, almost 1000 years before The Hobbit, so it's not a rehash of LotR with Harry Potter
