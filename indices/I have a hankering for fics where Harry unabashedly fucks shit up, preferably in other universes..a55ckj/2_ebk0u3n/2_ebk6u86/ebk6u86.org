It's an okay story. Author really tries to toe the line without going too overboard like what happened in Harry Potter: Geth, but ultimately failed and comes off a bit too crack-y. I would say some ME knowledge is required because it does pretty much just follow the plot of the first game without having a lot of the background info.
