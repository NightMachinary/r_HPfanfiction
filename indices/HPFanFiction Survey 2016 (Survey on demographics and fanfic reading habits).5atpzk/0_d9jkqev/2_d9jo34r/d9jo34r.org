I use a sliding scale of canonicity which has upto book 4 as canon, and then onwards it becomes less and less canon. I was frustrated by the deaths of so many beloved characters followed by the incongruous epilogue. I'd rather have had an ending like Animorphs if all those deaths were meant to be significant. Same goes for the other forms like interviews. Dumbledore is gay? Sure, it seems plausible. Hermione is black? nope, too late. Cursed Child? as canon as HPMOR
