I'm quite surprised by the 2/3 majority for wizards vs muggles. I mean yes, technically with the abilities at their disposal wizards would win hands down, but *we* think like muggles, we have common sense. Wizards barely understand electricity... they will all be dead before they realize that they are being wiped out.
