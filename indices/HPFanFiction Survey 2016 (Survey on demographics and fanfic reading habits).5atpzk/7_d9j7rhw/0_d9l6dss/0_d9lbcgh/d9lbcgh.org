These are some great charts. It's a real pity that they're going to get buried in here; I would encourage you to make a new thread for them to increase their visibility. I certainly think people will be interested enough to make them worthy of their own thread.

Edit, some of the non-obvious trends are interesting. Women much more likely to accept things as canon than men, men much more likely to have GoF as their favourite book.
