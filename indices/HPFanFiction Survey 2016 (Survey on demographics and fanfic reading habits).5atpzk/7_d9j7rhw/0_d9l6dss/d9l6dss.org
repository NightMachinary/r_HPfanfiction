Thanks [[/u/Taure]] for sending me a link to the dataset! Since the response rate has slowed down and the percentages for the responses have been fairly stable, I have put together some charts by gender for some of the questions, the results are super interesting, there are some big differences between genders on some of the responses! LINK TO RESULTS BY GENDER: [[http://imgur.com/a/FYdRE]]

The [[http://imgur.com/yuqeZXx][favorite character]] table in particular has a lot of differences! It seems like guys are more likely to have Harry, Dumbledore and Luna as their favorite character (26% vs 9% , 11% vs 2% , 15% vs. 8%), and girls are more likely to like Hermione, Snape and Draco (22% vs 11%, 15% vs 3%, 7% vs 0%).

For [[http://imgur.com/jIV2YKt][least favorite character]], Snape and Draco are the least popular among males (11% vs 3%, 7% vs 2%) while Umbridge and Ginny are slightly less popular among females (58% vs 46%, 5% vs 2%).

Slash fics are not surprisingly way more popular among females (71% vs 18%) but femslash is equally popular among both genders (53% vs. 52%)! Some other big differences are in [[http://imgur.com/ZsXFC87][the pairing preferences:]] Harry-Ginny pairing is more popular among females (33% vs 19%), while guys seem to like Harry-Daphne or Harry Fleur (17% vs 3%, 13% vs 3%).
