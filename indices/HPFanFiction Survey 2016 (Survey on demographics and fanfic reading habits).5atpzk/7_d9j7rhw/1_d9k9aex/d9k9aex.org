Really interesting results! Is there any way you could break down the results (or at least the results of the fanfiction question section) by gender? I would love to see the breakdown of favorite character/whether someone reads slash or not by gender and whether there is a difference. Or even if you just link to the actual dataset if possible, I can do it myself.
