Hey :) I think it's pretty awesome that you have a link to the results, is it possible to place it higher up the page/ as an edit under your post, so others can see it too? It's kinda far down right now. Also, will you be doing results that show... for example, people's political alignment matched with their favourite character~ ? I think it would be pretty interesting to see that. [[/u/dehue]] has already done a fantastic job but I think it would be interesting to compare other factor combinations they seem to have not done.
