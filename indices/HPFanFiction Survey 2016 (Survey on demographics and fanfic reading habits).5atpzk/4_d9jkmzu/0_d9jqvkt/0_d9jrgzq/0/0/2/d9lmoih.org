I think that climate change is absolutely real, but again, as was said earlier in this thread, climate and weather are not the same thing. You cannot assess whether climate change is real by walking outside, only by carefully measuring global temperatures over long periods of time. When one gives in to myths like "the current warm weather pattern shows climate change is real", you also provide fodder during a cold snap to those who believe it is false.
