When it comes to Slytherin females that could potentially be paired with Harry though, the only ones we receive any sort of characterization for are Pansy and Millicent to a much lesser degree. Pansy isn't exactly a pleasant individual and that great of a person all things considered and Millicent has largely served as the female version of Crabbe and Goyle in the series, so if you're intending to pair Harry with a Slytherin of some sort, you've got slim pickings.

Hence, Daphne Greengrass is used as the stand-in for the Slytherin OC. It's not that you might as well pick any Slytherin OC, but Daphne Greengrass herself might as well /be/ an OC. The only things we directly know about her are:

- She's a Slytherin in Harry's year and took her OWLs in 5th year. (Per /Order of the Phoenix)/
- She's a pureblood, with her family a member of the Sacred 28. (Per Pottermore)
- Her sister, Astoria, later marries Draco Malfoy. Astoria herself suffers from a bloodline curse circa Cursed Child and later moved from a belief in pureblood supremacy to a more egalitarian one concerning Muggles and Muggleborns. (According to Pottermore)
- In [[http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1695388_1695569,00.html][an interview with /Time/]], Rowling says that Daphne was part of Parkinson's "Slytherin Posse."

My own personal interpretation of Daphne is not as an Ice Queen or anything of the like. My headcanon instead is that *Daphne is a thoroughly plain individual, perhaps a wallflower even*.

She's not significant enough to do anything like joining the Inquistorial Squad---Millicent, the half-blood, plays a more significant role there. She's not invited to the Slug Club meetings either on the train or at Hogwarts: recall that Ginny was able to get in merely with a very well-done Bat Bogey Hex. As such, I don't see Daphne courting much influence among Slytherin, let alone the school in general. As far as school politics is a concern, maybe some people were initially interested in her due to being a member of the Sacred 28, but by and large, she's a nobody.

Zabini pines more after Ginny and Greengrass isn't even mentioned, and Draco passed over her, a girl in his year, for Astoria, two years his junior. So, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that she's not a knockout in the looks department and not the epitome of the female form as she is in various stories.

She may or may not have been the fourth unnamed Slytherin in NEWT Potions class (the other three were Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, and Theodore Nott), but even if she was, she wasn't significant enough for Slughorn or Harry or the others to notice or care about. As such, I do not expect her to be Hermione's peer academically, as she's again portrayed in various stories.

Maybe you can do some interesting things with Daphne possibly also inheriting the bloodline curse. Possibly you could have her as an unwilling, on-and-off member of Parkinson's group: seeing as her sister seems to disavow anti-Muggle and anti-Muggleborn sentiment later on in a way neither Lucius nor Narcissa did,

Daphne might only have a nominal belief in pureblood supremacy, but isn't willing to bully others with respect to it. Either of those angles could perhaps make for a more complex Daphne that isn't invented out of whole cloth, but all in all, I feel that Daphne is likely an average nobody---politically, socially, in terms of physical attractiveness, academically---and is just another face in the crowd.

As such, ironically as it is played for laughs, the Daphne that I've seen that matches my headcanon the closest is Luan Mao's amusing /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]]/, minus the child abuse.
