I'll admit- as a young adult not living in my country of birth, and living here as a legal resident, I have no knowledge of voting or politics, and I hold no interest as since I'm not able to vote, I don't follow it. And since I no longer reside in my native country, I can't vote there either.

I feel as if this makes me immature or unknowledgeable when it came to a few questions, so they may have been skewed slightly to what I assumed, not based on what they actually meant, so I'm sorry. ðŸ™ˆ
