Next time could you instead of making the: "How do you identify your political position?" not left vs right because for about 40% countries they are the reverse of the US. It literally referees to the seating position of the early parliaments of the respected countries. Also no defining it red blue won't make it any better because in Europe the red stands for socialism and sociolibratism, while in the US it stands for the conservative party. Which is often, but not always, on different sides politically.
