  I'm a bit surprised that 90% of the respondents think Muggles would lose to wizards. I thought it would be more contentious.

Without traitors, the muggles would be squashed if we're talking an all out war rather than some kind of kid's book war. Wizards are simply too OP in comparison. The ability to apparate, look into people's minds, force people to tell the truth, completely go around any kind of muggle barrier, and create magical barriers would make them completely dominate. The only thing I can possibly see going wrong is if muggle relatives of magicals ratted out the location of some places they were aware of, like Diagon Alley. But even then, there's not much the muggles could do that the magicals couldn't stop. The only way I see the muggles causing any significant damage would be if they started it by bombing magical areas, but after that they'd be overwhelmed quickly.
