I'm not so sure. I think Hermione's approach towards her parents in DH is indicative of the extent to which her identity has become a wizarding, not a Muggle identity. She has largely absorbed the wizarding mindset including their paternalistic approach to Muggles and casual approach to mental manipulation. I have no doubt that Hermione would side with the wizarding world against the Muggle world if it came to a conflict. It's the place she considers home, it's where all her most important personal relationships exist, it's where she later makes her career, it's a part of her identity. Hell, given that she later becomes the Minister for Magic, it would be her /leading/ the war against the Muggles, never mind participation.

If it holds for Hermione, then I don't see why it wouldn't hold for other Muggleborns.
