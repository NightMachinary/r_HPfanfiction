You don't need that many traitors to affect the outcome of the war, given the capabilities of magic. And I honestly doubt that the same law enforcement that couldn't deal with Death Eaters will be more effective against such traitors.

Further, Voldemort was defeated, yet returned. I think assuming that Grindelwald's ideas will never see a ressurgence is quite naive - or white-washing wizards. Further, if Voldemort really cared about the SoS, he'd not have attacked muggles, since each attack endangers the SoS.
