So? Neither Voldemort nor Grindelwald cared about the statute of secrecy. And they had many followers, and almost took power. The idea that wizards would never attack muggles is, therefore, disproved by canon.

Hermione cared about others. But to think that Dean Thomas would not care about muggles just because he doesn't give a damn about creatures he never knew existed - remember, Hermione was surprised that there were house elves in Hogwarts, since she had not seen any in years - is not that convincing. He grew up in the muggle world, he had muggle friends, muggle family, and might even have a muggle love interest.

Are you really arguing that no wizard, ever, for no reason (love, hatred, spite, bribery, principles, family, etc.) would side with muggles?
