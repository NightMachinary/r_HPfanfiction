  You don't need that many traitors to affect the outcome of the war, given the capabilities of magic. And I honestly doubt that the same law enforcement that couldn't deal with Death Eaters will be more effective against such traitors.

Except that the moment Voldemort was gone in 1981, the Death Eaters were rounded up by the Ministry in short order. It was clearly Voldemort who was shielding them from the law and without him they posed no real threat to the Ministry.

Unless one of the few Muggleborn traitors happens to be a Voldemort-level talent, I imagine the same would occur.
