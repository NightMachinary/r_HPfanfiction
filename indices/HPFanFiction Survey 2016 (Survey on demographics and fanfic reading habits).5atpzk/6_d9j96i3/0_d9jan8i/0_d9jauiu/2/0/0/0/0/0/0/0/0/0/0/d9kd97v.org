I don't really see how you can assume the muggleborns would be caught without someone denouncing them, as happened after the war for the Death Eaters - all the Aurors couldn't find Sirius when he broke out of Azkaban, and that was with support from the muggles. If the muggles help hiding someone? Good luck in the middle of a war.
