Well, any wizard vs Muggle war would surely be started by the Muggles, since wizards have an established desire to be left alone and are perfectly happy with the status quo of exerting control over Muggle governments to maintain that situation. So Hermione may not have a choice. Wizards already effectively have the Muggles subjugated, it would be a war of independence against her Ministry.

I certainly agree that all Muggleborns would not think alike - Hermione, even though she's likely to side with the wizards, is on the extreme pro-Muggle end of the spectrum. I imagine the other Muggleborns would be much more enthusiastically pro-wizard.
