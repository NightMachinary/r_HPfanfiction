  So? Neither Voldemort nor Grindelwald cared about the statute of secrecy. And they had many followers, and almost took power. The idea that wizards would never attack muggles is, therefore, disproved by canon.

I disagree that Voldemort didn't care about the Statute. He was always careful to keep it in place. The Statute does't forbid interacting with Muggles, it only forbids revealing the magical world. Killing Muggles doesn't break the statute of secrecy so long as they don't know it's magic.

Grindelwald was another matter but he was a unique situation which is unlikely to reoccur precisely because he has occurred once and been defeated. Wizards have completely rejected that path.

  Are you really arguing that no wizard, ever, for no reason (love, hatred, spite, bribery, principles, family, etc.) would side with muggles?

I'm saying that "assuming no traitors" is close enough to possibility to be more than merely hypothetical. That by and large there would be no traitors which makes the phenomenon controllable. A small number of individual traitors can be dealt with by wizarding law enforcement as they would normally. Traitors only really affect the outcome of the war if there's enough of them to cause a large scale intra-wizarding conflict.
