  I don't know why you think wizards would not start the war

Because it goes against the Statute of Secrecy which is the basis of wizarding government and society.

  Also, Hermione would not fight to oppress muggles. That goes against her core character. The girl who counts among her greatest achievements according to JKR the house elf reforms would not fight against muggles who are fighting for their freedom. On the other hand, it is debatable if the wizards are actually oppressing and subjugating the muggles, as long as they are simply doing what's needed to keep themselves secret. The USA has the power to subjugate a great many nations, but that doesn't mean they are subjugated, as long as that power is not used.

Subjugation is not the same thing as oppression. The Muggles are subjugated in the sense that they are completely under the wizards' control: wizards are able to rearrange the schedules of Muggle leaders on a whim, for example. But they're not oppressed because wizards choose not to use that power except when necessary.

Hermione wouldn't fight to kill all Muggles or anything like that. I think she would fight to restore the status quo described above.

You say I underestimate family, I think you underestimate the extent to which most Muggleborns completely abandon the culture and values of their childhood. For example, Hermione is the only Muggleborn that we know of who has any problem with House Elf slavery. No one else was willing to join SPEW except Harry and Ron, and even they only did it out of friendship.
