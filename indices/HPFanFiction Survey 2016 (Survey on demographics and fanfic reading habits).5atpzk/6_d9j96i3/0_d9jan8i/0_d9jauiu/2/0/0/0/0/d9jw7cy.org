Well, I don't know why you think wizards would not start the war - Grindelwald had other ideas, and while we don't know if he attacked muggles, Voldemort certainly attacked and killed muggles.

Also, Hermione would not fight to oppress muggles. That goes against her core character. The girl who counts among her greatest achievements according to JKR the house elf reforms would not fight against muggles who are fighting for their freedom. On the other hand, it is debatable if the wizards are actually oppressing and subjugating the muggles, as long as they are simply doing what's needed to keep themselves secret. The USA has the power to subjugate a great many nations, but that doesn't mean they are subjugated, as long as that power is not used.

And I really think you underestimate the value people put on family. Even if the vast majority of muggleborns would side with the wizards, the idea that everyone would do so, no exceptions, no "traitors", is too implausible. And then there's love - a historically proven cause for many betrayals.

No, the "muggles vs. wizards" war has no chance at all to be fought without traitors.
