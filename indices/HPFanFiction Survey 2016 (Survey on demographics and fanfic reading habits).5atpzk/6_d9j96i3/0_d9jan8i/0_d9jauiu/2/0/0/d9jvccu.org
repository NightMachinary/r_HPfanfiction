I honestly doubt that Hermione would war against the muggles without a cause such as a "Kill all witches!" movement in power. Also, her sense of justice is among the most prominent in the series, so she'd side in a conflict with the party she'd consider in the right. The girl who stood up for the slaves when no one else would, would do no less.

But even if that was true for Hermione, the idea that everyone among the muggleborns would think like her seems implausible at best.

Family is damn important.
