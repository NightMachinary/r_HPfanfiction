"Assuming no traitors" means the question is purely hypothetical - such a scenario is simply impossible given muggleborns. The very idea that all muggleborns and their muggle families will split along those lines is too far-fetched to be taken seriously.

So, pointless question, really - without magic on the muggle side, there is no conflict since one side can't ever find the other.
