I personally took the no traitors to include no Imperius of muggle leaders.. which I think would make the wizards very likely to lose.. but then again we also don't even REALLY know what the magic is capable of. Are there spells that can redirect bullets? Can you detect sniper shots? Can you shield/ward against bombs? And we don't even REALLY know what the population looks like. It's a very open ended idea I suppose. But from what I know from cannon I definitely went with muggles winning.
