I'm a bit surprised that 90% of the respondents think Muggles would lose to wizards. I thought it would be more contentious.

If you're still doing this next year, may I suggest adding 'Tweets' to what one considers canon. I don't, but almost all of [[/r/HarryPotter]] seems to hang on every tap of Rowling's fingers and I think it would be interesting to see what percentage of the HPFF SR considers her ex cathedra blurbs to be noteworthy.

I think the most interesting bit is the dead even split (so far) on this question:

  On balance, did Dumbledore's decisions make Harry better or worse off?
#+end_quote

Edit: These data get even stranger: Harry/Ginny is leading the pack in het pairings with 110 votes (closest runner up is Harry/Hermione with 88), but Ginny is the favourite character for only 14 people.
