British Wizards barely realize who the Queen or the Prime Minister are. How would they accomplish this? Wizards are much too ignorant of the muggle world to pull off assassinations. They'd just kill the wrong person a bunch of times... and even if they'd manage to locate the White House and kill the President, I'm sure the U.S. would have a folder with a bunch of contingency plans to get rid of the Wizards in that situation.
