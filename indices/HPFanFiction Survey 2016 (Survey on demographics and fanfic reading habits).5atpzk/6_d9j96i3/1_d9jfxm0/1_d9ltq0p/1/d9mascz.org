  Wizards are much too ignorant of the muggle world to pull off assassinations

I feel like this is a more serious question, so I think we should take it that the answer will be an adult one and not based on the types of stereotypes that would prove true only in a child's novel. Are the magicals generally unaware of the muggle world? Yes. However, muggle borns do exist, and they would not be nearly so ignorant. Further, magicals aren't stupid. They don't know about the muggle world because they don't want to know and don't need to know. In the event of war, it wouldn't be difficult for them to figure things out.

  I'm sure the U.S. would have a folder with a bunch of contingency plans to get rid of the Wizards in that situation

Like what, bomb the places they don't know the location of and kill the people they don't know the identity of, all while trying to defend against people that can flash in and out of an area at will, penetrate all muggle barriers, form magical barriers, steal a person's will, look into their mind, and force them to answer any question truthfully?
