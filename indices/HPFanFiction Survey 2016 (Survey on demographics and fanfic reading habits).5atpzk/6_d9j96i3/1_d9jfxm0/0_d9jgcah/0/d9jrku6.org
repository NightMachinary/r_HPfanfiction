Or just imperius a load of politicians, media barons and thought leaders and have them all declare that the whole thing was a hoax and of course wizards don't exist. The world breathes a sigh of relief and expresses incredulity that they were ever fooled into thinking that magic is real.

Not even sure that the imperius is needed. Could just alter their memories in a way that leads them to that belief.
