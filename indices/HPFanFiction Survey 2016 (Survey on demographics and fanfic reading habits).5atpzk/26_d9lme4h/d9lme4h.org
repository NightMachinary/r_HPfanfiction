I'm kind of dismayed that the options given for politics are "right" and "left". It might be nice to provide more options in the future for other sorts of political views.

And no, "centrist" isn't the other option. It's like asking an atheist "are you for Jesus or are you for Satan" --- there are people who believe in neither Jesus nor Satan, and no, those aren't the people in the middle who are undecided which of the two to pick or who think both have some merits. (No offense intended to Christians, I'm using this purely as an exemplar.)

At the very least, you could provide "other" as an option.
