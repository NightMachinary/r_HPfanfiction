I'm not really surprised by the political leanings of this subreddit. Reddit itself is pretty progressive and HP has always been a pretty liberal fandom.

I'm actually surprised how many read slash on this subreddit. Whenever its mentioned I get the sense that its really unpopular and people just aren't interested.
