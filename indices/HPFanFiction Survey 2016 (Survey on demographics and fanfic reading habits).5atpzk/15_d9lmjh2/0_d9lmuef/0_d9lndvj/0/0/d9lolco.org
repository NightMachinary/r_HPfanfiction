I'm not assuming you're American or European.

UKIP isn't alt right in the US sense, it's just traditional right with some (European sense) liberal bits thrown in. I would never reasonably classify them as alt right.

The "real" Alt Right is a completely different beast, with a very broad and very non-traditional agenda, most of which I find terrifying in a way that UKIP, which I dislike, is not.

I suggest reading some Mencius Moldbug if you want to understand what they're like and where they come from. It's an interesting mix of unusual but supportable ideas, mildly unsupportable yearning for 19th century political values, and batshit loony insanity.
