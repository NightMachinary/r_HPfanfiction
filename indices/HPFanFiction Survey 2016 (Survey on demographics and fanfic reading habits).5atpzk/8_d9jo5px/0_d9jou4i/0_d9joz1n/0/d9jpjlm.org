Well yes, but I mostly write adult Sirius/oc which has, shall we say, a limited audience. As far as recs go, when I asked on here a couple of months ago, I didn't get a single one. There doesn't seem to be much call for Sirius stories that aren't Sirius/Hermione, Wolfstar or Black Comedy. There are a couple in my favourites. I can't do links on this device but my username is Malebron.
