/With/ Dumbledore, Harry knows about the Horcuxes and stands approximately 5% chance. Dumbledore's plan was literally "welp, he's gotta die anyway. Might as well see if we can get something out of it."

The only thing he could have done to make Harry worse off would be letting Harry's death accomplish nothing. I just really don't think the next step up from failure should be called success. The bare minimum of any plan that could be called a success would be Harry *not taking an Avada Kedavra to the face.*
