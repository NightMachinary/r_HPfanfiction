I'm surprised at how dead even the results are for that question.

Personally, I selected that he was better off, but it was a bit of a coin flip. I only selected that because Harry was insanely lucky every year and actually /did/ get through it alive even though some of Dumbledore's choices put him in life or death situations constantly. For example, the way Dumbledore handled the Chamber of Secrets in the second year was pretty questionable in that it's pretty much a miracle that no one died.

Since everything turned out okay, I will give Dumbledore the benefit of the doubt, but I'm sure there could have been a better way to do it (although maybe not as drastic as say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification proliferation]] )
