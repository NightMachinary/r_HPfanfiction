I put worse just because I was thinking about the Dursleys. I feel like they could have found a nice wizarding family for Harry to live with and put them under fidelus which would have had a similar protection as the Dursleys without all of the horrible abuse. Even assuming Dumbledore didn't know about it until Hagrid saw what was happening and wanted his mother's love to still protect Harry, Dumbledore could have sent someone with Harry during the summer to the Dursleys to chaperone, or to check on him every day or once a week to make sure he was being fed etc.

Also, there were lots of times when Dumbledore's choices were to keep Harry in the dark about important info, and if Harry would have known those things he could have made better choices. Similarly, if Dumbledore would have picked someone nicer to teach Harry legilimency, Sirius would probably still be alive.
