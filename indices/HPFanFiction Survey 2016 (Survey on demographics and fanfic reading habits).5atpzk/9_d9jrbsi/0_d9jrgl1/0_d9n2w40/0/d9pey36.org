The only way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy the container. With a living being that means death. Basilisk venom, fiendfyre etc are all just a means to destroy the container. So for example, in CoS Harry was injected with basilisk venom but because he didn't die the container wasn't destroyed, and therefore the horcrux in his scar survived.

It should also be noted that basilisk venom is not some universal horcrux destroyer. Rather, you can destroy a horcrux with anything that it has not been enchanted to be resistant to. The reason why basilisk venom is so useful for destroying horcruxes is that its counteracting force, phoenix tears, is so rare and hard for dark wizards especially to obtain.
