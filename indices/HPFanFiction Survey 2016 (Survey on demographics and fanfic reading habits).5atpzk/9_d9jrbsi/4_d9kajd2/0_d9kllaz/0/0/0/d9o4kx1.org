The first point makes sense, but why cant dumbledore just do different actions rather than just noping out of the situation? Big jump there. Why couldnt dumbledore just raise him? He didnt have to be headmaster, not saying this woulda made somthing, but I just think saying its all or nothing is kinda stupid.
