Hmm, I thought the question was vaguely worded myself, which means the design of the question is at fault, but assuming it was an A-or-Z situation I would have picked the answer yes, but I didnt assume that.

But then again, under different standards you might even answer no, with the A-or-Z situation as a given. These questions are tough lmao.
