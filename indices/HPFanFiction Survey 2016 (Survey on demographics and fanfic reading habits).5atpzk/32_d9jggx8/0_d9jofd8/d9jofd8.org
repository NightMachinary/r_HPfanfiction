Working class/blue collar/service jobs are basically what Americans call 'lower middle class' because everybody in the US wants to be considered in the middle class. Working class identities were much stronger before the 1950s when socialism, which derives its power explicitly from the power of laborers and the working class, was wholly associated with the USSR and the Cold War.

And ever since then, people in the US who say 'I'm working class' are assumed to be anti-American commies, basically. But folks who work for hourly wages instead of salaries are traditionally part of the working class, as are skilled tradesmen & women.
