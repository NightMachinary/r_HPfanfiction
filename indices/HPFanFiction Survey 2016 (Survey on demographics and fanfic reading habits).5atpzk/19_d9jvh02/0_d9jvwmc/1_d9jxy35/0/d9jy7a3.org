When it comes to American politics I wouldn't take my cue from Reddit, which is full of 3edgy5me teens who see "the establishment" everywhere and are still in love with ideas of rebellion.

Clinton essentially represents the continuation of the status quo with some minor tweaks (which is what candidates generally stand for in most Western democracies). Life under Clinton will continue on pretty much as it always has. Education and healthcare might get slightly more investment and the military might get slightly less. No major changes.

Trump on the other hand wants to completely upend the US constitution by denying constitutional rights to millions, ditch half the USA's alliances, turn back the clock on the last century of economic progress... and of course build a giant, expensive, useless wall.
