The hate for Hillary revolves around her character, not her policies. There are two main objections to her on that basis:

1. She lies to pander to the anti-establishment crowd while having no real intention of enacting anything anti-establishment.

2. She displayed a certain level of negligence with regard to the handling of top secret information in the past by having it on an unsecure email server.
