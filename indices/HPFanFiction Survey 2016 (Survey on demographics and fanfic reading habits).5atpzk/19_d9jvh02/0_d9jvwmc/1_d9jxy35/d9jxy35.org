Yeah I did notice that, but my confusion was mainly related to the fact that I thought they were equally bad.

It was only last week that I saw a viral post on facebook by a feminist hating misogynist who said that he might actually vote for Hillary because he thinks that shes so bad that she'll "fuck the parliament up so badly that no woman will ever be considered for presidency for the next half a century."

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not very well educated at all regarding American politics, but most of the posts I've seen seem to suggest that neither will be prefered over the other and that they will both majorly screw the country over.
