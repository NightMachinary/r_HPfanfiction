I was more surprised that barely 1/3 of the people chose "Third party/no vote" for the US President question.

Granted I don't live in America so most of what I heard is probably extreme propaganda from either side but both the choices there seem absolutely horrible. The fact that more than half chose Hillary seems to suggest that maybe I'm missing something?
