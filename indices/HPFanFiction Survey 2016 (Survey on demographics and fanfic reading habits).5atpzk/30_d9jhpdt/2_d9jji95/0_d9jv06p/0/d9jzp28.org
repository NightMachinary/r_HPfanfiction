IIRC, the question was worded "do you identify as a feminist". While I believe those things, I never-the-less answered "no". I don't go to protests, donate to feminist charities, or really talk about it in more than passing conversation. Again, not because I don't believe those things, but because personally my free time and money are taken up trying to secure equality for blind folks; being blind, it's a thing I know more about, and care more about because of direct personal experience. I assume the majority of people answered "no" to that question for similar reasons.
