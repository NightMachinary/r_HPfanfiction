  Wizards would lose that war without a doubt, guns shot faster and stronger than spells

some disillusionment, a few false memory charms, and an imperius or two go a long way. To me both sides losing is a more likely proposition.

Gives you insight into what people look for and like reading, which can be useful for authors, and informative for readers. For instance, being left of center, in the Worm fandom I don't really enjoy reading fics where the protagonist joins the Empire 88, a neo nazi gang. Over here, I don't like fics where Harry is evil, or where death eaters are presented as not that terrible. Or any death eater ships.
