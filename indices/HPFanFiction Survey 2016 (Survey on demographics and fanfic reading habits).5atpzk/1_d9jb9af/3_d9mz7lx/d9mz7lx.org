'least favorite' is pretty imprecise. If there's a character I love to hate and one I just wish wasn't in the books which is my 'least favorite?' I feel strongly negative about the first but wouldn't want them out of the books.

I put down ron for that question because I feel like he's just generally useless except as ham handed comic relief and the books could have been much better without him in them at all.
