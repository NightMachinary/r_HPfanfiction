Voldemort is almost too evil to be hated, have you heard the phrase one death is a tragedy a thousand is a statistic? I apply the same concept, you can't comprehend what Voldemort is doing but Umbridge, that's real you can understand and process that. Voldemort is almost evil because he is the villain not for reasons we can understand.
