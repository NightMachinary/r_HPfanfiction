Interesting to see the religious breakdown, I guess Harry Potter really is a satanic text.

I'm also shocked that Harry is winning the favorite character poll, given how he has been maligned on HP-related subs in the past.

Edit: LOL at the time of this post, Umbridge has 46% of the vote for least favorite character, and Voldemort has.....0%.
