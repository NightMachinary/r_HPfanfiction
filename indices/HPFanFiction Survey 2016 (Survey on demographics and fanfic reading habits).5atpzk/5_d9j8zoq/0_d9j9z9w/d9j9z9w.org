Yeah, wow, I was really not expecting some of those questions.

The gender balance really threw me too! I'm sure it'll change a bit but tumblr, the other place I'm active in the fandom, at least the area I'm in seems to be almost exclusively female-identified people.

I also was shocked at the amount of people who indicated they would read femslash, seeing as how it is so much harder to find. You'd think there'd be more of it! (A gal can only dream...)
