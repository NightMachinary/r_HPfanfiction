[[http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1997/03/in_praise_of_cheap_labor.html][In Praise of Cheap Labour]], an article by Paul Krugman, a nobel-prize winning economist.

To sum it up briefly: There is a reason why people choose to work in sweatshops, and it is because they are better jobs than the alternatives they have available to them. We would not choose these jobs because we have alternatives available to us that are better, but this is not available to third world countries. This growth in a manufacturing sector has led to growth in the standard of living, especially as factories begin competing amongst themselves. This is industrialisation of the same sort experienced by the West, but happening far faster than it occurred here (largely due to established technologies), and the outcomes have been incredible. To quote Krugman:

  The benefits of export-led economic growth to the mass of people in the newly industrializing economies are not a matter of conjecture. A country like Indonesia is still so poor that progress can be measured in terms of how much the average person gets to eat; since 1970, per capita intake has risen from less than 2,100 to more than 2,800 calories a day. A shocking one-third of young children are still malnourished--but in 1975, the fraction was more than half. Similar improvements can be seen throughout the Pacific Rim, and even in places like Bangladesh. These improvements have not taken place because well-meaning people in the West have done anything to help--foreign aid, never large, has lately shrunk to virtually nothing. Nor is it the result of the benign policies of national governments, which are as callous and corrupt as ever. It is the indirect and unintended result of the actions of soulless multinationals and rapacious local entrepreneurs, whose only concern was to take advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor. It is not an edifying spectacle; but no matter how base the motives of those involved, the result has been to move hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty to something still awful but nonetheless significantly better.

Which is not to say that Fair Trade is a bad thing. Fair Trade, if it fails to dampen demand whilst giving consumers a way to be actively altruistic in paying a premium for higher wages and better working conditions, is clearly a moral good. But sweat shops are not a moral evil (except where slavery is involved, but that is a separate issue).

[[http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2008/Powellsweatshops.html][A more in-depth piece]] expanding on this.

Also, anti-Free Trade isn't something which has a traditional left-right skew.
