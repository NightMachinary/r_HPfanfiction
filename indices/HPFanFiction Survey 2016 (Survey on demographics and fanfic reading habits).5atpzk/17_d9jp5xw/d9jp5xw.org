I am shocked at so many people who think free trade is great. Free trade is ultimate capitalism where companies go with the best price (including contractors using sweat shops) as opposed to fair trade which pays reasonable wages to real people in other countries for their goods. We had a fair trade fair when I was in high school. Free trade sounds great but it's actually some of the worst parts of capitalism. And I'm not exactly a left leaning person on most issues.
