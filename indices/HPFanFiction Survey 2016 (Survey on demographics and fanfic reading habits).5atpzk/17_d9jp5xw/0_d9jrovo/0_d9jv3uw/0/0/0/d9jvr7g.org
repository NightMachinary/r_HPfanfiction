It would be removing a trade barrier (if you believe that unfair trade is a market failure). Free trade doesn't mean unregulated trade, it means trade which most efficiently distributes resources globally without regard to national borders. The ultimate manifestation of free trade would be a global free market. Indeed, generally, the freer trade gets the more regulated it is, because regulations are required to harmonise standards, laws, etc. The freest international trade zone in the world is the EU single market and that requires a mountain of legislation to maintain.

If a market failure is lowering the price of a good below the correct market price, then it is preventing the efficient distribution of resources. Correcting that market failure is not a trade barrier, it enables free trade.
