Essentially every economist, including Paul Krugman (who got his Nobel for his work on why free trade is a good thing) will tell you free trade is a good thing. You will have trouble finding an economics textbook that opposes free trade. Note that when we want to punish a country for bad behavior, we cut off trade to them, we don't push for greater trade with them. It is difficult to believe free trade is a bad thing and simultaneously that (for example) trade sanctions cause harm to the impacted countries. Were free trade actually bad for countries, then as punishment for bad behavior we would somehow impose it on them.
