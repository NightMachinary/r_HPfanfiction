1) Fred and George's Busy Day by Northumbrian (plus his other F/G fics) linkffn(5486126)

2) I love when they're written canonically. Hate constant twin-speak/Gred+Forge, because this isn't canon! They only did it once!

3) I like canon ships. I am 100% good with George and Angelina; they were housemates for 7 years and teammates for 6, so they have a good background. Personally, my headcanon is that Fred and Angelina went to the Yule Ball as friends only, because people seem to really hate that George ended up with Fred's alleged ex-girlfriend. On the flip side, I've read good fics where Fred /did/ date Angelina (quite seriously), and George and Angelina bonded over mutual mourning/grief. Basically as long as the fic doesn't make it into some tragic thing where Angelina went for George because he's practically Fred (which he isn't, they actually have slightly different personalities, and it's noticeable in canon).

4) U-NO-POO, their departure from Hogwarts, all their brotherly antics (making fun of ickle Ronniekins and Percy). I like the PoA bit that's like:

  Percy: why are we taking ministry cars

  Fred (deadpanning): It's for you Perce, they're going to have flags on the bonnet with HB on them

  George: For humongous bighead.
#+end_quote

I don't like the bit where Fred dies, although I think it was a good literary choice because it /was/ the most traumatic sibling to die (Ron and Ginny are not options).
