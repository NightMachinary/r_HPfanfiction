My favourite part of the twins is the scene with their joke-shop at the start of HBP. The garish, over-the-top shop in the middle of all the doom and gloom. Great stuff.

I read a story once, can't remember which, where Fred and George randomly decide to switch girlfriends. George says something along the lines of "Angelique finally found out I'm more handsome". Made me laugh, and I think that's the whole point of the twins as characters.

Least favourite part of the twins: I think it's because I've read about it too much, but Fred's death doesn't faze me at all anymore. So when I read those post-Hogwarts fics and I see a wall of text where the main character grieves about Fred, I just skip it.
