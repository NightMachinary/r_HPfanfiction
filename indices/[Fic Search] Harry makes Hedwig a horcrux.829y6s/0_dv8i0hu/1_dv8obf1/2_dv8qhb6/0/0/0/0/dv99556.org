  Lol, someone keeps downvoting you for disliking this story.

Yeah, which is hilarious seeing as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4w61kw/what_story_wasted_its_potential_the_most/d64afu0/][I am on the record as saying it had a lot of potential until the summer happened.]]

  How can Harry be this smart, yet this oblivious.

Entirely due to the influence of Slytherin's portrait which sent Harry down the spiral into darkness that he experienced through the entire fic.

I did actually really like how Dumbledore was portrayed, and was actually one of the only things keeping me in it (plus it was the first fic I had basically followed since publish date). I liked the juxtaposition of a Dumbledore who is trying to set everything up so that Harry will survive but all Harry-mentored-by-the-terrible-influence-of-Slytherin's-portrait sees is the stereotypical manipulative!Dumbledore we see so often in fanfic. It was one of the ideas to the story that I found actually really good.
