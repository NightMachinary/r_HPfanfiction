Main reason I enjoyed the fic was that it was a Harry/Fleur fic that tried to be a little different. It didn't start with OP Harry saving Fleur and Gabrielle at the World Cup and then falling for each other. Granted I have many problems with it, especially after rereading it last month but as someone that wants more varied Harry/Fleur fics it scratched that itch.
