In that case, I like most of what I see. I'd be more careful of formatting(starting a new paragraph for new dialog is an absolute must), there are some super-minor spelling errors, and smoothing out the dialog. It seems a bit.. stilted? Like very rapid changes in their tone, it's a little jarring. Otherwise, it's a radical premise and Im looking forward to seeing what you do with it!
