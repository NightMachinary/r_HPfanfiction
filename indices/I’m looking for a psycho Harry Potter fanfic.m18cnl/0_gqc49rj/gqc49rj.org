Linkao3(The Good War by inwardtransience) Abused Fem!Harry unlocks her leglimency powers possibly turning her into a sociopath. She has major problems with empathy and communication despite being a literal mind reader. Normal readers will probably find this disturbing/fascinating. In fact just about every one of the author's works have protagonists who would be considered functionally insane by normal standards.
