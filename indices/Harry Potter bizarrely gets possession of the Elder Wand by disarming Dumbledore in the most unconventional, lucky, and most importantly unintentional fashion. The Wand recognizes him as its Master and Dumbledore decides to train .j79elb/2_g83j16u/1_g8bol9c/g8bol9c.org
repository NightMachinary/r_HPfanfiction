Not truly. I believe that The Elder Wandâ„¢ is a twisted artefact, such that to gain its allegiance the owner must not want to part with it or if the owner wants to lose it in some meaningful way, the plan will go wrong such that someone else will become the owner. You cannot want the wand to change allegiance to someone who you want to gain its ownership, because then you would have never been bested in that way.[My Head Cannon] So! When Harry went to die, he accepted his death and became the master of death for a short whole when he gained the resurrection stone, allowing him to live in exchange for voldies horcrux. Hence voldie did not gain the allegiance of the wand as he hadn't really bested harry.
