Killing someone doesn't necessarily mean besting them. Harry willingly went into the forest with the intention of allowing Voldemort to kill him, and in doing so bring about Voldemort's death. Thus there is no way whatsoever that it can be counted as Voldemort besting him.

That was also the entire reason Dumbledore wanted Snape to kill him. If he had died on his own terms without ever being bested, the Elder Wand would have lost it's power altogether. (Or at least, that's what he theorised. He could have been wrong) Of course Draco messed that up, but it ended up working out better than expected so it's all fine.
