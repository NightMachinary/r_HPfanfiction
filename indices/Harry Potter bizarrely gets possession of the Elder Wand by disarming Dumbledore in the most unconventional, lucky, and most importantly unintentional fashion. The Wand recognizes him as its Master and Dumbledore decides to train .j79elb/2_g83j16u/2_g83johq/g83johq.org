Yes, that part doesn't make a lot of sense. We could say that since Harry was already considered Master of Death at that point, the previous Hallows rules no longer apply to him, although it is only a personal hypothesis. Only reason may be that we do not fully understand how the Elder's Wand works, so perhaps, although in most cases death counts as "defeat", what happens if the murdered person is resurrected? Not to mention, contradictions have been seen in the Wand's behavior, like when Grindelwald is defeated in Fantastic Beasts, but in the next movie he uses the Wand as if nothing had happened. (If you do want to assume that the above is something from the history and not a plot hole).
