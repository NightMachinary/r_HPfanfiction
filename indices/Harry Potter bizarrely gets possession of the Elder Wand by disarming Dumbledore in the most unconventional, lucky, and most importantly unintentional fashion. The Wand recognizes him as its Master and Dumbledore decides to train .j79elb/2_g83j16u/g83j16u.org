I have a question. Doesn't Killing someone means to best them? And voldie did kill Harry (he survived because of deathly hallow thingies but still he was bested), so why didn't elder wand change allegiance? If expillarmus and physically grabbing changes allegiance then avada should too (voldie killed snapey for that reason alone). Or am I missing something?
