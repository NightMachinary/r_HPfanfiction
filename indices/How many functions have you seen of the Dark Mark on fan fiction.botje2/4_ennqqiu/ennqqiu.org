The two canon items that show up are:

1. Responds somewhat to Riddle's status (faded out while he's out of action, becomes more prominant as he gains strength in GoF)
2. Can be used to beacon in other DEs (also GoF, graveyard), though someone using the mark on someone else is apparently not pleasant in at least the movieverse

That said, them not being on mind controlled troops makes sense, why mark someone you're literally using to throw away? On the other hand that might be dependant on how important any particular controlled person is and how much they need to be monitored or pulled arond for more instructions.
