Not necessarily a function, but my favourite interpretation of it is that the dark mark is branded into their skin like a scar. In the books it's described as red (opposed to the black tattoo in the movies) and burns when touched. I'd like to believe Voldy branded his Death Eaters like cattle and acts as a shepherd to his sheep.
