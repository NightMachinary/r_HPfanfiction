There's at least one where the dark mark gives the Death Eaters a basic sort of Occlumency to protect Voldemort's secrets and make them less susceptible to Boggarts, Dementors, Confundus spells -- not immune, but resistant. The exception, of course, is anything cast by Voldemort himself. Since he Marked them, he can ignore the defence that he granted them. That leaves only legitimate practitioners of Occlumency able to resist him at all.
