Every mark has a part of Voldemort's soul embedded into them, effectively making them all Horcrux'

Can use the mark to punish followers.

Either complete your mission or the mark will judge you and you die.

Killing Voldemort kills all the marked death eaters.

The snake tattoo can animate under parsletongue for more intricate commands.

Dark mark bearers can draw upon a small amount of Voldemorts power to power boost in difficult situations.

Can send messages through the mark like Hermione's protean charm on the Galleons to send messages to the DA

Can sense his followers intentions through them, thus know when they are lying to punish.

Can only receive the mark if deliberately choosing to follow the Dark Lord, kills spies. (Snape only turns spy after receiving the mark )

When pressed can summon the Dark Lord, or if Dark lord presses can summon targeted followers or all followers.

Can turn invisible if someone tries to randomly check people for the dark mark.
