I have read only the first 4 chapters according to the ffn app.

I don't keep much memories of it, it is nice but not really memorable, I remember that I was afraid of Harry becoming Ã¼ber-super-op, in a wish fullfilment sort of fic.

Other than that, I think it is a nice introduction to the other fandom (Dresden files). I say that as I never paid much more than a passing glance to the title and so am completely lost in the fandom. Despite that, I was not lost in the story, which is always nice.

Technically speaking, I think it is quite nice, having also read is Naruto fix.
