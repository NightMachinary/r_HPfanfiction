I re-read it several times and I have to say, this fic is absolutely fantastic despite some of its flaws. It has one of the best Dumbledore characterization. Fight scenes are FANTASTIC although some are a little bit overdone. I still remember the feeling when I read the 2 vs 2 battle at the Ministry, boys if it isn't EPIC. Merciel is also one of my favourite part of this story. When she sacrificed herself at the end of the series (was it, I don't remember that exact part), I was honestly extremely sad and unable to read it for days. Finally, the sass on this fic is ON POINT. All things considered, this is a brilliant series and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for one hell of a ride.
