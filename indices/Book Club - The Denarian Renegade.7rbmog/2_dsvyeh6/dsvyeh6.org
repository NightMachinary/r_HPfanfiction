I have a lot to say about this story. Actually, I pre-wrote this entire review when I saw that this was the next fic being put up here. I just want to say that this story is probably in my top 5 favorite fics of all time, but it does have loads of problems.

I do like how you really don't need to know anything about the Dresden Files to read it. Hell, I probably hadn't even heard of the Dresden Files when I first read the story, and I know there are many like me. I would not be surprised if Shezza was responsible for thousands of sales of Jim Butcher's books. I heartily recommend those as well, though they're not without problems either

However, listing problems is always far more interesting than listing what is good about a story, so that's what I'll do here. 1) Grammar/spelling. Honestly, it's all over the place, and you'd think with how many people Shezza had reading it over, it would end up a bit cleaner. Shezza even mixed up the characters names a few times.

2) Fight scenes are good, but most of them are just too damn long. And there's /tons/ of them. It just gets kind of tedious, and it gets even worse in later stories when the fight scenes take multiple chapters. You know it's bad when you're skimming fight scenes to get to the character interactions.

3) Some of the fights aren't actually choreographed all that well. And I say this while saying that the ending fight scene is my favorite scene in all of fanfiction. Some of it is just /lazy/ for lack of a better word. Like, for how good the third task fight is, the second task is the exact opposite, and the fault of that lies in something that is done throughout the whole story, but is deluged here. It's how Harry is described when he's fighting. His eyes glint darkly, he hisses spells, barks, grunts, barks some more, snarls, bellows, etc. It's super generic descriptors that feel very out of place. They're the type of descriptors used as a crutch to make it feel like the moment is dark and gritty, but it's really not.

4) The beginning of the story. Honestly, it's a mess, and quite arbitrary. Like, Harry carrying a cross - A bit too on the nose. And then the method for Harry actually getting to Hogwarts? Way too convoluted. Like, Harry arrives, asks to enroll in the school, but it only ends up being for a single day anyways as he completes the debt, only to have to stick around anyways for the tournament. At least the scene with Harry trying to get out of the tournament was entertaining. “I don't even know what the fuck is going on, I just got here!” or something to that effect. Also, I wasn't a fan of the actual time setting - HP was born in 1980 so would actually be near the same age as Dresden. It worked out ok, since Amanda was kind of interesting.

5) Harry's character. I get that the story is a perfect example of DLP's grimdark era circa 2007, but some of it is way too over the top and a bit too tryhard. It just makes Harry come off as just not very interesting at times. Some of the snark and sass is on point, but that really is only true when it involves the characters in the story who are more interesting than him. Namely, Dumbledore. I love the Dumbledore in this story. He just feels more real than pretty much any other version that I've seen. Same with Meciel. Despite existing solely in Harry's mind, there's just something tangible about her, which makes her my favorite OC in any fic. So, I guess Harry maybe ranks as the third most interesting character in the story, at best.

6) The actual crossover mechanics. It's just not necessary to have split up the magic systems. Wand-magic and true-magic is just so damn convoluted to the point of it being a major detraction from the story. I've just never understood what so difficult about combining the two systems, and all the reasons people come up with just seem minor at best.

Yet, despite all this, I still consider the story a masterpiece, and one of the best in the fandom. I've read it probably ten times, the first in 2009, the most recent being last month.
