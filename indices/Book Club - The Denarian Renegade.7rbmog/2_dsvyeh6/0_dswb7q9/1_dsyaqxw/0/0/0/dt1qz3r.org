Ahh, i thought sympathetic was a synonym for nice (sympathises with others). My bad lol, thank you for correcting me. Yes i agree with you that harry was a jerk, but it was kind of understandable as to why. Jerk harry! Isn't for everyone, but he does become less of a asshole throughout the story.

I don't care about how he acts all that much because he does do nice things occasionally. that gave me the impression that he was unsympathetic and acts like an asshole but is still a (somewhat) nice person. That for me is more interesting than the average harry.
