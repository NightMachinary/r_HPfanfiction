"Nice" and "sympathetic" are entirely different. If a character is sympathetic, they're easy to sympathize with. You can understand how they'd get into their situation and root for them in some way. It takes effort to write a character who is, for instance, both malevolent and sympathetic, but it's possible. And you can write unsympathetic nice characters.

/The Denarian Renegade/ features a protagonist who is both unsympathetic and a jerk.
