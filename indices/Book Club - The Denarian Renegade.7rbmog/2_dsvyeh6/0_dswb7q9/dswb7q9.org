No offense but i disagree with almost everything you just said. The grammar mistakes are pretty easy to just ignore even for a "grammar nazi" like me.

Fight scenes were all good, the story is just some good old action and an interesting plot. If you want a story about characterisation and with a sappy harry read "harry potter and the Days of future past".

The beginning was meh, i will agree on that. Harry is an arsehole, but it makes the story more interesting and it breakes away from sterotypical harry who is a wimp and still shaken from abuse, which while realistic isn't very entertaining. It comes down to personal preference, and honestly would a nice harry fit the story at all? He grew up with a fallen who isn't exactly the epitome of morals.

The magic system... merging them would require shezza to concoct some complicated explanation for 1. How it works and 2. Why exactly other wand wizards don't use true magic. I know i am not explaining it right but point is there would be too many plot holes nitpicks like you would point out.

TLDR; again i am not trying to offend anyone, but this is my opinion. It is all down to personal preference whether you like this fic or not. In the end, it is fanfiction, enjoy the story instead of trying to hold it up to the standards of professional writers.
