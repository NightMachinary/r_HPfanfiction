I gave this one a try four or five times and I think the best comparison I can make is to Prince of Slytherin. I hear from many people that once you get past a certain point it gets good, but I have to get to that point first.

Perhaps I should be more forgiving with this fic, given when it was written, but it has to be said. The writing is just /terrible/. There must be more adjectives shoehorned into the first chapter alone than in some entire works of fiction. And the tryhard is cranked up so high you could build a space elevator out of it.

I keep meaning to try to buy into it on the strength of recommendations, but perhaps some fics from the 2000s just aren't worth the effort.
