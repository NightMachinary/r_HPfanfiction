What can I say? It's a ten-year-old fanfic, for God's sake.

Alright, it's good. The combat scenes are great, the OCs are great (especially Meciel), it has the best Dumbledore I've ever read, there's a very interesting concept of magic, however... /It's not a Dresden Files crossover/. There's very little from the Dresdenverse in this fanfic. For God's sake, Dresden himself appears in, like, two chapters.

Also, Harry should have died about after the Nicodemus fight.
