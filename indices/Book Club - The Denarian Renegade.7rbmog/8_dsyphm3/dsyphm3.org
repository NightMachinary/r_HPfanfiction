I must have liked this a bit, I read a couple of them and bought some Dresden books, but after a while Harry's unrelenting grumpiness just made reading the series hard work. So: read the first book, then read a couple of books from the Dresden Files, then read some Ben Aaronovitch to cheer yourself up.
