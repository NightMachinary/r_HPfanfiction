I've reread the whole Denarian Series a lot of times, for specifically the Denarian Renegade though? One thing that you Have to understand with a Dresden crossover isn't the differing magic systems or Outside or any of that. The big one is God (Catholic) and all other gods exist (like physically tangible) and things that to a reader of an ordinary story you'd say "Well isn't that convenient?"

In the Dresden verse and D Renegade verse are "Well some upper power, God, Fey, Daemon or otherwise, that is is messing about. I hope the main character can overcome it." you have to be much more aware of the possibility of outside manipulation than just the standard Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore, and OC baddies.

Maybe it's because I'm a big lover of Jim Butcher's series and I don't mind that. But to a HP fanfiction reader it may come off as odd. But faith is tangible and effects things just like magic does. Both are forces that act on the world about them. And Harry as a character interacts with the mixing of those forces in his day to day life in this story.

As for Harry himself, he comes off as a total arsehole. Because that what he wants to be seen as. Sure pretend to be something long enough and that will change the way you actually feel. But for this story, I'd say Harry's key feature / flaw is his will. Time and time again he has to put his willpower over Angels, Outsiders, Fey, Dracon, and he comes out on top because of his will and his ability to think on his feet (with some help from Meciel when he needs it). Exactly like Harry Dresden himself.

Harry is a huge jerk face, Harry says racist, misogyny purporting, hilarious things, Harry says anything and everything to keep people away.

He lives most of his life alone and because of that, is fulfilled most by conversing with Meciel. And only because of that is he such a ridiculous character. He wants to be loved. And getting her to laugh at his (to her) hilarious antics are what he does through this story.

At a certain point you can see where he realized Meciel loves him for him not because he does such unexpected things. And he mellows out, we'll for him. He's still a right bastard, for his own amusement and Meciel's but less so to get her to love him. I think their relationship is one of my favorite things about this story, even more than the Fallen in the Cannon Dresden series.

Now let me be clear it is not a perfect story. But it is most likely one of my favorite Harry Potters created. Because he is one of the few I can actually see as powerful through his own merits. Sure Meciel gives him hellfire, but really hellfire doesn't actually do anything but strengthen your will artificially giving your magic a perceived boost. The whole story he talks about how easy it is to lose yourself in it. And how people go mad. What's the point in that powerboost if you can't focus it? But he does because his will IS enough.

It's like punching a wall, most people could swing and do a bit of damage. Some people if told to swing as hard as they could, might do some more damage. But if you were being chased by daemons from hell you'd break your own bones to get through that wall. You always had the strength to do so, but sometimes that mental visceral push is needed to actually break the wall.

Hellfire is the same thing but mentally with magic, the real asset to picking up a coin is another consciousness to help you with combat and their ability to heal you while you're fighting. Angels can think much much faster than mortal men.

Last thing to be said is Dumbledore, a lot of people think this is one of the most realistic ones ever written. They are correct. Also the action scenes are pretty damn good.

Give this 3 part Denarian Series a chance if you haven't been able to reread it in awhile. It really is good.
