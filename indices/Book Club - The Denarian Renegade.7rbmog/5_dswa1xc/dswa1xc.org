They were the most amazing fics of harry potter i have ever read. Harry was an arsehole, but he was a sarcastic and funny arsehole. It had a good dumbledore instead of your typical "i am manipulating you, stealing from your vaults and spying on you with ron and/or hermione" or the mass of contradictions that is the "i care about you but manipulate you anyway, for the greater good" stereotype. It had good fight scenes and decent plot from what i remember.
