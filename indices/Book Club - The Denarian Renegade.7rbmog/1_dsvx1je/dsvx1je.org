I honestly enjoyed it way back when I first read it. I attempted to re-read it recently and was unsuccessful, though.

Characterization was why, I think. Harry is almost entirely unlikeable and Meciel reads more like a plot-device than a character.

The fights are well written and the magic thrown around is fun. The Harry/Amanda part I also enjoyed.
