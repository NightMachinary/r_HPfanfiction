I agree about Alex's stubbornness being something I had to get used to. All the teachers really were sick of Alexandra's shit all the time too lol. It makes sense for personality of being such a problem child coupled with her age, but it still wasn't as inviting for the reader. It's like as if Dennis The Menace had magic.

I should finish reading the Alexandra Quick series since I'm almost done it. That's for the reminder lol.
