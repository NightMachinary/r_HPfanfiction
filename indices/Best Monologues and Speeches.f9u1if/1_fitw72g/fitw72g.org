Well to be honest it sounds like your not making much distinction between "quotes/quips" and speeches or monologues, which itself is vast. Here are some speeches I remember in particular:

- Harry reliving the memories of Dumbledore in Ch. 1 of linkffn(The One He Feared). Absolutely nails both the sense of awe at the beginning section as well as the Dumbledore-ness of the character
- Ron's explanation to Harry in Ch. 1 of linkffn(Contractual Invalidations). Absolutely nails the best friend Ron that most people forget in the fandom, and Harry's response is totally on point: "you're the best friend ever."
- The part where Neville comes out and reveals his greatest fear in linkffn(Oh God Not Again!) is actually Harry as Minister of Magic, and the corresponding Boggart. Cancel Tuesdays indeed.
- Hermione's commentary on Harry's growth during the memory chapter in linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher).
- When Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys finally sit down and ask Jasmine about her experiences in the last 5000 years in linkffn(The Long Journey Home). The nonchalance is just so...believable and honest.
- Several monologues by both Voldemort and Verdandi on how the Dark and White Arts are both opposite and identical in linkffn(The Crown of Metis).

YMMV
