Yeah. I'm trying to focus on the big speeches and monologues, but I found that if I try to get too specific with my requests, they somehow end up sounding like something other than what I originally intended, so I was trying to keep it simple. All the things I mentioned were definitely speeches and monologues though, so I hoped that would be enough. Guess not. C'est la vie. :D

The only ones I've read are Contractual Invalidation, Oh God Not Again!, and A Long Journey Home, and the only one that really fits is the latter. The first two are definitely more quips than speeches or monologues.
