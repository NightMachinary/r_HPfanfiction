How inappropriate/explicit are we talking? I'm very asexual, so I find most overly smutty fics to be either baffling or appallingly scandalous in that "You do /what/?!" sort of way and I'm trying to debate if I should add it to the To-Read list. No offence intended - I'm sure it's great, but if there's too much fuckin' I end up skipping over most of the fic out of boredom so I have a habit of checking first. :D
