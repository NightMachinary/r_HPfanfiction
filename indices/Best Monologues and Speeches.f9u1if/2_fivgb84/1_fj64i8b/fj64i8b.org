I have not read either of those fics, but they sound brilliant. Definitely adding the Hawaii Five-0 one to the list.

Iruka sounds like a familiar name (though I think that's an Avatar/Korra character?), but I don't really know much about Naruto aside from Vegeta having a ridiculous name. Would I, as a Naruto neophyte, be able to keep up with your fic, or would I have to see some of the series first?
