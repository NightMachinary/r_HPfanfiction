For most of the fic, you could get by with just having watched the first episode (or read the first chapter), since that's the biggest place Iruka's featured. A lot of the terminology would be less confusing having watched through the first ten or so episodes (shorter than it sounds if you skip past the copious recap at the start of most episodes) or read the first couple volumes of the manga.

That, plus occasional references to the wiki, should leave at least most of the Naruto-content easy enough to follow, though you'd have to read/watch a bit further to encounter most of the characters that are referenced. Then again, the first couple seasons / first few volumes are most of the series's best content anyway.
