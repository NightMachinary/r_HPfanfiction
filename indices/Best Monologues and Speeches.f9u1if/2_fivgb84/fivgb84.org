There's a really insightful bit in, of all things, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10836553/6/Harry-Five-0][Harry Five-O]]:

  "I can't believe anyone would do this to him, why?" She practically wailed.

  Harry conjured a small sofa and sat her down with him.

  "Before I was born there was a seer. Someone who would sometimes see glimpses of the future... prophecies." Harry told her. "She prophesied about someone being born who would be able to defeat the Dark Lord. This Dark Lord was killing and torturing people because he enjoyed it.

  "About a year later, I was born. I fulfilled part of the prophecy simply because I was born 'as the seventh month dies'." He said with finger-quotes. "The Dark Lord heard part of the prophecy and knew of my birth. He came to my home and killed my father whilst he tried to give my mother time to get us away... but he just breezed through, killing my dad.

  "When he reached my bedroom where my mother was hiding with me, she begged him to leave me be. But he killed her without a thought. Then he tried to kill me."

  Harry lifted his fringe to display his scar. "This is all I have left of that night. The curse backfired and destroyed his body and completed another part of the prophecy that said 'he will mark him as his equal'.

  "That just left the final part of the prophecy. 'Neither can live whilst the other survives.'

  "Now... you could say that it was prophesied and meant to be and blame the whole thing on fate or destiny. But really it boils down to the fact that the Dark Lord was a bastard who should have been strangled at birth. Unfortunately there were no prophecies about him back then.

  "I suffered a lot from the time I was fifteen months old until I moved to America a few years ago. Each and every person who inflicted that suffering on me did so for the same reason: Power.

  "For some it was monetary power, others, political power. The worst did it because they enjoyed the feeling of power they got from hurting and controlling others.

  "The reason I am telling you this story is because Ian was killed for the same reason. Power. It could be the money, the influence he had over young people like you, or it could be that some stupid idiot felt threatened by him and they wanted to take back a non-existent imagined power.

  "Ian is gone. It is going to hurt for a bit. But when all is said and done you will be able to look back on the time he spent in your life and the time you spent in his and smile and laugh and tell your friends and family about those good times. But for now, focus on finishing his case and remember to lean on the rest of us."

It was the inspiration for a vaguely similar speech in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12498125/31/Umino-Iruka-and-the-Will-of-Fire][one of my own fics]]:

  "Why did he do that?" Harry's voice was faint, small.

  "Power," Iruka answered. "Ever since they took custody of you, all three Dursleys had a lot of power over you. For a man like Vernon, and I've seen plenty of them before, power is one of their greatest cravings. Some rise to high positions where they have tremendous power, but some end up lower on the ladder. They're always aware of the fact that there's someone above them, someone that has power over them, and it chafes worse than sandpaper underwear. To have someone like you available, someone over whom he could exercise near-absolute power, would have been intoxicating for such a man."

  "The first problem that cropped up was magic. Ever since last summer, he'd been feeling the threat of magic-users hanging over him. That was a kind of power he couldn't match, couldn't overcome, so it left him scared. He also had to worry about whether /you/ would have that power when you came back, and take his power away. Instead, /I/ took his power away at that first meeting, and I did it inside his home, one of the places where he should feel safest and most secure and powerful. The day after your birthday, he tried to exercise power over you, and I stopped him with an even greater show of power, again making him feel weak and helpless in his own home."

  "His fear from that incident kept him at bay, until today. I don't know what tipped the scales, but somehow his hate, anger, and most importantly his need to retake his power overcame his fear of me. Most likely, after killing or incapacitating me, he'd have called in the police and told them I forced my way into his home and threatened him. Then, once I was out of the way, his attention would have turned to you. There's no telling how exactly he would have reasserted his power over you, but the cupboard would probably have been part of it; almost certainly, he'd have tried to keep you from returning to Hogwarts."

There are a few monologues/lectures in my fic, probably as a result of my own tendency to lecture.
