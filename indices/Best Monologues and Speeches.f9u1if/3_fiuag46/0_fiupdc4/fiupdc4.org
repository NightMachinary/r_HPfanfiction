Oooh. That's nicely threatening. Very reminiscent of some of the more... vengeful fantasy literature out there.

From the summary, he's met a weird fuckin' Goddess, but I suppose 35,000 words of paedophilia is tolerable for a good speech (Harry being 15 in '96 when Sirius dies). Is the romance as... unfortunate as the premise? I'm guessing from a T-rating it's not too... vivid or explicit.

EDIT - In rereading that sounded way more aggressive and disappointed than I intended, so I thought I'd add this to say that I'm thoroughly grateful for your rec and just questioning whether the fic is viable for me. No aggression intended.
