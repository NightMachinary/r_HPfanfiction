You might enjoy a one-shot of mine, if you haven't read it already. It is a crossover with the first book of the Incarnations of Immortality series, On a Pale Horse. You should be able to follow most/all of it even without having read any of Incarnations series, but you'd probably enjoy it more if you've read both series.

(You can also find it by the same name at AO3, if you prefer). Hope you like it!
