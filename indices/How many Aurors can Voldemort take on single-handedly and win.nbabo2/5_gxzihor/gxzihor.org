It depends on the skill of said aurors. I would imagine he would have trouble with 4 or 5 Kingsley's, though he might take down 10 Dawlishes with little sweat.

The thing is, when fighting large numbers, long sustained fights against big numbers are difficult. Those 10 Dawlishes might find an opening at some point, the key is in how quickly can Voldemort incapacitate opponents. Opponents who are good at dodging and staying in the field are more of a threat than those with low defense.
