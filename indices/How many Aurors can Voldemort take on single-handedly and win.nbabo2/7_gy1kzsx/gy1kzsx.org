A good way to answer this question is to reframe it.

"How many soldiers can a normal wizard take on single-handedly and win?"

The reason why this is useful is simple. The Statute exists. That Statute must exist for a reason. We already know that non-magicals have a significantly greater population than magicals, even at the time the Statute was enacted; the flintlock ignition system was a thing in guns by then, making them more reliable. So the only conclusion at the time the Statute was enacted was that magicals were /not/ confident that they'd win in an all out conflict with non-magicals. (I'm not really going to comment on who would win between the two, but I will say, no matter who does win, both sides would likely take heavy, and perhaps devastating, losses for that win).

With over three hundred years of firearms developments, not to mention tactics, it'd be safe to say that against a similar number of non-magicals as you expect Voldemort to be against Aurors, that normal wizard would be toast. Those non-magical soldiers might take heavy losses to achieve that, but all the same, that wizard would not survive an encounter with up to 100 trained soldiers.

Back to the question at hand then.

Voldemort against 100 aurors, Voldemort loses.\\
He has knowledge of advanced dark magics, and he has power to back that up. But he is also against Aurors who are, ostensibly, 'Dark Wizard Catchers', which is literally one the first descriptions applied to 'Auror' in canon. 'Dark Wizard Catchers' therefore implies that they are trained to deal with dark wizards, and have ways to either mitigate dark magic being used on them, or knowledge of dark magics enough to directly combat dark magics being applied against them.

Those Aurors also have numerical superiority, which is a quality on its own. For Voldemort to win, he has to kill or incapacitate /all/ of his opponents. But only one of those Aurors has to get a lucky hit in. Given that Voldemort has been shown to hold his own against only three combatants (Kingsley, McGonagall and Slughorn), we can assume that his ability to combat multiple opponents is finite, even if he's willing to use area effect spells. This means that there are way more Auror's in this fight than Voldemort can reasonably deal with.

In short, a combination of dark wizard combat specialisation, and numerical superiority would result in Voldemort's defeat. Though I would grant that those Auror's would likely suffer heavy losses for their win.
