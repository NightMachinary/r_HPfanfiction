The thing with Voldemort is that, while he is undeniably a great duelist (he takes on the three most powerful good guys alive at the of DH and wins and he is on par with Dumbledore with Elder Wand and draws), but it's just not Voldemort's style. A lot of the fanon doesn't seem to realize that Voldemort is extremely secretive and he was like that even as a kid. He relies on stealth tactics and inspiring fear. Despite being quick to kill, I think his worst fate would be ruling over a throne of corpses because then there would be no one to fear or admire him.

However, I think that if he'd go against the whole Auror department, he would probably take them one by one or force them in a situation where they'd die. I don't think he'd cast a mass destruction spell because that would draw too much attention to him. Might even elicit a response from ICW. Besides the only mass destruction spell we see in canon is Fiendfyre but that's very volatile and hard to control and I think that that's why most mentally functional people avoid it.
