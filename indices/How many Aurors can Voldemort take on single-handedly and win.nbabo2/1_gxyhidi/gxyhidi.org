Flying doesn't stop people from casting spells at him., unless he's so high up that no spells can reach him, in which case he shouldn't be able to damage the aurors either.

Setting that aside, the 100 aurors would win-- at least one of the is bound to hit him with an AK. He'd likely kill a bunch of them too. But the overwhelming force should just pound him with spells until one hits.
