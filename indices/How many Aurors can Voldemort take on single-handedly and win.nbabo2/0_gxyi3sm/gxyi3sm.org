  I assume that a total number of Aurors should be around less than 100 for the British Ministry of Magic.

First of all, I believe you are really overestimating the total number of Auros in Magical Britain. We can't know for sure since Rowling, just like with the total wizards population, didn't give us a clear number (is 3000, 5000, or even 20 000 . . . ?), but I still think the Aurors should be a really limited force.

In fanfics, some people like to compare Auror to "Magical Cop", but their job is in fact a little more complicated than that. In Canon, an Auror job is both to arrest Dark Wizards, and to protect VIP. A good example of that is Dudley who was first charged to arrest Sirius Black, and later asked to protect the Muggle PM during the war. Other, more "mundane" tasks are taken over by over Offices of the Ministry of Magic (Magical Patrol, Misuse of Mugle Artifact Office . . .). Hell, even the arrestation of Dark Wizard may not be the job of the Auror (who would just have to find them) depending of your opinion about Hit Wizards (separate Office, or 1st version of Aurors before Rowling coined the term?).

Anyways, my point is that Auror are an elitve force, who probably have very limited number. I personally believe that they are around 15 to 20 during the war.

​

Now, concerning your question, if we assume that the Death Eater are, in term of power, comparable to the Aurors (by taking the Battle of the DoM as an example since Aurors/ Ex Aurors made up around half of the Order's during the Battle), and that Voldemort is also around the same power than Dumbledore (as seen by their duel), then we can say that the Aurors would cope against Voldemort just as well as the Death Eater against Dumbledore.

During the Battle of the DoM, the Death Eaters didn't even try to fight. The second Dumbledore arrived, they knew they were fucked and tried (unsuccessfully) to escape. I believe the same situation would apply in a Auror Vs Voldemort fight, with a maybe even worse defeat because, unlike Dumbledore, Voldemort would not even take the time to arrest them and would just use murder.

Now of course, the number of Aurors (and their willingness to fight) may change things a bit (10 motivated Aurors would last longer than 3 terrified ones). But even if they put up a good fight, I don't think the totality of the Auror Office would be enough to take down Voldemort. Their only hope would be to last long enough for some help to arrive.

​

One problem to my theory would be Kingsley who, with the help of McGonagall and Slughorn, managed to hold Voldemort back during the Battle of Hogwarts. But not only did they lose in the end, I also assume that he only manage to last as long because of Harry's protection after his Sacrifice.

​

Tldr : I don't think there are enough Auror in Magical Britain to win against Voldemort.
