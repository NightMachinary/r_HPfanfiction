1. We don't know, because we have no good data on the effectiveness of different battle charms, so we can just guestimate. One fact we have is that aside from Dumbledore (which is not a good measure), we know that joined force of Kingsley/Slughorn/McGonagall got him to stall in the last battle as well as joined force of Luna/Hermione/Ginny was not quickly overpowered by Bellatrix. Of course, we don't know how these duels would end, because both of them were interrupted before their conclusion.

2. I don't think those overpowered charms like Fiendfyre are of much use inside of the building and amongst the people. They are as useful having A-Bomb in the building.
