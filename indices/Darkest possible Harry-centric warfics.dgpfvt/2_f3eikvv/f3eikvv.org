/Probably/ not what you're wanting really, but to me when I think of "dark, Harry-centric, warfic" I think of linkffn(7539141)

In case the bot gets fucky, that's Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma, by Matt Silver.

So to clarify, he's not dark really but the fic itself is pretty dark in tone from what I remember.
