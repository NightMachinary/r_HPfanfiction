Doesn't exist... A few months ago, my requirement was that he be apathetic to everyone and power hungry like Leylin Farlier but these kinds of fics don't exist(not at all what you were looking for but quite similar, I think).For good reason too, since usually a story needs multiple central characters to progress.

On that note, I have noticed that when I wanted to read stories with this premise, I was going through a tough period of life(addiction to anime, fanfics etc; isolation from people). This may be totally unrelated but if you are too then I wish you the best of luck :)
