That may or may not be the /ideal/ solution, but that doesn't mean that expelling him isn't also reasonable. I'm not sure that speaking to him would have accomplished anything. It seems as though he hasn't really learnt the lesson even decades later as a man well into adulthood.

Whatever his intentions were, he still hid and raised an infamously deadly magical creature in a school.

How do you think a normal boarding school would react to a comparable situation? I'm pretty sure a kid could get expelled for keeping a cat, nevermind something actually deadly and illegal like a highly venomous snake or spider.
