I've tried this in the past, but it was way too similar in pacing, and tropes as a lot of other indy!Harry fics. While I might have liked it in the past, i've read too many stories like this before. Still thanks for the suggestion, and if you have any others that aren't quite so...you know, please link it.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
