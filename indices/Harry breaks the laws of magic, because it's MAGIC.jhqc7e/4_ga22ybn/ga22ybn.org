[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]] is a four part completed series. It takes a while but Harry develops a very unique form of magic that I haven't seen elsewhere. It is my favorite fic of all time.

I also recommend [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833?view_adult=true][Life skills outside the curriculum]] by the same author. Harry runs away before his Hogwarts letter comes and develops his own style of magic (different than previous). Absolutely love this one. It's complete and 66k words.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is a oneshot and clocks in at 8k words but it is incredibly singular. I don't know that I've read anything similar and the less you know going in the better

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][blood crest]] is a WIP that is still regularly updated. This delves into necromancy. It's dark and funny. I also loathe following works in progress (abandonment issues), but I make an exception for this one.

However, I think the best answer for your request is this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]. The protagonist literally throws back her head and laughs at the laws of magic. This one is also a WIP that is still being updated.

I hope you enjoy!
