One, we don't actually truly know that. We're discovering whole new things about the universe everyday. Two, I don't f****** care. Like you yourself just stated, most settings have hard limits, but not the best. LOTR's magic system for example has no real defined hard limits. They just have different methods to achieve different goals. Most magic systems actually in general don't really have hard limits now that I think about it. They have forbidden branches, spells, and such, but give me just five decent fantasy stories that have hard limits. I'll wait.
