Also, now that I think about it, why should I care about your opinion. I'm not asking you to write a story, nor am I asking you to stay here. What I requested here has zero bearing on you. Why do you care so much about what I want, and why are you in the HPFanfiction sub if you cared whether magic is real, or not. I'm not asking for a story based in the real world, i'm asking for a fantasy story. So 'magic is not real' means jack here. I feel like you're being obtrusive for the sake of it. Why?
