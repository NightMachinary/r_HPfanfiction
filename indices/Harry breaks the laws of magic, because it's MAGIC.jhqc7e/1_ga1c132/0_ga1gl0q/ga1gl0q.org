I'm not saying there shouldn't be a system, but it should be a system of growth. The MC can't pull powers out of his/her ass, but that the power itself doesn't really have limits beyond the pursuit of understanding, and knowledge. He/she couldn't just straight up fly, but with enough dedication to study, and power requirements, they eventually could. Magic should be limitless with possibilities, but you should have to learn how like any good magic system.
