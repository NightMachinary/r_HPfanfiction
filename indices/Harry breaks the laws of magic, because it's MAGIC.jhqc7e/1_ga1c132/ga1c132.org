the problem is a setting without rules generally makes the reader lose interest because if the charcter can pull any power out of his ass at anytime where is the tension.

Rules add structure to the universe, we know what characters can and can't do.

as fair as magic systems goes JK's is actually quite loose compared to most. there are plenty with fair more defined rules.
