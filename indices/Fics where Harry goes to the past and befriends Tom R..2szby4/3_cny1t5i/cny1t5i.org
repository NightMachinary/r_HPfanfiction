[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1103246/chapters/2219054][Fate's Favorite]] is the other way around [TMR coming to Harry's time but really it's a continuation of Harry being in his time. Tom's just a clingy bastard] and the author declares it is not slash....though the sequel is...and so is a lot of fan versions but I digress. Very deep characterization of Tom and the horcruxes and what separates him from Voldemort.
