[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]] is the best one I can think of. Writing gets better as it goes on and Tom Riddle is written /very/ well. I don't know if you count their relationship as 'friendship' though, since they are mostly trying to use and one-up each other behind the facade of friendliness (at least from what I remember).
