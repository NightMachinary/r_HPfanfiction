My favorite one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10272040/1/47-Days-to-Change-a-translation][47 Days to Change]]. Harry goes back in the past to try to adopt Tom Riddle in the hopes that it would change him, it doesn't though. Tom is a twisted psychopath, but he manages to be manipulative enough to hide it from Harry. It's pretty dark and realistic. Harry battles between his need to kill the little boy and his natural protective instinct not to kill the little boy. It's the only story I've ever read that accurately portrays Tom and doesn't romanticize him as only needing "one good friend."

Now, I will say up to the very last chapter there is no slash and it's still awhile off. It's supposed to happen in the future ~sometime~ but in a dark, twisted kind of obsession kind of way, not romantic. The story is actually already completed, but not fully translated yet, so there's not too much of a fear of it being unfinished forever. Despite that, because of it's quality and good characterizations, I think it's worth reading regardless. It's almost like a slice of life type story so there's no real cliffhanger or mystery left at its current ending spot, so I actually think it's fine reading as is.

This story actually ruined other Tom Riddle stories for me because they make him too good or friendly.
