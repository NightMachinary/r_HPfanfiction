If you use an Android phone, check out Codex Reader ([[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qan.fiction]]). It's one of the more reliable ones I've found, and always maintains position.

Supports FF.net, AO3, and Fictionpress IIRC.

Hasn't been updated in forever, and has ad support, but it's fairly good. Sadly, no syncing between devices or anything, nor exporting your library.

Another option is to use Calibre (a cool ebook library manager, [[https://calibre-ebook.com/]]), with FanFicFare (a fanfiction downloader plugin, [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221]]), then sync to your phone or e-reader (if you have one).
