One of the major benefits to this is that you can also get an app* on your Kindle to create Kindle Collections based on tags in Calibre, so you can easily sort your FF if you so desire (or keep your FF separated from your original fiction so you don't have to sort through 100+ FF ebooks to find a novel)

*The app is called LibrarianSync. Only downside is you'll need to jailbreak your kindle to do so. If you're interested, check out the MobileRead forums for instructions on how to JB your Kindle, install KUAL, and install LibrarianSync. Only took me about an hour and a half one afternoon and was 100% worth it.
