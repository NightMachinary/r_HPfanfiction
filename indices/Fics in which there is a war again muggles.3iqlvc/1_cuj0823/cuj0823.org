linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) is a post-DH fic where muggles strike first and eliminate almost all the wizards. The last of them escape in a spaceship. It kind of fits your requirements, in that wizard/muggle conflict is central to the story, but there is also a lot of wizard/wizard conflict afterwards.
