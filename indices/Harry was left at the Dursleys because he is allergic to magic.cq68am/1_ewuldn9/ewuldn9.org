There was actually a Terry Pratchett-like series by Craig Shaw Gardner which started with a book called a Malady of Magics, where the wizard master of the main character, his apprentice, was allergic to magic. So he sneezed whenever he performed a spell. It was quite funny and one of the first fantasy books I've ever read.

Harry doesn't need to die, just sneeze like an allergic person who enters a cat's home.

It could be made into a funny oneshot.
