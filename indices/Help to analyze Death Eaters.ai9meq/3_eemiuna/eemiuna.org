Don't they literally get pissed and go attack some muggles in the Quidditch World Cup?

I am not entirely sure what military tactics you expect them to employ. They charge in and throw spells. The enemy holds their line and throws spells back.

I haven't seen any "strategy" of any sorts in the books except for the maneuvering to gain allies, and even them it was mostly approaching some monsters and saying "ay lmao lets go kill muggles and blood traitors. I swear I won't turn on you later, despite my ideology of pureblood supremacy and how everyone else is impure and worthless", gaining the allegiance of giants, acromantulas and werewolves somehow, considering that the death eaters were massive bigots.
