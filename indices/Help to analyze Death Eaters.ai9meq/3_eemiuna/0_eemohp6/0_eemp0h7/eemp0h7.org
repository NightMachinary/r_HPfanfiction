Yeah, but you can literally count those guys in one hand. And most of them spent years in Azkaban, so they aren't all there in the head (not that they were before).

There is a difference between subterfuge and military tactics. Crouch Jr. was a decent infiltrator (despite the fact that he kept taking swigs in front of everyone) but that is all they showed of him.

I stand by what I said that there is not really a single moment in the original works were "strategy" was really used in a fight situation.

There was the eventual plan to trick each other, but it usually went downhill and they winged it.
