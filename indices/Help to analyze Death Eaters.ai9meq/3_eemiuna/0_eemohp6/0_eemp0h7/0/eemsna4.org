I'm not saying it's shown; what I'm saying is that it's /implied/, by way of a "true" Death Eater like Barty considering the World Cup attackers pathetic shadows of their former selves, that the attack on the World Cub is not a good standard from which to extrapolate the likely behavior of First War-era Death Eaters.

As for Barty's frequent swigs, I take that to be "hiding in plain sight". He had to do it so often it was unlikely he'd never be caught, so might as well make a habit of being seen drinking foul-smelling ale in public, and no one will be the wiser if they see you hurriedly gulping down a flask of /something/ at an inappropriate time.
