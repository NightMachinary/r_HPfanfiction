But those are the decadent post-Voldemort Death Eaters who are just trying to have a spot of "fun" without seriously trying to learn the War. Barty Crouch Jr, who on the other hand is much more concerned with actually upholding his Master's legacy, keeping the old ways alive, and if possible even ready the world for V's return, is very vocal that these so-called Death Eaters are unworthy of the name.
