I wasn't thinking of the "civil war" as between the Order and the Death Eaters, but rather as between the /Ministry/ and the Death Eaters. Crouch Senior's Aurors were authorized to use Unforgivables, which I think goes to show they weren't messing around. I imagine the casualties were a lot more numerous on both /these/ sides than they were from the Order/Death Eater skirmishes.
