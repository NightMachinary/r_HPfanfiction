Not really. They staged a coup and took the Ministry in an afternoon. The Order might claim otherwise, but they were defeated and forced into hiding that day. There were no open battles or large-scale acts of sabotage. The Muggleborn commission was not bombed, Azkaban not assaulted, Death Eaters not hunted. All the order managed was a radio show and some form of militia which could be called upon for an uprising. They were the Resistance or Armia Krajowa, not the Red Army slugging it out with the Germans in Stalingrad.
