The Nazis tried a coup first. The fought in the streets in the 1920s. Hitler was even sent to prison after the coup failed. They had uniforms and classified people according to their blood. And once they took the power - which came with oppressing the opposition and murdering rivals - they started an all-out war. But most important: They started a genocide, as did the Death Eaters. Really, trying to treat the Death Eaters as mere neo-Nazis or KKK-members is wrong - they are the real deal wizard Nazis.
