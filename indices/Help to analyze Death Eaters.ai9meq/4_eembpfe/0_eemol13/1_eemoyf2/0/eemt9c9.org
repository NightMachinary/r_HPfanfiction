Oh, they're certainly more like Nazis than they are like the KKK --- the KKK comparison is, I think, more accurate to speak of the post-Voldemort, decadent Death Eaters as seen at the World Cup.

What I'm saying however, is that while there are heavy parallels, they're not /quite/ Nazis either; a coup and a takeover are two different things, even if the end results look basically the same, for example.

Mostly, I don't think Lord Voldemort ever maintained pretenses of being the legitimate government of the British Wizarding people, in the way Hitler claimed (and, rather likely, /believed/) he was doing what was best for Germany's interests. To my mind, Voldemort just made it clear that he was a living war machine and he was going to Sauron the heck out of England whatever you did, so you might as well join him... and there might be something in it for you and your causes if you did, too.

The Death Eaters were also not organized like a military, as far as we know --- wizarding "armies" never are, at the end of the day. The closest Muggle equivalents are cultists, but that's not really on the mark either, and neither is the frequently-cited "terrorists" comparsion. They're just... they're Dark Wizards. It just doesn't exist in the Muggle world.
