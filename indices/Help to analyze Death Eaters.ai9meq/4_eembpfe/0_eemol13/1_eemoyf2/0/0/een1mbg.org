I think the best comparison would be the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi streetfighting gang of the late 20s and 30s, who used terror tactics, intimidation, hits on undesirable stores (like you see in Diagon in HBP) and generally assaulting their opponents. The police and justice system often turned a blind eye because they were sympathetic to the cause or afraid of defiling them. And you see the Ministry do just that.
