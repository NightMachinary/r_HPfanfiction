Everyone and their mother compares them to Nazis, but they're not. They've really got nothing in common other than having a case of the Big Racism, and even then, not in the same way. As far as I can tell, they're closer to the KKK in ideology, and prior to coming into power, structured like a drug cartel or some other minor organized crime syndicate. I don't know any perfect fits off the top of my head, but I'd start by looking into white nationalist gangs for their internal dynamics, and drug cartels for their political and social influence, as well as their military tactics.
