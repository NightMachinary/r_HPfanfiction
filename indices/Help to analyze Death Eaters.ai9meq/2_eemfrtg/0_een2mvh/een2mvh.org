The whole Muggleborn commission and its "scientific" and legal bases are a ripoff of the NÃ¼rnberg Laws (1935) and the underlying Social-Darwinism.

The overall tactics used by the Death Eaters are very similar to the Sturmabteilung.

The Snatcher Squads are a mixture between Gestapo and SD, or SS squads sweeping occupied territories.

The failed first attempt and lax punishment are parallels to the Hitler-Ludendorf Coup of 1923.

There are way more parallels beyond "Big Racism"
