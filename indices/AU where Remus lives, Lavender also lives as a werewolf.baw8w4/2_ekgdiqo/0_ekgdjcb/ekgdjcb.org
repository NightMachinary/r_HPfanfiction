  Harry Potter is screwed.With a penchant for Firewhiskey and late-night parties, he had no idea that he would find a handsome man in his bed the next morning, when he wakes up; already late for his first day at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies as a Healer trainee. He also had no idea that his mom's ex-boyfriend would have an axe to grind, the most eager girl would follow him around like she'd been hit with a Permanent Sticking Charm, or that the handsome man in his bed that morning was his boss, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Head of Spell Damage.Like I said, Harry Potter is screwed.
