  Joke aside, he could start protecting his sister from the three muggles attacking her, thus preventing his father from being sent to Azkaban.

  After that, tere's the whole Grindelwald part.He could be more cautious around Gellert, maybe trying to temper the man and his world domination plans.

Changing anything from Dumbledore's past has the potential to wreck the entire plot :

- If Albus protects his sister from the Muggles, his father doesn't go to Azkaban and Albus isn't treated as an outsider when he arrives at Hogwarts (which may change his relation with Elphias Doge).
- If Ariana isn't "ill", she doesn't kill her mother and Albus doesn't have to return home after his 7th Year to take care of the family, letting him go to a world trip and thus, not meeting Grindelwald.
- If Albus manage to stop Grindelwald before he does too much damages (either by vanquishing him or convincing him), he isn't treated as a "Saviour" like in Canon and may have less powers.
- Finding Tom Riddle earlier than in Canon may ends up with a magically raised Voldemort, just as ambitious but without the problem of being a thought Muggleborn.
