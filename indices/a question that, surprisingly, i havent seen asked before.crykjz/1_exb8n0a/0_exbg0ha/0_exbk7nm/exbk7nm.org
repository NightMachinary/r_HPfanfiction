Idk if you're serious or not, but the horcrux didn't move from the basin. Harry tried to touch it while it was in there, but couldn't. I doubt very much that Voldemort would place a deadly curse on one and place another in an enchanted basin full of a hallucinogenic with an invisible barrier surrounded by inferi in cave on a rock that was damn near impossible to reach and forget about a summoning charm. He's arrogant, but not so stupid.
