It was said that Ministry of Magic regulated and routinely inspected chicken coop in order to avoid Basilisk breeding. There might be not be any decent number of chicken produce in Britain or the ones that existed are kept under strict control.

For an individual wizard it might be because of the difficulty on handling and manage the creature. We don't know for certain how quick will Basilisk grow overtime. Considering that Norberta grow from mere hatchling to young baby dragon in under a year it might be possible that Basilisk is the same. When they grow big enough they will causing ruckus and be noticeable. Even with slow metabolism of snake. Apparently only parselmouth can control their metabolism.

Imperius might be used but it is uncertain if it will hold overtime besides it didn't take much for the handler to get killed or petrified easily.

There are probably Basilisk that may escaping to wilderness either because the handler is incapable or unavailable though considering crowing from rooster fatally injure them, then yeah not a big chance they live in wilderness. The one that grow big enough will be easily noticeable anyway.
