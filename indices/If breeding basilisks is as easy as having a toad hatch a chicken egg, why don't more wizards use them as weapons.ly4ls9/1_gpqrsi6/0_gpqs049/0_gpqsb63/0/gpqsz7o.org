This.

There was a story about a wizard named [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Eldon_Elsrickle][Eldon Elsrickle]] who owned a Nundu as security for his home since it was a small cub while he snuck to steal from wizarding homes, keeping it sedated with the Stunning charm while he's at home.

Then, when the Anti-Alohamora spell was invented, he went home angry and forgot to reapply the Stun spell and got killed by the Nundu.

There's also the difficulty of casting the Imperious curse. Casting the curse on a spider is vastly different from casting on a very dangerous beast like the basilisk.
