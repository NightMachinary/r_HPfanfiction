I think the process is not as easy as it seems. I think hatching a basilisk is like rocket science, you can have the basic ingridients, but in order to get the desired outcome there might be a lot of control process and knowledge involved.

The chicken egg and toad should match according to some obscure requirement that may people can't even comprehend let alone get a matching pair.

After obtaining the pair you might need to wait for perfect planet alignments and then you need to control the position and timing of toad and egg, even a small deviation would result in a disaster, of course you need to calculate the timing. You also might need to prepare difficuilt potions and rituals to achieve this control structure.

I think for Parslemouths this would be easier, as they somehow have an instinctive knowledge of these things.
