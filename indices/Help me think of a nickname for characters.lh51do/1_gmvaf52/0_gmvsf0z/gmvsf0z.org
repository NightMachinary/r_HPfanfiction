Eh, firecracker isn't biting enough for a British style nickname, it doesn't really take the piss like it's supposed to. They might call her a ‘Dementor' as she's a ginger with ‘no soul'.

With the Marauder style nickname, again you've kind of got to be careful. They are supposed to take the piss. I see too many authors try and make the names cool. Your nickname in general isn't supposed to be cool, its supposed to be ridiculous.

For instance, if Ginny's animagus form was a cheetah, the nickname might be ‘Miss Spots' If it's a larger bird, it might be ‘Miss Beaky' For an owl, ‘Miss Hooty' And for a songbird, like a chaffinch or a robin, it might be ‘Breakfast' or ‘Snack' or Miss Tweety.
