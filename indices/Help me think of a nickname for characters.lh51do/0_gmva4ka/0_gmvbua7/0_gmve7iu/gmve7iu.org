In that case, how old are Ginny and Ron when the Marauders meet them and how old are the Marauders? And also Harry's relationship with the Weasleys at first meeting as well and what he may have told the Marauders about Ron and Ginny.

If, say time travel was some how involved and teenagers marauders witnessed Ginny during the first summer Harry was there, I could see them calling her Butterdish" but I can't see older, more mature Marauders calling a kid that. But, assuming Lily has told James and Co. Muggle fairytales, I can see adult Marauders using "Little Red Ridinghood" as a possible nickname. If they met Ginny for the first time in Harry's 5th year, I can see firecracker as suggested by someone else being used by either young or old marauders.

For Ron, I can see the marauders giving him a mocking nickname based on his undying support for the Chudley Cannons or a more respectful one based on his skill in chess.
