I like Draco Malfoy, King of the House Elves [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/287633]] They sort of start out as helpless victims but get to the point they are pretty self reliant.

"After the war, Draco finds his own path toward redemption, with a little help from his major domo. "

*Dobby House Elf and the Popular Culture*

Harry makes the mistake of letting people around an impressionable poor house elf. Dobby takes his obsessions a little too seriously. Rating for violence. Yes, violence. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6443341/1/Dobby-House-Elf-and-the-Popular-Culture]] it gets a little strange but still fun.
