I was honestly thinking as I started to read your title that this was really not a big deal as I've seen so many of these...then I hit 3k words and was like...wait, what?

I'm honestly impressed I managed to get through this without hurling. They've taken the most tired and stale tropes and somehow made them actively worse.

I miss the time I was reading storylines like this ten plus years ago when they were fresh, and talented fanfiction authors were turning their hand to them and writing epics.

Edit: Also, how did they misspell their own title? That's literally the easiest part to get right!
