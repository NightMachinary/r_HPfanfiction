I know. I can believe a greater good Dumbledore, him being the oldest, and wisest in just about any room would ensure that about anyone. I can even believe a manipulative Dumbledore, mostly because that's canon, although it all turns out alright in the end, and most people are manipulative to a degree, whether it's guilt tripping someone to go shopping with you to changing lives, we all do it. I just can't believe in an egomaniac Dumbledore, or an evil Dumbledore. He had his problems like all great leaders, and maybe it could have been done better, or differently. In the end it all worked out though.

I personally like Dumbledore, but i've read a lot of anti-Dumbledore fanfic, because it's honestly interesting to see what Harry would do when he has no old, and wise mentor. Granted i've also read the garbage ones like robst(to my everlasting shame) as well.
