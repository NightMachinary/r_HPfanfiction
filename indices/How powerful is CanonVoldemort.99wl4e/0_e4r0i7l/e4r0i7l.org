Well you have a literary dilemma. If he's too powerful, he can't be defeated by Harry. Harry's unfortunately the Everyman. He might have wealth, luck, Love Magic, and a few friends on his side, but he doesn't really have much talent cannon wise to help him other than his bravery and empathy. That is his strength and his special power, but it does stretch believability. The horcrux hunt in itself has a lot of plot holes but I think it was supposed to follow the Hero's Journey and ancient myths like Jason and the Argonauts which is at odds with the magical realism and the casual humor of the first half of the series. I watched an op ed that said that the series is supposed to be a subversion if the fantasy trope of the Chosen One, and it is, but putting it in the context of a somewhat realistic war is kind of jarring.
