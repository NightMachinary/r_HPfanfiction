Voldemort is pretty powerful. But at the end of the day, he has to aim his wand towards someone to kill him. I don't think he was nerfed when fighting Harry. Resurrected Voldemort fought Harry:

At the end of GoF, when Harry never gave them a line of sight to kill him

At the end of DH, when Harry "cheated", because he suspected the Elder Wand wasn't going to work for Voldemort and would instead try to work for Harry

That's it. Those are all the times Resurrected Voldemort and Harry fought each other
