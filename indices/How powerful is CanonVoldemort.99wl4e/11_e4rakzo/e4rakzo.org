I am pretty sure that Voldemort is way more powerful than Dumbledore, considering that Dumbledore, despite having more knowledge than Voldemort and wielding the Elder Wand, still didn't manage to defeat him. So Voldemort is, at least in my opinion the most powerful wizard alive. On the other side it is a bit hard to compare Voldemort to the characters from other universes, mostly because it is hard to hypothesize how HP magic works in contrast to other fantastic powers. For example the killing curse is an unstoppable one hit kill that, coupled with apparition, would give Voldemort an incredible advantage against any Jedi or Sith but if magic acts like a form of energy then it would be incredibly easy even for an average Jedi to defeat him considering that lightsabers can rebound energy hits and Jedi train to stop blaster bolts which travel way faster than spells.
