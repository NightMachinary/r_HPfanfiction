Your bit about the curse on the DADA is brilliant btw. So true.

You forgot to mention the Taboo on his name, which how do you even make a general spell that allows you to be alerted to the location of a person for simply saying a word. Also according to HP.wikia it simultaneously weakens any protective spells around the speaker?!?
