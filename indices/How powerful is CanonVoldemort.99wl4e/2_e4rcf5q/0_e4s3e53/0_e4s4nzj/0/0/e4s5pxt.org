Not that I know of. Otherwise Dumbledore would at some point concede that being afraid to say his name is valid (as opposed to "fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.")

In fact, in Deathly Hallows it's said that the taboo is intended to specifically target Order members who are brave enough to say his name.

Before Harry was born, he didn't control the ministry, no.

Still, powerful wizards are OP af. Dumbledore single-handedly defeats a group of "elite" Death-Eaters. And Riddle keeps his ground against McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn while using a want that doesn't obey him and while not being able to harm them. The difference between top hier and second tier is immense.
