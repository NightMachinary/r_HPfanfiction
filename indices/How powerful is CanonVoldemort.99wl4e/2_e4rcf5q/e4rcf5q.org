He apparently is very powerful and is proficient in magical research and feats no other can.

For example he is capable of unaided flight, something which is considered impossible by conventional magical knowledge. Not even Dumbledore was able to do that.

He also performed the single most powerful feat of magic in the HP-Universe, which is the curse on the DADA position. It's literally a spell that somehow warps fate to achieve a certain outcome. Dumbledore couldn't solve that for decades, even with the help of people proficient in the dark arts like Snape. (There's of course the question of the limits of that curse, and why he can't just make a similar "Let me win"-curse so that he can sit back and watch his enemies fail.)

He is also a legilimens so can see his what his opponent is about to do.

However, he is still severely lacking because, as [[/u/Redhotlipstik]] points out, regular guy Harry must be able to defeat him. It's similar to the problem that somehow a group of students can hold their ground against battle-hardened death-eaters. Also, I'd say that Rowling lacks the, let's call it "criminal creativity" of a villain. She doesn't have them (or the good guys) plot out realistic plans.

Edit: An important question for the "who would win" scenarios would be the potency of the killing curse. Many superpowered beings (for example in MCU) can take severe punishment, be it lightning, physical impact, magic, whatnot. If the killing curse would insta-kill a being like Thanos, that would increase Riddle's standing in the lists by a lot.
