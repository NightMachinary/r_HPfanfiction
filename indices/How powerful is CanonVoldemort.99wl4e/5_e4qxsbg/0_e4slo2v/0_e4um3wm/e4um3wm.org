  Voldemort probably kills all the Avengers
#+end_quote

Extremely unlikely. I'd give Riddle a fair shot at a number of them, but not even close to all the Avengers. Just off your post -

Iron Man

#+begin_quote
  his magic disrupts the Iron Man Suit, plus he can transfigure it and Tony inside into a crushed ball of alloys and meat
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure in canon it was magic and electricity that clashed and given that, there is almost zero chance that the suit isn't shielded against electrical interference given how easy IM would be taken down without a shielding.

Being turned into a crushed ball, extremely doubtful. IM is moving at Mach speeds, there is no indication that Riddle is reacting quickly enough.

Thor

#+begin_quote
  Thor while super powerful is still mortal and this vulnerable to a AK
#+end_quote

Unknown. You can assume that, but it can just as easily be assumed that AK could be shrugged off by an Asgardian because the fact is, there is not enough information about how AK works on non-humans.

Cap - agreed, but Caps 2nd best bet would probably his speed. He is that much faster than an average human being, and nothing indicates Riddle is working at superhuman speeds.

Widow - agreed, but she's more of an assassin so there's a pretty fair shot that she wouldn't go toe to toe against Riddle in a fair fight unless she absolutely had to.

Vision

#+begin_quote
  Vision IS tech so just trying to fight Riddle will destroy him
#+end_quote

No chance it is that easy. Again its almost guaranteed Vision is shielded from any type of electric disruption, otherwise any villain fires up EMP and Vision is down.

SW - she has way more control in Infinity Wars. At that point, she has a very good chance at taking down Riddle.

Ant-Man - Probably a wash.

Hulk

#+begin_quote
  Hulk's regenerative abilities don't protect him from a AK to his 11 foot tall face while he is screaming about puny mages
#+end_quote

Unknown. Similar problem with Thor. Hulk is no longer just a human, he is something beyond and there just isn't enough information about AK other than it being soul magic and OHKO to humans.

Strange - Portals OP honestly. Portals are fairly quick to achieve, and with Strange's intellect, I wouldn't doubt he would just portal whatever Riddle sends, right back at him.

#+begin_quote
  People forget that ALL Potter Mages have Reality Manipulation skills on a localized level
#+end_quote

Yea there is localized Reality Manipulation, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a system/rule in place for magic. It isn't whatever the wizards want to do, they can. MCUs biggest advantage over Potterverse is most likely speed. All the spell slinging in the world won't save them if they cannot hit.
