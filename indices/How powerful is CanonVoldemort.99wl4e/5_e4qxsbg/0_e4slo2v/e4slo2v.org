Actually outside of Dr. Strange Voldemort probably kills all the Avengers, his magic disrupts the Iron Man Suit, plus he can transfigure it and Tony inside into a crushed ball of alloys and meat, Thor while super powerful is still mortal and this vulnerable to a AK, plus Voldemort has displayed more fluid and abusable magic than even Loki, Cap is a super human but still human, his best trick against Riddle is a shield throw but if Riddle snipes it with anything including Transfiguration, Charms, just blast it away from Rodgers. Rodgers falls to any spell Riddle can think of. Worst for Black widow since she is long lived but not a Super human, she basically falls like any well trained wizard against Voldemort. Vision IS tech so just trying to fight Riddle will destroy him, Scarlet Witch's Hex Bolts could beat him if she could hit Riddle but in the MCU she doesn't have the control over her abilities nor does she seem to actually have Chaos Magic of her comic counter part. Ant Man maybe again and he seems to have the best time against Riddle, but summoning spiders and then a wave of fire once He has revealed himself would do away with the micro hero. Hulk? Hulk's regenerative abilities don't protect him from a AK to his 11 foot tall face while he is screaming about puny mages

In fact if the Time Stone wasn't in the Eye of Agamotto the battle between Strange and Riddle would be much closer.

People forget that ALL Potter Mages have Reality Manipulation skills on a localized level, that is the inherent BASIS of their power. Add onto that the most talented and powerful mage in the entire series without the limitations of morals or fears and 70 years to turn that academic talent into combat skill. Voldemort lost to Harry because of Deus Ex Machina that doesn't make Him weak in fact it doesn't undercut but implies that without that power, Harry would of lost.
