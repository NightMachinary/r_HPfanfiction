I can't think of any fantasy setting that would struggle against Voldemort tbh. MCU is a bad example, because it's probably easier to think in terms of 'who wouldn't smash him'. His threat, doesn't really come from his strength though. It's not his magical prowess that made him feared.

He created a terrorist organization and turned the status quo over night.For years he killed and pillaged, and accumulated a very influential circle of supporters. It was his political might that created his legend. So I wouldn't say that canon Voldemort needed to be overpowered to work, he did the job Rowling intended him to do just fine.
