He got what I refer to as the HP nerf, where he gets nerfed down to HP's levels, in Book 7. That's literally the only way he could lose.

In Book 5, a glimmer of his power is shown, when he casually waltzes into the Ministry, duels Dumbledore to a standstill (AD has nearly a century of experience on TR, so under normal circumstances, the odds would be heavily stacked against TR, even in spite of the artificial body and enhancements that TR has no doubt done), casually possesses HP, then casually rips through the wards and protections around the Ministry like wet paper when he and Bellatrix escape.

After all that, he falls to a fucking 2nd year spell. Yeah, Rowling definitely gave him the HP nerf.

In a more realistic setting, he would have allowed himself to be disarmed, then taken out his Yew wand, and cursed the shit out of everyone there.

Against characters from other series', well, as long as TR had his horcruxes, he was invulnerable. They might be able to surprise him once and kill him, maybe, but that would just turn him into a wraith. Can't kill a wraith, or trap one (as far as canon).
