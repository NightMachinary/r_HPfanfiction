Voldemort's flaws lie in his arrogance and pride rather than his magical ability.

He has some significantly impressive magical feats-dueling Dumbledore to a standstill, unassisted flight, 7 Horcruxes, duelling three expert wizards, weird magical arm (which is impressive considering wizards don't really seem to have prosthetics of this versatility before).

On the other hand, I don't really see him matching up well against characters from other universes. HP magic is versatile but their bodies are human and are pretty breakable at the end of the day.
