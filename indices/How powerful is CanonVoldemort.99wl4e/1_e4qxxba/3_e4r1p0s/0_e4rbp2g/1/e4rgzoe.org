I mean, a Lee Enfield or similar shouldn't be an issue. But do you honestly believe people would want to advance across an open field [[https://youtu.be/8E4qA50I4hI?t=44s][while being shot at with an MG-42 at 1200 rounds per minute]], shield charm or not. And even if a shield charm could stop that (which I doubt), it prevents the caster from using magic offensively.

So you need two or three machine guns to suppress the opposition and then pick them off with regular magic while they are taking cover. Throw in a mortar or two and RPGs (everything easily available in Eastern Europe/Russia), and you have a situation where magic might stop muggle weapons, but at the same time the weapons pin the enemy down (and ammo isn't an issue with transfiguration).
