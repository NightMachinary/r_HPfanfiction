It's not about if you can move, it's about that you don't want to move. If you hear what any soldier has to say on that matter, they'll all tell you that if you are under machine gun fire, you throw yourself in the mud and then try to squeeze an inch deeper. And remember, bullets can ricochet from certain surfaces, so you need to cover more than just the shooter himself.
