I don't doubt that at all, if anything I have read and seen is remotetly accurate. But once wizards are used to the concept that shouldn't be so much of an issue-they'd be able to defend at that point. Bullets can ricochet-but wizards can transfigure/conjure temporary defences against that.

True, but I was actually imagining muggles in that scenario. But yeah, anti-apparation wards would stop that.

Edit: I think the interesting thing is, unless I am wrong there's some strong indication in Fanstastic Beasts that wizards fought in WW1, so we might actually see what exactly wizards were doing in that war and how magic matches up-but I see them having significant advantages that mean that wands are still the preferred choice.
