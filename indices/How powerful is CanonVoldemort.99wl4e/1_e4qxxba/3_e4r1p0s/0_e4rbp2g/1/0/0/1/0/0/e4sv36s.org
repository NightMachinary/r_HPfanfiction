You do Know about the rangeless movement spell called Apparition right, that would allow a wizard once they got a bead on their shooter to magically appear behind a Sniper... Right I mean you have read the series and realize that.

Now you going to RE post the Anti Apparition thing, but then you forget that even wards or 'localized spells cuz wards are Fanon' still have a range, meaning that even if a wizard bounces off that ward they still have a general idea where their are being shot from, a little fiendfire to kill everything in a local area and no more Sniper

Stop thinking of this like a call of duty game and think more D&D, your enemies can and do break the laws of physics Every God damned second of every God damned day by existing, if you lack the surprise factor guns can be rendered useless due to their one dimensional ability to fling metal at super Sonic speeds. Once that metal is no longer a threat to a well prepared wizard the gun is as useful as farting into your hand and Hadoken-ing it in their face
