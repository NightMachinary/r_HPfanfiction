I was thinking more along the lines of Harry, Hermione and Ron making a short side trip to Russia/Ukraine/Romania/ex Yugoslavia, use their gold to buy a few crates of surplus cold war gear and use that to improve their odds during the Battle of Hogwarts (or, the Hogwarts Turkey Shoot). Hundreds of yards of open ground, attacking uphill with little cover, Anti Tank Weapons making short work of giants and giant spiders while machine guns and mortars tear through the Death Eater ranks. Of course, the others use their wands to throw in blasting curses, Sectumsempra and whatever else is good at killing in the general direction of the Death Eaters far below.
