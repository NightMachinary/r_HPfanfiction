I am assuming Battle of Hogwarts, which means the Hogwarts wards prevent apparation, the defenders have a magically fortified position and the approach is across hundreds of yards of open ground. I'm not sure if Fiendfyre can be directed across those distances, even by Voldemort. And lets be honest, the only reason the Battle of Hogwarts wasn't a one sided massacre was because Rowling has no idea about combat of any kind. I mean, "anyone who hears a mandrake's scream dies" would make one of them enough to kill all Death Eaters. The DA raining area of effect spells from the battlements on the Death Eaters charging while safe from return fire by the aforementioned battlements.

D&D is irrelevant if you insist on something as stupid as a charge across open ground. There was no method to Voldemort's plan. No infiltration, no cunning. Hell, a good ol' cavalry charge like at Vienna 1683 would have torn through his ranks.
