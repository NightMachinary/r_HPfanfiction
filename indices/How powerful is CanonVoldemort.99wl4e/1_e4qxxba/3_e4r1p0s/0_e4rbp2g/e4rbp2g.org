Ordinary firearms vs. a wizard would never work though-their shields stop projectiles. Only instance it might work is if you were caught by surprise-but in any instance where wizards start using firearms they're not going to be able to be caught by surprise for long.

But yeah, I was imagining that most other universe tech would be a lot more affective.
