Actually, HP wizards have a fair bit more durability than their muggle cousins in canon. Quidditch is a good example, with the Irish seeker ploughing into the ground at 200 ks per hour and just getting a concussion out of the deal.

Also, remember that Voldemort's body is artificial by book 4 and, since we rarely get to see him fight, we don't have a solid idea of what he's capable of. The one time he faced off against Dumbledore in the books the two lit up the atrium like the bastard lovechild of a fireworks display and an artillery barrage. Yet, in the middle of all that, Voldie possesses Potter like it's nothing and then escapes the field despite who knows what protections activating to stop him.

I reckon that, if we had a better idea of his abilities, those vs matchup would look very different. Not 'curbstomps the God Emperor of Mankind like a bitch' different, but different nonetheless.
