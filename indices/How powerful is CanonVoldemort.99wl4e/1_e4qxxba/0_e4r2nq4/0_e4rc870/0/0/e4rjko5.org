Voldemort in Doctor Who would be interesting. I don't think he'd do well at all-again universe too big, but things like Daleks and Cybermen would be hard to defeat maybe, even by magic. Cybermen's advantage are in numbers, and Daleks have weapons that are supremely effective-one hit and Voldemort's vaporized. Also time travel.
