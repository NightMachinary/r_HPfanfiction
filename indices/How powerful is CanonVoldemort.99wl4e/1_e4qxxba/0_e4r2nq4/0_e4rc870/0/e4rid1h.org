Fiendfyre+Urban environment = not-so-happy fun times.

Actually, I think that he would fit quite nicely into Worm. You have to admit that he would make a kickass gang leader in Brockton Bay or Chicago and he wouldn't really be quite as OP as he would be in other 'hero' universes.

Aside from that, if perils of the warp isn't a thing for him, the Warhammer Fantasy World. As a minor lord, he would have all the muggles he could ever want to mistreat, an endless army of badasses to fight against and Dark Lords to out-edge.

The Avatar universe is a bit hit-and-miss though. I mean, humans, he'd be great against. Spirits and such would be way trickier for him.

Hey, Tom Riddle masquerading as The Avatar sounds like a great premise for a trolling fic.

Every non-HP YA ever would see him win. Well, maybe not PJO, but that's only because Gods tend to get pissy when complete randos show up to insta-murder their kids.

Dresden and Supernatural are a No. With people actively looking to murder people like him and the forces of heaven & hell becoming interested in owning/killing him, I doubt that he would last long.

Another Universe he could handily fit into? Early versions of D&D, which inspired such classics as Berserk, fantasy fuckin' Vietnam and Goblin Slayer, to name a few. Again, plenty of non-magical assholes to kill/enthrall/etc, lots of enemies and more than a few casual scrubs that dare to call themselves Dark Lords. Likelihood of permadeath is high there, because phylacteries are a thing.

But the big scifi ones such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo, Mass Effect, BSG and WH40k are on the nope list as far as Voldemort's concerned. Too big, too much clarktech, so very many opportunities for a higher being/giant space octopus/precursor of humanity to come along and just paste his soul across n dimensions.

The Culture series and Stargate are exceptions. I could see him doing very well in those.

Voldemort's new horcrux being a GSV's controlling Mind would be awesome and scary.

... Hey, this is kinda fun!
