I think a problem in assessing HP-magic strength is that we never hear about the real limits. Most notably if there is some form of "mana" or magical energy that gets exhausted. So if there is a difference between using "wingardium leviosa" on a feather, on a car, or a comet. Similarly the difference between summoning a small flame or a fire inferno. The books are mostly silent on /what it takes/ to cast a spell.
