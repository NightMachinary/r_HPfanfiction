But many of those upper echelon of power would be considered minor Deities at worst many of whom has no concept of dying. Any world where actual Deities exist and are confirmed are kinda over weighted in comparison mostly due to these Deities having what equates to infinite weight in comparison, no human no matter how strong is stronger than a literally Deity.
