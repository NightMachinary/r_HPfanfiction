I never said anything about Harry D or the rest of the wizards, though I do wonder how he would face up against someone like The Merlin or even a holy sword wielder.

I agree with you completely that against most wizards in the HD world, Voldemort would win no doubt. The rules of HP magic are simply more open ended and spells happen much faster in general.

I was specifically talking about the big guys in the HD world. Mab, Titania, Thor, Freakin' Santa Claus, etc etc.

In terms of upper limits of power, there's really just no question that the HD world does it bigger.
