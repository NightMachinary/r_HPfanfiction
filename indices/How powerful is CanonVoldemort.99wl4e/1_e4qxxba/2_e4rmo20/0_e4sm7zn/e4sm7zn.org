But before Mab gets there he has probably already killed Harry D after figuring out his invocation, everything Dresden does isn't out of the realm of The abilities for Potter Mages and in fact some feats have been outdone by lesser Mages in Hogwarts. The additional fact that Dresden uses multiple foci to achieve the effects he does and Voldemort can do the same with just his wand plus has the broken reality warping spells of Potterdom its a simple leap in logic that Voldemort could kill Dresden, and if he can kill the Main Character he is at least above most characters we know Dresden can defeat.

Mab being a interdimentiomal being who we know and accept to be a fairy being able to kill Voldemort doesn't change that Voldemort can probably kill most human Mages on earth, it's like saying that Since Voldemort can't kill a Outer God that he can't take over the human world of The Cthulhu mythos
