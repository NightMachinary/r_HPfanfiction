Vs debates forums often apply limits to abilities depending on the highest feats and try to apply physics to fictional universes as much as they can. One example of this is the shield charm. They limit it by the highest amount of energy it has shown to "tank" in the books. It can't take into account that the sheild charm may be immune to any non-magical attacks because that is considered a No Limits Fallacy. Different universes may have conflicting laws, so vs debates often has rules to take care of that, but as a result it can conflict with the rules of a setting. Thus, Voldemort's power really depends on how you interpret the Harry Potter magic system to work.
