Ah that way. Well the trace was already there the minitery just "controls it"

Being able to tear trough the protections because now they can use all the spells they want to without the minestery intervening. This is actually metioned in the book.

This one is true the castle reports to the Headmaster but i don't think thats magical power that is just the castle following it's boss.
