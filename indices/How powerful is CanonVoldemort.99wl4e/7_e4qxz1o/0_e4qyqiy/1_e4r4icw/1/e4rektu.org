  It certainly explains how Dumbledore can create a Portkey inside Hogwarts, or the reasoning for his ability to apparate inside in the HBP movie (take that one as tentative at best though).

In the books, Dumbledore is able to lift the anti-apparition feature of the Great Hall so that the students can learn. A lot of features of magical "machines" seem to work with root-access mechanics.
