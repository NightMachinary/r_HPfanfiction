I'd like to imagine that it's because his horcruxs are being destroyed. Like he's already insane because they are separate from his body, but he can still draw power from them when he needs too. So as his mind/soul is being torn to shreds and destroyed, his magic is following it into death.

Alternatively I like the idea that his rebirth sapped a lot of his magical ability. Either because it was a magic heavy spell that needed long to constantly fed magic to maintain it's self, or because it had been so long since he last used magic that he wasn't at the same caliber as he was before
