Confectionary Chronicles is great. It's a crossover with Supernatural, but I know bugger all about that show (Gay Angel and they meet Death a few times) and I've been able to follow and enjoy the story. I know quite a bit about mythology and theology though, so I'm not entirely sure how good my knowledge-measurement is there. It's definitely fun, and Hermione becomes quite the Trickster with her magic.
