This reply really irks me, especially the 'he could've nipped the Voldemort issue in the bud whenever he wanted' despite Dumbledore being the one wizard Voldemort feared, he and Voldemort seemed to be on par,

And there's us zero evidence of Voldemorts immortality aka horcruxes until chamber of secrets, only dumbledore's suspicions because of the mystery of Halloween 1981. If you look at how each horcruxe is found all are circumstantial to harry except the lake obviously, so how could Dumbledore possibly have found them.
