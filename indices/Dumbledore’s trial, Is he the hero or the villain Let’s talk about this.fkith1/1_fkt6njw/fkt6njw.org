If the person who's pronouncing judgement on Dumbledore is affected adversely by Dumbledore's numerous schemes, then he's the villain. If not, he's the hero.

Personally, I lean towards the villain side. He had numerous chances to nip Voldemort in the bud, not to mention all the leeway he gives the Slytherins. His treatment of his comrades in the Order is downright sickening, same with his handling of Draco's plot to murder him. He decides to ignore the execution of Crouch Jr, which happened while he held a very exalted position in the Wizengamot and the ICW, and pretend like it never happened - that is a complete breakdown of law and order.

His shenanigans involving the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Triwizard Tournament are...well, we've heard that several times. His hiring choices also leave a lot to be desired.

This is my view, and I know it's quite biased against him. He's written the way he is because this is a children's story, but in real life, someone like him would be at the centre of a lot of controversy.
