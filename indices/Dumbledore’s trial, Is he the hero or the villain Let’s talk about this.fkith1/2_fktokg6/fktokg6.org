dumbledore is not a villain but he's not a hero either he's used to having positions of power and seems to view himself as the master of a game he is manipulative but he genuinely believes he is right the road to hell is paved with good intentions and sometimes dumbledore genuinely seams to chose good options but a lot of the time he does things the easy way without looking for a second opinion he often does things for a majority rather than a single person he is very secretive and he seems to have complete power over the order he believes to often in second chances he always thinks he has the moral high ground he doesn't understand wars and so he probably shouldn't be leading the war usually wars don't stop when one person is killed he doesn't understand that in wars people die he isn't great at strategy his plans usually could fall through if one thing happened differently if he is afraid of something he will hold off till he has no other choice this is my annalisis of albus dumbledore once you read fanfiction dumbledore will never again be the sparkly eyed headmaster who can do no wrong from your childhood
