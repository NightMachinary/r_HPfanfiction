This will explain far better than I ever could ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/]]). In short, Dumbledore is man who cared about Harry so much, he was unable to act for the greater good, a philosophy he had long since eschewed. He was an unbelievably brave man.

Some notable quotes from the above post are included.

  Snape being the proficient Legilimens that he is, it is interesting that Dumbledore would close his eyes in front of him and especially that Rowling would mention the status of Dumbledore's eyes three times in the span of a single conversation. Dumbledore is brilliant at Occlumency and might be able to hide his thoughts from Snape, but not all magic is infallible, and so whatever Dumbledore feels the need to conceal is probably of the utmost importance and cannot risk Snape finding out.

  So what could he be concealing? We know that Dumbledore knows Harry will survive --- why not tell Snape? Besides the fact that Snape really doesn't need to know, it would be incredibly risky for another person to walk around with that knowledge. If it ever came back to Voldemort that he was unable to kill Harry, then Voldemort might have someone else kill him instead (in which case, Harry would die, because the protection from Lily in Voldemort's blood only counts if Voldemort is the one to kill him). What appears to be Dumbledore's nonchalance at Harry's death is actually an incredibly important moment in ensuring that Harry survives.

  A weakened Voldemort is an easier Voldemort to kill. Essentially, Dumbledore's plan not only gave Harry an option to survive, but made Voldemort infinitely weaker. It was the hardest thing Dumbledore ever had to do --- much harder than fighting Grindelwald. But he'd finally learned from his experience with Grindelwald and the mistakes he made with Harry. He wasn't going to wait years and watch people die like he'd done with Grindelwald. Despite his love for Harry, he finally did what was right rather than what was easy. He found a right answer in a situation with no right answer. He won the war, and not through force, not through dueling, but through /love/. Not through the abilities of Voldemort and Harry (for surely Voldemort would have won that way), but through the /choices/ he knew they each would make.
