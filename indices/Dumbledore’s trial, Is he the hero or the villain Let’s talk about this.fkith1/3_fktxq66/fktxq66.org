Dumbledore as a manipulative mastermind/villain is something I only heard about from fanfic readers. But there's that scene in canon where after Lily dies, Dumbledore tells Snape that Harry survived and has Lily's eyes and there's that 'you remember the shape of Lily Evans's eyes' bit. He does want to get Snape to help him. Those who dislike Dumbledore say he's manipulating him. Though someone actually said this wasn't true.Dumbledore is supposed to care about his students and yet he hires Lockhart to expose him. And so essentially he gets to use his position for his own ends. Exposing someone is all well and good, but students shouldn't suffer because of that. I think, and this is only my opinion, that he even hired Firens to put Umbridge in her place. This was sort of 'you're not going to tell me what I can and can't do, Dolores.' He even showed up in Remus's life when Dumbledore had something he wanted Remus to do. So he can do something good, but that isn't necessarily out of the kindness of his heart or care for the students. And there's the whole Draco issue. He let Draco go pretty far and had Ron died, he would have said oh I'm so sorry. I'm guessing he wanted to keep Snape who had given the unbreakable vow but still. I'm not entirely sure Dumbledore doesn't want to be in all those positions of power. After all, he pretty much does what he wants at that school. I think he knows he is smart and this has made him arrogant,' being cleverer than most men...' He doesn't give Harry enough info but nor does he tell his order members anything. But this last point is because it's a kids' book and they are the heroes. He definitely didn't want to be put in a position of being the one responsible for the fate of the wizarding world, but he isn't just a nice old man even if we set aside his unenviable position. He leaves Harry with the Dursleys and then lectures them in HbP. I was always so annoyed with him there as it's completely pointless to lecture them at that point. He comes across as very arrogant there, with the air of one being prepared to lecture people on the matters of life and have fun while doing so. I don't know about his further manipulation, though, as it's difficult to make sense of PS and his actions there.
