I am going to just copy paste an old bit I wrote on the matter of Dumbledore. IMO, he's an infinitely more complicated and interesting character than, say, Snape. He's actually Grey, not just shadowed charcoal like the latter.

I think the big problem with Dumbledore is that people fundamentally fail to understand the character. They either think that he's a moustache-twirling machiavellian secret villain, or that he's a doddering idealist fool.

The truth is neither. Dumbledore's character in my opinion is itself an inherent conflict. He is both an idealist and a pragmatist.

He would like to just be able to quietly run his school in peace. He believes himself unfit to rule more than that. But he also has never been able to bring himself to stay uninvolved, in anything, and in the fifty-odd years between Grindelwald's fall and Voldemort's return, he has the power and reputation to do essentially whatever the fuck pleases him.

So despite the fact that all he wants to do is be Headmaster, he has this feeling of obligation that he must choose to remain Chief Warlock, he must choose to remain Supreme Mugwump, because somebody else could have gotten it wrong.

But in so doing, he stretches himself too thin, which is why he has all these mistakes that people point to as evidence that he's incompetent or malicious. In truth, he just doesn't have enough hours in the day.
