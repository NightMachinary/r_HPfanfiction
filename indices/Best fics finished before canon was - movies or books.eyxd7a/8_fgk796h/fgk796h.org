Hard to explain the plot exactly (and it's been 9 years since I read them) - it was written in the Three-Year Summer as a post-Hogwarts fic where Harry and Hermione are adults and together and Ron has died in the battle that finished off Voldemort.

They don't feel aged except for the non-canon-compliance.

I don't believe they're online any more but I saved them [[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uotoxmvj95yazfg/AACX0ySbV-aREhKR9nVmpk2Ha?dl=0][here]]
