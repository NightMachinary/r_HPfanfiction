DrT has several stories that meet your criteria, assuming mc means male character, but they're hard to find.

[[https://ficwad.com/story/15333]] is The Saga of the White Warlock, you have to create an account on the site and log in but it's free. The character in question is a Runes professor who I think you will like.

[[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/drt/]] The first three stories on this page, the first being Relations so I think of it as the Relations series, has an older cousin of Harry's who has been unavailable to him for the first years of his life but comes into it the summer after 4th year, I believe. I think you will like him too.

All of DrT's stories are phenomenal and I maintain copies against the fear they will vanish completely because I reread his whole bibliography every year or two.
