Wellp, the killing curse as we know it needs to be cast at someone/thing alive and with sufficient hatred/wish to kill, right? So in order to create a shield you're describing it would both need a different emotional requirement as well as a different 'anchor' (open space or another spell as opposed to a being).. If you're writing a story, you could probably make some hand-wavy explanation how one becomes the other, otherwise it just sounds like a wholly new and different spell. But yeah, if we assume such a spell could be created, there's no reason it couldn't have been based on the killing curse.

Does remind me of a fanon shield I came across, though! In The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter on ffn there's a so called "depulso shield", which is a red barrier that disintegrates anything that comes into contact with it save for the person who cast it IIRC. It's never stopped the killing curse, but there's some charmed piece of jewellery that does, in the same series.
