I think it would work. The whole concept would not be that Harry is rejecting the fact that Sirius is dead. He would want the PAIN to stop. Sirius is the first death that Harry faces, and in my mind, that is his most intense moment. And while I agree that he needs to be able to eventually work through it, my Harry would hate that people feel pain. He would attempt to numb himself, and others in his quest to feel less hollow inside. That would be where he fell into darkness. Harry never really felt love, and when he did he had it ripped from him by a psycho bitch. (sorry Bella) So I want a harry that would react as if he lost the one thing he always wanted, followed by being told that his whole existence is simply to kill a man who wants him dead.
