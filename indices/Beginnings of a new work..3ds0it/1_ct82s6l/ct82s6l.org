For me one of the defining moments of Harry's strength of character was when he told Dumbledore that Sirius wouldn't want him to mope around. People die, at some point we all experience this one way or another. If your Harry can't deal with this it is more a sign of how weak and fragile he is. You can go and try, but to make this into good and believable story you need to work VERY hard on it ...
