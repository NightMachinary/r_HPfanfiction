Decent read, i would say. Use of Stable Time Loop was well done and i could see the development of the romance as realistic. The characterization and portrayal of Bellatrix was believable Nonethelass, the ending does suffer because it seemed that the author was too hasty in achieving the happily-ever-after ending where the Quartet defeated Voldemort after finally getting Hermione and Bellatrix together. The author should have heavily expanded on that dynamic with the addition of Bellatrix to the trio, especially since she went the Youth Potion Route like TGCWW. It probably would have been worthy of a seperate sequel in and of itself.

As a romance story it's ok. But i do feel that it could have more adventure elements and align closer to the general theme and atmosphere of the HP books.

Lastly, from what i remember, the writing had a little too much exposition and the wording was kinda basic but it was not a major turnoff.

However, TGCWW i feel is still the best Bellamione fic since it introduced me to the ship in the first place. Kinda sad that it does not have regular updates.

What other Bellamione fics do you like?
