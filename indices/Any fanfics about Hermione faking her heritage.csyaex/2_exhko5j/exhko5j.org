Unfortunately, I've never seen one about /Hermione/, but there are a few series where other female characters do the same that comes to mind, if you're looking to scratch that itch. T[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][he Pureblood Pretense]] is set in an AU world where only purebloods can attend Hogwarts, so half-blood femHarry with parents that are alive and no prophecy attached to her name switches places with Sirius Black's son, pretending to be a boy so she can go to school under his name. Fantastic series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12664453/1/A-Name-Is-An-Enigma][A Name is an Enigm]]a is a pretty good Sirius/OC series where OC has a common pureblood surname, is sorted in Slytherin, and decides to run with everyone's assumption on who her family is rather than admitting she's muggleborn. Which is a problem when a lot of her friends and classmates are deatheater recruits.
