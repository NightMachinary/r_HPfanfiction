So, godlike Harry with an attempt at a reasonable explanation, then turns into again and again type stuff which actually has a good explanation for being frikin op (being 600 years old with constant magical growth) and then does some weird shat to save the planet? Sounds fun

Sorry but I suck at writing a story that has any kind of base, if it's not completely out of my creativity I can't write shat

The biggest guideline I ever worked with was ”MC is attacked and survives with magic”
