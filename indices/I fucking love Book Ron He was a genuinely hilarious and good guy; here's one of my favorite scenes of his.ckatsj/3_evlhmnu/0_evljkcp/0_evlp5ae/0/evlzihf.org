One of my favorite Ron lines in fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry," said Hermione, keeping her voice low enough that it wouldn't carry across the room, "Cedric told us what happened in the maze."

  "Yeah, what were you playing at?" said Ron, mock-punching him in the shoulder. "Being all noble like that, letting pretty-boy Diggory tie with you."

  "I'm standing right here," said Cedric mildly.

  "I know, mate," said Ron. "You're hard to miss, being such a pretty-boy and all."
