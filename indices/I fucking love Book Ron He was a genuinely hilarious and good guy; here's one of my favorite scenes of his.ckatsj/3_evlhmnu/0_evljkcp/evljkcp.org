Well, granted, Ron is often depicted without real effort, but I think the point of Ron's character is that he's mostly a normal, decent bloke with faults (like his envious streak and lack of discipline). That IS canon. People usually blow it out of proportion though, and ignore his better traits like friendliness, readiness to defend his friends and such.

Â´People are usually blinded by a) fanon (it's actually Harry in canon who's the most prejudiced about Slytherins) and b) the movies in which the pathetic directors unnecessarily overplayed Hermione's role and character.
