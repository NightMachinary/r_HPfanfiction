With Hermione, it seems like she has two modes.

Rules are sacred, and rules are bullshit.

Because she's so pro-rules, so pro-authority, she doesn't have a proper sense of scale. She genuinely can't grasp why helping Hagrid with Norbert would be an acceptable violation of the rules, while setting a teacher on fire isn't.

As soon as that "rules are sacred" switch turns off, she goes all out.
