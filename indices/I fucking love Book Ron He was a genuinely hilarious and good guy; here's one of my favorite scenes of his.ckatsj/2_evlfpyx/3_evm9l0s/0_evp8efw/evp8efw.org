She really doesn't think about the implications of her actions in canon.

I mean, she's definitely ruthless. She lit Snape on fire, and she led Umbridge to a forest.

But look at Rita or Edgecombe. She stops Rita for a year, and she permanently scars Edgecombe for betraying them (even though she never used it as a deterrent.)

Definitely vindictive though.
