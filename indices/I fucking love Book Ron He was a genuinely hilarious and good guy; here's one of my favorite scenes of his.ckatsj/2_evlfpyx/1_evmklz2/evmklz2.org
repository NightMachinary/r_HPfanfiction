  He also immediately suggests killing the two Death Eaters in the cafe
#+end_quote

In fairness to Ron, this suggestion came during war time. The Death Eaters weren't in the cafe for a friendly duel or exchange ideas - they came to seize Harry for Voldemort to murder later, and Hermione and Ron would've inevitably been tortured and killed as well. Not to mention the fact that even if Harry, Ron, and Hermione are able to get away, those Death Eaters are certain to terrorize and harm /somebody/ (as many somebodies as they can, and probably targeting people very close to Ron), and how exactly is it righteous to leave open that possibility? Ron isn't really being ruthless, he's being pragmatic.

I understand the short-term strategic reasons behind leaving them alive, but sending two murderous enemy combatants back into the fray (in fine condition, no less) was not an ideal outcome, particularly long-term.
