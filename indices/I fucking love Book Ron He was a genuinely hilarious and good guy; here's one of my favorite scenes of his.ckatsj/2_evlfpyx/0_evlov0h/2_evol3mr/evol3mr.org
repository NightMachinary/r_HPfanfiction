It's really strange how so many fans have managed to kind of turn "fanon" into canon in a way---a sort of mandela effect where people believe shit that isn't at all supported in the books.

Your point is a prime example. Ron's a single guy, and Hermione physically attacks him and Lavender and slut shames Lavender for...dating...like any normal teenagers. I love Hermione and Ron, but both are deeply flawed and there's nothing in canon that suggests Ron would be abusive or bad towards her...if anything it suggest she would be awful to Ron.
