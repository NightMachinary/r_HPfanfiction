I think it's incredibly easy to side with Ron when you view things from his perspective. A lot of people never step outside of Harry's shoes long enough to empathize with other characters.

Fourth year? He didn't betray Harry. He was upset because he felt as if he was lied to and intentionally excluded. Horcruxes hunt? Harry didn't seem to care that Ron's family was I'm constant danger due to Ron's choice to go with him.

Whether right or wrong, I can never think of a time Ron's actions weren't justifiable.
