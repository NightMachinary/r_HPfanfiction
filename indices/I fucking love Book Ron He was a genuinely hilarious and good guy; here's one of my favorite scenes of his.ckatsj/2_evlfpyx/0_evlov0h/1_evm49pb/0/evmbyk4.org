I agree. I really empathized with Ron in his fourth year. I'm the youngest in my family and it honestly did feel like my parents loved my siblings more (which they confirmed later on in my life). So having a famous best friend who is a) loaded and does not want for anything in addition to be famous from birth and b) falls ass backward into these amazing, heroic opportunities would be REALLY hard.

Jealousy is a really natural emotion that I felt was accurate for Ron. Harry could have related if he tried.
