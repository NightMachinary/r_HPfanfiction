  She's super intelligent but has no knack for people

Intelligent. Super intelligent is a bit of a stretch. Rowling called her a borderline genius, and I like that explanation.

I dislike the character. She functions as exposition to keep the protagonist dumb. And she wasn't that competent to begin with.
