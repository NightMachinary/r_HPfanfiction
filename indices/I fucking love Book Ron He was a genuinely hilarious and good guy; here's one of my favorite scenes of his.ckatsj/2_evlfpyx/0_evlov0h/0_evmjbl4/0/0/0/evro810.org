I love this response.

That's why I dislike her as minister in Cursed Child.

I do get why Kingsley wasn't still Minister (you're getting awfully close to an Authoritarian Government doing that), but it just reads as meh fanfiction to have her become Minister. I think she'd be better than Fudge, but anything else? She shows absolutely no leadership during canon. Harry is the leader of the trio. Harry teaches the DA. Neville leads and organizes a fucking resistance against Death Eaters.

What does she do? She gets the DA started by spreading word of Harry teaching.
