Yes. Hermione is a dyed-in-the-wool, born bureaucrat. She loves rules and order and information, believes that if everyone else would just shut up and do what she says the world would be perfect, and after 7 books of literally being oppressed openly by every authority in her world she's still only marginally better at understanding that not everything can be a perfect, logical set of rules and steps that we never deviate from.

She'd make a wonderful Undersecretary, but a godawful Minister.
