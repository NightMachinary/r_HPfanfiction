Oh yeah.

Also, book 6 Ron had excellent insights on Hermione's views on things. Like the Prince's book for instance. Unfortunately, he also started thinking with his dick.

Abusive Ron is also a trope that makes no sense in canon, considering Hermione is the only one in that relationship who hit the other. Frankly, barring book 4, I actually tend to lean towards Ron in most of the arguments.

Edit: Fixed factually wrong information.
