  Lavender once put Daphne Greengrass in the hospital wing after Daphne called Hermione a mudblood

Book 6 Hermione was a bit nicer to Lavender than book 3 Hermione. Lavender's character is treated horribly in canon.

I'm glad you aren't buying in the Daphne Greengrass hype. I've read good fics with the canon OC, but that's in spite of the character.
