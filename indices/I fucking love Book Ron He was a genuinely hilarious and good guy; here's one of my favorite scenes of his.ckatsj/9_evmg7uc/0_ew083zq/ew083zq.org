Hermione might have been more loyal to Harry as a whole, but Ron was the one he loved spending time with. And Ron wasn't disloyal as peeved. He handled the situation in book 4 poorly and spent book 7 being affected by a horcrux.

But looking at the Ron and Hermione relationship, I don't think Hermione gives Ron enough credit, and actually treats him quite poorly. Book 1, while Ron was thoughtless to mention Hermione's lack of friends within earshot, he had a point. She was very condescending.

Book 2, she fawned on Lockhart. We'll save this for later.

Book 3, she ignored her pet trying to presumably eat Scabbers, dismissing Ron.

Book 4, while she was right to be mad at Ron for the Yule Ball, she was also wrong to call him out for admiring Fleur, as she did the exact same thing.

Book 5, look at her response to Ron becoming a prefect.

Book 6, she freaking attacks Ron with birds for daring to have fun with his girlfriend while she's sad.

Book 7... I have nothing on this front.

Ron was actually a pretty cool character, who just didn't a chance to shine. In the books or the movies, where Hermione steals all his parts.
