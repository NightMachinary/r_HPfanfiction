For the most part, I agree with this post. But I don't think the example you gave was good. Not when Ron was being a low effort guy in that scene. He gave away a gift he received, and yes, that was sweet of him to do, but it falls flat when you remember Harry actually went out of his way to free Dobby.

Better example of Ron's thoughtfulness would have been one of the scenes where he notices Hermione's breakdown in third year or one of the scenes he magnificently eases tension when Harry gets mad or upset.

Honestly, for all Hermione's claims that Ron has the emotional range of a spoon, Ron was adept at reading a situation. He understood his friends better than they understood each other or him. He was a great friend.

What he lacked was a plot purpose while he had narrative purpose. So, he was thought as the useless guy.

I really suggest anyone who thinks about rereading the series to pay close attention to Harry's thought process. He bases so many decisions on what Ron thinks. Theirs is truly a special relationship. Much more than one between canon couples. Bros forever.
