Tell me about it. I wrote a story where the cousin the Weasleys don't talk about was Rudy West, the father of Wally, and through extremely convenient coincidence Ron walked away from visiting the Wests with Speed powers.

The amount of crap I got for writing Ron as the story's hero still amazes me.
