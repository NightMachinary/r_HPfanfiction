I'm not that involved with ao3 but from what I know you could search ''no pairing'' at [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/search][this]] or at the ''Other tags to include'' in the filter section in the right at the screen in desktop mode if you want a specific tag.

Another solution is removing every possible pairing in the exclude section>relationships and/or with ''Other tags to exclude''.
