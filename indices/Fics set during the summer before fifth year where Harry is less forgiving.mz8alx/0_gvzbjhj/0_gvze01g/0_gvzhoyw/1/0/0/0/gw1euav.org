I'm not justifying in any way the Dursley's horrid treatment of Harry. But it's still not as bad as some fics make it look. That particular incident doesn't indicate that Harry is treated as a little more than a slave. If they want to go for blood, fic authors should pick on the request to groom the garden and then just getting sent to bed with some bread and cheese. Now that's abuse.
