A rather feeble work, written (oh god) 12 years ago.

â€‹

They're Hermione and the Loon

Yes, Hermione and the Loon

One is a genius, the other is too

They're both researching fools

Finding Dark Lord killing tools

They're kinky

They're Hermione and the Loon, 'oon, 'oon, 'oon,

'oon, 'oon, 'oon, 'oon, 'oon

Before each night is done

Their plan will be quite scary

By the dawning of the sun

They'll have had their way with Harry

They're Hermione and the Loon

Yes, Hermione and the Loon

Their twilight campaign

Is easy to explain

To prove their witchy worth

They'll de-Dark Lord the Earth

They're kinky.

They're Hermione and the Loon, 'oon, 'oon, 'oon,

'oon, 'oon, 'oon, 'oon, NARGLES!

In a dark corner of the Library, two witches were bent over ancient tomes

"Are you pondering what I'm pondering Luna?" asked the bushy-haired brunette

"I sure am Hermione," answered the slight blonde "but it seems to me that if the Gryffindor boys call Harry 'Tripod' for the reason we hope they do, wouldn't he pass out if he got an erection?"

"Well, yes Luna, but that can wait. I was referring to our plans for tonight."

"Oh poo." Said Luna, obviously not agreeing that Harry's erection could wait. "Then what do you want to do tonight Hermione?"

"The same thing we do every night Luna," Hermione said, her voice rising in a dramatic baritone. "Try to take over the school!"

Edit: gold for this? Thank you kind stranger with exceptionally low standards.
