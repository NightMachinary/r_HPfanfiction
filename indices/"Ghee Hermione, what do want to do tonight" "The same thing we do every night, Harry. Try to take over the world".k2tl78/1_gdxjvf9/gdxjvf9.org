"Attention, entire world! Hear my proclamation: I am Harry Potter, Emperor of the Magical Britannian Empire and your /only/ ruler!

Voldemort has surrendered to me. I am now in control of both the Horcruxes and the Deathly Hallows, and even the Order of the Phoenix no longer possesses the strength to oppose me now! If anyone dares to oppose my supreme authority, they shall know the devastating power of the Hallows. Those who could oppose my military rule no longer exist!

Yes, from this day, from this moment forward, the world belongs to me!

Harry Potter commands you: /Obey me, subjects!/ */OBEY ME, WORLD!/*/"/

"Um... what are you doing, mate?"

"Oh, nothing much. Just practicing a little speech."
