It seems like a mix, leaning more towards excuses. I've only read Chapter 34, though, but it seems more like a soul bond fic than anything else at first glance. I will say that Chapter 34 does deliver on the original request of no Weasley bashing.

They are in fourth year and refer to each other as their "mate." After Harry's name gets called by the Goblet magic forces him to propose to Hermione and she accepts. Fleur asks Cedric if this is typical for the "kitty couple" and he agrees, seeming tired of it. A group of their friends seems to have formed a, well, group to fight with them called "Chaos" and they all have "Warriors"-style cat nicknames and basilisk armor and meet up in the Chamber. Additionally, Ron is the one who organizes everyone to research the tournament and help Harry prepare and the twins are part of the group, too, so it does seem that it avoids Weasley bashing at first glance
