The Triwizard Tournament! I'm pretty sure 'Rigel Black' will be the name that pops out (since the TT is definitely taking place) and Archie and Harriet are going to FREAK trying to figure out if Archie is the one being compelled to compete.

Also, if the Quidditch Cup happens, I'm looking forward to seeing if vowed-to-silence and Quidditch-mad Flint is the first one who figures out that Harry is Rigel's replacement at school. He works with Quidditch so he'll probably get tickets to the Cup.
