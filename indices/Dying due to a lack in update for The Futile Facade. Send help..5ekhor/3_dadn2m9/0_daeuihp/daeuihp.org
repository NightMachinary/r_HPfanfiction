While I definitely don't think this fic is abandoned or likely to be abandoned in the near future, many fanfic authors are consistent, until they very suddenly aren't. By this I mean there are a lot of fics that are updated regularly for a long time, then the updates get infrequent, then the fic gets abandoned. Even authors who prior to this point had communicated regularly with their fans and where actively engaged in communicating progress.
