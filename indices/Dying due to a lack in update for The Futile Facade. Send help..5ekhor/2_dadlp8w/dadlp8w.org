Don't take this as me maliciously [[/r/gatekeeping]] here, but for real come talk to me when the fic you followed for 3 years through 600k words hasn't updated in 3 years. Or any of the other ~2400 fics that reached 100k words but are still incomplete and haven't been updated in over a year (Compare [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=100&s=1&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][total incomplete (~3500)]] to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=5&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=100&s=1&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][incomplete but updated this year (~1100)]] and for reference, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=100&s=2&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][total complete (~4000)]]) and I'd wager half of those ~1100 that did update this year will never update again. And that's just on ffnet. AND that's me being too lazy and too mobile to also check the 50k numbers which I imagine are even more skewed.

Sadly, even though many authors do their best to keep going, writing is fucking hard and keeping it up as an unpaid hobby amidst all of life's typical difficulties is often impossible. Muses and plots come and go, and though we pine so desperately for more, at least as many fics are abandoned as completed.

Anyway, I just wanted to remind everyone to be realistic in their expectations from authors especially in this case where the author has posted 5 chapters and 55k words in two months and then nothing but a minor bio update for over 5 months.

Be excited for what you have and what may happen next, but don't get your hopes too high and don't get angry when you have to move on.
