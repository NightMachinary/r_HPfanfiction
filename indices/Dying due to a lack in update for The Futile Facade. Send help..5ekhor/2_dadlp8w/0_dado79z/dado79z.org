I haven't yet had my dreams crushed by an abandoned fic, at least one that I am attached to - this is just an upcoming chapter that I believe is in its late editing stage. I can afford to pine when I'm 99% sure we'll get something within the month.

I'm certainly not angry, though. It'd be different if I approached it like, 'omgwtfbbq where is upd8 I will Kill Author Nao if I don't get it'. I get what you're saying. Despite my facetious title, though, I'm hyping here, not whining.
