Your punctuation was a bit odd, especially placing periods and question marks after the quotation marks.

But let's get to the more important part. I really liked the idea of repeating the boggart lesson with the Slytherins. I enjoyed reading Lupin's thoughts about Slytherin at the start of the story.

The boggarts were all quite serious. I liked the idea of Draco's boggart, as the love for their family is the one redeeming quality of the Malfoys, but I think it's more fitting of sixth year Draco than third year Draco. I'd generally expect some more "silly" boggarts from some of the third year students, for example from Crabbe or Goyle. Maybe you could have started with the funny ones, and gradually have made them more serious. Your characterization of Nott was very interesting and a bit terrifying. I didn't see that one coming.

The most important part is that the characterization was good and the premise of the story was interesting. Wording and flow will improve with practice.
