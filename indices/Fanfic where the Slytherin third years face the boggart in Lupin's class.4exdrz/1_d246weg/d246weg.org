Please work on your punctuation. Commas should go at the end of quotes like this:

#+begin_example
   "This is a really nice apple," he said.
#+end_example

You screw up your punctuation quite a lot, usually by not adding enough commas.

With a proofreader/beta/someone of the nature, your writing could certainly become fairly promising. But if I might be a bit brutally honest, right now the writing level isn't really high enough for me to read it as proper fiction- it kinda reads like it was written by an eighth grader.

If you want me to pick out some examples of where exactly you've gone wrong, I'd be happy to help.

As for the actual story itself, it's quite interesting, but it's really a little too short for me to say much.
