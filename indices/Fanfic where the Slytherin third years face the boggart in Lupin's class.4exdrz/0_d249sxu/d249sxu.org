Sadly it's not a good fic, there are serious problems with both style and substance.

Let's start with style, the writing is rather clunky and dry. This is serious problem here, because to write scenes with boggarts well, you need to convey characters' emotions and sadly you didn't manage to do that.

But let's not put style over substance. Fanfics allow to something new, that weren't in canon, I will even say more, there is no point to showing what we already seen. And this fic doesn't really show anything new. Of course we haven't seen Slytherin's boggarts earlier, but the fears aren't new and aren't interesting. There is also a crucial mistake. It's not Riddikulus spell that defeat's the boggart. It's laughter. And nobody in the whole fic laughed.

Generally, boggart encounters are hard to pull out well. They work better if we know more about character and their fear. The second thing is mentioned earlier matter of language. Fear is an emotion, and the writing needs to convey this emotion well enough to work.

But what really killed the emotional impact was sole focus on Lupin's thoughts. He was well prepared to face his fear, and even that face off was practically ignored. But the titular "skeletons" belonged to students, and showing their thoughts as they faced their own fears would give much needed substance to this fic. After all, we didn't have occasion to look into their thoughts in canon.

An example of what I think, is boggart encounters done right. There are probably better ones, but this show all crucial points.

  "Mister Goldstein!"

  As he approached, the flames transformed into a vision of a rabbi he'd known well -- only this man was looking at him with hate and disgust written on his face.

  M'khashephah lo tichayyah.

  The rabbi's form flickered, becoming one of his friends from childhood, a young girl who pointed an accusing finger at him.

  M'khashephah lo tichayyah.

  Again and again the form shifted, becoming each one of the many people he knew from synagogue.

  M'khashephah lo tichayyah.

  And they repeated those words -- those hateful hateful words that translated to "Thou shall not suffer a witch to live."

  Against them, what could he do? Raise his hand and cast a spell, thus revealing himself to be exactly what they accused him of being?

  He...he...

  ...but the point was rendered moot when he too was pulled away from the Boggart by a rope of enchanted light.

  (...)

  And so on and on it went until at last Matou Shinji was called to the front, with the Boggart taking the form of a wizened old man with a gnarled cane -- a man who was almost a shriveled, hairless version of Alastor Moody. He looked harmless enough, with olive-green kimono and a charcoal-grey haori, but there was a sense of malevolence and danger that radiated from every move the man made.

  "Useless," the man spat. "You are indeed a disgrace to the name of Makiri."

  "No."

  "You and your father both. No, you are worse. Your good-for-nothing father left an even more worthless son. The only one worthy of anything was your repl---"

  "Riddikulus!" Shinji snarled, as the shape before him changed, the old man's form catching fire as Matou Zouken screamed, strange, unnatural sounds issuing from his throat as he writhed and twisted and howled in the heat of the fire.

  And at the sight of his nightmare burning away to ash, Matou Shinji simply laughed and laughed and laughed.
