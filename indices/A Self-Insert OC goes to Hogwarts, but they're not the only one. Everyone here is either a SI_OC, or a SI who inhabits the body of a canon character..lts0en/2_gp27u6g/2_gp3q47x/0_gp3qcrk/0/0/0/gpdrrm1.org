Well, I finished it and I don't know what to think. The scattered nature of the story is a major reason why I don't like stories written by people who make it up as they go along.

There's elements that get brought up and then dropped and then the story just kinda ended.

Like, what was the point of everything involving him and Fleur? Luna and Daphne are in a relationship...and? You'd think Luna being either gay or bisexual in this universe would be an interesting plot point. Perhaps her relationship with Daphne would be explored further. Daphne was deeply unhappy with being found out and desperately didn't want anyone to know about her relationship.

Oh, so is there homophobia in this version of the HP universe? Maybe Daphne is in one of those marriage contracts or something and that's why she needs to keep this a secret? But then he just swears on his soul and magic and walks off.

Why have Luna appear so much if she wasn't going to play a major role? She kept getting screen time but what did any of it lead to? What about Lucy for that matter? So he apparently seduced her once, but he has no memory of doing it. He doesn't ever regain his memories and then he ends up with Tonks. Why is Lucy here?

Well, the author didn't mind devoting chapters to a romance that never went anywhere or having characters show up and drop in and out of the story, because there was no plan. So in hindsight, a lot of this story was filler, but it could have been important as it was being written.

The heavy fanon elements grated on me but it turns out this is a complete AU, so I didn't mind it as much. Like the idea of wizards only living a hundred years and some change. Can I really feel sorry for Harry or Hermione or these other worthless idiots if they have a cure for death being offered to them and they refuse to take it?

I don't think I've ever seen a story where the main character having a limited "magical core" wasn't eventually worked around. I always hated it that some people can be blatantly born better than others, but it really just comes down to a way to make Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort seem like total badasses.

I'm okay with wish fulfillment stories, but this one wasn't especially moving for me. So the guy has sex with loads of women but besides Tonks, the others get little development. He had a three way with the bar lady but then she just drops out of the story. He doesn't seem to care about any of them. I'm struggling to remember if he even told Tonks that he loves her at any point.

He has sex with Bellatrix, who is good apparently, but what's the point? He didn't immediately go and rescue Narcissa, nor did he take Bella with him when he went to go confront Voldemort. Why even have her be secretly good? She's only in this story to ride this dude's dick.

The main guy's personality wasn't especially gripping and he didn't seem to really stand for much of anything. He coasted along in life from one event to another. At least he was relatively smart, except when he needs to be stupid for dramatic effect or to push the plot along.

What even is his personality, anyways? He decided that after he defeated Voldemort and rendered him harmless, he'd kill every single Death Eater present...because? He showed the ability to stop time, and he could have taken them alive. Why's he a killer all of a sudden? He didn't go out of his way to murder anyone before this.

He had plenty of opportunities to kill Death Eaters and get away with it, but he chooses not to.

He just decides to kill all of these guys at that moment and claims he wasn't forged in the light. Okay...we gonna explore this element of his personality? No? Alright.

Same deal with the House elves. We don't see him actually change the Ministry or anything to give them rights or end abuse against them, he just buys a bunch of them and treats them fairly well. Despite having the ability to conjure infinite gold and he knows how corrupt the government is.

We see nothing about him changing the utterly monstrous marriage contracts that apparently warp people's personalities entirely and turn them into utterly horrific, sadistic monsters. No, he just fucks Bellatrix and then Narcissa is saved and then we see nothing else from this.

Why did Lucius get to live? Was it to spare Sirius the pain of breaking the contract? But apparently he's not truly evil, despite having handed the diary to Ginny and organized that little Death Eater raid during the world cup. And the fact that rather than go for freedom, he alerted Voldemort to the main character's presence so he and Tonks could be killed? What has he done to deserve to get off scot free?

Okay, author.

Again, why didn't they save Narcissa right away? Why even wait? Did Sirius not love this cousin as much as the other one?

We don't see anything about either of these women recovering from years of abuse and being trapped in their heads while their bodies went about doing awful shit. It could have been interesting to see how Narcissa treats Draco now. Does she even love him? He was conceived by rape after she was twisted into a completely different person. What does she think of him being a racist, bigoted little shit?

We'll never know. Wasted potential.

Loads of great ideas in this story, but terrible execution.

So much of this story was completely pointless and the author just threw in whatever ideas they thought were cool at the time.

Like that entire section with the new magical game. It's a hell of a lot better than Quidditch! It's pretty awesome! But totally irrelevant to the plot. You could cut out that entire section and nothing would change.

So I'd say before the reboot halfway through, the story was a 7/10.

Pretty kickass, the main character was on track to destroy Voldemort and his scientific mind was intriguing to read. Until he apparently killed himself somehow. The author decided that instead of ending the story and starting a new one with a similar premise, and even the same characters, to just redo it and keep going because he made the main character too powerful and wanted the story to follow the script of canon.

The second part is a 3/10.

At first it was implied he died going through a cabinet that's charmed to kill anything that enters it, but later it's stated that killing Voldemort too quickly causes the universe to implode. Somehow. It's not explained why this happens.

This doesn't lead to any sort of emotional conundrum with the main character acknowledging that many have to die to keep the "plot" on track who really shouldn't have. At the very least, Bertha and Barty Crouch Senior were killed and probably many others when the Death Eaters started to operate again.

The story takes a dive in quality until eventually the main character decides to just go kill Voldemort without telling anyone but Tonks, then nearly gets Tonks killed and then brings Harry over to kill Voldemort, and then it ends.

So it was certainly an interesting story, but it's a prime example of why you'd want to have some guidelines on where you're going and where you plan to end up.

I'm guessing the author reads a lot of HP fanfics and borrowed heavily from them for ideas for this one. Hence why there's so much stuff that doesn't serve any further purpose.
