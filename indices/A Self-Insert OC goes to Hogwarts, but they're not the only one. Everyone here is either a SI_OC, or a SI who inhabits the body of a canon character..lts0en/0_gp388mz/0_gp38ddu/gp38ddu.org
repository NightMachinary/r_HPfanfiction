Pomona Sprout liked to think of herself as unflappable. The rock upon which the House of Hufflepuff was maintained. Her matronly demeanor was simply one tool in her arsenal, one she carefully cultivated. There was no problem that couldn't be solved with teamwork, focus, and tons of gumption.

But... this...

This.

She was no longer unflappable. She was thoroughly flapped.

She'd barely remembered to draw breath for the past fifteen minutes, much less participate in the discussion. One of her little badgers, Kevin Entwhistle, had spent the past fifteen minutes ordering around Severus and the Headmaster! He demanded something called a "muffliato," which was apparently a form of privacy charm. How on earth on Muggle-born had heard of charm invented by Severus, she had no idea.

He'd then referenced Alastor Moody by first name, and ordered the Headmaster to apply enough privacy wards and charms to satisfy "that paranoid old cyclops."

When Albus had suggested retiring to his office to continue the discussion between just the two of them, Mr. Entwhistle had casually refused, asserted that he was merely acting as the spokesman for the group, and affirmed that collective bargaining was the bedrock of all meaningful social change.

There was something of a hub-bub going on amongst the children:

"Goddammit, Susan, shut the fuck up. You're speaking out of turn!"

"I told you, my name is Caleb. I don't care if I'm stuck in the body of an 11 year old girl."

Miss Abbot whacked the Bones girl on the back of the head hard enough to send a resounding smack through the nearly-empty Great Hall. Hannah then grabbed Susan's arms in her own and leaned forward, hissing something in ear.

"Thanks Hannah," Entwhistle continued.

Hefting a rat back and forth in his hands, he went on: "Okay, so there's 38 of us with our 'special knowledge'. To keep some semblance of order on things, raise your hand if you'd like to speak.

"You may only speak if you're holding the conch. I mean Scabbers," he said.

"I'll be the chairman for now. Draco, would you please act as our Sergeant at Arms?"

Mr. Malfoy's expression went from confused to profoundly anxious.

"Uh, what's that?" he asked, his piping voice failing to carry.

Crabbe, towering nearly half a foot over Malfoy, turned to answer: "basic parliamentary procedure. There's too many of us to talk all at once or it'd be chaos. Only people holding Petti... I mean the rat... get to talk. If anyone talks out of turn, you get to hex 'em. Preferably something that shuts them up good."

Pomona couldn't believe what she was hearing. By all accounts, the Crabbe family spawned an endless series of barely-literate thugs who'd be lucky to pass even one or two OWLS, and here the latest Crabbe boy was lecturing a Malfoy on principles of government!

"Okay, so first order of business is obviously the Horcruxes," Kevin declared. His statement was meaningless to Pomona, but based on the many grim nods around the room, it looked like most of these 'self-inserts' agreed.

Susan Bones objected. She opened her mouth and started a rant, but one of the little Lions merely turned to Mr. Malfoy, jerked his head towards Susan and gave him a predatory grin.

Draco seemed to finally shake himself out of his bewildered state. He drew his wand, a smile spreading across his face.

"Petrificus Totalus!"

"Serpensortia!"

His first hex collided squarely with Miss Bones's chest. As the girl started toppling backwards, a three-foot long brown adder emerged from Draco's wand.

"Goddammit, Draco!" one of the Ravenclaws exclaimed. "Quick, Harry, tell the snake to stop moving!"

Heads swiveled towards Mr. Potter.

"Uh... what?" he was even more confused than Pomona was, and clearly very uncomfortable with the sudden attention.

A Gryffindor girl that Pomona thought was named Lavender something turned to Harry and answered him, "Harry, you can talk to snakes, like at the zoo! Tell the snake to stop!"

Harry's mouth opened, a question on his lips.

"No time, Harry, the snake might bite someone!"

Mr. Entwhistle turned his attention on little Harry.

"Harry," his voice again carrying the calm authority of a person decades older, "we'll answer your questions later, but for now, please tell the snake to stop."

Severus interrupted the children's bickering by smoothly drawing his wand and dispelling the snake. Mr. Entwhistle merely nodded at the man in thanks.

Pomona had no idea what was going on, but the way these firsties were conducting themselves promised one thing: the next seven years would be something to remember.

Filius was fascinated.

Sure, he cultivated an appearance of excitable affability to put students at ease, but he wasn't the head of Ravenclaw for nothing. He was, first and last, an academic. Even his achievements on the dueling circuit were merely an extension of his studies into mobility charms.

He watched as a few dozen 11 year old students organized themselves, following something called "Robert's Rules of Order." They formed committees and even sub-committees. They bickered back and forth in a manner that was reminiscent of nothing so much as a contentious faculty meeting.

He caught snippets of conversations that seemed to make reference to other lives. If he could believe what he was hearing, many of these students claimed to be decades older, with a disproportionate number of them making references to places that were in the U.S.

Even that phrase - "self-insert" - was so very tantalizing. Self? Which self? A soul? A mind? And inserted into what? Into these 11 year old bodies? The implications for the original inhabitants was worrying in the extreme.

The discussions drew to close after no more than a half-hour. Mr. Entwhistle gathered together a bunch of muggle papers with the notes taken by each group of students. After running through them for a few minutes, he cleared his throat and looked like he was going to start speaking.

One of his Ravenclaws - a Mr. Goldstein - interrupted him. "Okay, I've had enough. Who the hell put you in charge, Entwhistle? Who are you that you get to speak for all of us?"

Mr. Entwhistle turned a withering gaze on the little Eagle. "I'm in charge because I am. I'm in charge because I was a successful VP-level executive at Unilever before all... all this happened.

"I'm in charge because I was the mother of five rambunctious children, each of whom could put the twins to shame. I'm in charge because I will stop at absolutely nothing to get my family back.

"I'm in charge because I. SAID. SO. NOW DOES ANYONE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT!?"

His voice cracked slightly at the end, but the effect was diminished not at all. Forty-three very intimidated pairs of eyes looked away, none daring to challenge Mister... Missus? Entwhistle's claim to leadership.

"Very well. Albus, let us begin. First, for the name and location of the horcrux located here in Hogwarts, we demand that you bring Horace Slughorn back as potions master..."

Filius couldn't help himself. He quickly pulled out a sheet of parchment and charmed a quill to take notes. He was one of the most accomplished charms masters in the world and yet he'd never even heard of a "horcrux." It was clearly a word to conjure with, a thing of dire power, given the expression on Albus's and Severus's faces each time Mr. Entwhistle made reference to them.

This was a gift. A gift that beggared all belief. A gift beyond imagining.

Albus watched as this entity wearing a boy's skin made demands of him. Demands that were somehow reasonable, somehow good. They asked for nothing for themselves, showing no greed. They asked for things that would improve the quality of Hogwart's education. Above all else, they asked for things that would help Harry.

The smallest flex of his authority had his heads of house remaining silent, holding their peace for now. Albus needed to focus all of his attention on this impossible phenomenon. This gift.

The universe was handing him the means to remedy the third and final of his great mistakes. He would join Ariana and Gellert some day, but he could not rest until Riddle was permanently defeated. Plans and contingencies were in place. Manipulations proceeded, some delicate, some blunt. Yet everything hung on a thread.

And here were 38 eleven year olds, stomping into his life, ripping the thread in half, and showing him that the abyss over which he hung was little more than a mummer's trick of black cloth and low lighting.

They made demands about Cuthbert, Horace, and Severus. They referenced Sirius Black and Harry's muggle relatives. One particularly loud group demanded that all students, including first years, be allowed to try out for Quidditch.

It was that last demand that sealed it for Albus. The sheer surreality of the scene could only be real. Only reality would so casually mix the mundane with the transcendent.

They made their demands, and Albus haggled simply to keep up appearances.

A mere two hours after the Sorting Ceremony of 1991, the negotiations wrapped up, and Albus broke into his first untroubled smile in nearly a century. He stood from his chair, clapped his hands once, and ushered in the future.
