Here was my response then:

--------------

Every entering class at Hogwarts was expected to show a heavy dose of anxiety - a mixture of homesickness, excitement about learning magic, and the fear and anticipation of making new friends.

But this group... there was something wrong with this group, McGonagall thought. They almost all showed a nervous, silent reserve that one normally associated with adults in uncomfortable social situations rather than keyed-up children. When the ghosts appeared in the hall, there were no exclamations of surprise or fear. None. That had never happened once in all her years at Hogwarts. Even the Muggleborns stared placidly at the ghosts, with only the Granger girl and young Harry showing any surprise at all.

As she lead the group into the main hall, she saw lots of gaping mouths and wide eyes, reassuring her somewhat. Okay, so this was a weirdly reserved group of 11 year olds, but they could still show surprise and delight upon entering Hogwarts for the first time.

She caught a number of students with their gazes fixed fiercely on the staff table. Following the line of vision, it looked like nearly a quarter of the group was staring at Professor Quirrel with predatory focus. Another quarter seemed transfixed by Severus with the remainder glancing around, constantly stealing looks at Harry and the Weasley boy.

She gave her head a little shake and told herself to stop wool-gathering. There was a sorting to get through.

--------------

Hermione Granger was happier than she'd ever been in her short life. From the moment she set foot on the Hogwarts express, she was absolutely mobbed by students all eager to be her friend. These two Muggleborn boys, Justin something and Kevin Entwhistle, had found her on Platform 9 3/4 and stuck to her like glue all day.

First they helped her get her luggage settled and then kept peppering her with questions about her life, her family, her magic, her... well, everything! They laughed at her jokes and were incredibly impressed with the magic she was able to do on the train.

They were trying out some charms on the train and Justin was pronouncing the incantation wrong. She very well knew she tended to be incredibly bossy but she just couldn't help herself - she sharply corrected him.

A moment of silence filled the air. Hermione was sure she'd gone and screwed everything up, and they hadn't even arrived at the school! Then Kevin burst out laughing so hard he could barely speak, coughing out "IT'S LEVI-OH-SAH!" at the top of his lungs.

A jolt went through Justin. He dropped his wand and stared, open-mouthed at Kevin. Kevin finally caught his breath and saw Justin staring, having gone pale as a sheet. His lips moved silently.

"What was that?" Kevin asked, still recovering from his freakish laughing fit.

Justin whispered, "No Ron, it's not levi-oh-sah it's levi-oh-sah."

And then Kevin dropped his wand. What the hell?!? It was the weirdest thing she'd seen since entering this strange, magical world.

"Oh my god," Kevin all but whispered back. "You too?"

Justin gave a little nod and recited something in this weird chopped cadence, something that sounded like a rehearsed litany: "Diadem Diary, Cup and Ring, Locket, Snake, Harry."

Kevin hissed his response. Something urgent, the way he was leaning into Justin, but it was too quiet for Hermione to make out.

Not a moment later, the door to their compartment banged open, a pair of girls standing there.

"Oh my god, are you Hermione Granger!?" the Indian one all but screamed. And then she had four friends.

Despite the weirdness, Hermione was SO looking forward to the next seven years.

Any idiot could tell that there was something profoundly wrong with this group of children. Without even his astute mind or mastery of the mind art, Severus mused. He'd indulged himself with skimming along the surface of the Potter brat's mind and found nothing amiss. The barest glance inside the minds of the students on either side of him - a Weasley and some buck-toothed girl that was obviously Muggle-born - also showed the typical childish eagerness and anxiety.

It was a puzzle that only temporarily distracted Severus from his usual mental pastimes - designing new potions in his head and wallowing in a chest-deep pool of regret.

His mind was well on its way to sussing out an improvement to the wit-sharpening potion that would reduce addictiveness by 10% of more when a little first-year student at the Slytherin table suddenly stood up on his bench and proceeded to kick aside food and stand on the table.

What the hell did the Crabbe boy think he was doing?! Severus started to rise from his seat when the boy's voice belted out across the great hall:

"Okay, how many of you are self-inserts?!"

The absurdity of his question was met by a momentary silence. A beat later it was broken by a voice at the Hufflepuff table, "holy shit."

Two Hufflepuff boys looked at each other and immediately stood up. One raised his hand and then clambered up onto the table, "Quick show of hands to answer Crabbe's question!" his tone of voice held that slow, easy cadence of someone used to being obeyed.

Severus was now fully standing and was about to interrupt this farce when hands started going up all over the hall.

The entire first year class.

All of them.

Wait, no. Severus noted several confused students at the Gryffindor table. Potter, the Longbottom heir, and Potter's two friends all looked completely confused. A moment's glance around the hall showed only Malfoy similarly bewildered.

Severus opened his mouth, drawing in a breath in order to intervene. Before he could, the Hufflepuff boy continued speaking.

"Alright folks, keep your mouths shut. No running off to the Chamber of Secrets or the Room of Requirement until we've got a chance to talk things over," the boy seemed to pause for the barest moment before suddenly exlaiming, "Oh shit, who's got Scabbers?!"

The improbable question was answered by a boy at the Gryffindor table standing up, holding a... rat? "Ron sold me Scabbers. I'm gonna keep him very safe and very well fed, okay guys?!" the rat-wielder glanced around the room, giving all the "self-insert" students a look whose meaning was lost on Severus.

"Mr. Entwhistle," Albus spoke, the old man finally intervening. "I think it would be best if..."

The little Hufflepuff git interrupted the Headmaster: "Albus, you need to clear the room right now of everyone except the first-years and Severus. Maybe Minerva."

How dare he?! "That's fifty points from Hufflepuff, and how dare you interrupt the -"

"Take your fucking points and shove them up your ass, Snivellus. This concerns a certain Riddle that the Headmaster is trying to solve and us first-years are going to help him."

That proclamation was met with an uproar of shouts, laughs, and... were some of the self-insert students complaining or objecting? What the hell is going on here?

The Headmaster had eyes locked on the Hufflepuff boy. He'd gone completely still.

Levering himself up, the Headmaster coughed lightly to clear his throat. "It seems that Hogwarts is host to some remarkable happenings this year. Prefects, please lead all students back to their dorms, except first years. All first years please remain seated. Heads of House, please remain as well. The staff is likewise dismissed."

Entwhistle turned and immediately spoke into the silence that followed Dumbledore's proclamation. "Someone get the map from the twins."
