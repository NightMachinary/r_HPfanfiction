Woah...

Can't think of any at all.

The only one that I've read, and comes close, is the Blue Eyed Doe. That features Lavender after the film DH2.

That's pretty niche fic you want to find, I'll actually be checking this thread if anyone finds one that fits your description.

Although, as I'm writing this, there is one that technically fits your description:

The Prince of the Dark Kingdom, Harry does develop a somewhat romantic (as far as he's able, considering all the shit that's happening to him) relationship with a female werewolf.
