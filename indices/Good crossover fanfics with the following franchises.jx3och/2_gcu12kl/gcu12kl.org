Hmm, only 'decent' Avatar crossover I can think of is the Ninja Wizard series, linkao3(10824855), though it doesn't start the Avatar crossover until like the 3rd story, I think.

Also, this isn't an HP story, but I just read an Avatar x Star Gate crossover that I thought was really well done. Linkffn(7679074).
