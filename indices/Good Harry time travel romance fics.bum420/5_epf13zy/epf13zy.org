I like this one: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699][The Love of a Good Wizard by SweetSorcery]] (Harry/Tom)

And this one isn't bad: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120][Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil]] (Harry/Sirius)

This one is lovely (Draco goes back in time, but it's a Harry/Draco fic) but be warned it's very sad: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/393118][The Eighth Tale by lettered]]\\
This one is pretty much a romantic comedy: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080][Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up) by MayMarlow]] (Harry/Tom)

​

I have these ones saved, so even though I don't remember them 100% I must have thought them worth reading: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/463038][In Time, Once Again by avioleta]] (Harry/Severus)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox by Meri]] (Harry/Severus)

​

These two are less traditional time travel fics: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/621717][Waiting to Divide by emynn]] (Harry/Severus)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2039154][At the Crossroads There We'll Meet by firethesound]] (Harry/Draco - Potter keeps dying; Draco keeps saving him.)

​

And I'm going to suggest this one just for giggles (well-written, but contains incest). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/434586][Memories in Future Tense by Eriador117]] (Harry/Severus - Harry travelled back in time to get Severus to befriend the Marauders and Lily in hopes that it will prevent Voldemort's attack. It does, but it has other consequences... When he suddenly returns to his own time, he finds out that Severus is now his father.)
