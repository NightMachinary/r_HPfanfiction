Upvoted to offset. The slash-hate in this subreddit is getting to the point that, even as a long-time user of this sub, I've been thinking of leaving. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of places to go and [[/r/HPSlashFic]] isn't popular enough (and is too narrow in its recommendations) to replace it.
