Yes it is, but I'm less likely to spend fifteen minutes of my lunch break pulling out recs for someone next time. And maybe you're okay with that since our reading tastes don't seem to overlap much, but if I was someone else reading this thread I'd be less likely to do so as well. Ingratitude plus unsolicited and inconsistant dislike of people's taste (I note that the Harry/Bellatrix rec isn't getting any hate despite also fulfilling your 'disliked criterion') causes people to contribute less. And since I like this sub I think it's a shame.
