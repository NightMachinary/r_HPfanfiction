I'd be happy to pull out my recs for other slash pairings for you if you're genuinely interested. The part I'm objecting to is that there was no specification other than Harry, time travel and romance, which I provided. If I asked for recs and wasn't specific what I wanted and then got recommendations I didn't like I wouldn't be rude, I'd thank them politely and then clarify what I did want.

And downvoting someone because you don't like their recommendations when you didn't clarify what you wanted, is rude. Frankly, I think downvoting recommendations at all (unless they blatantly don't fit what was asked for) is rude.
