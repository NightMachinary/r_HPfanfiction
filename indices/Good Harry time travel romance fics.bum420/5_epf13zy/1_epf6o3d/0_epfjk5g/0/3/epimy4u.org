When most of the slash fics put Harry with Death Eathers/Tom/Draco/Snape, it's hard to read them, since those are all terrible, terrible pairing. Snape is in his 30s/40s, Tom is well into his 60s, everyone else is the same age is Snape, and Draco hates Harry. And then they throw in mpreg through rape most of the time. There's a reason people on slash. It's not usually well done, and it's fucking weird just to sate the author's need to make Harry the bottom through every single means available to them.
