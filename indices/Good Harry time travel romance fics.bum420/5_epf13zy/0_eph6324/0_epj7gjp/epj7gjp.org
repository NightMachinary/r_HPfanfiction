Well part of it is the theme was time travel and there aren't that many older characters that aren't married (or dead in the present time which presents its own complications) to pair Harry with.

Part of it is that if they start off hating each other there can be much more tension between them more easily which makes for good reading.

Part of it is personal preference - they're my recs and I like Harry/Severus for example (I don't read much Harry/Voldemort but they're over represented here because of the temptation for authors to write fix-it fic involving them and time travel).

But not all slash involves those pairings. I've read plenty of good fic that's Harry/Ron, Harry/Remus etc. And there's plenty of post-Hogwarts Harry/Draco which has Draco as a decent character - some of it even explains why which is to my preference.

Also the request was Harry time-travelling so I didn't include for example the lovely Percy/Oliver slash I've read or Remus/Sirius.

If you search by pairing in archive of our own I'm sure you'll find lots of slash to suit your preferences.
