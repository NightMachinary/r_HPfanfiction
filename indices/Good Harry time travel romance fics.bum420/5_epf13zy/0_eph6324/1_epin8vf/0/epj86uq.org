I'd say this is a mischaracterisation actually. Yes there are plenty of young people writing both slash and het and yes the quality of fan fiction can be variable, however I've read lots of very thoughtful fanfic involving pairings I'd never even thought of or fresh takes on old favourites. As I replied to nouseforausernam, part of the reason some of these pairings are popular is that if they start off hating each other there can be much more tension between them more easily which makes for good reading, and part of it was the request which was Harry, romance and time travel.

But not all slash involves those pairings. I've read plenty of good fic that's Harry/Ron, Harry/Remus etc. And there's plenty of post-Hogwarts Harry/Draco which has Draco as a decent character - some of it even explains why which is to my preference.

Also because it didn't fit the request I didn't include for example the lovely Percy/Oliver slash I've read or Remus/Sirius.

If you search by pairing in archive of our own I'm sure you'll find lots of slash that doesn't involve characters you don't like.
