Totally agree. It just pisses me off how one dimensional they make the two other main characters in the book. Ron hates anything dark, even the colour green and Hermione is the naive do gooder that has an obsession with following the rules and never doubts authority. I can see how they got there but its so one dimensional. Those are the mindsets of early teenagers, not people in their late teens.
