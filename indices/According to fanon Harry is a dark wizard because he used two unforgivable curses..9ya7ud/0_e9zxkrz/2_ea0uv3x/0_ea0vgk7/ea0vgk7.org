Hermione follows authority as long as she agrees with their decisions. As soon as authority gets into the way of what she thinks is right, she ignores any and all rules. Teacher sabotaging Harry's broom? Set him on fire. Illegal dragon growing? Smuggle it out of the school and out of the country by breaking both rules and the law. Voldemort breaking into the third floor? Sneak out after curfew, curse the one student who tries to stop you, and break into the vault yourself. Think Draco is a criminal? Steal ingredients to brew a potion, drug and kidnap his friends so you can impersonate them to interrogate Draco. Need more information? Trick a teacher into giving you access to the restricted section.

And that's just the first two years. Hermione's respect for authority is entirely fanon.
