I forget which fic I saw it in, now, but there's a characterisation of Hermione as a very well brought up, english-middle-class-affluent high-functioning sociopath, who just doesn't get, on an emotional level, that there's a difference between slipping a whoopee cushion under someone and setting their dog on fire. (Intellectually, she can tell the difference, but to her the emotional content of the two acts is the same). So she makes sure to know the Rules so she doesn't do something that scares the normals by accident.

That's why, in situations where the Rules no longer apply, she doesn't bat an eyelid at outright criminality.
