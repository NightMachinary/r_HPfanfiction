Hermione makes me think of The Doctor from the episode "A Good Man Goes to War."

Madame Kovarian: The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have too many rules.\\
The Doctor: Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many.

Hermione is all about following the rules, submitting herself to authority. She is a good and proper person because she was raised to be a good and proper person.
