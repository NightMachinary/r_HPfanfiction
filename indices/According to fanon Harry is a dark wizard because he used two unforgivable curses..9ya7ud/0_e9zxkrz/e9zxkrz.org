Well, Hermione has no issues with morally questionable (eg Umbridge, polyjuice, Marietta). She would not be neutral to a casual use of them, but she has a "the ends justify the means" attitude, even in canon.

And Ron is probably the same. He would not be comfortable with the casual use of such spells, but would/did not object in a do-or-die situation.
